She does not pause in her performance, nor play a single wrong note.<br> Without rising to greet her visitor, the woman remains dutifully at her task.<br> ...A slight dizziness comes over me.<br> Is it because of the high ceiling? The music of the organ reverberates throughout the chapel, filling the space with sound.</p><p>&quot;----------------&quot;<br> I was about to walk up to the organ, but then had a sudden change of heart.<br> I sit down in the very back of the rows of pews.<br> It will be over soon anyway.<br> It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s one of those performances that lasts for hours. I can just wait for it to end.</p><p>The tedium of the piece dulls my ability to think.<br> It&#39;s so peaceful it&#39;s making me sleepy. As I sit there dozing off, I surrender myself to the music worked by the woman&#39;s fingers.</p><p>It&#39;s just an ordinary hymn, nothing noteworthy about it. There&#39;s nothing special about her finger work, nor is her performance imbued with any emotion.<br> She simply plays.<br> It&#39;s as if she&#39;s performing a daily chore.</p><p>This performance, it&#39;s--------as though she&#39;s praying.</p><p>&quot;........................&quot;<br> So this is what those who come to worship are so touched by.<br> The house of God, built by the hands of men,<br> and a song of glory in His name, written by a pen held in a human hand.<br> The men of centuries past must have endeavored to express something sacred by way of performances like this.<br> In order to believe, and to make others believe as well, they gathered to create these spaces, so far removed from those familiar in daily life.</p><p>The cornerstone of a shared illusion.<br> The crystallization of prayer, for tranquility and forgiveness of daily trespasses.</p><p>From that point of view, this place could be called an appropriate boundary for the eyes of God to rest upon.<br> Even nonbelievers should be able to feel a divine presence in here.</p><p>However...<br> I&#39;m afraid I feel nothing holy in this place.</p><p>The image it brings to mind is that of a ruin, nothing more.<br> What can I compare it to but a wasteland, devoid of human life?</p><p>&quot;...Aah, I&#39;m gonna throw up.&quot;</p><p>I prop my head up with both hands and remain seated, waiting in a daze for the hymn to end.<br> ...God and ruins, huh?<br> Well, whichever it may be, both of them are hollow.</p><p>The performance that grated on my ears is over.<br> The woman rises from the bench, and the pipe organ disappears from the chapel.<br> ...That&#39;s right. This church never had such an exquisite organ in it in the first place.<br> It&#39;s probably something she had brought here.<br> A woman with the ability to bring something that huge and make it disappear is right up there with Caster in terms of mysteriousness.</p><p>Not at all surprised by my presence, she walks briskly towards the pew where I sit.<br> I thought she hadn&#39;t noticed me, but it looks like she knew all along that I was here.</p><p>&quot;Welcome, Emiya Shirou. Although our house of worship is quite dilapidated, I will do my utmost to make you feel at home.<br> If memory serves me correctly... Ah, that&#39;s right, If you&#39;re thirsty, shall I prepare refreshments?&quot;<br> &quot;No thanks. I didn&#39;t come here to have tea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Is that so? I know of no other way to welcome you, so if there is something you require, please tell me of it.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s acting almost as if her feelings have been hurt.<br> ...This girl. She said she was welcoming me, but, is this her first time greeting a visitor?</p><p>&quot;Then allow me to introduce myself. I already know that you are the Master of Saber, so there is no need for further introductions from you.<br> What about you? Do you wish to hear my name?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s fine. I already know that much.<br> I&#39;ll leave as soon as I&#39;ve heard what I need, so there&#39;s no use for introductions.&quot;</p><p>I answer her concisely.<br> Perhaps she is surprised by something, as our conversation suddenly stops.</p><p>&quot;...Hey, is it okay if I speak?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. If you have questions, please just go ahead and ask.<br> I have no questions for you.<br> ...No, I do have one now, but it&#39;s not that important.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that so. Then let&#39;s get this over with. Too many things I&#39;ve been wondering for so long.&quot;</p><p>There are three things I intend to ask. I start with the first.</p><p>&quot;So, my first question.<br> You said your name is Caren. Who are you?<br> Where did you come from, and why are are you in Fuyuki?<br> And don&#39;t try to claim that you&#39;re just here to take in the sights.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am the successor of this church. Ordinarily, such a job would not have been entrusted to someone of my level, but in light of the current circumstances, I was temporarily appointed as its caretaker..<br> I suppose a magus like you would call me an agent of your enemy, the Church.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By agent, you mean a part of the Church&#39;s army? A hitman who passes arbitrary judgement on heretics and magi, and eliminates them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I am more like an executor in the legal sense. I do not possess the abilities of a true Executor.<br> It seems this church&#39;s previous caretaker was one, and of some repute at that. However, I myself have neither the authority nor the ability to pass judgement on heretics.<br> I am merely an apprentice acting on the orders of the Church, here to observe this city.&quot;</p><p>&quot;An apprentice, huh? Is the Church so low on manpower that they&#39;d leave someone like that in charge?<br> ...Well, I guess it does depend on the mission, but if yours is just to look around, even a dog would be able to--------!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The right person in the right place, as they say. I am indeed just an ordinary nun, but I was sent here because I am the most qualified for the job.<br> The assignment the church gave me is to investigate the reappearance of the Holy Grail.<br> To investigate firsthand whether or not the Holy Grail that was destroyed in the fifth Holy Grail War is present. Not everyone can accomplish this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;-------Okay. So, you&#39;re an apprentice, but you&#39;re a promising apprentice, right?<br> ...I understand now, so could you let go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your tone is rather irritating, but getting rid of your doubts over this issue is a good thing... Very well, you shall be forgiven.&quot;</p><p>She quickly lowers her hands and takes a step back.<br> That really came out of the blue.<br> That woman, with nary an expression on her face, just walked right up to me and used both hands to squeeze my face.</p><p>Had I continued to make fun of her in that position, I daresay she might have headbutted me.</p><p>&quot;Observing the Holy Grail... Well, I guess those are Church matters, so I won&#39;t ask about that.<br> The point is that you&#39;ve been dispatched here. That means there is solid evidence of the Grail&#39;s reappearance, right?<br> ...So, did you find it? The Grail, that is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can confirm something that appears to be a Grail in function, although I am not able to secure it.<br> My task is only to investigate. I&#39;d be crossing the boundary of my assignment if I delve any deeper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm... So you don&#39;t intend to steal the Grail and take it with you.<br> Huh? Wait, if it&#39;s only to confirm its existence, hasn&#39;t your purpose already been met?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have fulfilled the mission that I was sent here for.<br> But technically, I was assigned here to act as an agent of this church.<br> If there is something wrong with Fuyuki, it must be resolved.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You&#39;re contradicting yourself.<br> You have no intention of taking the Grail, but you want to resolve the incident it caused?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to the extent that you do.<br> For the record, I ended up taking on two roles at the same time.<br> That is, investigating the Holy Grail, and acting as the priest in this city.<br> For as long as I am entrusted with both, I have no choice but to fulfil them at the same time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re just doing your job, huh? And then you found me.<br> Great, I do appreciate a business-like approach. Far better than some cheap sense of justice.<br> ...So, where&#39;s the Holy Grail? You already know, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel the presence of evil in those words. I shall not divulge it to you.&quot;</p><p>She turns away from me.<br> Looks like she isn&#39;t impressed.</p><p>&quot;...Well, whatever.<br> Second question then.<br> What&#39;s with those monsters? The Grail&#39;s reappearance and the abnormalities in the city gotta have something to do with them, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That I can not tell you, for I have made a promise.<br> Furthermore, if I did tell you, it would damage your pride.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...............&quot;<br> Well, I really don&#39;t value my pride that much.<br> Besides, my pride would already be hurt the moment I asked the question. In other words, I&#39;m prepared to cheat if that&#39;s what it takes to get full marks.</p><p>&quot;...It appears you are not pleased. Will you use force to obtain the answer?&quot;<br> &quot;I told you already, you don&#39;t interest me at all. &quot;Force&quot; makes it sound like, well...&quot;</p><p>Like I want to violate her out of anger and hatred.</p><p>&quot;Nevermind, I won&#39;t push it.<br> But what in the world are those things? Didn&#39;t one of those monsters come out from your body?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know about it, but it must have happened at least once.<br> ...Come to think of it, something&#39;s up with her.<br> She&#39;s not scared of the monsters, she gets hurts for no apparent reason, and she even makes monsters appear.<br> Maybe she&#39;s more like a stage magician than a magus?</p><p>&quot;You are mistaken.<br> Emiya Shirou. Have you ever heard of the term &quot;demonic possession&quot;?&quot;<br> &quot;Demonic possession...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve heard of it.<br> It&#39;s a kind of spiritual damage that&#39;s well-known in the western world. The Japanese equivalent would be something like being possessed by a fox or dog spirit.<br> A non-human &quot;something&quot; invades a human and starts and starts destroying them from the inside, similar to a curse.</p><p>The symptoms are too numerous to describe, but in the western world, they are all caused by the concept of &quot;demons.&quot;<br> For reasons unknown to humankind, demons tend to possess people who are considered virtuous.<br> Compared to the Japanese concept of possession which is based on the will of the &quot;curse-caster&quot;, the western one has no will at all. It&#39;s a phenomenon that occurs similar to a traffic accident.</p><p>Those who are possessed are often ordinary virtuous men.<br> Their minds are eroded by the demons who enter them, they disparage morality and the teachings of God, and they terrorize those around them.<br> Not by direct violence, but by showing them what raw, ugly creatures humans become just by being stripped of reason.</p><p>Those are only the initial symptoms, however.<br> Those who have been afflicted for a while won&#39;t be corrupted on the mental level alone.</p><p>A severe case of &quot;possession&quot; causes a change even in outward appearance.<br> ...The formless &quot;thing&quot; that possessed the victim will try to project itself upon the human body.<br> The change begins from developing the level of body control that is unthinkable for a normal human being, and ends with mutation of body parts.<br> The changes depend on the class of the &quot;thing.&quot; The stronger the demon is, the further away from human the victim becomes,</p><p>...But fortunately, a demon cannot be resurrected in a human body.</p><p>A person who is possessed will be forced into an unnatural transformation and simply die as a result.</p><p>The western depicted demons all look rather weird.<br> Two heads, hooves, or limbs arranged into the shape of a hexagram. Definitely not something a human with only one set of arms and legs could imitate.</p><p>&quot;..................&quot;</p><p>However...<br> They say there are some rare cases of humans who can resist the transformation.<br> It&#39;s similar to how magi that crave knowledge can become vampires.<br> There are apparently heretics who extend their lifespan by making use of the &quot;thing&quot; that continues to devour the blueprint known as their soul.</p><p>Then, this woman...</p><p>&quot;...That, too, is a misunderstanding. While it is irrelevant to the matter at hand, I used to serve as an exorcist&#39;s assistant.<br> I was never possessed, and I do not believe I ever will be.<br> A demon requires a healthy body. They cannot take root in mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;? Then why did you bring it up in the first place?<br> ...I could certainly see your body acting like that if it was possessed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Porca miseria.&quot;<br> &quot;Uh. Did you just say something really mean?&quot;<br> &quot;I just said, &quot;What an impatient person.&quot;<br> ...We shall get to the real issue right after this. Just listen, please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Being possessed will produce many forms of supernatural symptoms.<br> Like knocking sounds that are associated with a poltergeist disturbing its surroundings, or interference with the host&#39;s body.<br> ...You could say it&#39;s a disease that only affects the host. It is a poison that does not spread to others like a virus would.&quot;<br> &quot;No kidding. If you could catch demons like a cold, I doubt there&#39;d be any normal humans left by now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s probably true.<br> However, just as there are people with a high degree of sensitivity towards the supernatural that can sense the presence of evil spirits, there are people that experience the same symptoms just by being near victims of possession.<br> -------Frankly speaking, I am referring to myself.<br> Whenever I get near something that is possessed by what is said to be an &quot;evil spirit,&quot; my own body will produce the exact same symptoms that the demon would have caused.<br> My master referred to it as masochistic pneumatic automatism diathesis.&quot;</p><p>No pause or hesitation.<br> Caren has just said something that might send me into a major depression if I think about it too hard.</p><p>&quot;...What? So, basically, you will turn into a demon if you get near one?&quot;<br> &quot;...Although that is an idiotic response, let us say it is correct.<br> To be exact, it is an automatic reproduction or spiritual damage of demonic origin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let us say you got infected with a cold.<br> Assume that it is still during the early stages before the symptoms show, so your body just feels a little heavy.<br> ...Now, if I get near you, the symptoms that will eventually be caused by that disease would appear in me.<br> The number of patients increased to two, so to say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...While it seems it did cause harm to you, it is not, fundamentally, a trait that is a problem to others.<br> Please, do not worry about it from now on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Even if you say so...<br> Well, I wasn&#39;t worried in the first place, but no surprise attacks, alright? I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that getting close to you will cause a lot of pain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. I am frequently under evil influence.<br> Yourself aside, Emiya Shirou, the presence of monsters will have an effect. If you find this prospect frightening, you shall do well by staying way from me whenever they are nearby.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t understand it, but this is one bit of advice I should probably follow.<br> Alright, unless things get serious, let&#39;s try not to get too close.<br> Randomly hurting each other is no good.</p><p>&quot;So, back then...&quot;<br> &quot;...Most likely, it was the type of symptom caused by those monsters.<br> While they rank low, it appears they do have a demonic connection.&quot;</p><p>In other words, if they aren&#39;t near, she won&#39;t go nuts either?<br> ...If so, would those monsters&#39; symptoms be, &quot;creation of the same monster&quot;?</p><p>&quot;We shall leave my traits aside for now. How about we continue with your questions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah-------Yeah, sure. Alright, the third and final question. I want to ask about the city&#39;s abnormality.<br> I don&#39;t know why, but the Holy Grail has come back.<br> And so the Holy Grail War has restarted around it... Or so we thought. The battle is vague and somehow odd.<br> Tohsaka said that this wasn&#39;t a restart, but rather a reproduction.<br> Let&#39;s assume---------Yeah, just for the time being...&quot;</p><p>&quot;For the time being, let&#39;s assume that there is a Master who wants the Holy Grail. What could they hope to accomplish by continuing an endless war?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To continue the fighting, of course.<br> To continue the fighting that ended with the conclusion of the fifth Holy Grail War, That is the single origin of all abnormality in this town.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saying that &quot;something is wrong&quot; is wrong in itself.<br> Everything in this town is wrong. Because of some person&#39;s wish, a false four-day period is being fabricated.&quot;</p><p>The woman of the church who has come to investigate says it&#39;s all because of someone&#39;s wish.<br> So the Grail has already been used after all.</p><p>&quot;So, is it all fake, then&quot;</p><p>For a brief moment, I feel as if I am about to die.<br> All fake.<br> The second those words leave my mouth, the despair alone almost kills me.<br> It&#39;s as if all the heat in the universe has instantly dissipated.</p><p>&quot;No, what&#39;s fake is only one person.<br> Even if the day-to-day life of these four days is impossible, it could also happen in reality as long as all the characters were present.<br> While the premise of a &quot;restarted war&quot; is a mistake, the events that occur within it are no illusion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These days are real.<br> Even if these four days end, your life will continue appropriately. Emiya Shirou will lose nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;----------------&quot;</p><p>Who is feeling relieved?<br> Pretty sure it isn&#39;t &quot;me&quot;.<br> But oh well.<br> There is no falsehood in her words. It&#39;s definitely true.<br> My ready-to-die self has sparked back to life again.</p><p>&quot;Is that so? That&#39;s great. If this will continue, all there is to do is to get rid of these four days.<br> ---------So.<br> You don&#39;t have any connection to the reproduced Holy Grail War, do you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I vow unto the Lord.<br> To return to the original topic, my aim and yours are the same.<br> The investigation of the Holy Grail, and Fuyuki&#39;s tranquility.<br> To complete these two tasks, I will cooperate with you.<br> Of course, cooperation only means providing you with some information.<br> I cannot bring change to this world. The only one who can solve the problem is you, who have participated in the fifth Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why...? Oh, yeah. I know you&#39;re not directly involved. I can accept that ending the war falls to those who have participated.<br> But why just me? If Tohsaka or Sakura or another Master wins---------&quot;</p><p>&quot;This battle is a reproduction of the fifth Holy Grail War. You were the victor of the war.<br> Based on that, the one to dominate the battlefield should still be you.<br> Only Emiya Shirou can end the fifth Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Listen well.<br> If you want to stop this &quot;reproduction,&quot; either the one who made the wish must willingly give up the Grail or, like before... you, who emerged victorious, must defeat that person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...This feels like a word game. You&#39;re saying that since this is a reproduction of the fifth Holy Grail War, it must also end the same way, with me winning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. This is a conflict between Holy Grails.<br> High-level magic is a battle between concepts. It is not a question of strength, but rather a test of which one possesses the most sound system of rules.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I do not possess sufficient magic to defeat the system known as the Holy Grail.<br> Being a mediator is the best I can do. Even if I wished to join, there are regulations that would stop me.&quot;</p><p>...Hmm.<br> Sounds like she&#39;s got her hands tied.</p><p>&quot;Got it. I&#39;ll at least thank you for the time being. I know what to do now.&quot;</p><p>I stand up.<br> I&#39;ve asked enough, and it&#39;s about time for me to go. I want to hurry back to the city.</p><p>&quot;Leaving already...? There must be something else you want to know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There sure is, but I doubt you would know. Like where the person who made the wish is, or how to get rid of the monsters.<br> I&#39;ll just look for them myself. I&#39;ll get the culprit to spill all the boring details once I find them. I don&#39;t have any business with you or the church anymore.&quot;</p><p>I wave and head out.<br> This church has always given me a headache.<br> I don&#39;t want to stay for too long. Frankly, I don&#39;t want to have anything to do with this woman either.</p><p>&quot;Wait. There is one question I&#39;d like to ask.<br> I&#39;ve answered all of yours, so please do answer one of mine.&quot;<br> &quot;Mmph.&quot;<br> How can I possibly refuse?</p><p>&quot;Alright, but make it quick.&quot;<br> ...Hey. Why isn&#39;t she talking?</p><p>&quot;Hey. You got a question, right? Spit it out.&quot;<br> &quot;......Really, you are so much ruder today than you were the last few times.&quot;<br> &quot;Huh?&quot;<br> My mind goes blank for a moment.<br> Was that her question...?</p><p>&quot;The last few times, meaning when?&quot;<br> &quot;The times we met that you know of.<br> When we happened across each other in the park and on the mountain, you were a little more gentlemanly.&quot;<br> It&#39;s not a question. She&#39;s only complaining.<br> ...Not only is there no way of reading her feelings, her thought process is also hard to handle.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m just grumpy today. It&#39;s the location that&#39;s the problem. If it were anywhere other than the church, I&#39;d be a little better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Is that so? I must remain here during the day.<br> A meeting during the night can only occur near the end of the four days. It seems like our connection is bound to remain like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Well, don&#39;t worry about it. Either way, I won&#39;t be coming back here.&quot;</p><p>This time I&#39;m really leaving the church.<br> ...Really. I always get halted like this when I&#39;m here.<br> The door closes.</p><p>&quot;-----&quot;<br> ...Ah, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to associate with her.<br> Who the hell asked her to pray for my safety?</p><p>I mean, look.<br> If she does that, it makes it seem like I&#39;m out of luck or something.</p><hr><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-2-dream-of-distant-utopia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-2-dream-of-distant-utopia" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 2 Dream of distant utopia</h3><hr><p>I see Caster.</p><p>...Come to think of it, it&#39;s not unusual to find her meditating here...

So long as I&#39;m careful a conversation should be alright.</p><p>It&#39;s akin to jumping into a lion&#39;s den out of curiosity, but this time the witch seems sated.</p><p>Surely she&#39;d overlook an unpleasant question or two to kill some time.</p><hr><p>\u201CBack again so soon? I don&#39;t know what you intend upon, but you sure have guts.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you know how dangerous it is to approach me when I&#39;m alone.\u201D</p><hr><p>Just as she says herself, being near Caster when there is no one else around is most risky.</p><p>The real hazard is not the fact that she can use magic without the concern of prying eyes, but the fact that she cannot control her emotions whilst not under the scrutiny of others.</p><hr><p>Once Caster snaps, there&#39;s no way to stop her.</p><p>She may act like a calm witch if an outsider were present, but when left alone, her feelings run wild.</p><p>...Well...</p><p>People do call that emotionally unstable or delusional.</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, there&#39;s just something I&#39;ve been curious about.</p><p>You looked like you were in a good mood, so I thought I would take the chance to ask you.\u201D</p><p>The atmosphere grows ever so slightly heavier.</p><p>I would say she&#39;s already figured out what it might be about.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhatever could that be. I don&#39;t suppose it would be anything pleasant.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s just a question. I fear overstaying my welcome so I&#39;ll just get to the point. I know you have no intention of doing anything about the current situation. I&#39;ve got nothing to say about that.</p><p>But there&#39;s just one thing I&#39;d like to know.</p><p>For someone as skilled a sorceress as you, figuring out something like these four days should be a cinch. So my real point is\u2015\u2015\u2015shouldn&#39;t you know the <em>truth</em> behind what&#39;s happening already?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow very interesting.</p><p>I should know all of the workings behind this, you say?\u201D</p><p>A broad grin spreads across her face</p><p>It&#39;s the polar opposite of her smile from before, a smile that carries an unmistakable omen of death.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Fufu. Unfortunately, you&#39;re way off, boy.</p><p>It is true that, at first, I had tried all possible means and seemingly almost grasped the root of it. But my current self is still one step away from that.</p><p>The play ends when all is known, doesn&#39;t it? That is why I ceased the search and just let it be.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Hmmm, so you stopped there.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that the same thing? It means that you pretty much know already, doesn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. But I have not told anyone yet.</p><p>Because if the culprit is found then the whole affair would end. And since the culprit can&#39;t do anything, we have no obligation to forcefully capture them, either.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. There are no victims, so you&#39;re just spectating... You&#39;re quite the passive character, aren&#39;t you?</p><p>Then, will you stay a spectator from now on as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I believe I have already told you that I have no intention of getting involved.</p><p>But when the end comes, indeed, that may not stay true for long.</p><p>If it were to end, then I won&#39;t be silent... Rather, it&#39;s not me, but my Master who won&#39;t.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s the same thing in the end,&quot; sighs Caster.</p><p>She may be known as a treacherous witch, but her obedience to her Master, Kuzuki Souichirou, is absolute and unwavering.</p><hr><p>...Well, in other words she&#39;s fallen deeply for him.</p><p>She seems to think she&#39;s not been found out yet, but it&#39;s a well known fact to everyone aside from Kuzuki and Caster.</p><p>The moment Kuzuki Souichirou says &quot;assist me&quot; to Caster, she would obey regardless of what it was.</p><hr><p>\u201C............</p><p>You said you wanted it to continue like this, but should Kuzuki-sensei tell you to settle it, you would still help?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. I won&#39;t interfere with the culprit, but I won&#39;t cooperate either.</p><p>No, I can&#39;t do that. Whether it ends or does not, there&#39;s nothing for me to do about it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDo you get it? That&#39;s why you&#39;re an eyesore. If you want to continue, then you should let it continue until you grow tired, yet you yourself are trying to interfere.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Seriously. How many times have I thought of killing you...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Gah. Just for the record, was that a joke?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my. You ought to know whether I am capable of making jokes already, don&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>My back freezes twice over.</p><p>I knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea to stay here for long.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmm. I do understand that you&#39;re nothing but a bystander. I just want to end this talk here, but... say, why didn&#39;t you kill me? Just once would have been fine.\u201D</p><p>Well, no, not really.</p><p>Since it&#39;s Caster we&#39;re talking about, you&#39;d think she&#39;d lose it and skewer me at least once already.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo reason in particular.</p><p>And my Master never wished that to happen, after all.\u201D</p><p>She declares flatly.</p><p>I smile at her graciousness.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. I guess so.</p><p>...One last thing I&#39;d like to ask.</p><p>Suppose that Kuzuki Souichirou notices this abnormality, what do you think he&#39;d do? Will he try to solve it, or will he leave it as it is?</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Say. What <em>really</em> happened to the two of you?\u201D</p><hr><p>For an instant, the air is completely frozen.</p><p>I could have died four times within three seconds.</p><p>Caster, restraining the magical energy that could kill me with just a glance,</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I will solve it.</p><p>Souichirou&#39;s conscience is different from yours, boy, but he&#39;s still someone who will correct what he feels is wrong.\u201D</p><p>Her answer has a shadow of sadness in it.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. So your Master is like me.\u201D</p><p>I say that to myself in reverence, as I let out the melancholy that had built up in my chest.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is wrong. It is you who is like Souichirou.\u201D</p><p>Her reply echoes with pride.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, then we&#39;ll leave it at that.</p><p>Sorry for bringing up something so trivial. Please feel free to just stay here and be as indifferent as you want.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t have to tell me that.</p><p>...But, oh well. To show respect for all the hard work you&#39;re doing alone, I&#39;ll see you off when everything is about to end.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m dumbfounded.</p><p>Her words leave me speechless.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that face? Do you not understand what I&#39;m saying? When the final moment comes, I&#39;ll...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI got it. You mean you&#39;ll give me a hand.</p><p>......I will no doubt be relying on you.</p><p>Frankly, having your assistance will, perhaps, become my best encouragement.\u201D</p><hr><p>I leave Caster&#39;s garden.</p><p>She fixes her robe and sees me off.</p><p>What an unpleasant subject.</p><p>Even though she was in such a good mood,</p><p>there was just one moment where she looked like her past ominous self.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015What <em>really</em> happened to the two of you?&quot;*</p><hr><p>The boy who said that is already leaving.</p><p>The witch conceals her body with a black robe and, rather than disappearing, stands completely still.</p><hr><p>Someone who is like someone.</p><p>Someone who is alike to someone.</p><p>&quot;I see.

Just perfect this one action, said \uFF0A\uFF0A.</p><p>That&#39;s the same as being a tool.</p><p>They consented to the fact they were tools being used by total strangers, and further polished their &quot;function.&quot;</p><hr><p>To put it another way.</p><p>Those unable to come to terms were grief-stricken, became unable to keep up with with their daily work, and disappeared even from the memories of the tools.</p><hr><p>It was shortly after that when he guessed his own &quot;function.&quot;</p><p>Extra knowledge was driven into them for when the time comes.</p><p>Daily necessities they may be, yet they have to become pseudo-humans to manifest their function.</p><p>The knowledge necessary to function as a human.</p><p>While considered an excess, it was rare for them to be &quot;used&quot; once that knowledge was lost.</p><p>Although it would seem the \uFF0A\uFF0A were against including extra functions, it was something unavoidable.</p><p>To him and to the \uFF0A\uFF0A, it was no doubt an agonizing decision.</p><hr><p>Knowledge that hadn&#39;t been taught until now.</p><p>Things that are common knowledge for a humans, things that would make you inconsistent if learned.

Something that should have been dead trembled as if to stir.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you doing there?\u201D</p><p>The woman collapsed without responding to his call.</p><p>Forest in the night. Rain. A weakened body. Clearly not a decent person.</p><p>Trivial matters like a cloak covered in blood.</p><p>This woman is dangerous.</p><p>He tried to stay out of it, but even to him, she was out of place. There was no way he couldn&#39;t pick up the same scent.</p><hr><p>But still, he looked after the woman.</p><p>It was not out of sympathy for someone similar, a fellow murderer that he saved.</p><p>He helped because a person had collapsed before him.</p><p>The reason why he saved her was simply that.</p><hr><p>The woman awoke in about an hour.</p><p>\u201CSo you&#39;ve woken up. Can you tell me about your situation?\u201D</p><p>The woman stared at him, dazed.</p><p>There was neither bewilderment nor delight.</p><p>She looked as if her despair of being alive had turned to tears and were about to spill forth.</p><hr><p>\u201CIf what I did was an inconvenience, then you can leave. If you tell me to forget about it, then I will.\u201D</p><p>How did the woman take his words?</p><p>Did she think she could use him, or did she let her guard down at his kindness?</p><p>The woman divulged her background, and he all too quickly accepted her rather peculiar identity.</p><p>He embraced the woman, and also acknowledged participation in the killings known as The Heaven&#39;s Feel.</p><p>Of course the witch was probably surprised too.</p><p>The woman&#39;s condition was, although slightly, improving.</p><p>Because while she gloated that she could have, the moment she were rejected, used magic to control his heart\u2015\u2015\u2015her vile schemes were undone with just a single statement.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not that he consented to her out of fear, or that he was interested in the Holy Grail.</p><p>He cooperated with the woman because he wanted to be saved.</p><p>He was a man who saw no evil in murder to begin with. He had no reluctance to becoming a Master.</p><p>However\u2015\u2015\u2015the truth is that he cooperated to distance himself from the past.</p><p>...If you assume there was a moment of disconnection then this would be it.</p><p>He did not realize why he had abandoned the life he had worked for until now and taken up the woman&#39;s cause.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo your utmost to keep our lives this way. Tell me when you need me.\u201D</p><p>This was his policy.</p><p>He has no desires. It was just that the woman he saved wants the something called the Holy Grail.</p><p>If he fights, then it is not for the Holy Grail, but for the woman.</p><p>Since he promised to aid and cooperate, lending his strength to the woman is a natural obligation.</p><p>To him, the Heaven&#39;s Feel was an abnormality, but it was not a wrongdoing.</p><p>Because to him, &quot;evil&quot; is defined as something that negates his established &quot;function.&quot;</p><hr><p>And so he became the Master of Caster.</p><p>He was a Master without Command Spells, but she obeyed his words.</p><p>He knew nothing like magic to begin with. She only used him to stay in this world, and planned to treat him as a puppet.</p><p>And he himself did not participate in the Heaven&#39;s Feel. Rather, he left the fighting to the woman.</p><p>If there ever was a chance that he would reject her, it would only happen if she denied the Heaven&#39;s Feel to begin with.</p><p>As the user and the used, their relationship was perfect.</p><hr><p>Yet, for the same reason, they did not mesh together as human beings.</p><p>The more fickle the woman got, the more of a reason he had to abandon being a Master,</p><p>and the more he experienced her character, the more he broke down as a tool.</p><p>...That sense of nostalgia...</p><p>He, who had no place to return to begin with, could not possibly understand it. No, it was an emotion he should not have understood.</p><hr><p>The battle ended quickly.</p><p>The gatekeeper, Assassin, was defeated by the enemy Servant, and the Master who went out to face him, too, was defeated by swordplay.</p><p>His abdomen was cruelly torn apart.</p><p>The arms he spent over twenty years tempering vanished below his shoulders.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaster, Master\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!!!!\u201D</p><p>The woman&#39;s voice echoed in the temple grounds.</p><p>The enemy Servant seemed to have left, having finished with the Servant and Master of the temple gate.</p><p>Only the woman was left, clinging to the remains of her pallid contractor.</p><hr><p>With eyes that had lost focus, barely able to discern silhouettes, he looked at her.</p><p>Seeing that crying face, he lamented over having done something inexcusable.</p><p>It was not an illusion that his fading consciousness was showing him.</p><p>His heart that should not have existed, shed blood on the verge of death.</p><hr><p>The woman wished to return home.</p><p>The idea of a place to return to did not exist for him.</p><p>A repeated sense of nostalgia.</p><p>A place he&#39;d never seen nor heard of, a dream of a paradise that he did not even have an impression of to begin with.</p><p>That\u2015\u2015\u2015he did not know how to take in even in his last moments.</p><hr><p>\u201CCaster, get away from here. If he senses your presence, the Servant just now will return.\u201D</p><p>He said indifferently.</p><p>Condition of his body aside, it was a miracle that his spirit was still in good health.</p><p>Perhaps it was the result of his long days of training.</p><p>Until the moment his brain stopped working, his mind was clear.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you saying...!? I will surely, definitely heal you, I will not let you die, Master...!\u201D</p><p>The woman didn&#39;t leave.</p><p>It&#39;s just that her reasoning was a little off.</p><p>Of course, losing a Master to anchor to is a serious blow, but not to the extent that it would result in death.</p><p>In fact, she had already lost one before.</p><p>Considering the possibility of being attacked by the same Servant again, it would have been best to leave as quickly as possible and search for another Master.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo not underestimate me, I am a witch...! Patching up a dying man or two is never a problem...!\u201D</p><p>A miracle would not happen.</p><p>The magical energy stockpiled in Ryuudou temple had been destroyed by the enemy Servant, and the injuries were inflicted with a mortality curse by their noble phantasm.</p><hr><p>\u201C...It&#39;s easy, I&#39;ve done this many times... I will not fail, I will not fail, I will not fail...! I&#39;ve never had any trouble with such a simple treatment...!\u201D</p><p>Whilst crying, the woman recited magic as if apologizing.</p><p>But it was no use, even the Divine Words she spoke had lost their usual power.</p><p>The woman&#39;s face filled with more sadness with each passing moment.</p><hr><p>\u201CHya....ah, aah, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015N-No, please help, someone, please, pleeeease...! Please help, please help...!</p><p>This cannot be, but up until now, up until now I&#39;ve never failed, not even once...!!!!\u201D</p><hr><p>Neither healing the wounds, nor regenerating his body was fast enough.</p><p>She could not save anything.</p><p>A witch&#39;s role is only to cripple humans.</p><p>Even if she could heal and animate the dead, genuinely saving a person simply could not happen.</p><p>...Perhaps it was because she hadn&#39;t really tried to save anyone up until now.</p><p>She had not known of that rule until this very moment.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Aah, aaaaah......!\u201D</p><p>Magic did not work.</p><p>She called for help, but no aid ever came.</p><p>The sky she looked up at was high, and she could not stop his falling body temperature.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Please, don&#39;t die...
