This is sudden, but I&#39;m looking for some\u2014\u2014\u2014hm?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, if it isn&#39;t Saber.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> \u2026 \u2026Who&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> If it isn&#39;t Caster and Archer. What is the matter? Came to fetch some medicine?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh no, the thing is\u2026 Archer ended up losing his memories again.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> It&#39;s seriously annoying, but I found him on the way and I can&#39;t just leave him like this, can I? So together with Sakura, we&#39;ve been trying to jog his memory.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Yes. Right now, we&#39;ve just gone through a description of the campus. As it turns out, Archer had even forgotten the class names.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I&#39;m ashamed. I can hardly remember that I was looking for someone. \u2026\u2026by the way, who are you? You seem to have many shades of red.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Hmm, so you&#39;ve even forgotten me. I am an artiste supreme, crowned as the Holy something-or-another Empire&#39;s absolute emperor.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Amongst all Servants, I am the swordswoman most fitting of the red flames of passion. \u2014\u2014\u2014Commit it to memory that I am Red Saber!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, so she&#39;s fine with being called that.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> It cannot be helped. If I had told my True Name, that would not have been much fun. Though an inelegant name, it will have to do this time.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Umu, where is my seat, by the way? This seems like fun. I&#39;d like to join in this company.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mtpiG84.png" alt="NeroJoins"></p><hr><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> U-umm\u2026 Saber? Was there something you came here for today?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I&#39;m looking for something. Essentially, I&#39;m looking for something important. Do you have an idea?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> That seems a bit\u2026\u2026 It would help if you told me exactly what it was\u2026\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I cannot say. You will have to guess. If others were to know what I find important, I would be very embarrassed about it!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> &#39;Kaaay. I think it&#39;d be best if we just completely ignore this king&#39;s remarks.

Fate/EXTRA was made with the theme of \u201Ca brand new Fate\u201D, it&#39;s a story that is Fate yet not Fate.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Using the visual novel Fate/stay night&#39;s core premise, it&#39;s a near future sci-fi romance written as a &#39;what-if&#39;\u2026 scenario.</p><p>Sakura: Rather than a &#39;novel&#39; depicting a chosen Master, the users would play the game as the Master. A Holy Grail War just for you.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> That&#39;s the intent of the TYPE-MOONxRPG project, the tournament-style dungeon RPG [Fate/Extra]!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> So, please look here for more of the specifics.</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SEzTPkN.png" alt="FateExtraSpecifics"></p><table><thead><tr><th>What is Fate/EXTRA?</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>++Genre++</td><td>Tournament-style dungeon RPG</td></tr><tr><td>++Console++</td><td>Playstation Portable</td></tr><tr><td>++Scenario++</td><td>Kinoko Nasu</td></tr><tr><td>++Character Design++</td><td>Arco Wada</td></tr><tr><td>++Developer++</td><td>TYPE-MOON &amp; Imageepoch</td></tr><tr><td>++Publisher++</td><td>Marvelous Entertainment</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Archer:</strong> This again\u2026 I felt something out of place.

Feel free to chime in if anyone knows the answer. Q1: In the setting of EXTRA&#39;s world, how is the stage set?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Elementary. In the era of 2030 AD, the story is set inside of the Moon in a &#39;Virtual Spirit World&#39;-SE.RA.PH</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Within the seven seas created by the Moon, the latest Magi vie for the Holy Grail. That is Extra&#39;s\u2014\u2014\u2014no, my Praetor and I&#39;s promised stage!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> What are you saying? It&#39;s the stage for me and my Master. Maybe you can&#39;t see that because the only thing inside of your head is STR as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Mm? Quite the one to talk, Caster. You as well, through all your mannerisms, are you not a forceful person yourself?**</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>fumei&#39;s TL notes</summary><p>The translation has a bit too many odd-sounding lines and is trying to really be as concise as possible. If the original text had to be compressed and fit in the dialogue box then it would make more sense, but here it does not.</p><p>Nero responds to Tamamo, &quot;Hm? You&#39;re the last person I want to hear that from, Caster. You&#39;re exactly the type of meathead who always gives the impression of stumbling over your words, not to mention your mannerisms, no?&quot;</p></details><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4fxpkcl.png" alt="NeroTamofight"></p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> How rude! My mind is like that of a flower garden. Aside from my Master and I&#39;s happiness, I have no interest in anything else.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Like a flower garden?! I-I will not lose, so I shall do the same! My mental image is always filled with the color of roses!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ldCS9XM.png" alt="SakuraAngery"></p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Are we ready to move on?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> The near-future\u2026\u2026 SE.RA.PH\u2026\u2026 I remember now. In the year 1970, the world&#39;s mana started drying up. Magi were no longer able to perform their mysteries as they did.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Magic went into decline, so magecraft is done through information processing, and the Spiritron-hackers known as Wizards came to be.**</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>fumei&#39;s TL notes</summary><p>&quot;Magic/Magecraft declined, and so now enter the hackers known as Wizards (spoken ruby for &quot;mages&quot;), having mastered the magic/magecraft theory based on calculational processing and spiritron conversion.&quot;</p></details><p><strong>Archer:</strong> These new Magi were invited into the Moon&#39;s virtual reality, SE.RA.PH</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> This time they would be the Masters, and my Master, the protagonist of this game. Is that enough, Sakura?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Yes, that will do. Q2: About the main character. Archer happened to say a little about it just now.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> To give a more detailed explanation, you can choose either a male or female protagonist. They&#39;re essentially a representation of the Player themselves!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> In the course of the game, it is up to the Player to make their choices. They have no personality, an ordinary person able to be loved by all.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> A protagonist with no personality\u2026\u2026 you say?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qKuFXUk.png" alt="HakunoKishinami"></p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Huh? Really?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Really \u2665 Even strange behavior is allowed since it&#39;s the Player&#39;s choice after all.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> On to Q3: What is a tournament-style dungeon RPG? About that.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I do not understand this one. Tournament-style\u2026\u2026 do you mean to say it&#39;s like a fighting game?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> No, it&#39;s not the kind of game where you interact with other players, but rather the kind of RPG you can play as you like, curled up in the kotatsu during winter break.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> The SE.RA.PH has seven seas\u2014\u2014\u2014or seven layers, with each layer having a dungeon called the Arena.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> In the Arena, Players will have events, face the enemy Master in a showdown, moving to the next round, vying to be the last one standing to take the Holy Grail\u2026\u2026</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> That process is the reason we call this a \u201Ctournament-style dungeon RPG\u201D. Through battles, through laughter and tears, please think of this as an RPG made of seven chapters.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Well, the one in-charge of laughter is Mr. Gatou. As for tears and emotions, the one in-charge is <em>me</em>. Kya, I&#39;m the main heroine after all~\u266A</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No, I think laughter-in-charge would be you.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> No, wouldn&#39;t you be as well?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Ahem. Can we get back to explaining? Q4: About the playable Servants. Needless to say: that would be me, and the two of them.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> <em>Ehh, but that&#39;s supposed to be my job\u2026</em></p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> In Extra, Players are free to choose their own partners.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> For beginners, Saber. For intermediate, Archer. For advanced, Caster.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Though each Servant has their own features, the scenario itself does not really change.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> It would be nice if one chose their Servant based on preference rather than performance.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> It&#39;s your Holy Grail War, after all. Choosing from effectiveness or affection, either is fine.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ohh? Feeling better, are we, Archer? Umu, you certainly are better this way.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Ehh, you already have your memory back? That&#39;s boooring.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Sorry, don&#39;t count me in just yet. To see this through the end, I have no choice but to continue.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> <em>Ah\u2026</em> <em>(She gasps meekly as she tries to put herself back to position only for Archer to push her back)</em></p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Next is, I believe, Q5: Who are the enemy Masters and Servants? This is completely new. Fate/EXTRA has diverse Masters and Servants as opponents.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> There are also some nostalgic references, but they were arranged in a way that fits Extra. The real charm of Fate is uncovering the true nature of an unknown enemy.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> After all, even in an RPG like Extra, that is the greatest enjoyment and is something to be carried on. As much as possible, I want you to keep gathering information and give your all in battle.</p><p><strong>Saber &amp; Caster:</strong> Ohh~</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> That&#39;s it for the Q&amp;A. Short though as it was, I think that serves as a basic introduction.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> \u2026\u2026Hm? But, why was I going over the basics again, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> No no, don&#39;t sweat the small stuff. It&#39;s just a little harmless advertisement.</p><hr><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Archer&#39;s memories have returned, so to my Private Room I will <em>also</em> return.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> That&#39;s right, I should hurry up as well. \u2026\u2026right now, I don&#39;t have the time to waste in a place like this.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u2026\u2026They left\u2026\u2026 U-umm, what about you, Saber? I don&#39;t have any tea right now, but would you like an Elixir?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Umu, I suppose I&#39;ll continue my search. Pardon my intrusion, Sakura. I am grateful for your consideration.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJdQUhq.png" alt="SakuraDepressed"></p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> She\u2014\u2026\u2026 still took the Elixir.</p><hr><h3 id="tell-me-blossom-sensei-merry-christmas-chapter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tell-me-blossom-sensei-merry-christmas-chapter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tell me!!

Much \u201Credder\u201D than usual, I&#39;d say\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Umu. I don&#39;t really know why, but\u2026 I heard there&#39;s an event going on tonight where a person named \u201CSanta\u201D or something hands out presents. Here, take this.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2U50P5z.png" alt="PadoruPresent"></p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Wow, thank you very much. I can&#39;t drink alcohol yet but I&#39;ll accept it gratefully. And it&#39;s from a new brand too\u266A</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> It is, isn&#39;t it? As a statesman, one should be able to hear the cries of their citizens. My researching rivals that of the Owl of Minerva.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Holla~! Just here to get my medicine~\u2606 Oya? I thought I heard an irritating person in here, so it was Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Mm, so it&#39;s Caster. Greetings, merry~! Your futile attempts at sex appeal are irksome as always. Though a herculean task, I shall bear with it.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Haaah? Did you happen to eat something rotten, lady? You&#39;re particularly irritating today, ya know?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I have not. My sadness is such that I cannot even swallow food. \u2014\u2014\u2014Anyway, that&#39;s that.

I don&#39;t like your attitude but I&#39;ll take what I can get \u266A</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> \u2026\u2026hey, what is this? Mink fur\u2026 gloves\u2026?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Uwaa! No thanks! Giving weasel fur to a fox, what the heck were you thinking?!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No, all of the school NPCs say that Casko never wears much, so to speak. So I figured you were surely cold doing so, but\u2026</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> <em>Your consideration is unnecessary.</em></p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> \u2026<em>sigh</em> If only you got me kneesocks or high-socks instead. I guess I&#39;ll consider this a one-sided favor, as usual.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Hm? I see\u2026 So Casko would have preferred socks over gloves\u2026 I guessed wrong again, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Oh no, it&#39;s the thought that counts. Umm, do you happen to have any other presents? I&#39;d really like to know.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I-is that so? Umu, in that case I shall make an exception and show you!</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yyKKQte.png" alt="CoinBarrel"></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Let&#39;s start with this. The smell of rum coils off from this barrel. A barrel-shaped piggy bank, \u201CDear Bottomless Feeder\u201D!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I wasn&#39;t fond of how Rider looked, but despite that, when we talked I found her a pleasant Heroic Spirit. I liked her.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> I&#39;ll pass. There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll get along with her.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Her Master was a troublesome one, wasn&#39;t he?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iOE8Dgo.png" alt="Poison"></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Next is this, a teacup with a filtration system \u201CDeath by Bad Blood.\u201D This is for Green Archer. Such green tea would certainly befit that man&#39;s fame. I do not like him.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Every time we meet, he calls me &#39;tiny&#39; or &#39;princess&#39;, things that I&#39;m secretly self-conscious about!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Agreed! Just because he&#39;s a lady-killer, he thinks he can get away with saying whatever he wants.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> He&#39;s flawed as a man, that one.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> He doesn&#39;t get along with Red Archer either. When they&#39;re in the dining hall eating lunch, they get into arguments about how to use traps. That&#39;s what you&#39;d call a &#39;hate-friend&#39;, right?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pxIzuDb.png" alt="Mirror"></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is for the adorable little Caster. I obtained this after surveying the NPCs. \u2026\u2026 I have no idea how to use this.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Hmm, that Caster&#39;s character is beyond help, but as a Heroic Spirit they&#39;re not too bad. What do you think, Saber?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Hm? Of course I like her! I love beautiful girls!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/32KTF2T.png" alt="BloodandShiki"></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Next is the black beard-guy and that incomprehensible woman.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Beard-guy&#39;s complexion isn&#39;t so good, so it&#39;d be nice if he just wet his whistle with this. I like his personality, but our affiliations seem to crash.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I&#39;m not sure on that berserk woman. She&#39;s in a rather pitiable state due to her Master. Since she cannot talk, I shall have to withhold judgement of her.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wBMFOKg.png" alt="HawaiianShirt"></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is for Assassin-sensei. I think this suits him well. How is it?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah. Yes, I think it will look good on him.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Why is only Assassin called \u201C-sensei\u201D?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> For some reason! Grr, \u2014how slow has it been opening these one by one! I&#39;m doing it all at once! \u2014Next up is this and this and this and this!*</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> It&#39;s a Hawaiian shirt \u2665</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Isn&#39;t this batch a little lacking?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Yes, I didn&#39;t know what they would like, so I decided to get them something they&#39;re not good with. I hope they may overcome these weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> There&#39;s nothing for Red Archer?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Mm? There is.

You understand? It&#39;s not hard to see why. \u201COne-tail Three-Realms\u201D. Not cute at all.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> \u2026From that, it&#39;d be pretty easy to guess your identity. Were there any plans for your tails to increase?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> <em>They weren&#39;t</em>\u2026\u2026 but maybe I&#39;ll get a spin-off sometime where I&#39;ll get to go full power. You know, I&#39;m really <em>something</em> when I&#39;m serious.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> For a game to be as good as it can be, there has to be enough resources to spare, you know?

I am a pure-hearted fox, you blockhead!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> In the first place, skill names in RPGs and fighting games are only up for an instant, so shouldn&#39;t it be intuitive to go look for the name?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> This unworthy Caster, in consideration of her Master, has taken on simple names for three!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Agreed. Whether it&#39;s attack skills or support skills, ones that are understood with a glance are the best. A lot of Servants have skill names that are self-indulgent and really out there.*</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Umu, and remember the guy that came out at the end! His were so filled with kanji that I couldn&#39;t read them.

I worry that we&#39;ll not be able to win.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Oh dear\u2026</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Kyahaha, that&#39;s pretty funny. What&#39;s with that? That Master of yours, don&#39;t they sound like a failure~?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> D-don&#39;t be stupid, he is not a failure! It&#39;s just that, we always run into some kind of trouble!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Come again?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Yes. Whenever we run into small fry is trouble.

The completion of the system features aren&#39;t a given.

It seems I have much to learn from you.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Indeed. How unexpected, my chest tightened just a bit for this white-haired guy.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Can we get back on topic now?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Still, why are you doing this? Aren&#39;t you for the management of SE.RA.PH? You shouldn&#39;t have a reason to kidnap Masters!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> I <em>do</em> have a reason.
