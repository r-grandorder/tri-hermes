She shies from asserting herself but is driven in her approach when it comes to what she must do and wants to do. She likes good people and hates the wicked. Although she can distinguish good from evil as someone Neutral-aligned, she doesn\u2019t fixate on which side counts as superior. This stems from how she generally doesn\u2019t hate others.</p><p>Habetrot\u2019s values are reflected as such: Peace is comfortable and much preferable, whereas conflict is draining and awful. As a general rule, let Habetrot enjoy her sewing and needlework and she\u2019s a happy faerie.</p><p>Be it Proper Human History Habetrot or Lostbelt Habetrot, her nature proves consistent. Whenever she finds a girl she feels is the one (someone she feels has the right to become a happy bride), she pulls out all the stops to care for and support her. Habetrot refers to such girls as \u201Cmy brides.\u201D Either she will set out to find another bride immediately after sending off the former, or if she finds one more good candidate while already attending to another bride, Habetrot will become engrossed in supporting both. This has led to some describing her as easily infatuated.</p><p>Habetrot won\u2019t admit it, but she\u2019s a bundle of devotion. The way this faerie tends to prioritize her brides\u2019 happiness over her own illustrates her self-sacrificing trait.</p><h3 id="habetrot-in-faerie-britain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#habetrot-in-faerie-britain" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Habetrot in Faerie Britain</h3><p>She appears as a spinster faerie in the Fragment chapters. Together with Aesc the Savior, they settled disputes all over Britain. Habetrot\u2019s fate changed significantly when she met Mash, who rayshifted to Fae Era Year 400\u2026 Or rather, this faerie made every effort possible to overcome her fate.</p><p>When Aesc the Savior and the original Tam Lin stepped down the stage, Habetrot roamed Britain alone and popularized the culture of wedding traditions, sending off many brides in the process.</p><p>By the time the new High Queen Era was adopted, Habetrot turned herself into a stone inside a twisted hole in the north and would stay asleep until a certain encounter in 2017. After ever so nonchalantly saving Mash in Sheffield, she would then guide the Master of Chaldea to Orkney, coming to terms with the choice she made.</p><p>She originally went by the name Totorot in the Lostbelt and only began calling herself Habetrot after waking up from her stone slumber. The reason for this is that she came to admire Proper Human History Habetrot\u2019s way of life from the legends Mash taught her.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Habetrot was originally a wild hooligan of the Wing Clan and became a member of Aesc\u2019s party following her defeat in their duel. (Although a spinster faerie by nature, she had no means of fulfilling her innate purpose of sending off human brides in the Lostbelt. This \u201Cexistential conflict\u201D tormented her, giving rise to displaced emotions that turned her into a wild hooligan.) From that point onward, she would achieve exploits as one of the original Tam Lin who fought alongside Aesc the Savior.</p><p>The Fragment chapters also reveal that the name \u201CMash\u201D was written on Mash\u2019s shield in chalk. This was done by Habetrot. When she asked her to show the shield, she deftly wrote Mash\u2019s name on it. The use of a tailor\u2019s chalk is proof that it was Habetrot\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Brides are \u201Ctreasures\u201D in Habetrot\u2019s eyes because she is a faerie that will never grow into adulthood. She longs to become a bride herself, but that is a wish never to come true. So at the very least, she wants to protect the future of the beautiful girls she falls in love with at first sight. This could be seen as compensatory behavior on Habetrot\u2019s part, or perhaps, as her radiant dream. \u201CMaybe one day\u2026 No, scratch that. I wish I could become like them, too.\u201D</p><h3 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h3><ul><li>&quot;Brides are great!
