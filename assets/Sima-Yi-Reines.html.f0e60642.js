Just great.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Reines!? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re behind this!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Dammit, of all the people I hoped wouldn&#39;t find out about this! Wait. Were you writing essays in the cafeteria again?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It&#39;s an old habit of mine! The words come more<br> easily when I&#39;ve got something to munch on!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Besides, the cafeteria&#39;s sandwiches are just too good. I can&#39;t resist them.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hahaha, I&#39;d say the ones from the caf\xE9 on Druid Street would give them a run for their money, but I got it.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Anyway, why&#39;re you still writing essays at all?<br> Did you forget you&#39;re a Servant now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help it!

It&#39;s not like your obsessive tendencies are anything new at this point. Anyway, now that the Code&#39;s out of the bag, Brother, why don&#39;t you give me a hand getting it back in?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Data collection obstacle detected.

Good luck!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> What have you pulled me into now!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Yup, this is definitely London.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> And based on the local architecture, it would seem the nineteenth-century setting was accurate as well.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any other people around...<br> Is that part of the settings, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why would the Volumen Hydrargyrum come here?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hmm. I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Aside from the lack of people, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything strange or out of place.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> What&#39;s your tracking spell say?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Thanks to that bit I gathered earlier,<br> I was able to get Trimmau&#39;s coordinates.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> But it&#39;s still going to take a little time to find her.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Then it seems now would be a good time for you<br> to tell us more about this research of yours.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Damn, so you didn&#39;t forget about that, huh?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Basically, like I said before, it boils down to how we can take advantage of Pseudo-Servants&#39; unique characteristics.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like what?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Most Servants never grow or change.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> And why would they? They&#39;re all dead, after all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> The moment they&#39;re inscribed in the Throne and given<br> a Servant class, their form is pretty much set in stone.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> They can level up, sure, but that&#39;s really just a way of showing how close they are to their true capabilities.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> But the same isn&#39;t true for us Pseudo-Servants, is it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> We&#39;re simultaneously dead, yet not dead.<br> Alive, and not alive.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I see. So that&#39;s where the Volumen Hydrargyrum comes in. It belongs to you, not Sima Yi.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Exactly. I figured if I played my cards right,<br> I could find a way to boost my combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong><br> And I thought the same,<br> which is why I decided to help investigate this idea.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong><br> Specifically, I was adjusting the data to better acclimate the Volumen Hydrargyrum to my own Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong><br> Both the Volumen Hydrargyrum and Lady Reines are old hands at that sort of tweaking, so if all goes well, it should unlock some new possibilities.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell if that sounds more like something you<br> would do, or something Lord Sima Yi would do...<br> Either way, that&#39;s no exploit. That&#39;s an out-and-out<br> cheat!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Huh, I&#39;m surprised you disapprove, Brother.<br> I thought you liked video games.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Video games are designed with their own respective rules, and those rules need to be followed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> One careless move, and you could end up destroying your entire Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Please, Lord Sima Yi, try to talk some sense into\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heeey! Can you guys hear me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I saw the simulator was booted up all of a sudden.<br> Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My professor, uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Wait, wait! I&#39;ll explain that part!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now I see. I&#39;m surprised that Volumen Hydrargyrum<br> would run amok on her own like that.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I must have made a mistake with one of her settings or something. Believe me, I feel very silly.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> (Let&#39;s just keep the fact that I was hacking into<br> Chaldea&#39;s database between you, me, and my brother, okay?)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, got it. Now that I know what&#39;s going on,<br> I&#39;ll keep an eye on all your vitals from here, too.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> (Phew. That was too close...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It looks like your tracking spell is reacting again.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hmm. She&#39;s south of here, near Regent&#39;s Park.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Come on, we&#39;d better hurry.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Ooh, a fish-and-chips stand.<br> Damn if it doesn&#39;t smell good.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Go buy me some, will you, pupil?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you just say we should hurry?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Hm? I see the stand,<br> but I don&#39;t see anyone working it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It does smell good, but aren&#39;t we kind of busy now?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly why we need a snack to keep our energy<br> up. ...Never mind. There&#39;s no one working it.</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe this is another odd simulator setting? Then again, it really seems as though someone was cooking here just a few minutes ago.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Maybe they&#39;re doing their best Mary Celeste crew impression?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Mmm, I&#39;ll have to really pour on the vinegar to tamp down the delicious smell this freshly fried fish is putting out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re already digging in!?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hahaha, I&#39;m just showing the food its due respect.<br> Mmm, yum! It&#39;s piping hot and perfectly flaky!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I can taste the delicious oils with every bite of fish!<br> And these steaming hot chips are salted perfectly!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> If this stand&#39;s proprietor were here,<br> I&#39;d be breaking out my Reines Stamp of Approval.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> What the...!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Now I see. Part of Trimmau got into the automated defense systems! And here I thought it was my comeuppance for dine and dashing!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Hold it, Reines.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Does that mean Trimmau has control<br> over the simulator itself?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> How much of her do you have now?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Let me see... This just makes forty percent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Forty percent, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess that means the main unit is still somewhere else then?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I knew there had to be more than an odd simulator<br> setting behind the lack of people here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> My Unreturning Formation isn&#39;t working right, either.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> You mean Zhuge Liang&#39;s famous maneuver?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Things might look normal here, but there&#39;s something<br> going on right beneath the surface.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It almost feels like a loading screen from a video game...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> My tracking spell!<br> There you are, Trimmau!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Huh? It can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Reines! Fujimaru!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m back in my room?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does that mean the simulation is over!?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> No, it isn&#39;t. Take a closer look, Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> This is the old Chaldea. I&#39;m sure of it.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not quite right either, Brother.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Both my Mystic Eyes and the part of Trimmau I collected are reacting. We&#39;re definitely still in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, that means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, this must be</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I see. So we&#39;re in a simulation of the old Chaldea!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Da Vinci, can you still hear us?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I think we can take the silence as a no. Damn.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Brother, you said that London reminded<br> you of a loading screen, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> What if that was a fake out, and Trimmau&#39;s real goal was to simulate the old Chaldea?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...If it is, that would explain why she infiltrated the automatic defense systems.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I see. So she put up that London as a front while she was secretly building this simulation behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> But even if she is going haywire right now, I still don&#39;t understand why Trimmau would go to such lengths...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Authenticating... Error...<br> Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Authentication attempt limit reached. Locking<br> system... Lockdown protocol halted by root user...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Authenticating... Error...<br> Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> What the hell?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It looks like Trimmau&#39;s trying to hack into the system. But this... Wait. That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Reines.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Yes, Brother?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You saw the last thing Trimmau turned<br> into back in London, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I did.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Do you know who it was?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Because if it was who I think it was,<br> she&#39;s someone Fujimaru knows, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone I know?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Someone with deep ties to the old Chaldea. Give it some thought, and I think you&#39;ll know who I mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> So you figured it out, huh? Makes sense.<br> I&#39;m sure you knew her a lot better than I did.</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> It was Chaldea&#39;s former director,<br> Olga Marie Animusphere.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Looks like we managed to avoid any obstructions.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Are you two ready?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Olga Marie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Director!</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hi, Trimmau. Sorry I took so long.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> The only reason Trimmau went haywire<br> is because she&#39;s working properly.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Huh? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Exactly what I said. Trimmau ended up like this<br> because she was carrying out your orders.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You ordered her to do this, Professor?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> We had it backwards.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> You said you couldn&#39;t get into the<br> central sector&#39;s data, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> In other words, Trimmau wasn&#39;t able to break<br> through the new Chaldea&#39;s security.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> So in response, she made a place where<br> she might be able to: the old Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Instead of trying to get past the new security measures...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...she decided to use the simulator to create<br> a route where she could get past the old ones.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> No way...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is it even possible to bypass security that way?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> It depends, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time this kind of scam has worked, either with magecraft or computers.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I see. So if there&#39;s a flaw in the simulator&#39;s security, she might be able to use that to gain access.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Whether that&#39;s actually the case or not, it must be what Trimmau was thinking when she did all this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mystic Codes can think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can Mystic Codes really think like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Trimmau can. We had Flat help make her personality.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Oh, Flat was one of Brother&#39;s pupils, by the way. The El-Melloi class was actually pretty popular, believe it or not.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Was that last part really necessary? Anyway, I can<br> assure you that Trimmau&#39;s thought processes are<br> impossibly flexible compared to those of standard AI.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Unfortunately, if she&#39;s going haywire now, that also means there&#39;s no telling what she might try next.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to be very careful.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Well? Come on, Trimmau, say something!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie?:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re sure she&#39;s actually the Volumen Hydrargyrum, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re sure that&#39;s not really Director Olga Marie, right?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Positive. I&#39;m also sure you know<br> that just as well as I do.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> She&#39;s what Reines was hiding.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> There&#39;s something you&#39;re still not telling us,<br> isn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Yes, you were in an important position at the Clock Tower, and you do know a lot about high-level security.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean you can just breeze past Chaldea&#39;s security measures like they&#39;re nothing.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Which means there&#39;s something else you&#39;re keeping<br> from us that allowed Trimmau to get through.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you. Reines here didn&#39;t just know how Chaldea&#39;s security was set up.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> She also knew Olga Marie&#39;s habits from her own world.<br> Didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Haha, well this is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> There are a number of differences in this world, but<br> in my world, yes, Olga Marie and I were very close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa! I had no idea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You and Olga Marie, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Well, relatively close. As mages, we both had our share of secrets, so we couldn&#39;t open up that much.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> But, we were still close enough<br> to know each other&#39;s quirks...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...and I could see them all over Chaldea&#39;s security.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...Man, this brings back memories.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> As the next Lords in waiting for our respective families, you and I used to deceive each other all the time.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> And as mages from the same generation,<br> we also always had lots to talk about.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Reines, this Olga Marie isn&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I know, Brother.<br> It&#39;s just a Volumen Hydrargyrum that looks like her.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Besides, I never even knew this world&#39;s Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I took a look at her file once, and she and my counterpart from this world&#39;s paths barely crossed at all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> She never got on that train here,<br> nor did she ever take part in the Grand Roll with me.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong><br> Authenticating... Error...<br> Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I can&#39;t fully get through this Chaldea&#39;s security. The Marie I knew might look like the one from this world, but she&#39;s a completely different person.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I\u2013</p><p><strong>Olga Marie?:</strong><br> Mage threat detected.<br> Eliminating.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Ghh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Professor!</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m fine.<br> As I was saying...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to tear you apart.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Seven holes are bored into primordial chaos. There are poisonous women to great men. Never is there a time when neither sun nor moon is set.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Behold my tactics! Unspoken Formation...release!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Release!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Trimmau&#39;s back to normal!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Now I see. Sima Yi&#39;s Noble Phantasm exposes an enemy&#39;s weakness, so Trimmau was imitating Olga Marie because she was Chaldea&#39;s weakness!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Not exactly. I only meant for Trimmau to imitate Olga Marie&#39;s habits.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I never planned for her to imitate Olga Marie herself.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> When she tried, she got stuck at imitating the Olga Marie I know, and now, here we are, trying to clean up the mess.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> And damn if it isn&#39;t a hot one. I could cry.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Now she&#39;s imitating me! Well Trim, if you think you<br> can beat the real deal, you&#39;re sorely mistaken!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Reines.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to focus my skills entirely on you. You said this is your mess, right? Then clean it up yourself.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) I swear, you&#39;re too damn lenient with<br> me for your own good sometimes, Brother.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> But I guess I can&#39;t blame you, seeing how adorable I am! Thanks, Brother! Just this once, I&#39;ll take you up on that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong><br> ...Lady...Reines?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Welcome back, Trimmau.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I just never expected to run into my<br> Servant karma here of all places.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Servant karma?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Well, maybe it&#39;s not karma so much as a weakness that<br> only Pseudo-Servants with their host&#39;s personality<br> intact are susceptible to.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> You know how Servants don&#39;t retain memories<br> of their past summonings, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Exceptions to the rule aside, usually it&#39;s the person summoning the Servant who feels bad about being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> But for Pseudo-Servants, we&#39;re the ones who remember, and have to deal with being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Obviously, the chances of running into someone we know are practically nonexistent, since we&#39;re in a world entirely different from our own and all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> So even if we do happen to run into someone we know,<br> they end up being someone else entirely.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> So, yeah, it&#39;s painful.<br> Nothing I can&#39;t handle, but it still hurts.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> ...But, maybe it&#39;s not all bad.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Maybe this&#39;ll help me better understand<br> what it&#39;s like to be in your shoes.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> As a Master, you go through this sort of thing all the time, right? So I should probably learn to appreciate this pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not all pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can at least tell you it&#39;s worth it.</p><hr><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong><br> Initiating reboot.<br> Reboot complete.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Whoa!</p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been monitoring the situation.<br> I&#39;m so sorry, Lady Reines.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be.<br> This was pretty much all my fault.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Trimmau.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> At least it looks like the experiment worked. I can tell you and my Spirit Origin are working together better now.</p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong><br> Yes, Lady Reines. I can confirm a thirty-seven<br> percent increase in Spirit Origin output.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Looks like the simulation&#39;s fading away<br> now that Trimmau&#39;s back to normal.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Come on, you two. Let&#39;s get out of here.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Phew. This latest caper really tuckered me out.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Then get some sleep.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> If Jason is anything to go by,<br> even normal Servants can benefit from a good nap.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> As Pseudo-Servants,<br> we no doubt need proper rest even more than they do.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Hmm. You make a pretty convincing case.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong><br> Okay then, good night, Brother.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Good night, Reines.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Just a moment, El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Lord Sima Yi.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Worry not. Lady Reines is fast asleep now,<br> so we can speak freely.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I wished to discuss with you, something that&#39;s been nagging at me. In fact, it&#39;s something I noticed you purposely shied away from.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> The reason Trimmau went haywire in the first place.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> She was making predictive calculations at a level<br> she could not even properly verbalize, correct?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Because we need to know more about<br> the data Chaldea possesses?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Exactly. The Volumen Hydrargyrum calculated that data was a top priority, even if it meant she had to go haywire to process it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Of course, her efforts to do so ultimately proved to be for naught. Haha, I must say, this modern world has turned out to be much more enjoyable than I expected.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Oh, and one more thing. You should come out of hiding once in a while, you cowardly excuse for a tactician.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Your \u201Cgift\u201D of women&#39;s clothing sent to taunt me is the whole reason I ended up inhabiting a woman&#39;s body, after all.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Tell it to someone who cares.<br> Besides, I&#39;m enjoying this modern world plenty myself.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Did you just get Liang to rehash the time he sent you women&#39;s clothing to insult you as being weak for refusing to fight him?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> I sure did. It only makes sense he would respond to me, no matter how deeply he may be lying dormant.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Such is the nature of our relationship.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> Of course, I have my doubts as to whether he truly<br> thought women were synonymous with weakness or not.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong><br> At any rate, take care, Zhuge Liang.<br> I am sure we will see each other again someday.</p>', 380);
