It is nearly impossible to be detected if one suppresses their presence completely, but the rank of Presence Concealment drops greatly when preparing to attack.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Mental Pollution: [A]</strong></p><p>Due to possessing a distorted mentality, it is possible for one to shut out any Mental Interference Magecraft. One is not able to come to a mutual understanding with individuals who do not possess a Mental Pollution of an equivalent rank.</p><p><strong>Beautiful Voice of Captivation: [B]</strong></p><p>A natural constitution of having a beautiful voice. It works as a magical Charm Effect towards females, but evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.</p><p>Using this beautiful voice, the Phantom conversates while singing like he was right there on the stage of the opera house.</p><p><strong>Innocent Monster: [D]</strong></p><p>A monster that had the way his past ought to be distorted according to the image cultivated in future years. The Phantom\u2019s abilities and appearance have been completely transformed.</p><p>The Phantom, who is the model for the novel character of \u201CThe Phantom of the Opera\u201D, has received the influence of that work where his real face has changed into something grotesque, while also, both of his arms have already further transformed into something that belong to those of a grotesque monster\u2019s. If he completely removes his black[1] gloves, claws that are even sharper and more dangerous than large knives are stretched out, and both grotesque hands become exposed out in the open.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="christine-christine-surely-my-love-song-shall-resound-even-in-hell-itself" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#christine-christine-surely-my-love-song-shall-resound-even-in-hell-itself" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Christine, Christine: Surely My Love Song Shall Resound Even in Hell Itself</h1><ul><li>Rank: B+*</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~50</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 200 people</li></ul><p>An ominous and gigantic musical instrument that is much like a pipe-organ, constructed by combining some of the corpses of the Phantom\u2019s former victims. Maybe the sinful deeds that Ryuunosuke Uryuu attempted through trial and error had already been completed in the 19th Century\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or maybe, this is the image of the cruel and mysterious person at the time of his materialization, sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.</p><p>By matching it with the Phantom\u2019s singing voice that is owned by his grotesque vocal organs, this Noble Phantasm scatters invisible magic damage to the surroundings. For the Phantom himself, who is the performer, he does not take any damage from the attack. Because it is an attack done not through sound, but purely through a radiation of Magical Energy, it is possible to block it with defensive magic and abilities. Equipped armour and the like also works effectively.</p><ul><li>The Noble Phantasm is B-rank in the game profile</li></ul><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronoun: watashi</li><li>Second Person Pronouns: kimi / omae</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB-shi</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Fundamentally, the Phantom is gentlemanly. However, he is not a true gentleman; rather, he is doing no more than consistently playing the part of \u201Chimself as a gentleman\u201D. An enormous sorrow and anger are being hidden beneath his mask, and he is deeply conscious that once they start to overflow, a tragedy will be brought forth.</p><p>The Phantom constantly works to restrain himself and kill those impulses. While holding conversations, he openly sings to show that his suppression of those impulses is being effective. But if he stops singing, evidence of his real nature as the \u201CPhantom of the Opera\u201D \u2013 a figure who will become a slaughterer if it is for the sake of his purpose, and someone who is cruel and insane enough to deal with the obstacles in his path by eliminating them \u2013 will begin to appear.</p><p>The Phantom likes girls with a beautiful voice. At such a girl where his eyes are affixed to her, he will also appeal that \u201CShe will mature into a diva if she is under my guidance.\u201D</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>As for his Master, the Phantom somehow becomes emotionally attached to them while saying \u201CWhat a magnificently beautiful voice.\u201D He is mixing them up with the diva from his past. Although he acquired an insanity because of his Mental Pollution, he is very obedient as a Servant. However, because his utterances are conversations that are constantly similar to him singing, what he is trying to say is substantially not transmitted very well.</p><p>The wish the Phantom wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cfor the diva that he guided to receive the honour of being the best in the world.\u201D If possible, he wants to bring up his Master as a diva (regardless of their gender). Therefore, he will probably care for his Master more than anything else.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI will sing to you as you doze off\u2026 with beauty enshrouding you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSing with me\u2026 one more time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt turns out that those who witness my face\u2026 will certainly come to know fear\u2026 Even you\u2026 You too\u2026 And you as well!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy soul and voice\u2026 are here\u2026 bundled up into one.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026 Sing.

A man who conceals his accursed and grotesque face with a mask modelled after a skull. The mysterious person who appeared in \u201CThe Phantom of the Opera\u201D, a novel set in the 19th Century\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015or perhaps, the person who became the model of the novel character. Settling down in an aqueduct that is like a vast underground labyrinth beneath the opera house (Palais Garnier), the Phantom of the Opera was charmed by a pure, chaste and young actress, even guiding her into becoming a diva, and he conducted serial murders on behalf of his unfulfilled love.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Gilles de Rais</strong></p><p>Their strangeness and conversations mesh well with each other.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Although the Phantom already turned into a joke character because of an event from the FGO Story, his design was initially drawn up with an elegant image. However, after Mr. Takeuchi said \u201CHe should be even more like a mysterious person\u201D, he settled down into this current design. Also, when I was looking up various mediums of \u201CThe Phantom of the Opera\u201D to get that touch in drawing his pictures, I found out that the \u201CPhantom of the Opera\u201D in the olden days was conscious of himself, given that there was a side to this mysterious person who was conscious of his entire face, so it is different when the visuals show him concealing only the right side of his face with a mask; personally, I resolutely created \u201Ca mysterious person who is possessing a young man\u201D, and I did an illustration to represent that in his Final Ascension. In this game, because he holds a Noble Phantasm that is overall valuable as an Assassin, I am grateful that he greatly plays an active role in the Ember Gatherings.
