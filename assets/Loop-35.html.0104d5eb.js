Ah, here?\u201D</p><p>It was in a place where I could graze her bottom by mistake.</p><p>My fingers make contact with the case.

Is there really no way out?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf it&#39;s opened from the outside, then there&#39;s no problem. But opening it from the inside is difficult.</p><p>How do I put it? I suppose it&#39;s an issue of the rules.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRules? By &quot;rules,&quot; do you mean the chest&#39;s rules?\u201D</p><p>\u201CObviously. It&#39;s a chest after all. If something in it could just arbitrarily leave, it&#39;d be troubling, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p>This is the great master Zelretch&#39;s favorite chest. It goes without saying that it stores and safeguards its contents perfectly.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CZelretch... Then, it&#39;s in the same class as your Jewel Sword?\u201D</p><p>\u201CExactly. A magical box created with the Second Sorcery.</p><p>The box stores things not by increasing the size of its space, but by fluctuating the volume of the items put inside. As a nonsensical side-effect of this, time inside the box differs from that of the outside world.</p><p>An hour in the box corresponds to a day in the outside world. It might be a strange comparison, but it&#39;s similar to a cold sleep.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CO-One hour is a day...!?</p><p>In that case, if\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>If we spend 3 hours in here, Sunday will already be over, won&#39;t it?</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s how it is. If we don&#39;t want to end up like Urashima Tarou, we&#39;ve got no choice but to hurry up and get out.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka lets out a sigh.</p><p>She&#39;d finally been able to get out, but due to my clumsiness she&#39;s right back where she started, so perhaps it&#39;s only natural.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I understand that it&#39;s difficult to escape.</p><p>However, there&#39;s no barrier to protect it from the inside, right? The box might break, but if you hit it with offensive magic, it just might\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, Emiya-kun?</p><p>Lets say you were locked up in a vault. Would you think of escaping by setting off dynamite inside of it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>Obviously before the box would break, we&#39;d be victims of the blast.</p><hr><p>\u201CFirstly, with my magical power, blowing the lid off would be impossible.</p><p>If I had the great master&#39;s Jewel Sword, it would be a different story though.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. Then, what about your glasses?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey&#39;re a magical item, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, they&#39;re just for show.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Then why&#39;d you put them on just now?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat do you mean? It&#39;s for when I&#39;m in the mood to give explanations.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......So they&#39;re not some sort of key to escape?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. If there were such a thing I would have gotten out of here by myself.\u201D</p><p>It seems like a hopeless state of affairs and yet, I&#39;m surprisingly calm and composed.</p><hr><p>\u201C...So, what then?</p><p>We&#39;re really stuck in this?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to say it, but we really are trapped in here.</p><p>It&#39;s not my fault, but I&#39;m sorry for involving you in this, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><hr><p>Her apologizing voice is a little frail.</p><p>&quot;We really stepped in it this time,&quot; I groan.</p><p>Inside this small yet spacious chest.</p><p>&quot;What will become of Tohsaka and me?&quot; I held my forehead as I worried.</p><hr><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-2-mimic-rin-lvl-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-2-mimic-rin-lvl-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 2 Mimic Rin Lvl 2</h3><hr><p>A day had passed.</p><p>For us, it had only been about an hour, but to the rest of the world, the sun had come and gone.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, I&#39;m getting a little tired.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah, same here.\u201D</p><p>I speak without meeting her eyes.</p><p>I&#39;m getting a bit claustrophobic trapped in this place, but I&#39;ve been feeling awkward being stuck this close to Tohsaka for a while now.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind staying like this forever, but cramped spaces aren&#39;t too healthy for the mind and body.</p><p>I should start seriously thinking of a way out\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right.

Is this Miss Tohsaka!?</p><p>W-Why are you with Shero!?</p><p>Didn&#39;t you choose Las Vegas because you weren&#39;t interested in Monaco!?\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C......I have no idea what you&#39;re on about, but if I had to choose, then Vegas for sure.</p><p>You&#39;re talking about gambling, right? If you&#39;re trying to make money, rather than some upscale western European casino, the businesslike American ones seem better.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300ASo, looks like you&#39;ve revealed your true colors, Miss Tohsaka.</p><p>So much for your &quot;grace.&quot; You&#39;re a savage after all, no matter how much you pretend otherwise. No matter of attire will hide your low birth.</p><p>Such a lady is unsuited to have servants and the like.</p><p>If you desire a familiar, let&#39;s see, I could give you a lizard from my garden, so promptly dismiss the servant you have now.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CNow you&#39;ve totally lost me, but... your Japanese is pretty good.</p><p>You have no more interest in Japanese culture than you would for bread scraps, and now this... what a curious turn of events.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AA-A lady may take up whatever pursuits she fancies! There is no deeper meaning to speak of...!</p><p>...Honestly, even bringing up such a conversation from two years ago.</p><p>Well, I suppose if there&#39;s one thing to praise you for, it&#39;s the tenacity to maintain your spiteful nature over all this time.\u300B</p><hr><p>The two of them continue their prickly argument back and forth.</p><p>It&#39;s got nothing to do with me, but why do I have a bad feeling about all this?</p><hr><p>\u300ASo. Why are you and Shero... no, Mister Emiya, with each other?</p><p>...I find this most displeasing.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s my line, Luviagelita.</p><p>How do you know Emiya-kun? It wasn&#39;t me who introduced you, was it?</p><p>......Also, what kind of pet name is &quot;Shero&quot;?\u201D</p><hr><p>A moment of silence.</p><p>The unidentified speaker gasps as if she were having a heart attack, and...</p><hr><p>\u300AY-Y-Y-You! You&#39;re still bringing that up!?</p><p>How cruel of you, Miss Tohsaka...! Even though we both agreed to forget that...!</p><p>Yes, I admit I bore you no ill will, but if I was ever in error, it was when we joined hands and jumped off the Tower of London. It was inevitable that I would end up with a nickname like &quot;Mary of July&quot;...!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u300AEnough already, if I could turn back time, I would!</p><p>How could someone like you be entrusted with that beloved chronicle of do-or-die memories! I&#39;m so stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Several loud bangs come from the other side of the phone.</p><p>They sound like gunshots, but I know they&#39;re Gandr.</p><p>No doubt about it. Whoever this is, she&#39;s clearly experienced.</p><hr><p>\u300AVery well, Miss Tohsaka. If this is your intention, I accept your challenge...!</p><p>I had intended to stand by until the casino owner appeared, but I&#39;m heading over there now! Don&#39;t bother Mister Emiya by saying anything unreasonable!</p><p>Oh, and because you were called Poppins of July, our reputation at the university is even, right?\u300B</p><hr><p>Disconnected.</p><p>Who was that just now?</p><p>Tohsaka seemed to know her, but I don&#39;t remember anyone like that.</p><p>And why was she at the Fujimura Group&#39;s place?</p><hr><p>\u201C......Hmm. Bit by bit, I&#39;m starting to get it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTohsaka. It&#39;s great that you understand, but now there&#39;s only one person left that we can call for help.\u201D</p><p>Next is Sakura&#39;s house. Even if Sakura&#39;s not in, Shinji might be. We might have a winner here.</p><hr><p>\u201CHello? Is this the Matou residence?\u201D</p><p>\u300AOh? Isn&#39;t this Shirou?\u300B</p><p>......Eh? Eeeeh? Eeeehhh!?</p><p>This voice... there&#39;s no mistake, it&#39;s Tohsaka Rin herself.</p><p>But the person in question is right next to me, clinging to me awkwardly.</p><hr><p>\u300AWhat is it this time?</p><p>It&#39;s been a little while since we last met, are you calling because you miss me, I wonder?\u300B</p><p>\u201CEh, ah, uh, that is, ah, what?\u201D</p><p>This is way more of a mystery than the previous calls.</p><hr><p>\u300AHehe\u2015\u2015\u2015Aww, you&#39;re so cute, Emiya-kun</p><p>To tell the truth, I was so worried about what you were doing, Emiya-kun, that I couldn&#39;t sleep\uFF5E\u300B</p><p>...It was definitely Tohsaka&#39;s voice coming over the telephone, but something about it was inconceivable.</p><p>As though it was... lovestruck.</p><p>It reminded me of lovers who shamelessly embrace each other in public.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, hello...?</p><p>Sorry, it&#39;s a little crowded in various ways over here...\u201D</p><p>\u300AHm, is it really that bad?</p><p>Aww, what would you ever do without me?</p><p>You end up calling me every time you&#39;re in a pinch\uFF5E\u300B</p><hr><p>Her sugary-sweet voice makes me wonder if she&#39;s gone mad. Actually, maybe I&#39;m the one going crazy here.</p><p>And, there&#39;s another <ruby>crisis<rt>Tohsaka</rt></ruby> next to me just waiting to happen.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tohsaka, just what&#39;s going on?</p><p>Somehow, I get the feeling I&#39;m calling a hopelessly different place...\u201D</p><p>Covering the receiver, I ask the Tohsaka next to me.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yeah. It&#39;s hard to believe, but if you make a call inside this box, it&#39;s like it connects to a <em>different place</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s because the chest was created using the parallel world-traveling Zelretch&#39;s Second Sorcery. It&#39;s not strange that something like this would happen.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHahaa, I get it now\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait, this is pointless, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>Even if we call a parallel dimension for assistance, with the exception of that sorcerer, Jewel Sage Zelretch, they won&#39;t be able to come over here.</p><p>Fuji-Nee, that girl from earlier, and this other Tohsaka are all of no use to us whatsoever.</p><p>It&#39;s useless, but the voice on the phone continues to talk without a care.</p><hr><p>\u300AOkay, I&#39;ll head over there right away.</p><p>Are you prepared?</p><p>;\uFF08\u52B9\u679C\u3000\u3042\u3063\u305F\u3089\u30AD\u30B9\u306E\u5507\u304C\u89E6\u308C\u308B\u97F3\uFF09<br> \u3000Since it&#39;s your request, I&#39;ll do anything you ask, my Emiya-kun \u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>As sweet as honey.</p><p>Did she just... kiss the receiver?</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, haha. Hahahaha.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What are you laughing at? Give that here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, I really think it&#39;d be better to hang up.\u201D</p><p>The <em>two</em> of you are existences which should never meet each other.</p><p>Just like a torch and gasoline.</p><hr><p>\u201CJust hand it over!</p><p>For some reason, I&#39;ve been getting major goosebumps this whole time!</p><p>I don&#39;t know who it is, but that woman is really getting on my nerves!\u201D</p><p>\u300AW\u2015\u2015\u2015What, was that a woman&#39;s voice just now!?</p><p>Wait, Shirou, what are you doing!?\u300B</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I can feel a fight about to break out.</p><p>And it&#39;s Tohsaka vs. Alternate Universe Tohsaka. Oh dear god.</p><p>...Ahh, I just want to cover my ears and curl up into a ball...</p><hr><p>\u201CGood afternoon, hello? Could this be Sakura?\u201D</p><p>That you could think that is a wee bit terrifying, Tohsaka-san.</p><p>Please hold back what you say a bit.</p><hr><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura?</p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. And likewise, who are you?\u300B</p><p>\u201CWho\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AAh, so that&#39;s it. I get it, is this the appearance of a thieving cat?</p><p>No wonder Emiya-kun was troubled. He was caught by some ill-natured woman and threatened into phoning me to sever our relationship. It&#39;s like that, right?\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re one to talk! This whole time you&#39;ve been going on like some nymphomaniac! It&#39;s embarrassing just listening to you!\u201D</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka is snarling at Tohsaka.</p><p>They both don&#39;t seem to realize they&#39;re talking to themselves. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a blessing or a disaster.</p><hr><p>\u201CI don&#39;t care who you are or where you are from, but sickly-sweet girls like you don&#39;t suit Emiya-kun!</p><p>What this idiot needs is someone who will stick with him through thick and thin, and guide him whenever he strays from the correct path... right, only something like a honor student that carries herself like a committee chairman!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGet it? A girl like you with pudding for brains can&#39;t measure up in the slightest.</p><p>If you understand, hang up and go repent at a convent for your life up to this point...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tohsaka.\u201D</p><p>Didn&#39;t you turn off the filter way too soon?</p><p>Or rather, maybe her intuition already figured out that she&#39;s speaking to herself.</p><hr><p>\u300A...I&#39;m shocked. Even if he made a mistake, I thought there would be some worthy points from a woman who caught Shirou by her wiles and yet, how disappointing.</p><p>&quot;Committee chairman?&quot; &quot;Through thick and thin?&quot;</p><p>The one who doesn&#39;t understand is you, Miss. You couldn&#39;t possibly take care of him with that little resolve...!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u300AListen, it even took me years to figure it out. I&#39;m really stubborn, you know?</p><p>Have you ever forged a blade? Relentless hammering will only produce something hard, yet brittle. At times, you have to handle your work delicately or the product won&#39;t be flexible. It&#39;s the same thing here.</p><p>Understand? Your ideas are too slow. Incredibly slow. It&#39;s like I&#39;m really talking to myself from three years ago. Don&#39;t be mad! Ohohohohoho!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...God, what did I do to deserve this?</p><hr><p>\u201CGrr...!</p><p>H-Hmph! Middle-aged women say the darndest things.</p><p>You must&#39;ve used some dirty means to seduce him, right? Shirou&#39;s a real idiot if he&#39;s gonna get taken in by a floozy like you.</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;ll make sure to beat some sense into him after this...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AHold it right there.</p><p>I don&#39;t care what you say about me, but saying that to Shirou is foul play.</p><p>After all, it sounds like he&#39;s over there with you. I won&#39;t forgive you if you break the prize after losing this argument.</p><p>...Got that? If you hurt my Emiya-kun, no matter where you hide, I will hunt you down and kill you.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Too much love can hurt.</p><p>Seriously, Parallel World Me. What the hell happened?</p><p>In what way? By what means? How did you get Tohsaka Rin to fall that madly in love with you...!?</p><hr><p>\u201CAl-Alright, if you say something like that, I can see that you&#39;re really serious for now.</p><p>...So you love him, but how should I put it, what&#39;s so good about him? Do you just have bad taste?</p><p>Emiya Shirou&#39;s quiet, unsociable idealism just doesn&#39;t understand how a woman&#39;s heart works. He&#39;s not that great of a catch. Seriously, why are you so into him?\u201D</p><hr><p>I want to object, but I&#39;ll probably just end up getting kicked, so I&#39;ll keep quiet for now.</p><hr><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><p>...Huh?</p><p>The other end fell silent.</p><p>Even though it was obvious the Tohsaka over here was pressing for a response.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey. Why are you so quiet? Give me some kind of rebuttal, you.\u201D</p><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><p>No response.</p><p>The Tohsaka on the other end is faintly laughing happily.</p><hr><p>\u201CH-Hmph, so it&#39;s not that much after all.</p><p>With Shirou&#39;s main points, even you-\u201D</p><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, I love everything about him.\u300B</p><p>They were only words, but they deeply rattled the Tohsaka over here.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Wha...\u201D</p><p>\u300AI told you, his oafishness, his thickheadeness, the way he blurts out whatever he thinks, his childish idealism, the way he ignores his wounds, all of it.</p><p>You should be more honest with yourself, too. Worded a different way, didn&#39;t you just admit that you love him in spite of all his faults?\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CWhaaa...!</p><p>Stop messing around! I seriously can&#39;t stand those things-\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300ASure, sure, we&#39;ll go with that.</p><p>But you know, Miss, I don&#39;t &quot;stick with him through thick and thin.&quot; I protect him when he struggles, lend him a hand when it really counts, and only see the best in him.</p><p>So I&#39;ll declare it now. Rather than becoming happy together, I will, with no questions asked, and more than anyone else, give him happiness.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CGah\u2015\u2015\u2015O-Of course, I already knew... n-no, I mean, why would I ever go through that much trouble for him!?</p><p>T-T-Too bad! I see your point, but I don&#39;t think Emiya-kun is someone who needs that much\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AIs that so? Then I&#39;ll do as I like.</p><p>You might think that, but to me he&#39;s the greatest partner I could ask for.</p><p>Say, isn&#39;t that right, Shirou? We&#39;d never be ashamed of our mutual love.</p><p>So, for that reeeason, reward me with a biiig kiss\uFF5E\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CFine, then! Take as many of him as you like!</p><p>Mutual love!? Greatest man!?</p><p>With such a naive person, you&#39;ll have nothing but trouble!</p><p>Hmph! Heroes and princes on white horses are just dreams! Drown in your ideals and die...!!!\u201D</p><hr><p>...Now she&#39;s done it...</p><p>In her emotional turmoil, Tohsaka might have activated her magic crest, or maybe it was just brute strength.</p><p>At any rate, the cellphone is now a magnificent piece of junk.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh. Mobile phones sure are fragile.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s... no, never mind.\u201D</p><p>Our hopes of calling for rescue were now dashed, but that was still preferable to continuing that conversation until the battery ran out.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, it doesn&#39;t matter too much because it had been useless, but... that woman just now sure was getting on my nerves.</p><p>Emiya-kun, was she an acquaintance of yours?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t know her. I&#39;ve never even seen her face.\u201D</p><p>Though I can easily imagine what it looks like.</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s okay then.</p><p>The one who was suckered in was that world&#39;s Emiya-kun, but be more careful after this.</p><p>That woman is a formidable opponent for you. No, your natural enemy.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. Got it, I&#39;ll bear that in mind.\u201D</p><p>I nod with many thoughts flowing through my mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CVery good. You&#39;re an honest one, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>I enthusiastically mean it as well.</p><p>After all, it was a warning from the person herself.</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever... now we&#39;re back to where we started.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible to use the cellphone to call for help...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI guess it&#39;s to be expected when relying on something useless.</p><p>There should still be another way. Let&#39;s use our brains.\u201D</p><hr><p>The tone she proposes that in sounds impatient for some reason.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>&quot;Still walled in on all sides,&quot; I grumble.</p><p>Inside this cramped yet boundless room,</p><p>&quot;just what are we really going to do?&quot; I worry while cradling my head in my palms.</p><hr><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-2-mimic-rin-lvl-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-2-mimic-rin-lvl-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 2 Mimic Rin Lvl 3</h3><hr><p>\u201C...............I&#39;m tired.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...............Aah, so exhausted.\u201D</p><hr><p>We sigh in unison.</p><p>...It&#39;s been two hours since we got in this box.</p><p>Any joy from being packed tightly together has been all but drowned out by the oppressive atmosphere of being sealed up.</p><hr><p>\u201C....................................\u201D</p><p>...Or maybe this indescribably oppressive atmosphere has more to do with the way Tohsaka is on top of me.</p><p>She&#39;s been frequently avoiding eye contact for awhile now, all while nervously tapping her pinky on her arm.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tohsaka. Should I, try moving a little more towards the corner?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? You don&#39;t really need to... wasn&#39;t this the best we could manage anyway?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat might be the case, but... didn&#39;t you say something like, these walls don&#39;t have a set boundary? Then, if we push our bodies apart as much as we can, we should be able to make more space...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh...? Ah, <em>no</em>, stop thrashing around!</p><p>For argument&#39;s sake, even if you&#39;re able to stretch out by doing that, won&#39;t the volume of the box stay the same? If you made some &quot;room&quot; for yourself, the balance of space in here would become absurd.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. But, are you okay with this, Tohsaka?</p><p>...It just, seems you&#39;ve been agitated for a while now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Everything&#39;s fine. Apart from being cramped up here, there&#39;s no reason for me to be agitated.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>When it comes to that, I wonder if there could even be any other reason to be irritated?</p><hr><p>...Another 30 minutes or so pass.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s appearance is becoming noticeably strange.</p><p>It seems the stress is piling up.</p><p>Even I&#39;m starting desperately to want to stretch out and, although it&#39;s not that hot or humid yet, the rising temperature inside the box is only increasing our anxiety.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, it&#39;s about 1 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, huh...? Are you alright, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I&#39;m alright...... not really.*</p><p>......You&#39;re pretty calm Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><p>I have no energy to reply.</p><p>...This is bad. I was optimistic that Saber or Sakura would come after an hour, but it looks like that isn&#39;t the case.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Alright.</p><p>Tohsaka. I want to try out something just one more time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat... do you mean?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLook, when I came into this room, you were rocking the chest, right?</p><p>That is, I saw that it was moving from outside.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat I&#39;m saying is, although the sound from inside the box was blocked off, it was moved and the sound of the box striking the floor could be heard.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Could you hurry up and tell me your conclusion?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s the opposite of what&#39;s normally done.</p><p>In other words, not trying to open the lid from the inside.</p><p>If we roll this chest and the lid catches on something, wouldn&#39;t it open from the outside\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;No good?&quot; I take a glance at Tohsaka&#39;s expression.</p><p>I thought she&#39;d be going on and on listing reasons to reject it, but...</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. Compared to relying on that, your way is...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? There&#39;s another way?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt, It&#39;s nothing!</p><p>We&#39;ll go with that, it&#39;s decided!\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s attitude shifted rather quickly. Suspicious.</p><p>The sense of unease and tension are enough to make me tilt my head to the side in doubt.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, whatever.</p><p>Alright, we&#39;ll roll it that way from the right side.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRoger\u2015\u2015\u2015Fuu...uuu!\u201D</p><p>Supporting myself with the box, I thrust my body.</p><p>I shift my center of gravity to match the movement, and the world tilts.</p><hr><p>\u201CUuuuu---......aaAAH!?\u201D</p><p>The chest started to roll.</p><p>Alright, this is good\u2015\u2015\u2015eh?</p><hr><p>\u201CNo waaay! Kyaa\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>Not good at all!</p><p>As we begin rolling the feeling of riding inside the confined box transforms into something unbearable...!</p><hr><p>\u201CYou touched me! Just now, your hand!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can&#39;t help it!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYaaah! Where are you putting your heeead!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI said I can&#39;t help iiit!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGaaah! Stop hitting meee!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve been having a nice experience so let me hit you once or twice!\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuwaah! That&#39;s already 3 hits, I&#39;m being oppresseeed!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COuchy...\u201D</p><p>\u201CH-Hey, are you okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I just cut the tip of my finger a little.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I can feel broken pieces of glass with sharp edges.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm... so they&#39;re broken?</p><p>I have to rebuild them again... Aaah, extra expenses...\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s glasses huh...? That&#39;s right, they&#39;d fallen off earlier.</p><p>And, even with all of that movement...</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015the lid is still closed.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo good... is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way...</p><p>Ugh, uuugh......\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka, perhaps from the shock of not being able to escape, lets out a groan.</p><p>With this, we&#39;ve exhausted all our options.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, then again... if a strange chest is lying around in the room, anyone who came over would probably notice it right away.</p><p>All we can do now is wait for someone to come\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, we don&#39;t have the time to be leaving this up to luck like that! We&#39;ve got a 30 minute limit!\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me with bloodshot eyes.</p><hr><p>...Somehow, it&#39;s a very precise time limit.</p><p>In half an hour... Is it because the 11th of October will have ended...? No, that can&#39;t be it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hm?\u201D</p><p>I start feeling around.</p><p>Because of its peculiar shape, I immediately know what it is.</p><p>That stick that grew wings.</p><p>Tohsaka was rather obsessed with it\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>Something&#39;s shining, but that&#39;s...</p><p>No mistaking it. It&#39;s the stick.</p><p>...If I think back on it, this stick is the reason we ended up like this in the first place.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...But, I wonder why it&#39;s glowing.</p><p>...Is it because we&#39;re inside of a dark box?</p><p>Such a red light without substance, this extremely ominous... er, rather, it seems trustworthy, yeah...</p><hr><p>\u201C! Stop, take your hand away from that, Shirou!\u201D</p><p>\u201Cheh!?\u201D</p><p>With Tohsaka&#39;s scolding, my senses return.</p><p>When looking at it, I was just one step away from picking up that stick.</p><hr><p>\u201C...That was close... Sorry, but it&#39;s that alone I just won&#39;t allow. Don&#39;t add to the number of our problems even more.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Whew,&quot; Tohsaka relaxes her shoulders.</p><p>On the other hand, the mysterious stick&#39;s radiance weakens with a &quot;tch.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Suspicious.</p><p>I thought it was just a toy just a little while ago, but now it&#39;s just way too damn suspicious.</p><p>...It&#39;s like an amazing magical energy is emanating from it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tohsaka. What&#39;s with that stick?</p><p>Is it a cursed item or something?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...<em>sigh</em> That&#39;s right, if we&#39;ve come this far, it could be bad to not tell you.</p><p>...Though I didn&#39;t want to say too much, this stick is called the Kaleidostick.</p><p>Just like this box, it&#39;s a Mystic Code created by Zelretch. It&#39;s something like a magic booster that supplies vast amounts of magical energy to the user that contracted with it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CZelretch again...? Huh, about that, does that stick use the Second Sorcery as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................Well, yeah, although it&#39;s kind of like that...\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s not speaking clearly.</p><p>So even Tohsaka doesn&#39;t know about this Kaleidostick thing&#39;s true nature? But still...</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, how come you&#39;ve been handling it like some sort of hazardous substance?</p><p>Ah, well, though it does have an amazing magical energy and I only get an <em>unpleasant</em> feeling from looking at it, so it&#39;s obviously a curse-type.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...This thing caused me some grief a while back.</p><p>Since then, I&#39;ve been careful never to activate it, but... what a blunder. Because I shed some blood earlier, it seems like it&#39;s awoken.</p><p>Hey. How long are you going to pretend to be asleep, you defective spirit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What?\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka glares at the stick giving off that dull red light.</p><p>The Kaleidostick flashes on and off as if giggling, and...</p><hr><p>\u300AFu\u2015\u2015\u2015fufufu, that&#39;s impressive, Rin-san!</p><p>It&#39;s only been 6 years, and you&#39;ve (annoyingly) grown up nicely! Ruby-chan is impressed!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh?\u201D</p><p>Somehow cheerful yet mischievous, adult yet girlish, the voice of a girl who&#39;d look good in an apron resounded inside my head.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You haven&#39;t changed at all, have you? I&#39;d have thought you&#39;d have reflected on your behavior a little after six years coated in dust, and yet...\u201D</p><p>\u300ANo no, worry not. I - have done plenty of reflecting.</p><p>From now on, I won&#39;t do anything outrageous to frighten my owner and make them run away. Yes, once the contract has been agreed to I&#39;ll follow you until (your) death!\u300B</p><hr><p>The rumbling Kaleidostick praises it&#39;s high spirits and reliability.</p><p>The words sound German, but the meaning came across as though clear Japanese. How strange.</p><p>\u201C......Actually, all of this is strange.</p><p>Tohsaka, I feel like, this stick is talking to me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt is talking. This talking stick is the real deal.\u201D</p><p>\u300AOh my, how rude of me.</p><p>Nice to meet you Shirou-san. I am the artificial airhead spirit acting as the Kaleidostick&#39;s function, pointer, feelings, etc. My name is Magical Ruby.</p><p>If you would, please be more familiar and call me Ruby \u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C..................Sure. Thank you for your consideration.\u201D</p><p>...Now then.</p><p>I&#39;m often susceptible to the deception of a sweet voice, but this thing is <em>dangerous</em>. An unrivalled-type of character, artificial and yet airheaded, the magical energy it&#39;s emitting is like poisonous radiation.</p><p>In the first place, there&#39;s no honest person in this world with &quot;Magical&quot; in their name...!</p><hr><p>\u201CFamiliar shmamiliar, I&#39;m never going to use you. Give it up and hurry back to sleep already.</p><p>Spilling blood on you earlier was an accident.</p><p>Even if you were to stay locked up in this box for your entire life, it&#39;s because I have no intention of making a contract with you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300ARight, then it&#39;s settled.</p><p>I understand Rin-san&#39;s order.\u300B</p><p>The Kaleidostick shines as if smiling sweetly.</p><p>...What&#39;s this, does it actually understand?</p><hr><p>\u300AThen, with negotiations over, let jump right to the resolution!</p><p>Hurry hurry, make a contract with me please.</p><p>With the two of you in a pinch like this, there&#39;s no way I can just calmly go back to sleeeep!\u300B</p><p>I take that back.</p><p>Not even in the slightest was such a conclusion reached in that conversation.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see your listening function is in the same state as always, you stupid stick... fine. I, will <em>neeeever</em>, ever make a contract with you again.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hmph,&quot; Tohsaka turns her face away.</p><p>Ah, rejected.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, leaving that aside. Tohsaka, you said something about &quot;again&quot;?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I made a contract with it once before.</p><p>An error of my youth. After my father died, I discovered it when I was putting his belongings in order. The instructions were there as well, and I wondered what would happen if I tried to make a contract...\u201D</p><p>\u201C...When you tried to make a contract, what happened?</p><p>Don&#39;t tell me your body was hijacked or something...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, actually, I don&#39;t remember anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t remember?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight. When I regained consciousness, I was collapsed in my room, the stick was put away in the box, and there was just a note in my own handwriting that said, &quot;Never use that stupid stick again.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t remember anything from when you used the stick until you put it away...? So then, was there any real harm done?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...No clue about that. However, my casual friends decreased in number after that day.</p><p>...Well, since I was an honor student, people were always at a distance. But then they would run away with a look of terror, or rather, amazement in their eyes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>What happened in those missing few hours?</p><p>The only ones who know the truth are Tohsaka&#39;s friends at the time, and this stick.</p><p>\u201C...I see... Anyway, having nothing to do with it would have been better, right?\u201D</p><p>Because <em>that</em> is, without a doubt, a cursed item.</p><hr><p>\u300AThat&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s a misunderstanding, Shirou-san!</p><p>Rin losing friends was her own fault. I was in no way responsible!\u300B</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s more than just a misunderstanding.</p><p>If you&#39;re claiming innocence, then reveal what you did to me and what happened on that day.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300A&quot;What&quot; you ask? Didn&#39;t Rin-san merely go into town and appear onstage at the park where everyone had gathered?</p><p>Like an idol from the eighties. &quot;Everyooone, thank you for coming to see me todaaay!&quot; Kind of like that.</p><p>Everyone was totally weirded out, but Rin-san was happily smiling from beginning to end \u300B</p><hr><p>\u201C.........\u201D</p><p>What&#39;s that? Compared to what I was imagining, that&#39;s rather pitiful mental trauma.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes, I know that. I caught one of the kids that ran away. The question is why. Why did I do something like that?\u201D</p><p>\u300AAh, I would think the reason for that is obvious.</p><p>Rin-san used me to transform into a &quot;Rin who is good at singing.&quot;\u300B</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AYes. The Rin-san of that day was adorable.</p><p>During the music, she hiccuped at the best moment, was laughed at, and felt sad.</p><p>&quot;Because I must be the best at that song,&quot; she said. I was moved by the sight of her practicing while crying. I just had to toy with this amusing girl, er, I mean I felt like becoming her strength.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CT-The details don&#39;t matter!</p><p>W-What&#39;s with that terrifying phrase you said? Transformed into a &quot;me who is good at singing&quot;!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300ABecause, a transformation is a transformation.</p><p>I&#39;m the Kaleidostick; the happy, one of a kind Mystic Code created by the parallel world traveling Zelretch!</p><p>Shall we call that ability Prism Trance?</p><p>Allowing Rin-san, the user, to change her skills to that of another Rin-san, I&#39;m a lyrical item of nightmares!\u300B</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>This Tohsaka, with the skills of another Tohsaka... wait, what?</p><hr><p>\u201C...No way. Then, when you said transformation you were serious!?\u201D</p><p>\u300AFuufuufu. As expected of the head of the Tohsaka house, you understood my explanation well. Ruby-chan is surprised. Though the truth is I wanted to leave it a mystery. Tehe.\u300B</p><hr><p>The voice from the Kaleidostick, no, Magical Ruby... gave an image somewhat like... a defeated smile.</p><p>It keeps repeating itself, but its voice was just devastatingly cute.</p><hr><p>\u201C...No, don&#39;t be fooled.</p><p>Hey, Tohsaka. What did all that mean just now?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Like it said, a transformation.</p><p>It&#39;s difficult to believe, but this stick... The Kaleidostick is an item that transforms its owner.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor example, say I am going to make some delicious black tea. However I can&#39;t make black tea very well.</p><p>At that time, all I have to do is wave that stick once and presto.</p><p>I become the &quot;Tohsaka Rin who is an expert at making black tea&quot; who exists in a parallel world, and become able to make delicious black tea.</p><p>Or rather, it&#39;s that the skills are only being temporarily borrowed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see... it just downloads the necessary abilities... right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C? Down load?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AYes. Setting aside the out-dated Rin-san, Shirou-san has it right.</p><p>This world&#39;s Rin-san is an anachronism, but a high-tech Rin-san might exist in a parallel world.</p><p>I fetch that high-tech Rin-san&#39;s exterior, and dress up the Rin-san over here with it.</p><p>The result: Rin-san becomes an electronics expert in less than one second, yes.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CWow, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><p>Incredible.</p><p>That means, by calling out Tohsaka&#39;s various &quot;what-ifs,&quot; she can become a specialist in anything!?</p><hr><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015However. Regarding this, there are several standard operating procedures.</p><p>An imitation must first begin with its <em>form</em>.</p><p>When she used Prism Trance, Rin-san&#39;s attire became that which is <em>appropriate for her form</em>.\u300B</p><hr><p>\u300AAnd yet, for some reason everyone disliked it. Thanks to that, in the past, present and future, I will only have two masters.\u300B</p><p>Magical Ruby sobs, hiding her tears with her kimono&#39;s sleeve.</p><p>Well not really, but the kimono is a persistent image.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat? Just that by itself shouldn&#39;t be enough to even bother anyone.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Y-You don&#39;t mean that you...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AYes. Like I said, the appropriate costume.</p><p>If you wanted to make delicious tea, it would be a maid&#39;s outfit.</p><p>If you wanted to be an amphibious Tohsaka Rin, it would be a school swimsuit.</p><p>And so, when poor you wanted to be good at singing, I was pleased to provide an over the top Goth Loli outfit!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CPff...!\u201D</p><p>I-In other words, that&#39;s unmistakeably a Magical Girl...!!</p><hr><p>\u300AAh, by the way, the words she shouted to activate the transformation were the most embarrassing choice at the time</p><p>Oh dear me, at that point everyone in the park went ghastly pale.\u300B</p><p>\u201CY-You stupid stick! That was what reset my entire network of friends----!\u201D</p><hr><p>...The terrible truth is now revealed.</p><p>An item that makes use of the Second Sorcery, the true identity of the magic stick that grants the wishes of young girls, it was truly a costume box for both the mind and body.</p><p>Yeah, never before has it been so easy to spot the appearance of dark magic.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, that&#39;s the reason no-one wants to make a contract.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnyway, let&#39;s think about other methods now.</p><p>Let&#39;s regroup, change our mindset, and completely ignore any noisy distraction.\u201D</p><p>\u300AEeeh. How meeean. Make a contract with me, Rin-san. Since the <ruby>blood-drawing<rt>Registration</rt></ruby> is already done, all that&#39;s left is to say a single word of agreement\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CGood. Ignore it completely, Emiya-kun.</p><p>It might be a Mystic Code of the Second Sorcery, but something like having completed a temporary registration with my blood doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>As long as I don&#39;t touch it, it will turn itself off given time, then it&#39;s good-bye. Such a dangerous item should be sealed at the bottom of this box for all eternity.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300ANo waaay. Uuu, such cruel treatment... I just, even though I just want to fight for justice alongside Rin-san...\u300B</p><p>The stick cries in anguish.</p><p>...As Tohsaka said, it seems that if we keep ignoring it, the stick will go back to how it originally was.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Even then, doesn&#39;t this seem just a bit pitiful?</p><p>Tohsaka, if it&#39;s just used to get us outside, shouldn&#39;t that much be fine?\u201D</p><p>And also, I feel an affinity with the phrase, &quot;fight for justice.&quot;</p><p>\u300A!\u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re too soft! If we let this stupid stick out, someone could make a contract with it!</p><p>Or what? Is a pervert calling herself a magical girl appearing in Fuyuki city one day okay with you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C.................., Um.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s a difficult question.</p><p>...Hey, I&#39;m a guy.

A slightly precocious fairy?</p><p>An elegant spirit who guides young girls? A transforming, combining giant robot?</p><p>And so on and so forth.

Even though I invited you here because you have things which resonate with me.\u300B</p><p>\u201C...Things that resonate with you?\u201D</p><p>I tried to make the question sound as cold as I could.</p><hr><p>\u300AOh come now Shirou-san, asking when you already know</p><p>Shirou-san is an ally of justice, I am a magical girl of justice.</p><p>See, we&#39;re both justice loving people.</p><p>Soooooo, work together with me and produce a magical girl of justice from the depraved monster that Tohsaka Rin-san currently is!

I mean, it let its true intentions slip out!</p><p>I&#39;m not sure whether Zelretch realized how bad this thing was and hastily added it as a feature, or whether it&#39;s because we&#39;re talking via telepathy, but Ruby can&#39;t conceal her motives. I can hear them perfectly through the brackets.</p><hr><p>\u300ACome now, there&#39;s no time to be indecisive! As a comrade who loves justice the same as I, please give me your answer!</p><p>Ruby-chan believes we can become friends, Shirou-san...!\u300B</p><p>\u201C...Got it, but for argument&#39;s sake, what is this &quot;Love and Justice&quot;? If that&#39;s even what you&#39;re <em>really</em> talking about.</p><p>So Ruby, what is &quot;Justice&quot; to you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AYes? Hmm, let&#39;s see\u30FC</p><p>Equality in the world, things that are interesting and funny (at least to me), right?\u300B</p><p>\u201C......Then, according to Ruby, what is &quot;Evil&quot;?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u300AAhaha, stop it, Shirou-san.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it obvious that the things that oppose me are &quot;Evil&quot;?\u300B</p><p>\u201CWha...!\u201D</p><p>T-This thing actually thinks it&#39;s okay to not keep that sort of statement to itself---!!?</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, our conversation is over.

I thought you were a fellow ally of justice. We could have been friends Shirou-san, and yet... it&#39;s already too late!</p><p>Right now, Rin-san is receiving (by force) an understanding of the wonderfulness of justice. The contract will be complete in mere seconds!</p><p>Ah, I&#39;ve said it before, but the contract can&#39;t be canceled.</p><p>If my contract is almost curse-like, it&#39;s because it&#39;s in old Zelretch&#39;s handwriting \u300B</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh...!\u201D</p><p>Bastard, if the circumstances become bad you&#39;ll just revoke it...!</p><p>But don&#39;t underestimate me, I haven&#39;t been getting caught up in strange situations like this just for show...!</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Here goes...\u201D</p><p>I slam my hands onto the ground and look up toward the sky with all my might.</p><p>When you&#39;re in a nightmare, the quickest and easiest way to deal with it isn&#39;t to escape from the world, it&#39;s deciding to annihilate yourself!</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015, Tohsaka!\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m pulled back from the nightmare.</p><p>Tohsaka was\u2015\u2015\u2015as expected, still enduring...!</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka, hand me the stick...!\u201D</p><p>I grab the stick from Tohsaka&#39;s hands... or not!?</p><p>\u201CGhh...!\u201D</p><p>The Kaleidostick flashes.</p><p>\u300AFufufu, the <ruby>curse<rt>contract</rt></ruby> is complete!\u300B</p><p>\u201CDamn, I didn&#39;t make it in time...!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, there&#39;s no problem, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Magical Ruby is the Spirit of Justice.

If there were a hundred people here, one hundred people&#39;s eyes would be popping, that was unmistakably a Magical Girl...!</p><hr><p>\u201CHu...h... ah...haha, ha...\u201D</p><p>With the <ruby>persuasion<rt>brainwashing</rt></ruby> removed, Tohsaka had regained the ability to think properly, and was trembling.</p><p>Her behavior just now, mixed with her current appearance and the recollection of that unpleasant experience\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201C..................Fine, just laugh!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPfft, kuhahahahaha!*</p><p>What&#39;s with that, Tohsaka, that&#39;s, ahahahahahaha!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...heh. As expected, Ayako, no mercy... fufu, ahaha......\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTohsaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? You want to laugh as well?</p><p>Go ahead and laugh.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that a performance for the cultural festival?</p><p>However, the student council hasn&#39;t received an application for approval stating 3A will do a play...\u201D</p><p>...Issei was calm as always.</p><p>Always nice to people, and today even nice to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, that was cute Tohsaka, it&#39;s the best!</p><p>To prepare something like that for the cultural festival, you&#39;re really into this! Ahahahaha.\u201D</p><p>Despite being a close friend, Mitsuzuri was laughing so hard she was having trouble breathing.</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, cultural festival...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, that&#39;s why we&#39;re here after all...\u201D</p><p>A small mercy.</p><p>It seems we were able to narrowly avoid the &quot;Tohsaka Rin is a magical girl&quot; theory.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou were having a fitting session together... I&#39;m going to have to question you about that later, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Two people coming out of that tiny box is quite the magic trick, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m amazed.&quot; Issei&#39;s eyes brighten up.</p><p>He may be on bad terms with Tohsaka, but Issei praises the feat for what it is.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, aiming to get miss Homurabara for the third year running with this clever scheme was something even I hadn&#39;t predicted.</p><p>Aww you&#39;re so cute. Ahaha, totally adorable!\u201D</p><p>\u201CErr\u2015\u2015\u2015yeah... winning the same way... every year... won&#39;t be... interesting... right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIndeed, up until now I have insinuated you were sly fox and feigning modesty among other things, I apologize.</p><p>To abandon your honor student image in order to liven up the cultural festival... Tohsaka, even though you&#39;re my adversary, I&#39;ll admit that&#39;s an approach not to be trifled with.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, looks like this year&#39;s going to be interesting.</p><p>And Matou&#39;s popularity has been rising in the past half year, might there even be a major upset?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha, hahahaha, hahahahahahahahahahahaha...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm, is Sakura really that popular?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Now that&#39;s inexcusable. Whose side are you on Emiya, Sakura&#39;s or Tohsaka&#39;s?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...eh!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMatou is an important junior to me, after all.</p><p>From a neutral standpoint, I can&#39;t let you favor just Tohsaka.</p><p>In the spirit of being fair, you have to tell Matou about your preferences. Well, I guess it&#39;ll be difficult no matter how hard she tries. I mean, it&#39;s a magical girl, a Magical Girl! That&#39;s great, I want to try being one too!\u201D</p><hr><p>The bad times for my heart continue.</p><p>Mitsuzuri laughs and Issei continues heaping on the praise.</p><p>In the end, unable to get changed until the two of them went home, Tohsaka had to deal with the arrangements for the cultural festival as Kaleido-Ruby.</p><p>...Naturally, in the flow of that discussion, she became obligated to participate in the Miss Homurabara contest looking like that.</p><hr><p>\u201CSeems the two of them finally went back.</p><p>Well then, I guess the trouble over that box is finally settled.\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m clearing off the table for Tohsaka, who hasn&#39;t moved for quite a while.</p><hr><p>\u201C? Heeey, Tohsakaaa.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it alright? Everything&#39;s been settled. More importantly, what happened in the box was\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I blame you. I blame you anyway. Because it&#39;s all your fault, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGeh.\u201D</p><hr><p>Nothing was settled at all.</p><p>Despite escaping the box and finally getting free of Issei and Mitsuzuri, Tohsaka is still trembling.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...I&#39;m worried.</p><p>Was it really that hard for her after all?</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm. But, it&#39;s not fair to say it was entirely my fault.</p><p>After all, I really put a lot into trying to rescue you from Magical Ruby, and yet...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CF-Fine then, just let me at least say that much!</p><p>If you hadn&#39;t said stupid things or picked up that stupid stick in the first place...!</p><p>You stupid combo! Double Mascots! Aah geez, contracting with that screws up my life!\u201D</p><hr><p>...So that&#39;s how it was.</p><p>The greatest victim was surely Tohsaka.</p><p>I, who couldn&#39;t help her even though I was by her side, should at least let her use me as an outlet and properly listen to her complaints.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Sorry, if I were a bit more reliable, something like that wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p><p>...Yeah. Let&#39;s look for a way to cancel the contract with the stick together.\u201D</p><p>I clasp her hand.</p><p>\u201CLeaving that aside, Toksaka, will you be okay without going to the bathroom?\u201D</p><p>See, you look like you&#39;re in pain, and haven&#39;t you&#39;ve been trembling for a while?</p><hr><p>\u201CAhahahahaha!</p><p>Why you... back in the box once more! Stupid Shirooooou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Why----!!!!?\u201D</p><hr><p>I take a magnificent fall.</p><p>Back inside the box again, I close my eyes as I hit the back of my head with a thud once more, and...</p><p>\u201CKyaa...!?\u201D</p><p>Somehow, I bumped into something soft.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh?\u201D</p><p>Just now, that was undoubtedly a person&#39;s voice.</p><p>While thinking that nobody could be here anymore, the back of my mind tells me that the <ruby>concepts<rt>rules</rt></ruby> of time aren&#39;t known to this box. I just accept that.</p><p>Assaulted by a bad feeling, I timidly turned around.</p><p>Hm?</p><hr><p>\u201C......Just who would you be?\u201D</p><p>Right there, is the figure of an unknown lady dressed in blue, holding the Kaleidostick.</p><hr><p>...The storm continues.</p><p>The trouble surrounding the box has not yet ended...</p><hr>', 1521);
