An arrow of death that leads one to boiling/evaporation/extinction. Tomoe changes her Magical Energy into heat, giving the arrow nocked to her bow flames, before shooting it violently at her enemy. The arrow itself is something ordinary (although they are shot at the speed of sound), but the arrow\u2019s power is increased due to the flames bestowed to it. Something falsely similar to Magical Burst. Although the biggest difference is that it can be used for ranged attacks.</p><p>Tomoe does not hesitate in saying that this paranormal ability is \u201CSomething caused by the great power of Lord Yoshinaka, who was called the Shogun of Asahi\u201D, but it appears likely that the reason is due to her oni blood being strongly expressed, an ability of which she possessed since her lifetime.</p><p>If she feels like doing it, Tomoe can bestow flames to her naginata as well.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronouns: Tomoe / watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females] / \u25CB\u25CB-dono / \u25CB\u25CB-sama<br> Third Person Pronouns: ano kata / kare / kanojo</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A female warrior who is gallant, while simultaneously, a graceful good wife maiden. Tomoe should be strongly possessing a savage disposition due to being a \u201Cmixed-blood\u201D descendant of the \u201COni Kind\u201D, but she is able to contain that because of her feelings towards her beloved Kiso no Yoshinaka, thus she has acquired an individuality as a peaceful human woman (or so it appears).</p><p>In times where there is no combat, Tomoe is a maiden who quietly obeys her master, while simultaneously, she shows a somewhat poorly informed behaviour about human common sense. Even when she has acquired knowledge of the modern era from the Holy Grail, it is too much information for her to the point that she cannot personally experience those. But if it is the battlefield, she will immediately be in high spirits as a female warrior, trampling down the enemy army while her red eyes are shining.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Although Tomoe often speaks of Yoshinaka\u2019s name, she will never wish to the Holy Grail for his revival. Yoshinaka has already died. She too has already died. The dead are the dead. They should naturally not be brought back to the world.</p><p>Tomoe Gozen\u2019s opinion on life and death is clear. As a temporary guest called a Servant, she believes and does not doubt that she should quietly vanish from this world sooner or later. Even in \u201CThe Absolute Demonic Beast Frontline \u2013 Babylonia\u201D, she did not hesitate in choosing to strike the enemy general Girtablilu to simultaneously kill each other.</p><p>But secretly, and modestly\u2026 Tomoe constantly thinks about wanting to meet Yoshinaka again some time in the distant afterlife, even if for just a moment. And if possible, she would like that moment to also include her son, Asahina Yoshihide\u2026 (It is not a wish of hers, but memories she is reminiscing about.)</p><p>Summoned in Chaldea, Tomoe has decided to calmly watch over the future of her new lord (Master) who she is serving as a Servant.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI am called Tomoe.

A figure of the Late Heian Period/Early Kamakura Period. The favourite concubine of the great commander, Kiso no Yoshinaka (Minamoto no Yoshinaka), who was defeated by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the one who also acquired the rank of Sei-i Taishogun. A heroine who always acts in accordance with Yoshinaka and frequently accomplished merits of war. Tomoe Gozen is the daughter of Nakahara Kanetou, as well as the younger sister of Higuchi Kamemitsu and Imai Kanehira, whom were both said to be part of Kiso\u2019s Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p>According to \u201CKiso\u2019s Last Moments\u201D, the 9th volume of \u201CHeike Monogatari\u201D \u2013 Kakuichi Text Edition, Tomoe was portrayed as \u201Cespecially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman, she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot.\u201D That is surely Tomoe Gozen, a beautiful woman of fair skin and long hair, and an archer and mighty warrior with an outstanding face and figure who wields a heavy-draw-weight bow.</p><p>There is also an anecdote where Tomoe twisted the head of Onda no Hachirou Moroshige \u2013 a warrior of an enemy army known for his immense physical strength \u2013 off his body. (\u201CThirty riders came into view, led by Onda no Hachirou Moroshige, a man renowned in Musashi province for his great strength. Tomoe galloped into their midst, rode up against Onda no Hachirou, seized him in a powerful grip, pulled him down against the pommel of her saddle, held him motionless, twisted off his head, and threw it away.\u201D)</p><p>In the first year of the Genryaku era (the year 1184), at the time when the military force of Minamoto no Yoshitsune \u2013 who received orders from Yoritomo to attack \u2013 drew near, Tomoe diligently made a name for herself together with Yoshinaka in the defensive battle against Yoshitsune, but later being persuaded by Yoshinaka, Tomoe withdrew from the frontlines. Afterwards, Yoshinaka lost his life and Tomoe ran away to Kiso.</p><p>According to the \u201CGenpei Jousuiki\u201D, it is said that Tomoe later became Wada Yoshimori\u2019s wife and gave birth to Asahina Yoshihide, and she soon became a nun after that\u2026 but because there is quite an inconsistency when taking into account Yoshihide\u2019s birth year (if calculating backwards based on an account of the \u201CAzuma Kagami\u201D, it would be the year 1176), it is also rumoured that Asahina Yoshihide is the child between Tomoe and Kiso no Yoshinaka.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Even if Tomoe continued to have feelings for her lord Yoshinaka, she was not able to be together with him during his last moments\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014A female warrior who continues to keep this one regret to herself within her chest. In the \u201CSeven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Blademasters\u201D volume, that calm sadness was transformed into a flame of anger by Ashiya Douman, changing Tomoe into a wonder of savage flames who displayed the act of burning Sagami province into ashes. She was originally a graceful maiden. One who disliked quarrels between people and prefers the beauty of nature.</p><p>Those red eyes of hers may be evidence of a mixed-race heritage between a human and an oni (an oni of the unabashed type), which are now an extinct species in the modern era. Tomoe possesses the \u201CMadness Enhancement\u201D Skill at a low rank while being an Archer. Even if it is not significant enough to cause her reasoning to disappear, her physical ability still has improved, allowing her to show a ferocious battle style.</p><p>Tomoe likes games. She prefers video games as well as analog games. It appears her interest is particularly drawn to things that have to do with battles.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Tomoe was summoned by a Sorcerer in the \u201CSeven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Blademasters\u201D, materializing as Archer Inferno, one of the Seven Heroic Spirit Blademasters. She stood in the way of the Protagonist and Miyamoto Musashi. For the Tomoe Gozen summoned in Chaldea, she held no records/memories whatsoever of that time. She is essentially a different person.</p><p>However, concerning the Pruning Phenomenon event in Shimousa, Tomoe is already aware of it by inspecting Chaldea\u2019s database. Immediately following her inspection, it seems she visited several people involved in the event and bowed her head in apology, saying \u201CEven if that woman is said to be a different shadow, she is still someone who concealed the same soul as this Tomoe\u2019s. At that time, Inferno has caused you great trouble.\u201D</p><h2 id="extra-info-from-in-game-profile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extra-info-from-in-game-profile" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Extra Info from In-Game Profile</h2><p>(Usually Bond 6, or story clear bond, etc)</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>(...)</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou Tokisada</strong></p><p>\u201CAt that time\u2026 huh?

However\u2026 because I had difficulties in getting everything about that concept going in that direction, I also got advice from Mr. Takeuchi, so I even added lightweight components like in her First and Third Ascensions while staying in that direction. As far as weapons are concerned, she is an Archer, but I got filled with the image where it seems warriors of that era can handle anything. I never thought she would clutch a game controller as well\u2026 In addition, by no means was I satisfied with my own abilities, so even in spite of submitting the Ascension drawings, I got to draw everything over again in order to improve her design and so forth, having changed things again and again, and she became a character I have an emotional attachment for as a result.
