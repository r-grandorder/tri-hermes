I keep waiting and waiting, but Mash hasn&#39;t come back yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I asked her to grab something from storage for me,<br> but I wonder if something happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, Romani, where are the dumplings?<br> I&#39;m about to show footage of the moon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry up and hit the booze.<br> After all, we&#39;ve been holding out for this day.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmph, yeah right. That&#39;s what you say,<br> but you&#39;ve already started drinking like a fish, you lout...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a little while longer, Da Vinci.<br> Not all the staff members are here yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Alcohol?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dumplings?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Fujimaru, didn&#39;t you hear? The outdoor calendar shows it&#39;s almost the end of summer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Meaning it&#39;s almost time for the Moon Festival.<br> It&#39;s said the harvest moon shall liven up conversations between friends.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The date isn&#39;t exactly right, but as long as there&#39;s a beautiful full moon in the night sky, it&#39;s perfect for the Moon Festival.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s not a lot to do for fun in Chaldea, so I prepared this thinking we could use a break, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mash hasn&#39;t come back yet.<br> She was getting the dumplings from food storage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She said, \u201CI&#39;m powerful now that I&#39;ve become a Demi-Servant, so leave it to me.\u201D Then she took off on her own...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this.<br> Fujimaru, go see what&#39;s up\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The alarm? What&#39;s going on?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is serious, Doctor!<br> Someone has raided our food storage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As well as the offerings we prepared for the festival and everything else... Chaldea&#39;s food reserves are nearly down to zero!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah. Good morning.<br> I&#39;m happy to see you&#39;re as healthy as ever.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is this the place for that kind of conversation?<br> I&#39;m impressed by how much you trust each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That aside, those glasses really look good on you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah... Thank you.<br> My eyes are good so I don&#39;t really need them, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, look around you.<br> This is supposed to be a tense scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, this is not the time to discuss that.<br> Somebody raided our food storage. Who could it be?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The thing is... None of the surveillance cameras picked up anything... They&#39;re not broken, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s like all of the recorded footage has been painted over with a heart mark, so we can&#39;t see anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The analysis team in the monitor room said...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CWhen we watched the footage, we got dizzy and fell unconscious, one right after the other...\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...<br> I see. This is a real pickle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A pickle?!<br> Leonardo, have you gone bonkers, too?!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, pardon me. I was just having a bit of fun.<br> But anyway, Romani, take a look at this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Three minutes ago, someone Rayshifted to France.<br> That must&#39;ve been the cause of the alarm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift... With no authorization, and solo?<br> You&#39;re saying the culprit escaped by Rayshifting?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t imagine a Servant capable of something like that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good point.<br> Right now, Chaldea doesn&#39;t exist in normal dimension.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The only ones who can go outside are Master Fujimaru and contracted Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> On the other hand, a Contracted Servant can do evil deeds.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But only special and extremely powerful Heroic Spirits could bend the rules of time and space.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, did you make a contract with such a powerful Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are no records of it, as far as I know...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, but the order of cause and effect would be opposite, you see?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking about a Heroic Spirit that could bend time and space, and stretch the string of possibility for \u201Ceventually forming a contract\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> into the \u201Ceventual outcome of a contract.\u201D<br> It would be an incredibly powerful Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...If it finds the coordinates of Chaldea using nonsensical means like that, that&#39;s incredible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But... I see,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> if the culprit here is a Heroic Spirit who&#39;s willing to form a contract with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then the damage we suffer wouldn&#39;t be critical.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Because whatever the future, Fujimaru wouldn&#39;t form a contract with an outright villain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Doctor.<br> The problem is that we don&#39;t have any food left.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this rate, Senpai&#39;s health management and tea time after a Grail expedition can&#39;t be guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As the Master&#39;s Servant, I propose we take measures quickly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-yeah, I guess this is not the time to be thinking, \u201CIf we&#39;re out of sweet dumplings, we can just have sweet bean paste instead.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru.<br> For the sake of Chaldea&#39;s future,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> and our fun Moon Festival, would you go check out the situation for us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes I&#39;ll go, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I knew I could count on you.<br> That&#39;s why you&#39;re the Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You really like sweet bean paste, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, of course. Sugar is indispensable to someone who works with his brain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, I was more of a pancake guy, but I got addicted to it when I went to Japan. Hahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Doctor, please prepare for the Rayshift.<br> I&#39;ll get every last sweet dumpling back!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (The culprit must be a Divine Spirit-class Servant that can Rayshift by itself...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Well, some things are better left unsaid!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift is complete.<br> This is\u2014the France we&#39;re familiar with, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The one who raided Chaldea&#39;s storage is here\u2014?<br> Huh? I hear something being fired nearby...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Oh my. What do we have here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master.<br> There&#39;s a woman in strange clothes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s holding a bow in an improper posture,<br> firing not so effective arrows, and\u2014</p><p><strong>Werebeast:</strong><br> Ghraaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s fighting a pack of werewolves!<br> What&#39;s going on here?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, but let&#39;s help her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For now, let&#39;s fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Oh my! Are you here to give me a hand, stranger?<br> Hehe, aren&#39;t you a decisive one?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> I will take up on your kind offer. Let&#39;s fight together.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> We can leave the fun conversation for after the battle.<br> Right now, let&#39;s take out these bandits!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Combat complete.<br> But, I still sense enemies nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, let me know the status of the surrounding\u2014<br> Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bad connection?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seems like it... We can perform a Rayshift to return to Chaldea from here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Think Roman&#39;s slacking?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?<br> The doctor&#39;s being lazy, you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can assure you that is not the case.<br> Dr. Roman isn&#39;t the type to slack off at his job.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The more pressing concern is this woman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Excuse me. You&#39;re not a normal human, are you?<br> Are you...a Servant?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Hmm? Am I a Servant?<br> Oh, you mean a Heroic Spirit! I know all about them!</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Indeed! I am a Servant!<br> The splendid hunter forever seen in the night sky\u2014</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> My name is Orion! That&#39;s me!<br> Round of applause, please!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You heard her, Senpai.<br> What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Clap, clap, clap.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hehe. Thanks for the applause.<br> I don&#39;t know who you are, but I think we can be friends\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t Orion a guy?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Truth is stranger than fiction, you know.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> They say that Orion was a fast-talking, no-good skirt-chaser who&#39;d go after any woman he saw,<br> but\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> PGRYU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Pgryu?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hehehe. Sorry, I think that&#39;s my tummy rumbling.<br> I haven&#39;t had anything to eat in so long.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Anyway, they say all kinds of mean things about Orion in the legend, but he&#39;s actually a pure-hearted, wonderful hunter!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve materialized to prove just that...<br> Well? Do you believe me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s appeared in order to repair her reputation...<br> In other words, to correct an incorrect history!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know how you feel, Miss Orion.<br> Your skills with a bow\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m really confused as to how you could hit a target effectively with that stance,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but that was really impressive!<br> You&#39;re as good as the Greek myths say!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The legendary hero who never misses, who seduced the Goddess Artemis!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh my. Oh dear. Never misses, you say?<br> Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Pgryyyrururur!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your stomach again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aww, that&#39;s bad manners, Senpai.<br> You shouldn&#39;t ask a girl about her tummy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh? Seduced a goddess?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s true. More specifically, he made a goddess fall in love with him\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Miss Orion.<br> Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re looking for someone who stole a large amount of provisions from our base...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Suspicious people... Maybe that trio I just saw?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> They were running that way carrying something strange.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> But, they were a little out of it.<br> All the food was falling out all over the place.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> See those wolves gathering?<br> They&#39;re here to get the food that fell out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! That&#39;s good information!<br> Let&#39;s hurry and follow them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but we need to get those dumplings back...<br> Especially those super rare dumplings. I have to defend them at any cost...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh... Super rare... What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh\u2014that&#39;s right.<br> You don&#39;t know about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mixed with the other dumplings are some special ones,<br> made by a famous Japanese shop named Nanayabashiya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Their taste rivals a 10,000 yen sukiyaki,<br> and their value rivals a dozen Saint Quartz...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re special.<br> I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m saying anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, calm down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... Right. Sorry. I panicked.<br> It&#39;s definitely not that I&#39;m hungry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, they&#39;re very special dumplings. They&#39;re humanity&#39;s greatest treasure, and must be defended at all costs.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I see! I understand.<br> Can I help, then?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I owe you for saving me, and I need to showcase my archery skills, too. You&#39;re a Master, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> If you saw Orion being useful here,<br> I&#39;m sure you would want to contract with her, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would be great.<br> Thanks for your help, Miss Orion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s get those dumplings.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let the hunt begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! We&#39;ll pick up the rare dumplings as we chase after the thieves!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is a special mission, unlike any we&#39;ve done before,<br> but let&#39;s do our best!</p><h2 id="ep-1-antoinette-and-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ep-1-antoinette-and-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EP 1: Antoinette and Company</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see light ahead...

My queen, I didn&#39;t actually like the guillotine.<br> Quite the opposite...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> You complain too much, executioner.<br> Her Majesty said we&#39;re taking them.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> So we shall help her do it.

When you think about it, no matter how good they are, you can&#39;t eat three tons, can you?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.

Where&#39;s Orion?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t see her anymore.<br> I wanted to thank her for her help...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hmph. I&#39;m still here.<br> Do you have any goodbyes for me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were useless against Altera.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help it. It&#39;s my class affinity.<br> I wouldn&#39;t be more useful than that woman Archer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want to join us for the Moon Festival at Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> No, thank you. The offer is enough.<br> Unknown Master, I hope we meet again someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for your help, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just having you on our side was a big help.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Yes, it means one less enemy.<br> You understand war well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And so I shall give you one final warning.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> When it comes to food, the first owner and the last owner are different.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> So who is the true owner of these dumplings?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Was it the one who prepared them? No.<br> The one who cooked them? Even less so.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Then who do they belong to?<br> They belong to the one who is last to eat them.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You claimed ownership of the dumplings, but from<br> \u201Cthat person&#39;s\u201D perspective, that&#39;s nothing but a joke.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Listen well. If you fail to realize this, the truth will remain forever hidden in darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caesar, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahahaha!<br> Stay hungry, and you&#39;ll find the answer someday!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Farewell, farewell to you, girl with a bosom that&#39;s soft like a dumpling!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I take back my thank you!<br> I think Rome is a bad civilization!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was a little worried for a while there, but I&#39;m glad to see you both safe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re handing out all the dumplings you recovered now.<br> The Moon Festival party will begin soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just rest a little until then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to know what happened out there, but I&#39;ll wait.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can tell all the staff about your adventures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sure, but, um...Doctor.<br> Did you find the cause of the communications problem?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> O-Oh, no. I couldn&#39;t find it.<br> All our equipment was working normally.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But if there was a cause\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t be on Chaldea&#39;s side, but your own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Some kind of problem should have shown up during the time you Rayshifted and when the comms came back online...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru, any idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...A little.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Pick...Up...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, if it wasn&#39;t a problem, you can forget it.<br> Good work out there!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Enjoy the rest of your time at the Moon Festival party!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Something doesn&#39;t feel right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I still feel like...<br> I want some more rare dumplings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t caught the thief, and the greatest question still remains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who was that Orion?</p><h2 id="ep-4-does-moon-goddess-dream-of-dumplings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ep-4-does-moon-goddess-dream-of-dumplings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EP 4: Does Moon Goddess Dream of Dumplings?</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These...appear to be the hills of France...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what are we doing here?<br> We were gathering rare dumplings...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehehe. I&#39;ll tell you, Mash.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u201CThank you for all the work you&#39;ve done for me and Orion. Good job, you two!\u201D</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Just kidding!<br> Good evening, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Miss Orion!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, how&#39;ve you been, Mash\u2661 It&#39;s a bit late, but do you need an introduction and explanation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I think we kind of do.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hehe. Soft on the outside, and prickly where it counts.<br> I like it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> All right, time to explain!<br> I was the one who attacked Chaldea&#39;s food supply!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Or at least, that was the plan.<br> But it didn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Um, I virtually proved the causality of being summoned by you, and managed to get into Chaldea,</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> but then it was just one failure after another.<br> Lots of nasty traps kept me out of the storage.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> All I could do was transport your entire storage into the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> And once I&#39;d done that, I jumped to retrieve them, but...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> By an unfortunate coincidence, a passing queen got to them before I could.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> You know the rest.<br> I chased after the dumplings,</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> gathered almost enough rare dumplings for the special Craft Essence, and waited for the time of my full revival!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I think we&#39;re good.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> R-Really?<br> Hmm, you don&#39;t need an explanation, huh?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> But, that&#39;s fine. It makes this easier.<br> All that&#39;s left to do is fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you were the real culprit?<br> But why?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> For the dumplings, of course.<br> The dumplings.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> The dumplings are a manifestation of faith, created for the moon... An offering to the moon.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Do you understand? They&#39;re a way to win the favor of the gods and bring them here.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Even if Chaldea didn&#39;t intend for it to happen, doing a ritual like that in a place with a summoning system...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...was enough for me to awaken.<br> More specifically, it slapped me awake.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> But when I woke up, I was starving.<br> I didn&#39;t have nearly enough magical energy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> So I wanted dumplings.<br> The sacrifices that were created for me.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> They are thoughts, created for me.<br> A rare source of magical energy that exists to feed me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then\u2014for the last few days Senpai and I have been running around to try and revive you!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That&#39;s right\u2661<br> But please don&#39;t treat me as evil or anything.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m on your side...well, I&#39;m not.<br> But, I&#39;m not your enemy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> If my darling is on your side, then I&#39;m willing to be, too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Anyway, thanks to all the rare dumplings that Fujimaru found, I can join your other Servants.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left is to wait for you to summon me\u2014<br> But first, don&#39;t you think we need to test your skills?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> [\u2642 Agreed. You&#39;ll pay for tricking me. /\u2640 Agreed. You&#39;re going to regret this.]</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hmm... I guess you&#39;re right.<br> I didn&#39;t trick you, but it is true that I was having fun...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can we talk instead of fight?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Impossible. I don&#39;t like humans to start with.<br> And I dislike the weak ones the most.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> So I want you to show me that you&#39;re strong enough to beat selfish, unreasonable, and inhuman old me.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Otherwise, you can&#39;t handle a Servant like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sigh...I figured it would end like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I was kind of ready for it, so it&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight\u2014 Ready to go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right! Let&#39;s beat this goddess, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit!<br> Let me reintroduce myself then.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I am the deity of moonlight, the elegant representation of purity, virginity, hunting, and eternity\u2014</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> One of the ancient gods of Mt. Olympus!<br> I, the Moon Goddess Artemis, shall test you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I hope you do well. Try and beat me, just like my darling did that day\u2661</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Kyaaahh!<br> You! Beat! Me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We did it! A perfect victory, Master!<br> We defeated the Moon Goddess Artemis!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> (Sob, sob) I told you to fight hard, but you didn&#39;t have to hit THAT hard... Oww!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Now causality is established.<br> I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Maybe when we do, I won&#39;t remember Mash, or you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> But I have become a part of you. The Moon Goddess shall flow from Olympus to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No...<br> Goddess Artemis is disappearing...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Aww, silly.<br> Next time, just call me Artemis, Mash.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> This is just a temporary goodbye. I&#39;m sure that before long...we&#39;ll see each other again on those familiar seas.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Until then, goodbye! It wasn&#39;t very long, but I enjoyed our Moon Festival night adventure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Artemis...disappeared.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll see her again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Even if none of us remember what happened tonight, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be able to get along.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope we can see her again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We will. She loves humanity so much.<br> I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see her soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know she said she didn&#39;t like humans, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just because she can&#39;t leave us alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The dream is ending.<br> Our night of adventure is coming to a close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good work this time.<br> I&#39;ll see you when you wake up, Senpai.</p>', 684);
