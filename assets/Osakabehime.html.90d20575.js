Through this course of events, it seems Osakabehime had taken pride in being the true lord of the castle, and despite there supposedly not being anyone up in the tower, you could sometimes see a light in there at night. People in the castle grew afraid of her and called her &#39;Hachitendou-sama&#39;. It was also said that whoever laid eyes upon her would die instantly.</p><p>If we were to make an estimate, her true form was that of a female fox who had lived for about 300 years. With her shapeshifting powers, she could change into a young girl wearing a ceremonial kimono, a three meter-tall fierce god, or many other forms. She was an important member of the fox family as she commanded 808 familiars, within which there were a few of them who were noted to be especially strong such as her four heavenly kings: Nikaido no Sususuke, Toriikoshi no Chuusaburou, Kakurekasa no Kinmaru, Niwatorikui no Yamitarou. As well as her lonely warrior: Noarashi no Hananaga.</p><p>Osakabehime&#39;s parents were ancient foxes who lived in the Yamato province for a millennium, and during the era of Emperor Kanmu her parents were hunted down to be used as materials for the magical rainmaking tool &#39;Hatsune no Tsuzumi&#39;. Genkurougitsune, who loved his parents and saved Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the then wielder of the &#39;Hatsune no Tsuzumi&#39;, from danger is Osakabehime&#39;s younger brother. (from the joruri play &#39;Yoshitsune Senbonzakura&#39;)</p><p>Youkai who lock themselves up in a castle like her are usually referred to as castle ghosts. Another example would be Kamehime of Inawashiro Castle (aka Kamega Castle). By the way Kamehime&#39;s true form is a badger, and in his play &#39;Tenshu Monogatari&#39; the famous author Izumi Kyoka wrote Kamehime and Osakabehime as having a sisterly relationship.</p><p>Just like how Kamehime coerced the castle keepers of Inawashiro into always greeting her, Osakabehime who wasn&#39;t very fond of humans also forced the lords of Himeji Castle to greet her once a year. (from the Kasshawa)</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Anyway, her real form may be that of a fox, but after a fierce argument with Tamamo it was decided she would do a job change into a bat.</p><p>She uses them as familiars to fight the enemy.</p><p>However, she&#39;s still just a shut-in. After all, she had for a very long time enjoyed a shut-in life where she merely left the tasks of castle lord to warriors and she only met with the (temporary) lord of the castle once a year to say hi and give him some random instructions before going back to her room.</p><p>After many battles, and many eras, she eventually came to realize she had been left behind alone.</p><p>The lords of the castle disappeared; the people who listened to her also disappeared.</p><p>At first it was all fun and games for her, but she eventually started thinking that nobody knowing about her anymore would be the same as being dead, and she was spurred on by those thoughts.</p><p>She protected Himeji/Hakuro castle from many fierce battles. Even though she knew there was no longer any point to it.</p><p>There was nobody left to praise her. There was nobody left to fear her.</p><p>Even if there were those who knew she existed, nobody could actually be sure that she was indeed still there.</p><p>&quot;......What, so this is the same as being dead, huh.&quot;</p><p>At some point, Osakabehime simply disappeared.</p><p>And now, after tasting the forbidden fruit known as the internet and doujinshi she has been completely immersing herself in them day and night.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Origami: Her origami attacks, protects, and moves her.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Miyamoto Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Back when she was having trouble with other youkai who lived in Himeji castle, they all suddenly ran away once Miyamoto Musashi decided to stay in the castle for a while.</p><p>Osakabehime &quot;T-Thanks for that...Huh?

If you ask me, her second stage is her default form, while her third one is basically her best clothes for going out. So if she were to be suddenly called while she was lazying around in her room she&#39;d go to her first stage to hide her appearance since she had no time to prep herself.
