Or at least, that would be the case were there no opponents awaiting the team.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is this mere chance? The whim of a Demon God Pillar?<br> Or is it simply human error?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whatever the case, on that day in 2018, only a short while after C\xFA Chulainn Alter was summoned...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Humanity&#39;s last Master, Fujimaru,<br> was in a dire situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hm? Dire situations are the order of the day here?<br> Well, be that as it may, THIS particular situation was something rather special.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Master&#39;s most trusted Servant,<br> Mash Kyrielight, was not by [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was not long after the difficult, arduous task of correcting the Singularity in America had been completed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of all Chaldea&#39;s Servants,<br> [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} took only C\xFA Chulainn Alter...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...on a forty-eight hour journey.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Bluntly, an Alter is another side of us...just another possibility.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> For example: heroes, no matter what kind of life they lived, almost always end up with blood on their hands.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Even heroes who like to think of themselves as good remain aware that they have a merciless side to them.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What would happen if their other side was brought to the forefront? Pretty obvious, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> It goes without saying that we are conscious that our living selves and ourselves as we are now are more or less the same.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> However, even I cannot make any claim to sainthood.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> A virtuous king can turn cold-blooded.<br> A cold-blooded king becomes virtuous.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> A mad dog of a knight had a time to shine bright.<br> And the opposite rings true.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> And there are those who fell from grace, those who fell into darkness, or were driven into it by events beyond their control.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> ...Lamentably, I cannot argue that point.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> That is the man I ultimately become.<br> An Anti-Hero, a mass-murderer, a truly evil man.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> As painful as it may be, it is not something I can simply avoid...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> I must acknowledge that he is another side of me...<br> I mustn&#39;t avert my gaze from that truth...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The real issue is that they&#39;re not exactly just another side of us. They&#39;ve mutated somehow.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The other me fused with Medb&#39;s far-fetched idea of me as a king.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Guess it happened since humanity is so unstable.<br> Otherwise, I&#39;d have been less of a jerk.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What?<br> You scared, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t act so tough.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> We lost communication, we&#39;re low on food and water,<br> and I&#39;m the only Servant you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Standing there, saying you&#39;re not scared?<br> Liar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, to be honest...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I knew it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> We lost communication, we&#39;re low on food and water,<br> and I&#39;m the only Servant you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Even your trusty Shielder isn&#39;t here.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Anyone would be scared out of their wits.<br> Right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that look.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> We did try to kill each other the last time we were here. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not. You and I fought to the death.<br> You, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If you&#39;re a Master, you are responsible for your Servants in battle. No matter the opponent, the ultimate decision to fight is on you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I fought against you and lost.<br> Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But now it&#39;s just a faint memory. Look at that.<br> While we were chit-chatting, enemies surrounded us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> So what&#39;ll it be, Master? Retreat or meet the attack head-on? You better choose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Attack.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Got it. Good, a quick decision.<br> You didn&#39;t even hesitate. I like it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s time for a massacre.<br> This lot isn&#39;t even hardy enough to be a good meal.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Still, no harm in an appetizer here and there!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Normally, if I were summoned as a Berserker,<br> I would turn out pretty different.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But from what I remember, the raged-out me is probably the world&#39;s biggest good-for-nothing.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So maybe HE is at least the lesser of two evils.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey! We&#39;re connected!<br> All right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh. Hey. Glad you&#39;re doing okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We were monitoring your vitals this whole time on our end, but I couldn&#39;t relax until I saw your face in person!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Hey. You aren&#39;t looking in person. You&#39;re yammering from a safe, cushy office. Who the hell do you think you are?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh, well...<br> I can&#39;t really argue that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I was only speaking on your behalf.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s completely right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When you come back, I&#39;ll treat you to my favorite sesame buns by way of apology.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Is that the best you can do?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Eh? Uh...um...my favorite bean buns?<br> Hngh...this is gonna cost me...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Master, I am not certain your boss is a good or worthwhile human being.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I sometimes wonder the same thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh come on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not exactly news.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just...consider all that an attempt to lighten the mood with a silly joke!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Aaanywho, that&#39;s enough chitchat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re in a bit of a dangerous situation right now...<br> We have two choices about how to retrieve you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Our first option would be to conduct a forced Rayshift. It&#39;s dangerous, but it&#39;s probably the best way to deal with the current situation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Let me emphasize that this will be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It will be a great deal harder on you than a normal Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Second option: I&#39;ve already pinpointed your coordinates. You should be able to make your way to Mash on foot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you do that, we can Rayshift you back normally.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, Mash is a little far. It will take you at least forty-eight hours to reach her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Forty-eight hours...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Ha. Well, well.<br> You&#39;ve gotten yourself into quite the mess, Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Is he saying there&#39;s a chance he might betray Master?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Who knows? Tough question.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No matter how levelheaded Berserkers may seem,<br> they&#39;re all pretty unhinged.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> However, if they&#39;re completely lost to madness, there is a possibility that they could make a mad dash without thinking twice... Maybe.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Either way, I can&#39;t imagine even the other side of me would do something like that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Honestly, the opposite is more likely, I think.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t sense any enemies nearby.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Just doing my job as a Servant.<br> Quit thanking me every time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Irritating.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the natural relationship between Master and their Servants.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I may be born from malice and bizarre circumstance,<br> but I am still C\xFA Chulainn.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Kill my enemies.<br> Protect my allies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That is how it goes for all Celtic folk:<br> we kill whether they be enemies or allies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And I&#39;m not so squeamish as to let others do my dirty work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Good. Rest up.<br> I&#39;ll keep watch.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Oh. Before you go to sleep,<br> there&#39;s one thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Why did you choose to do it this way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way can I let myself die here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Figured as much.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Had you chosen the forceful Rayshift option in an attempt to get away from it all, and some kind of accident happened...the world would be over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Eh, just &#39;cause.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But now, you&#39;re stuck with me for another thirty-six hours.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You have no other allies here, and nobody else can help you. This time we have together will be like torture... Are you sure you can make it out alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I am.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Oh really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not... At least, not if I&#39;m alone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Time to head out, [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.<br> Get a move on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And one more thing: hydrate yourself from the tree roots before we leave the forest. We won&#39;t have another chance to get any water for a while.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got some bad news.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I doubt you could tell us much that would make matters worse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve detected a large group of enemies up ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re spread out all over the place. Trying to go around would add about two hundred hours to your trip.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Considering your food and water supplies, your psychological state, and your current vitals, I recommend you Rayshift immediately.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It shouldn&#39;t be so much of a cause for concern now.<br> Our chances of success have gone up. It should be fine...probably...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Enemies?<br> Then I&#39;ll kill them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s just too many of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Plus, our analysis of enemy activity shows they&#39;re in constant communication with each other.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Once they&#39;re engaged, they&#39;ll just keep calling for reinforcements until they&#39;ve killed their target.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Matters might have been different if Mash were there, but there&#39;s just no way you can protect Fujimaru alone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Huh. Nice pep talk.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Well then.<br> Master, we&#39;re going to find a place for you to hide.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll go slaughter them all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Come on, don&#39;t be absurd!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> First and foremost, I can&#39;t let you just leave Fujimaru alone!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> As it is, there&#39;s no choice.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If I fail, then you can just Rayshift or whatever you want to do.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s review.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;ll stay here and find some food and water.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go swing my lance around a bit, even throw out my Noble Phantasm. Once I&#39;ve swept all the enemies away, I&#39;ll call for you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What, are you going to tag along?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think I should go with you?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You out of your damn mind?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If you pull something like that, the whole plan&#39;s a waste. The enemy&#39;s after you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You wanna be dead weight slowing me down?<br> And you call yourself a Master...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I want to say that I understand what you&#39;re saying.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> \u201CI don&#39;t want you to die and I don&#39;t want to die.\u201D</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But the whole Master-Servant relationship isn&#39;t that simple.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think betrayal is a concern,<br> but I&#39;d say death is imminent.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> In a normal Grail War, a Master only thinks of their Servants as familiars, which causes some trouble.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Most Masters are good-for-nothing mages. It&#39;s no wonder they don&#39;t get along with Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, some Servants tolerate them,<br> but some Servants cross the line.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But that guy is the opposite. He understands that he&#39;s just a familiar, and acts accordingly.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why if Master&#39;s life&#39;s in danger...I think he&#39;d throw his life away to protect [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} without hesitating.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something he&#39;d do out of affection so much as just the sort of service he feels is appropriate.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Goring Spear of Slaughter...G\xE1e Bolg!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe it. I knew his NP is Anti-Army,<br> but he wiped out a third of the enemies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Quit mocking me. It&#39;s ONLY a third.<br> Until I&#39;ve massacred the rest of them, this isn&#39;t a victory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If only you weren&#39;t alone, and if only there wasn&#39;t such an endless tide of enemies...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Heh. I&#39;m used to this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No matter how I look at this, you&#39;ll only be able to get through half of them at best. I recommend you give up and make a temporary retreat.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And what would happen if we retreat?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well...you&#39;ll just have to start all over again.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Screw that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Backup from Chaldea has its limits. If we turn back and start all over again, this [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl} definitely won&#39;t last.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...<br> I think you underestimate Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let me say this again: at best you can take out half. They may not be individually strong, but their sheer numbers are overwhelming.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s nothing new for a lone Servant out in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I forgot that C\xFA Chulainn fought through an army of Medb&#39;s soldiers all by himself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But still, you&#39;re a Servant now. We don&#39;t have sufficient magical energy for you to keep exerting your true power like that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Figured as much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You think that&#39;s why you have a Master, huh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A supplier of magical energy for manifestation...<br> A link to maintain your existence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That, and that alone, is what you believe a Master&#39;s purpose to be.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What else would it be?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you,<br> there&#39;s a good deal more to it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;ve taken out a third of the enemies,<br> we can ensure [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} safety from our end.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Huh? What the hell are you talking about...?<br> You&#39;re not saying...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru! It&#39;s your turn!<br> Support him as a Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Damn.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be okay.

Better take care of them before the poison spreads too far.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Still no sign of what time period this is, or a place where we can get a look at this whole Singularity.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Ah well, that&#39;s not important.<br> The main thing is finding the other Servants.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...What? You still worried about the poison or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of it, but...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s just, you have so little regard for yourself...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...You haven&#39;t changed a bit, have you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to get me.

Some parts look like the Far East, others like South America.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And on top of that, I don&#39;t see any signs of people anywhere. We can&#39;t just keep stumbling around and hope for the best.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Any bright ideas, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe we could find somewhere to go if we made a boat?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Forget it.

Give me some space, Master.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Please don&#39;t think poorly of me.<br> It&#39;s nothing personal.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re the guy we gotta take out, C\xFA?<br> Well that sucks!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Come on, why don&#39;t you ditch the loser and join us?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that.<br> You&#39;re merely loyal to a fault.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Becoming an Alter has done nothing to change that.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> True. You just wouldn&#39;t be C\xFA if you went around ditching your charge.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So it&#39;d make me real happy if you just agreed to roll over and kick the bucket to get out of this Holy Grail War!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I see little point in telling you more,<br> as you are about to die.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Let&#39;s begin.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know how I feel about this. Facing you when you&#39;re poisoned seems like a geis from when you were still alive...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No, wait, I totally know how I feel! This is just as exciting now as it was back then! I can&#39;t wait to back you into a corner and finish you off!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Come try.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> When this is over, there won&#39;t be so much as a speck left of either of you!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I see. So that ferocity is what made you a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You have narrowed your focus so much that you&#39;ve blinded yourself to anything other than your goal.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> But remember this, warrior of Ulster: that very part of you is what weighs on your Master the most.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every breath I take is agony.<br> I have no idea what I should do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I tear into the enemy in front of me.<br> That&#39;s all I&#39;m meant for.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s what warriors have always done,<br> especially when we&#39;re berserk.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> A true hero...kills with his eyes!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Tch...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Bring it!<br> Chariot My Love!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Is that a joke, Medb!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> He took it head-on!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Here, Karna.<br> You can have this back!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Karna!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...It would seem this is it for me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You left yourself open, Medb.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh!?<br> Oh shi\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> G\xE1e Bolg...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Guh...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s over. Now it&#39;s your turn to die.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heh, hehe... Owww...<br> That was...a good hit.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You win this one. But...there&#39;s still three Servants left. Think you can take them all with your body falling apart?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Shut up.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe...<br> See you...on the other side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Come on... We need to keep going.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can we at least rest a little?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, all right.<br> You stay here and hold down the fort.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Meantime...I&#39;ll go finish off the last three.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you just trust me?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not that. If I didn&#39;t trust you,<br> I&#39;d have killed you long ago.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Karna said I&#39;m a burden for you as I am now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> He&#39;s probably right.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> For some reason...I&#39;m dead set on handling everything on my own.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Allies, comrades, friends...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Anyone who&#39;s supposed to help share the load just ends up making it heavier for me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> As much as I&#39;m a burden for you,<br> you&#39;re a burden for me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> So you just sit tight here while I go take care of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So now, here I am, all on my own...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something about this doesn&#39;t feel right...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Huh, what do you know.<br> You must be that Master of Chaldea [\u2642 fellow /\u2640\uFE0F lady}.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Andersen...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> A third-rate Servant, and the only one to voluntarily drop out of this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If you already know who I am, that&#39;ll save us some time. Now, what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Is your Servant staying out of the Holy Grail War?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CHoly Grail War\u201D is kind of stretching it...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> True, this one is much different than the usual battle royale.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Instead of fighting each other, all seven Servants are working together to keep the Holy Grail safe from a single opposing Servant.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Of course, since it won&#39;t make any difference if I&#39;m there fighting or not, I decided I&#39;d go ahead and sit it out right here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Besides, it doesn&#39;t matter how many of us our enemy defeats. There&#39;s no way he&#39;s getting through Heracles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heracles...!</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Yup. The greatest hero in all of Greek myth. If most Servants can hit like a truck, Herc is more like a goddamn freight train. Only a fool would take him on.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So, what are you doing here,<br> anyway, Master of Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmm. He prefers to go it on his own, huh.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That certainly sounds like something C\xFA Chulainn Alter would say.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> The original C\xFA Chulainn was a Celtic warrior through and through. For him, both enemy and ally alike could be a friend...depending on his mood.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...But it sounds like all of that&#39;s gone in C\xFA Chulainn Alter.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So he thinks it&#39;s fine for everyone else to be weak, and as long as he&#39;s strong, everything will be fine.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> He also thinks it&#39;s just fine to keep his charges at a distance, and doesn&#39;t care if he gets hurt.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What a joke!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t he realize that&#39;s exactly the sort of behavior that ends up hurting the ones he&#39;s supposed to be protecting?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That&#39;s the whole reason why you&#39;re hurt and moping around in here now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Good. Then get out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been feeling...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Now do you get it?<br> Only one thing left for you to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hurry up and go find him. Once you&#39;re out of these woods, turn left and keep heading straight.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You&#39;ll see a cave there.<br> That is where this war will come to an end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Andersen.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got no use for your gratitude. You don&#39;t look like you could afford one of my books anyway.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So get lost.<br> Go do what a Master&#39;s supposed to do.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If he succeeds at defeating the last two Servants,<br> it won&#39;t take long for this Singularity to disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can hear them fighting...!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Hraaaaaaaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2"></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> (Huff, huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Master?
