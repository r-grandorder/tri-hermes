Robin&#39;s buying things from that shop.<br> Did you tell him to do that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, I asked him to guard the area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As expected, Senpai knows exactly what to do with Servants. If there&#39;s nothing to do, have them patrol.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t remember asking him anything...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then he&#39;s just walking around on his own?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, until they&#39;re needed they&#39;re free to do what they want, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Those beat up old blades? If you&#39;re just gonna give them to the blacksmith I&#39;ll take all you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, and a dozen lengths of rope.<br> Throw in some rags, too.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Yeah, sure thing. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking this junk off my hands, but what will you use them for?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Who knows? But junk&#39;s got its uses.<br> You can put it together into something good.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, this is a nice blanket.<br> Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see something like this. I&#39;ll take it.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> That&#39;s an expensive blanket.<br> You sleep in your cape, what will you do with it?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> My new boss is a wimp who&#39;s not used to camping.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Looks like he&#39;s buying a lot.<br> Should we talk to him, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hello Robin, are you buying something?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, Master and Lady Mash.<br> Fancy seeing you here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m kind of surprised to see you here Robin...<br> It&#39;s rare for a Servant to go shopping.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Maybe so. Compared to the other guys, I&#39;m a little plain, right? I feel more at home in places like this.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But again, this is perfect timing.<br> I&#39;m going hunting, want to tag along?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hunting? Is that code for you&#39;re going gambling?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What kind of guy do you think I am?<br> Not gambling, plain old hunting.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Quietly. Quietly.<br> I saw some weird animal tracks around here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I set some traps over the past few days... Got it!<br> Bingo! They fell for it.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> This area up ahead is a blind alley.<br> It&#39;ll be easy to trap them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really did mean hunting...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Of course I did.<br> What did you think I was doing?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t make me a Servant just because I&#39;m good looking. I&#39;m a master hunter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What did you trap?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Haha, you&#39;ll have to find out.<br> Something perfect for a growing Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Robin, it&#39;s pulling!<br> The line is pulling!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this! This is some rare prey.<br> Don&#39;t let it escape, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was amazing!<br> Master, Robin is a master hunter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Totally agree! Do it again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s the best! Gimme more!</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hahaha, you&#39;re a greedy one, huh Master?<br> Let&#39;s move on to the next trap then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Quietly, quietly...Oh, this one too.<br> Although this is one I hoped they wouldn&#39;t trigger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You hoped they wouldn&#39;t trigger?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, unlike the other place, there are signs of people staying here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They&#39;re pros too, so they&#39;ve hidden themselves well,<br> but... See? 3, 2, 1, 0.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> GYAAAAHHH!<br> A trap! A hidden pit!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Scouts, what were you doing? There&#39;s spear tips smeared with cow dung on the bottom!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hear terrible screaming!<br> Robin, what was that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Damn, enemy soldiers!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Damn! Definitely not a bonus character!</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> These guys were getting ready to attack the town.<br> See? This is important, too.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If we can get rid of them here, they can&#39;t hurt the town and the enemy won&#39;t know our location.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Just like they said, scouts are the most basic and critical part of war.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> A bonus is important, but you need basic recon work too. Don&#39;t forget that, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. Robin is right!<br> This is important too! No, it&#39;s more important!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Damn it! Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger\u2014I&#39;ll change my feeling of misplaced hope into rage, Master!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, how brave!<br> Let&#39;s do this nice and easy. Nice and easy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew!<br> We ended up going around the whole forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it paid off, bigtime.<br> Not just from the battles, but what Robin did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s been protecting the town without them ever knowing, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. Robin Hood is a true hero.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Aww, don&#39;t say that.<br> I&#39;m not a hero even after death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aww, you should&#39;ve just told us.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit I can be a bit of an oddball.<br> But you&#39;ve got me all wrong, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even remember the people in town.<br> I just protect it because it&#39;s a nice place.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m not any different from the soldiers who attack the town. Just different tastes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, what does that mean?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You know, I didn&#39;t want to go around crushing kids&#39; dreams. But I may as well say it.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You guys talk about saving humanity, but that stuff&#39;s too big for me to really understand.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Servant?<br> It got to be some kind of mistake.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I was just a murderer with a rebel streak.<br> I didn&#39;t save anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But you saved the villagers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There are people you saved.</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how things ended up.<br> I fought alone, and the village was safe for a year or two.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure, I fought the lord&#39;s army,<br> but that doesn&#39;t mean I wanted to save anyone.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You get it? I&#39;m just a thug and a coward.<br> So be careful, Master.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous to let your guard down because of my good looks. I&#39;m a coward who&#39;ll run if he has to.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Anyway, we&#39;re done hunting, so I&#39;ll be going.<br> Might take a nap in the woods.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Call me if there&#39;s a fight.<br> It&#39;s my job, so I&#39;ll do whatever crazy things I have to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s gone.<br> But Robin contradicted himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said he protected the town because it was a nice place to be, but he sleeps in the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think he...I think he&#39;s keeping his distance from what&#39;s truly important to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Some guys are like that, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It might be too important for him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What does that mean...<br> Hey, why are you smiling like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you know the answer, please tell me!<br> Senpai, Senpaaaai!</p>', 111);
