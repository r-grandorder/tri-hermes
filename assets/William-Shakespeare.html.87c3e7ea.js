The world is a stage, and the men and women coming and going on it are performers.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Regardless, there is no smile in this town.<br> No happiness. Why is that\u2013?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> It&#39;s because there is no drama!<br> If so, shall we put up an improv for people to see?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An improv? ...And you said &quot;we.&quot;...<br> By &quot;we&quot;, you mean...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Why, of course I mean myself, Mash Kyrielight, and Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-Impossible!<br> I&#39;ve never seen or performed a play!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, you haven&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes. I&#39;m sorry for my inexperience...<br> But there was never any need for me to...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahaha, what are you talking about?<br> That need is more apparent than ever for you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> What you need right now is love, words and poetry!<br> A kindled passion is exactly what you need!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ohhhh, but...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, and a shield and weapon, too.<br> It&#39;s kind of sudden, I know\u2013</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong><br> Monsters!<br> Monsters are coming\u2013!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> But monsters are coming all of a sudden, you see!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Why is that\u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-We should deal with them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s protect everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, what a courageous line!<br> But I wish you&#39;d made your delivery a bit more complex.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> &quot;Hear your death bell ringing! Are you going to heaven, or to hell!&quot; ...How about that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, excuse me.<br> Please join the battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, how valorous you were.<br> You are majestic even when standing behind me, Master.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, the Holy Grail War is a fine thing.

So it is you\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The villain named S grows impatient with the town&#39;s neverending peace, curses the people, and to top it all off, he comes up with a plot!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> It was to use the townspeople!<br> To incite the townspeople, and turn them into daemons so he can make them attack our heroes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!?<br> Shakespeare, is that\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way...!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> They have no people to protect, no friends to share laughter with.All they do now is shiver with loneliness\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> &quot;You can give in.&quot; The demon whispers.<br> &quot;You can rest now.&quot; The nightmare murmurs.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, well, well, what are you going to do, Mash Kyrielight?

If there&#39;s no way to turn them back, we just need to defeat them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m coming with you, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We defeated them...!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, we must hail your victory! ...Now that they won the battle, the end of their dream comes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Oh?<br> The town...is gone!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Excellent job, Master.<br> And you, Mash Kyrielight...the shield and sword.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The dream is now over.<br> You gathered the beautiful threads of your story.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s walk toward the rest of the story. I am certain the transient dream and illusion shall satiate your mind.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...And of course, for me, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From...where to where was it a dream...?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> \u2013Heheheh.
