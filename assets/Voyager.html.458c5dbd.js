While he doesn&#39;t say much and is prone to discreetly observe things, he isn&#39;t exactly the silent-type.</p><p>As befits a space probe, he is very curious, always seeking out new things and experiences. New smells and tastes excite him, and he is a sucker for delectable dishes and unique desserts.</p><p>Even when he is exploring the unknown, he can use his keen sense of direction and spatial awareness to keep from ever getting lost. He also has a great sense of hearing, and can remember anything he hears. Even though he has limited vocabulary, he is versed in various languages. He also enjoys listening to music of all kinds, and he can&#39;t help but feel drawn to live performances.</p><p>He quite likes donuts because of their resemblance to Saturn&#39;s rings.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t seem to like taking baths.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>While not restricted to his Master, if his heart gets through to someone, he stands by their side as a dear friend.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>&quot;I, ask, of you.

The probe recorded many observations about the planets of the solar system, including Jupiter and Saturn, then continued its endless interstellar mission. Even now, he continues to journey through the starry sea outside the heliosphere.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Voyager is considered a young Servant for two reasons: he originates from a very recent period of history, and possesses the physical body of an eight-year-old. He is essentially a piece of exploratory equipment made of aluminum alloy that survived the Holy Grail War and ultimately gained a spiritron body equivalent to a human body in order to communicate better with his Master.</p><p>In consequence of this miracle, he lacks common sense, has a limited vocabulary, and his appearance is greatly influenced by the preference of Utsumi Erice, a Master with whom he has a close connection. Through multiple Ascensions at Chaldea, he is sure to grow into a formidable being fit to be a guardian of humanity.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>In his first Ascension, he drops stars like rain, and generates solar wind and such like something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>In his third Ascension he has lively, high-speed punches and kicks, while also performing cool stunts while driving a lunar rover.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Utsumi Erice</strong></p><p>Erice is the Master who originally summoned me. I even look the way I do because of her, I think. She can be a lot to handle, but since becoming her friend, we&#39;ve been really happy.</p><p><strong>Kijyo Koyo</strong></p><p>She&#39;s strong, scary, and kind. Sometimes though, she looks really sad into the distance. I wonder if she had a kid a long time ago...</p><p>(Ascension 3)</p><p><strong>Edison</strong></p><p>If it wasn&#39;t for his competitive spirit, showmanship, and his reckless sense of adventure, I probably wouldn&#39;t have been born. That&#39;s essentially how journeys start.</p><p><strong>Chiron</strong></p><p>The mythological centaur!!! When I began my journey, I rode right along his back. This is sort of an assumption on my part, but...since then, I felt like he&#39;s always been watching over me.</p><p><strong>Jason</strong></p><p>The greatest &quot;ship&quot; in the night sky is his, of course. I&#39;m not a &quot;ship&quot; in the sense that people can ride on, but my precious cargo I carry will someday reach it&#39;s destination.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>I was contacted for the Requiem collab happened not long after Requiem went on sale, so I was very taken aback, but also did a little happy dance. I wanted Voyager&#39;s Ascension designs to really touch people, so I took great care in making them. His second Ascension is in the style of a certain Prince, while his third is a mix of motifs from space suits + flight jackets with Voyager being a slightly more matured traveler.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 76);
