A paved road.<br> A faint foul odor.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No grass or earth. An ominous place covered with cold stones. I suppose even the fog that&#39;s been dirtied by science conceals magecraft.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So this is 19th century London.<br> Truly distasteful. But not bad, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm, Geronimo?<br> Which is it?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not bad.<br> By the way, Master, sorry to trouble you.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry I was so selfish in asking you to come here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. But why?</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s the home of modern magecraft, correct?<br> I never had a chance to cross the sea in my lifetime.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Our magecraft and their magecraft split apart completely in history.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> On the other hand, there are many similarities as well. And let us set aside discussion of which is the original for the time being.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always wanted to take a look.<br> Now, are there any rituals worthy of study...?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hm. But first, spirits.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We often borrow the powers of spirits...but this is a low-class one.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It never occurred to me that we would encounter such a spirit the instant we set foot here, though.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see London and death are quite...intimate in this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, if you would kindly help us fight...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Fight? There is no reason not to just ignore something so weak...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Weak. Fragile. Fleeting.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t possess the strong emotions,<br> grudges, or regrets normally so important to ghosts.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It likely died in a freak accident and something tied it to this place.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> And then I expect it was awoken by the demonic fog that blanketed the city.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Besides, take a look at that insubstantial figure.<br> It is practically advertising its weakness.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Honestly, it&#39;s not worth involving ourselves.<br> It may be a ghost, but it is hardly important.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Professor Geronimo?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oh. I see, I see. My apologies.<br> I may have provoked them a bit.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They&#39;ve all combined themselves to attack us.<br> They must really be angry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. They&#39;re pretty angry.<br> To say it as Blackbeard might, they&#39;re triggered!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did that on purpose.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Well, yes. I suppose.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> To be honest, it&#39;d be disingenuous of me to say I wasn&#39;t hoping for something like this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I wanted to see what an English ghost would do if they got serious.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Either way, my apologies. I&#39;d like you to accompany me in some, shall we say, ghost busting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.<br> Master, your command, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see, I see. There are exponentially more spirits here than in the land where I lived.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...And I wonder what else is here?<br> Let&#39;s keep looking around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Wow, Geronimo seems like he&#39;s having a good time. Is he the sort who&#39;s taken in by new and different things?)</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ah. This bounded field technique is impressive! It&#39;s so intricately constructed, appropriate for a small island nation like this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a fine Persian rug...such wonderful detail.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The fields that we created were quite crude.<br> However, even if one is intricately constructed...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ah, yes. Unfortunately, the mage who constructed this seems to have been somewhat lacking in terms of power.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If this is the best they could do, my field would still have been better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what are you doing!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Someone erected a field here, so I destroyed it.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Now then.<br> Who or what will show up...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Wh-who are you!? This is my territory! You just destroyed the concealment rite I worked so hard on!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We are merely travelers. I see no sense in you putting a bounded field in a place like this.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Wh-who the hell are you!?<br> You&#39;re a foreigner!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In addition to that, I am not human. At least not anymore. Either way, you are also a budding mage.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Am I correct in pointing out that you have already abandoned being human as well?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Answer MY question!<br> Who the hell are you!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> By the way, would you mind telling me why it is you put a field here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hm, for example...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Was your intention to conduct a sacrificial ritual using those children standing behind you?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sacrifices!?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Hnh, unfortunate... I didn&#39;t want to involve tourists, but I cannot let you leave alive now.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oh, on the contrary.<br> This will have been your ill fortune.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Had it been some other mage, they might have tried to steal the fruits of your efforts, but not likely impeded your progress.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Or rather, if this was truly your territory,<br> they might have avoided this area all together.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Wherever you may go, most people prefer to avoid conflict with people with whom they have no connection.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, unfortunately for you, the ones who happened by were myself and my Master.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I am afraid we are not good enough mages to allow such egregious behavior to go ignored.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That, in turn, means that you have no opportunity to explain yourself or negotiate.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You must die right here.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> The hell I will!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He transformed!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see, I see. How fitting in a city like London.<br> He&#39;s a werewolf.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, this is merely a superficial transformation using newer magecraft techniques.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> His kind is nothing compared to the Phantasmals who are said to have lived since the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The coyote from my nation would be a better adversary. Well, if he intends to fight, I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s muzzle this beast, shall we? Here, boy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> And that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Gargh... Im...possible...I worked...so hard...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> My clan&#39;s oldest wish... The recreation of a Divine Beast... To be hindered...at the first step...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I warned you. The structure of your rite was composed poorly. Now, let&#39;s release the children.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No...they would be terrified by the sight of me.<br> I believe you are best fit for the job. If you would, Master. I leave it to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Why...you...!<br> Then I have no choice but to offer my own life...!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A summoning circle!<br> Take care, Master! Something&#39;s coming forth!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Devour my own life and answer my call!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see.<br> This is due to the disorder in the ages.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even in a modern time like this one, the instability in the world is enough to allow for the summoning of ancient beasts!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I am...not a fool...! I am the smartest in my village...a genius bursting with knowledge...!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> And this is proof!<br> Now my clan&#39;s wishes will be fulfilled!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> No...I was trying to...call forth...something more divine...!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Fool. An attempt to summon a Divine Beast in a London where the foundations of humanity are so unstable is doomed to failure!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The only possible result would be monsters drenched in blood, full of rage...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> How embarrassing... I want to go back to my village... You...mage...I have a favor to ask...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Please...get rid of...that...<br> We never meant...to plunge the world...into chaos...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I have no arguments there.<br> You just rest in peace now.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hmph. What a selfish mage. But now that he summoned that thing, we need to deal with it.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It certainly doesn&#39;t appear that we&#39;ll be able to reason with it and convince it to return whence it came. That being the case, Master...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We shall shine the dazzling brightness of the sun into London&#39;s night and incinerate all that is evil.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to use my Noble Phantasm!<br> Master, I&#39;m leaving the moment to unleash it up to you!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s finally over.<br> I was sadly unable to complete my tour of London.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We should lightly hypnotize the children and send them home with no memory of this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We wouldn&#39;t want them to draw a mage&#39;s attention by mentioning anything strange, would we?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The bigger issue is...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Whenever I hypnotize someone,<br> I must use cigarettes to do so...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But you say that underage children mustn&#39;t smoke, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Definitely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That is quite the conundrum.<br> I suppose I should consult with Miss Da Vinci on this.</p>', 118);
