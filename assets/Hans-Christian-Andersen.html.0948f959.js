It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;re not looking disgruntled today.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I am so disgusted with my super-boring life that my brain has turned to stone.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I feel like as if I&#39;ve been transformed into a dumb monkey. I&#39;m overwhelmingly lacking enrichment in my life.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Look. Don&#39;t you have anything to say as my Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stone bread?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Enrichment?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Huh? You don&#39;t know the taste of a completely-dried bread? Scandinavians start their breakfast</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> by forcefully washing down a piece of rock-like bread with a drink like lead-boiled water...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Well, that trivia aside,<br> what I want to say, Fujimaru, is...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Give me something new to write about, or if you don&#39;t have anything, then give me some money.<br> I&#39;ll have some fun at the bar to kill some time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, Mr. Andersen is sounding more arrogant and reprehensible than ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you do anything to get on his bad side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Andersen is always like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you say you&#39;re not at fault.<br> Of course. That&#39;s what I remember, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mr. Andersen.<br> We don&#39;t have any resources to waste here at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please behave yourself, and work on a new book.<br> Personally, I request a sequel of The Little Mermaid...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Tch.<br> That story is so popular among women and kids.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I wrote that story to mock the idiots in this world,<br> so I don&#39;t understand why it would be taken as a touching tale.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What\u2014M-Mister, what did you just say?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I said, that is one of the worst trash that I ever wrote, you fool!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Geez. I made the ending so obvious,<br> but people kept calling it a tragedy or tragic love story.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Not only is she finally released from love at first sight,<br> but she even gets a soul as a reward in the end!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Listen. The best part about love is when it&#39;s purely yours. That&#39;s my conclusion, at least.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You ask me to write a sequel, but why can&#39;t you understand it would only drive Little Mermaid to further despair?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Uh... What, you look like it&#39;s the end of the world.<br> ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t ask me to write a sequel to a story that ended already. It&#39;s the reader&#39;s privilege to imagine what happens after the ending.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Fine. If you don&#39;t have any money,<br> some new inspiration will do.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Take me wherever you can, Fujimaru.<br> France would be nice for now.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What are you doing, Mash? You&#39;re coming, too.<br> We&#39;ll end up dying if it&#39;s just me and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew.<br> Is this place alright with you, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Yes. Anywhere is okay as long as I can stay away from my desk. Let&#39;s enjoy the city of France first...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, hostiles approaching! Looks like ghosts from the Hundred Years&#39; War manifested using the Grail&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmm. Soldiers from the past are reappearing?<br> Interesting, why don&#39;t you play with them, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;m against physical labor but I will bear with it to get something to write about.<br> Make this battle a good one, yeah?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Not bad. I never thought of this.<br> But perhaps it was too late.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash.<br> Let&#39;s move on to the next location.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You went on quite a rampage in Rome, correct?<br> Then let&#39;s head to the Italian Peninsula, where my heart belongs!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t do it by choice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you said you hate physical labor...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Skip the commentary, and you call yourself my editor?<br> Let&#39;s go check the next observation object already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Apparently, we&#39;ve pushed his buttons as a writer.<br> Let&#39;s just accept it and keep him company.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I found you!<br> How do you do? Take that!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with you people! Especially that kid there! His face has &quot;bad guy&quot; written all over it!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Wow, so aggressive! As expected of Roman Soldiers, their brains are always on vacation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mister, with all due respect. Anybody would get mad if a stranger suddenly threw a mud ball at their face.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What? All I did was add fuel to the fire!<br> Fujimaru, make sure you keep them alive this time, too!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> \u2014Well.<br> Now that we&#39;ve finally ventured out into the ocean.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Ohhhh, our prey is coming to us!<br> Guys, this is a non-stop party!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Should we strip them? Or strangle them? Ridicule them?<br> Whatever. Let&#39;s just kill them and let off some steam!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are we surrounded?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re already in huge trouble?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, this is what happens when Andersen fixes the coordinates right on a pirate ship!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hahaha. Sorry, I underestimated the pirates&#39; IQs.<br> I had no idea how dumb they actually are.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> They aren&#39;t worth observing. I&#39;m going home.<br> You guys go ahead and beat them up for me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> They may be a memory of the sea, but they&#39;re still humans. Beat them to a pulp, and make them regret their actions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to tell us! We&#39;ll do that!<br> And you should reflect on your deeds for once, too!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Gotcha. Oh, Mash, about the sequel to The Little Mermaid, can I base the Prince on those pirates?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Absolutely not!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Now I&#39;m satisfied. Good work, Fujimaru.<br> I had an experience like no other thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re finally back.<br> We had a rough time, huh, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aimlessly fighting through all those eras...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was good combat experience for us,<br> but why did you do it, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> To observe people, of course. The weapons people of those eras used, how they fought.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Even primitive combat reflects human thought.<br> The differences of all those eras will make a great reference.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Observe people... Then, you must love mankind. Right, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Huh? Don&#39;t be stupid!<br> I&#39;ve no interest in mankind. I just needed data.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Not only the soldiers, I learned something about you two as well. Maybe I will write it into a book someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Being written about by one of the three greatest fairy tale authors, I&#39;m embarrassed just saying it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I think it would be a great honor.<br> Dr. Roman would get so jealous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right.<br> Count me out, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re a more thoughtful person than I imagined, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You two get along so well.<br> You&#39;re so easygoing.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I made a contract with you as a Servant because I had no choice, but now I&#39;ve changed my mind.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to find partners for this crazy fieldwork, you know.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ll get a little more fired up from now on.<br> A little. Very little. A tiny bit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I was able to help you write, Mr. Andersen.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t you understand that&#39;s a separate matter?<br> This is why I hate my readers...</p>', 106);
