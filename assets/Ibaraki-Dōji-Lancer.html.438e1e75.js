It is said that while she was alive, using this power, she broke through the seclusion of the detestable Tsuna and took back her arm that was cut off by him.[3]</p><p>In addition, in this work, Ibaraki Douji has lost to Watanabe no Tsuna at Rashoumon and at Ichijou-Modoribashi too. She was defeated by Tsuna twice in a row.</p><p>When releasing the True Name, despite intending to fire her max powered Heian Rocket Punch - in other words, her Sougenbi - just like when she is a Berserker, for some reason 5 spears manifest simultaneously &quot;as if they were five giant fingers&quot; instead and, after turning into a humongous fist, an uppercut is unleashed. The enemy that receives the attack is launched high into the air, shining brilliantly in the Summer night sky, just like fireworks.<br> The five spears that are like five huge fingers...<br> &quot;Perhaps these five spears are mine own five fingers?&quot;</p><p>The True Name, &quot;The Praise of Folly\u30FBIchijou-Modoribashi&quot; and its reading were thought up by Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter upon Ibaraki&#39;s request.<br> &quot;Is something like this fine for a True Name? Or should it be special since your Saint Graph has been tampered with?&quot;<br> &quot;I-I don&#39;t get it...&quot;<br> In addition, wondering what True Name to use in case she got a new Noble Phantasm, she consulted with Shuten-douji who replied with &quot;Wouldn&#39;t Ooeyama Great Fireworks be fine?&quot;. And so, the form of Ibaraki uttering &#39;Ooeyama Great Fireworks&#39; as a different True Name release upon using her Noble Phantasm can be seen.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First person pronoun: ware (\u543E)<br> Second person pronoun: nare (\u6C5D)/\u25CB\u25CB (no honorifics)/human (for humans)<br> Third person pronoun: yatsu(\u5974)/are</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>She seems like the usual Ibaraki Douji.<br> She hasn&#39;t changed that much in character either.<br> If you look at it from another angle, it&#39;s to the extent of whether &quot;she&#39;s become more cheery&quot; or not, though pointing that out to her will definitely get you bitten. However, when Shuten-douji went &quot;You&#39;re awfully cheerful and restless and, well, you look lovely behaving like a child.

In the end, I made it so the tattoos on the shoulders and arms were not connected. Later, in her third ascension, her abdomen was exposed too and I left that without tattoos. With that said, when I was drawing the tattoos, I had every intention to draw them correctly, but each time they were ever slightly off which was quite the conundrum... (Hidari)</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes</h2><p>[1] &quot;Otogizoushi refers to a group of approximately 350 Japanese prose narratives written primarily in the Muromachi period. These illustrated short stories, which remain unattributed, together form one of the representative literary genres of the Japanese medieval era.&quot; Taken from jisho.org.<br> [2] Metaphor for the unpredictability of the fate that lies ahead or something like that.<br> [3] There is a story about Tsuna giving a ride to a young beautiful girl on his horse to help her cross the Ichijou-Modoribashi bridge (a bridge in Kyoto). The girl then suddenly turns into Ibaraki-douji and grabs him by the hair before leaping into the sky to take Tsuna to Mount Atago. Without getting flustered or panicking, Tsuna uses his sword, Beard-Cutter, to lop off Ibaraki&#39;s arm and manages to escape with some difficulty.</p><p>Then, Tsuna shows the arm to Raikou, who goes to consult an onmyouji (who&#39;s Abe no Seimei himself in some stories). Since the oni will definitely return for her arm, Tsuna is told by the onmyouji to seclude himself in his home for seven days and to not let anybody in. In these 7 days, Ibaraki uses various methods to break into Tsuna&#39;s residence, however she is stopped by the talismans plastered everywhere and the Humane King Sutra that Tsuna is chanting constantly.</p><p>On the 7th day, Tsuna&#39;s aunt (in some sources his foster-mother), Mashiba, comes to visit Tsuna. However, since he was forbidden from letting anyone in, Tsuna has to turn her away. &quot;So the reward for raising you with great care since a very young age is this poor treatment&quot;, hearing such sad lamentation, Tsuna has no choice but to violate the orders he was given and let his aunt in. Said aunt is really curious about the arm of the oni that Tsuna cut off so she is led to a six-legged Chinese-style chest where the arm was sealed. Tsuna takes it out and hands it over to his aunt so she can get a better look at it. At this moment, the aunt transforms into none other than Ibaraki Douji, who quickly absconds with her arm and vanishes into thin air...</p><p>So that&#39;s how Ibaraki broke through Tsuna&#39;s seclusion which probably served as the concept for her Noble Phantasm.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 63);
