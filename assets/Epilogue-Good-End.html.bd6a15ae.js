What is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um... You&#39;re Saber, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am Saber. Or do I look like Archer or Lancer to you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course not. You don&#39;t look like anyone else at all.&quot;</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>&quot;Exactly.

I&#39;m glad to be able to see you again.&quot;</p><p>I tell her the first thing that pops into my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Shirou. I am glad as well to be able to greet you again.&quot;</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>She shows no worry that she might disappear anytime soon.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But how can you remain in this world? Um, the Holy Grail doesn&#39;t exist anymore, right?</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I stop before I tell her that Servants can&#39;t exist in this world without the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou. Please ask Rin about this matter. She is waiting for you to realize that she is there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, I turn around.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What a blunt response. You&#39;re all kind to Saber, but a mere &#39;oh&#39; is what I get?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re here, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am! I was waiting around here since you didn&#39;t wake up after that!&quot;</p><p>She glares at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you were staying at my house!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I had to treat your wounds, and I have to convince Fujimura-Sensei and Sakura. I can&#39;t leave you and go home by myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015you&#39;re right. ...I&#39;m sorry, Tohsaka. I caused you trouble again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t worry about thanking me. It wasn&#39;t that much trouble. And besides, you&#39;re the biggest contributor to our victory. Take it as your reward. We&#39;ll let it slide for today.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so while she looks away.</p><p>Tohsaka acts so much like herself that it relieves me.</p><p>Just as Saber and I are safe, Tohsaka also survived the battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Thanks for everything, Tohsaka.</p><p>A lot&#39;s happened, but we made it back.&quot;</p><p>I put my hand out to show my thanks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, you&#39;re right. Nobody died, so it&#39;s a complete victory for us. I guess the word &#39;congratulations&#39; fits this moment.&quot;</p><p>She shakes my hand with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s troubling because her hand is soft and reminds me of that night.</p><p>I blush, but we feel each other&#39;s existence in our hands.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015So, what did you do to Saber?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? I didn&#39;t do anything to Saber. Our contract still exists, so she&#39;s still my familiar. Saber&#39;s the strongest familiar, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;d let her go, right?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka replies as if it&#39;s natural.</p><p>But it&#39;s not that simple.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. Saber became a Servant in exchange for the Holy Grail. She should be set free since her reward&#39;s gone now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Did you hear that, Saber? Shirou is saying you should go back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015n-no...! That&#39;s not true!</p><p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that there&#39;s no meaning in keeping you as a familiar\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There is. Saber cannot stay in this world unless she has a contract with a magus, since the Holy Grail doesn&#39;t exist anymore. Having her become my familiar is the best way, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;First of all, I&#39;m giving Saber most of my magical energy, so she should work to compensate for that. The fundamental rule of magecraft is equivalent exchange.</p><p>Or what? Are you not happy that Saber stayed?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Of course I&#39;m happy...!</p><p>But isn&#39;t it wrong that she&#39;s still a Servant?</p><p>And\u2015\u2015\u2015can you even keep her in this world without a Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>...Right, that&#39;s the biggest problem.</p><p>It&#39;s beyond human capabilities to make a heroic spirit into a familiar.</p><p>Even if Tohsaka is a superior magus, it should be impossible for her to keep Saber in this world.</p><hr><p>...So there&#39;s only one way.</p><p>A familiar that cannot live off of the contractor&#39;s magical energy needs to replenish her powers from elsewhere.</p><p>Like taking souls from the people in town, just like what Rider did\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking with that gloomy face, but hear me through.</p><p>Look, it certainly is hard for me to maintain Saber by myself. But we have one more magus here. We should be able to maintain Saber with the two of us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...!? You mean me!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. Who else is here?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m glad you&#39;re counting on me, but that&#39;s troubling. I don&#39;t know anything about contracts, and I can&#39;t do anything so skillful.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I already took that into consideration.</p><p>I&#39;ll supply Saber with magical energy, so all you need to do is help me. I won&#39;t be as bad as Saber, but I&#39;ll be at an inconvenience as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s angry about, but Tohsaka explains while looking away.</p><p>Let&#39;s put that aside for now.</p><p>&quot;...? What do you mean by &#39;help&#39;?&quot;</p><p>I address the biggest question I have.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Well, a lot of things. It&#39;s not something I should mention, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Sorry, you lost me. Don&#39;t be lazy and explain it to me properly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s just stuff, okay!? Come on, you know what I mean, you idiot!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>D-Damn, my ears are ringing... What&#39;s up with Tohsaka, yelling like that all of a sudden?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. Anyways, it&#39;s just that I can keep Saber in this world by keeping her as my familiar.</p><p>You want Saber to stay, right?</p><p>Then this is all good.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm.&quot;</p><p>Well, it is good if Saber can stay.</p><p>But that&#39;s only the case if Saber consents.</p><p>It&#39;s wrong to keep her in this world if Saber doesn&#39;t want to stay here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Do you have something against me staying here?&quot;</p><p>Saber must have sensed my concern.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I have no objections.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to object, but this is something I have to ask.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. There is no Holy Grail in this town. Your wish won&#39;t come true even if you stay here.</p><p>...Is that fine for you...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I am staying in this world out of my own will.</p><p>...I would like to watch over you until the very end.</p><p>He said that my way is wrong. ...I would like for you to tell me the answer to that someday.&quot;</p><hr><p>Her voice is gentle, yet it contains a strong will.</p><p>It&#39;s just like that night.</p><p>It is the pure voice that told me of our contract on our first night together.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I know I will be a nuisance, but please forgive me.</p><p>As compensation, I shall be of help to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I stare back at her.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to meet her expectations.</p><p>But I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t stray from my path if she watches over me\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, all right!</p><p>It&#39;s fine if you two stare at each other, but the conversation&#39;s not going anywhere like that!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...!? W-Why the loud voice? You scared me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. It&#39;s because you two are flirting.</p><p>Listen up. Let&#39;s get back on topic, okay?</p><p>Saber has a contract with me, and Shirou is to support me. It&#39;s an ex-post-facto approval, but are you two all right with that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I have no objection if Saber&#39;s fine with that.</p><p>But what do you mean by support? I don&#39;t get what I should do, so I&#39;m a bit reluctant to agree.&quot;</p><p>I ask Saber for consent.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It should be difficult for Shirou to make a promise he does not know about.</p><p>Rin, what do you mean by having Shirou help you?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber asks her, and Tohsaka retreats.</p><p>Good, good.</p><p>Even Tohsaka should give up if a third party gives an unbiased opinion.</p><hr><p>&quot;See. Saber&#39;s saying so too, so give me a clear explanation.&quot;</p><p>This has to be my chance.</p><p>But.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sheesh, just be quiet!</p><p>Saber is mine, and you&#39;re mine too, so don&#39;t argue back to me!</p><p>Familiars should listen to their master without talking back!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka has apparently established a dictatorship.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, hold on. I&#39;m not yours, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What!? You made a contract with me!</p><p>You&#39;ve been like my familiar from the moment you took my magical energy, so I&#39;m allowed to be this selfish...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s pressuring me. I recall what happened that night and freeze up.</p><p>...And I can tell that...</p><p>&#39;Crap, I&#39;m saying a ridiculous thing!&#39;</p><p>...Tohsaka clearly regrets saying that, and I kind of feel sorry for her.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I did manage to survive because of your magical energy, and it&#39;s true that we made a contract, so I guess that&#39;s one way to put it...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh. It is true!</p><p>So that&#39;s all. Our cooperation is still intact.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Furthermore, I don&#39;t want an amateur for a partner, so I&#39;m going to have you become a proper magus.</p><p>I&#39;m going to teach you magecraft and Saber&#39;s going to be teaching you how to fight. We&#39;re going to be hard on you, so prepare yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m surprised at the sudden proposal.</p><p>It&#39;s really great, but that, um, means...</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. You&#39;re going to become my teacher...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It can&#39;t be helped, right? There&#39;s no other suitable person.</p><p>A-And you&#39;re mine, so I can&#39;t let anyone else take care of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s unfair.</p><p>It&#39;s really embarrassing if she says something like that with a red face.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>We&#39;re both blushing, and we keep standing there not knowing what to say.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I need more training.</p><p>I can&#39;t speak because I&#39;m so conscious of her.</p><hr><p>And right before Tohsaka goes on a rampage due to too much pressure...</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. This case is settled, so let us go eat breakfast.&quot;</p><p>Saber offers timely help.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right. I&#39;m getting hungry too. You haven&#39;t eaten breakfast yet, right, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is acting awkward.</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No. I did cook breakfast right after I woke up, but I came here before I ate it.&quot;</p><p>I answer awkwardly as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Then you already made breakfast?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. There&#39;s two servings of toast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Wow, you sure are thoughtful.</p><p>Let&#39;s hurry. Let&#39;s go to the living room, Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>Where did the previous awkwardness go? Tohsaka pulls Saber with her and leaves the dojo.</p><hr><p>I watch them go in blank amazement.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, what are you standing there for, Shirou!?</p><p>We can&#39;t start eating until we&#39;re all there!&quot;</p><hr><p>She calls back to me while pulling Saber forward with her.</p><p>Tohsaka is waving to me from the yard.</p><p>&quot;...Man. She really doesn&#39;t wait around.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s been taking the initiative so many times, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be in the future.</p><p>This is just an everyday thing if I am to be with her.</p><p>You cannot be with Tohsaka unless you&#39;re really prepared.</p><p>But, to put it her way, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>She was able to make it this far because she&#39;s like that, and that&#39;s exactly the girl I fell in love with.</p><p>&quot;Come on, hurry up! We&#39;re going to start eating without you!&quot;</p><p>Even though she says this, she&#39;s standing there and waiting for me.</p><p>She&#39;s always complaining and cold-hearted, but she&#39;s really good-natured deep down.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m coming\u2015\u2015\u2015!
