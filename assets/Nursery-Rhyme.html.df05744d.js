When you performed the second Ascension,<br> she gained the form of a young girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So why has she regressed to her original form?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t speak, either.<br> This is\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh-oh! I&#39;m detecting magical energy in your vicinity!<br> It looks like her, but it&#39;s not!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re trying to surround you,<br> which means they&#39;re probably enemies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare for combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger, Master!<br> Give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemies defeated.<br> ...She helped us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means that, yup, Nursery Rhyme accepts Fujimaru as her Master.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s a book, so she doesn&#39;t talk, though.<br> What is happening, exactly?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Keep looking into it, Doctor.<br> It appears we&#39;ve got more enemies approaching.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, give me your orders.<br> The battle continues!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Battle is over. We&#39;ve defeated them.<br> Good work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not getting anywhere with my analysis, but I have news. There&#39;s something very similar to Nursery Rhyme nearby.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That army of books was similar to her,<br> but this is more like an exact copy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This might be what pulled you into that space.<br> Can you try talking to it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nothing else to do anyway</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, Senpai.<br> Let&#39;s move\u2013You too, Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, when you move,<br> she follows you, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That book&#39;s really attached.<br> That&#39;s really...rather nice...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah.<br> It feels like watching a cute little animal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seems like it&#39;s up ahead.<br> I can feel the response.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Here it comes. Looks like it&#39;s approaching.<br> It might be an enemy, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> \u2013Hello, the other me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I missed you, book me!<br> Emotions folded in-between the pages.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I missed you, real me! The me who can do nothing without fingers to flip the pages.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I am me, Alice.<br> You are me, a story.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> No, no. I am me.<br> I&#39;m not Alice. You stay in that form, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Alice?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Two Nursery Rhymes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, exactly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the one that&#39;s connected to you by contract is the one that&#39;s a book.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But at the same time...<br> That girl over there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t seem to be a fake Nursery Rhyme.<br> Her magical energy feels too similar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I got a detailed analysis now that you&#39;re closer\u2013<br> Yup, Mash is right. Their magical energy response is identical.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s too identical.<br> Like another copy of the same being?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I want to say that&#39;s impossible,<br> but where you are, in a way, is inside Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible that her core is split into two beings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In other words?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dumb it down for me!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re both her.<br> It&#39;s a possibility.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014Correct.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It talked!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fou!)</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014That&#39;s me. The other me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014The me in Alice&#39;s form.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014The Alice that shouldn&#39;t exist<br> \u2014Because I imitated that form.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014I thought to myself.<br> \u2014That form is Alice&#39;s, but...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014Is it okay for me to take it?<br> \u2014Can I be Alice when there is no Alice here?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> No, no, no. It&#39;s wrong!<br> I am just a story, right?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> Alice isn&#39;t here!<br> Only I&#39;m here!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I must stay a story.<br> I can&#39;t stay as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> Right\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ??</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see! So that&#39;s it!<br> Nursery Rhyme isn&#39;t supposed to have a human form!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But the Ascension gave her the form of a little girl.<br> That self-contradiction grew within her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So she called Fujimaru, her Master,<br> deep inside her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s trying to get an answer, isn&#39;t she?<br> About which form she should choose.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The book Nursery Rhyme is uncertain.<br> The girl Nursery Rhyme wants to reject it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s ask her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s her choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Senpai.<br> ...Nursery Rhyme, the answer is within you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can&#39;t answer for you.<br> We don&#39;t know what that girl&#39;s form means to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know why you&#39;re hesitating.<br> Or who or what you&#39;re thinking of.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014I am me. I know that.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014But I want to be Alice.<br> \u2014I want that form, if I can have it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014I want to drink sweet, sweet tea as Alice.<br> \u2014I want to eat sweet, sweet candy as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014I want to play, as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...That was what Alice longed to do,<br> ...when she held me in her arms until the very end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s your answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I see. So that was my decision.<br> But I won&#39;t allow it!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I am me. Alice isn&#39;t here!<br> I won&#39;t let you pretend this is a happy ending!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Magical energy response expanding!<br> Here she comes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Enemy unit defeated.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> Hmph. Actually, I knew how this was going to end.<br> If Alice isn&#39;t here\u2013</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> I can just become Alice.<br> That&#39;s the kind of dumb idea I&#39;d get now.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> Listen, me.<br> If you&#39;re going to choose Alice&#39;s form...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> Never...let your...<br> story have...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong><br> an unhappy ending...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> \u2014Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make it a happy ending.<br> I&#39;ll do my best for Alice.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, I guess we&#39;re done!<br> That weird space is closing, I think, so yeah!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use the Rayshift technology to get you back to Chaldea.
