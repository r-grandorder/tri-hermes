I am the world&#39;s greatest detective, as well as its only consulting one.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am both the progenitor of all detectives, and the essence of the very concept\u2013one who reveals truth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Today, I am here to guide you all towards a new mystery, and the facts that lie at its core.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I originally became involved with Chaldea when I began investigating the Incineration of Humanity incident in 2018, when I played a part in the Fourth and Sixth Singularities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, once Goetia, the King of Demon Gods, was defeated, and his plan to incinerate humanity foiled, the world was faced with a new crisis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I speak, of course, of the bleaching of humanity\u2013an event that has resulted in the entire earth being wiped clean save for the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As you all surely know, this incident led to my gaining an official administrative advisor position at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And I must say, it suits me rather nicely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While I continue to act as a detective, naturally, I&#39;ve also found the work of supporting a larger organization to be quite stimulating.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid there<br> is little room for optimism...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...given the sheer scale of this case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> My current theory is that in a sense, this bleached Earth phenomenon pairs directly with the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> When Goetia incinerated all of human history, he did so by starting in 2018 and going back in time to collect the necessary energy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is to say, the infamous king never bothered to collect energy from the future, because he knew there would be no human history from which to collect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So using 2018 as a single turning point, he headed back towards the past and succeeded at destroying humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Conversely, this great reset has left the past untouched, destroying humanity now, robbing it of its future.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Given these facts, one could argue that the King of Demon Gods&#39; plan was intended to avoid this very future...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...as it involved incinerating humanity and remaking Earth before it was wiped clean.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is a dreadful problem and a horrific mystery. Even Goetia believed it beyond his ability to resolve.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Bad as things are, we cannot afford to stop seeking a solution. Not if we are to regain humanity, and everything else that was lost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We cannot\u2013will not give up.<br> No matter what manner of hell may await us...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...we must continue onward. We must.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I, in turn, will naturally continue to provide my full support.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I WILL solve this case, even if I must consume every last bit of energy in my Spirit Core to do so.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Why, you ask? Why else?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Because...I am the greatest detective.I am Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...Okay, Mr. Holmes, I&#39;ve finished changing the security levels on all the Lostbelt records.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> What would you like to do about the library&#39;s request for hard copies of them?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite all right. I&#39;m happy to authorize it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All parties involved with those incidents already have the clearance to view those records freely, so it shouldn&#39;t pose a problem.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> More so given that these hard copies will be for Novum Chaldea&#39;s own underground library. There is not a single person here who isn&#39;t part of Chaldea, and therefore involved in some way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sure to let the director know about this.<br> Thank you, Mr. Jekyll, that&#39;ll be all.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome.<br> Please let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can do.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be cooped up in the central computer room for<br> a while to assist Ms. Da Vinci and Sir Babbage...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...but if you need my help with anything,<br> I can be here at a moment&#39;s notice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Much obliged.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are those two friends or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They seem like they&#39;ve known each other for a long time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know what you mean, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They seem very comfortable working together,<br> if not outright close with each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It really is like they&#39;re old friends!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then again, maybe it&#39;s no surprise considering when the books based on parts of their lives came out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u201D was written in the late nineteenth century, and while Sherlock Holmes novels continued to be published well into the twentieth century...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...the first ones also came out around the end of the nineteenth! Not to mention they&#39;re both set in London!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Ah, now I see. I thought I had told you two this,<br> but I guess I never got around to it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I knew Mr. Holmes back when I was alive. He was always very kind to me.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> We&#39;ve only had time for brief hellos here and there since we both came to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...but now that I finally know how to use a computer,<br> I thought I would help him out when I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you knew each other when you were both alive, huh? That explains it!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. In your...past life, Holmes?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come to think of it, you never did give me a straightanswer about whether you really existed or not...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Are you certain? That particular topic can get rather thorny quite quickly, to be honest...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, I&#39;m always willing to obfuscate when necessary.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the irony of me saying this as a short-lived Heroic Spirit is not lost on me, as a general rule, one mustn&#39;t try to unravel Mystics or the past.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s not to say Mystics are a significant part of either Mr. Jekyll&#39;s past or my own...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But regardless, one&#39;s past is one&#39;s past.<br> Dig too deep, and\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then again, I wouldn&#39;t want to be so coy<br> that you end up distrusting me, either!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Rest assured, at this point, I have no intentions of covering up anything that is clearly a matter of public record. Yes, Jekyll and I were indeed acquaintances in our lifetimes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-then, does that mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...you and Mr. Hyde once went toe-to-toe like something straight out of a fan-fiction dream match!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I do love that you&#39;re clearly such an avid reader, Ms. Kyrielight! And indeed, it&#39;s little wonder that question would be foremost in your mind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, I am sorry to say, the circumstances of how we came to meet were not nearly so exciting as that. If anything...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...they were one of my most embarrassing failures.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I only wish I had never tried to avoid facing Mr. Hyde...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Mr. Holmes. It&#39;s mine.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m the one who agreed to organize those case records, and read some of the ones I was clearly told not to.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Not to mention I was the one who ended up entangled in the spiderweb connected to those records...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...laid by the diabolical Moriarty</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Moriarty?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What???</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I was always fascinated by evil.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> So I think when I tracked down Moriarty, the wicked spider himself, my own evil side couldn&#39;t resist facing off with him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-hang on, Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In R. L. Stevenson&#39;s novella, Dr. Jekyll drinks an experimental serum that causes him to gain a new, evil personality, the titular Mr. Hyde.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As Mr. Hyde, his very body transforms to reflect his wicked nature, and he undertakes a series of awful deeds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dr. Jekyll is so aghast by this turn of events that he ends up killing Mr. Hyde by taking his own life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And from what I&#39;ve heard, the novella is a fairly accurate depiction of the events of your life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, based on what you just said...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It sounds as though the Professor\u2013<br> or rather, James Moriarty...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...was somehow involved in you becoming Mr. Hyde?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Could you tell us more about what happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s not a pleasant story.<br> In fact, it&#39;s really quite depressing...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> And since Moriarty wasn&#39;t directly involved,<br> there&#39;s really no need to go into it...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He may not have been directly involved, no...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But what about indirectly?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In time, the ingredients required for your serum became much harder to come by, no? That was his doing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While I didn&#39;t learn this until after the case was closed, there was a time when the Clock Tower&#39;s alchemical catalysts were\u2013</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> A-ahem!<br> N-never mind that now!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re all here now, Mr. Holmes, this seems as good a time as any to ask you something I&#39;ve been curious about!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> O-oh? And what might that be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, Jekyll, don&#39;t change the subject now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, I wanted to hear more about what Moriarty did!</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> (Master!)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> (I&#39;m rapidly losing confidence in my ability to suppress my, um, urges...)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> (And I&#39;m worried Hyde may put in an appearance if we keep this discussion going for too long!)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> (So please, help me change the subject!<br> I&#39;m begging you!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Well, in that case...)</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> (Thank you, Master!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai? Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Yes, um, you mentioned the Clock Tower, Mr. Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You know, I engaged in many different fields of study back in my day. I earned doctorates in law and medicine, a spot in the Royal Society of Scientists, and eventually even uncovered some of alchemy&#39;s greatest secrets...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> But in spite of all that, I never managed to set foot inside the Clock Tower. Apparently, not even my magecraft-adjacent work with alchemy was enough to gain entrance.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> In the end, I went to my grave knowing nothing about mages, the Mage&#39;s Association, the Clock Tower, or anything else pertaining to that world.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...But the same isn&#39;t true for you, is it?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> The fact that you mentioned the Clock Tower at all<br> tells me you must have known that magecraft\u2013</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> \u2013That is, incredible Mystics exist in this world, even as they&#39;re unbeknownst to almost all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Well, yes, I suppose I did.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, you knew the Clock Tower circa 1900!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I knew of it, yes,<br> but my knowledge was strictly secondhand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At the time, I&#39;d decided to keep my distance from Mystics and other things of that sort.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I believed that my domain, and the cases I investigated, were solely within the human world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However...there were times when I unwittingly<br> encroached on the world beyond.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For example, in The Adventure of the Speckled Band\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Adventure of the Speckled Band!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, um, do you know that one, Senpai?<br> If you don&#39;t, I&#39;d hate to ruin it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I do, so don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Adventure of the Speckled Band was one of the<br> most popular Sherlock Holmes stories of its day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It begins when a woman from Surrey asks Holmes to<br> investigate the circumstances of her twin sister&#39;s death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her sister died in a locked room, with seemingly no way for the killer to get in or out, and the last words she spoke were \u201CThe speckled band!\u201D In the end, it&#39;s revealed that\u2013</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> The \u201Cspeckled band\u201D was actually a venomous snake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. The speckled band was a snake the killer had been controlling by whistling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It had an incredible plot twist at the end, and I have no doubt that Holmes fans at the time enjoyed it a lot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, it has one big plot hole: the fact that\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Snakes, lacking ears, cannot distinguish between whistle tones. And that&#39;s hardly the story&#39;s only oddity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s also the fact that the killer enticed the snake with milk, the fact that the snake&#39;s venom should not kill its victims so quickly...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Truly, there is no end of contradictions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So if the story as written couldn&#39;t be true,<br> what actually happened? I&#39;ll tell you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t, so yes, please keep the spoilers to a minimum!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! In that case, I&#39;ll do my<br> best to skip over the details.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Basically, it&#39;s a locked-room murder mystery where the victim is killed under seemingly impossible circumstances.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes managed to solve it brilliantly, of course, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Scientifically speaking, the \u201Ctruth\u201D still left a number of unanswered questions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that for a story, but if this case really happened as depicted\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would mean there are still<br> greater truths yet to be told.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So if the story as written couldn&#39;t be true,<br> what actually happened? I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I suppose this may inevitably get into spoiler territory, as they say, but rest assured that it will still be a far cry from the events of the novel!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...There is great evil at work in this case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A man of incredible intelligence is using his unique<br> talents to commit crimes. I can think of no worse scenario.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At any rate, it won&#39;t be long now, Watson.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very soon, the instrument of our villain&#39;s wicked ambitions will come to this room very in search of more prey.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I trust you have your pistol at the ready?</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean!? What instrument!?</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> And hang on: you have ME playing Dr. Watson!?</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> G-granted, you certainly help me out a lot, Administrative Advisor, so I&#39;m not entirely unwilling to join you in retelling one of your old escapades...</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> And I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not honored that you chose me for the distinguished role of your most trusted colleague\u2013one famously played by Edward Hardwicke, no less! Very well then, so be it!</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> ...What are we about to see, Sherlock!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Some sort of curse. There is no more fitting term.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It comes from the Clock Tower&#39;s domain\u2013the world of magecraft. It may sound fanciful, but I assure you that its wicked power is very real!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect the responsible party is most likely a Clock Tower dropout or, on the other end of the spectrum, a Seal Designated mage.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Here it comes!</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaah! It&#39;s heeeeeeeeere!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I must say, whoever let something like this slip out of the Clock Tower ought to be ashamed. Not that any admonishment will do us much good at the moment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Come, Watson, let&#39;s take care of it!</p><p>\uFF0491-90-05-01-1-1</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s over! It&#39;s finally over!<br> (Huff, gasp...)</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Wh-what in the world was that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The sign that this case is now closed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> An evil Dark Arts practitioner was using curses with physical forms to murder his victims...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but now that his curse has been routed,<br> it&#39;s going to come crashing down on his head.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect he&#39;s dying from the recoil over in the next room as we speak. As they say, violence invites violence.</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Then, you mean when I was shooting that monster just now, I was actually shooting the dastardly villain behind this latest murder?</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> I s-say, couldn&#39;t you have said something sooner?<br> I ended up firing every last bullet I had into it...</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> ...No, that doesn&#39;t sound like something Watson would<br> say. Let&#39;s see... Damn, this is harder than it looks.</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> On a different note, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m ever<br> going to turn this incident into a book...</p><p><strong>Watson:</strong><br> Not to mention that if I write about what actually<br> happened, I&#39;m liable to draw the Clock Tower&#39;s attention...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s quite all right, Watson.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come up with something!</p><p>\uFF0491-90-05-01-2-0</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And there you have it. In the published record of these events\u2013Sir Conan Doyle&#39;s novel, to be precise...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...a different \u201Ctruth\u201D was substituted for the<br> actual facts of the case, as one would expect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Nor was that the only case where the Clock Tower&#39;s<br> involvement, or magecraft, was skirted around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean there were others!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what about The Hound of the Baskervilles!? I&#39;ve always thought there were some things that didn&#39;t add up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did it actually have something to do with the black dogs that appear in British folklore!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, it did. Most perceptive, Ms. Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you full<br> marks for that insight alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t only the black dog, you see. As a matter of fact, the King of the Storm was also involved with\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...On second thought, I&#39;d best not say any more.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect it will be far more entertaining once I&#39;ve had a word with Mr. Edison about filming it for the big screen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><h4 id="" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#" aria-hidden="true">#</a> !!!</h4><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.<br> D-does that mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...there might be a brand-new Sherlock Holmes<br> movie made here at Novum Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Easy, Mash! Just take it easy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Your eyes are literally glittering with excitement, Mash...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you hear that, Senpai!? Speaking as a huge fan of both the original books and the movie adaptations, this may be the biggest news since\u2013</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Goodness, it&#39;s so lively in here!<br> Hehe, what&#39;s everyone talking about?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Whatever it is, it certainly can&#39;t be an evil scheme<br> if it&#39;s got Mash so excited. Hehe, so what&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Helena!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Good day, Madame Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahaha, don&#39;t be ridiculous, my dear Yelena. You know I would never engage in any manner of scheming.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know, Sigerson.<br> You&#39;ve definitely got a mischievous side to you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahahaha.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sigerson! That&#39;s one of Holmes&#39;s aliases<br> he used in the original stories!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re all reminiscing, huh?<br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Did you hear the one about the Himalayas yet?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> What about the... What did people call it again,<br> Siger\u2013Mr. Holmes? The Great Hiatus?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t heard the one about the Himalayas yet,<br> no... But I do know about the Great Hiatus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Great Hiatus, huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see you know about it too, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know about it, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a roughly three-year period of time between May 4, 1891, the day Holmes goes over the Reichenbach Falls with Professor Moriarty...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and April 5, 1894, the day he reveals to Watson that he&#39;s still alive!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Sherlock Holmes fandom refers to<br> this period as the Great Hiatus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The explanation Holmes gives for his absence<br> during this period in the books...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...is that he spent this time overseas<br> in places like Tibet and Persia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So then, when Holmes was off in Tibet\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yup! After he and I both faked our deaths in<br> 1891\u2013him at Reichenbach, me in London\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> We went around exploring the Himalayas together!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Ugh, I can&#39;t believe this.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Why would the Clock Tower youngsters be coming<br> after me now? Did I do something to upset them?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> They&#39;ve left me alone for years, saying they don&#39;t care what I do since there&#39;s no such thing as Mahatma anyway...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> And now, out of the blue, they start sending assassins after me?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> I expect they became more wary of you by virtue<br> of the fact that you faked your death.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Wary?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Given the \u201Cgenius\u201D Madame Blavatsky&#39;s success at bringing modern occultism into mainstream Western society...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> ...they must have thought you were about to make a move on the magecraft world now that your public persona is gone.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Or something to that effect.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You think they were paying that much attention to me?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Hmm. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that<br> you lack awareness of your own importance.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> But whether you are aware of it or not, Madame Blavatsky, the fact remains that modern-day Europe is in the midst of an unprecedented occult boom.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> While it may not have reached the world of true magecraft, the group of people who believe in ghosts and supernatural phenomena is far greater than you think.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Even the criticisms leveled by the Society for Psychical Research have done nothing to turn the tide. At this point, it is a genuine social phenomenon.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Which is why the Clock Tower, and the Mage&#39;s Association, cannot afford to completely ignore it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Remember, they were supposedly forced to add a new department at the turn of the last century thanks to Count Cagliostro&#39;s influence.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> And if that is true, you can be certain they<br> are keeping a close eye on you as well!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If only they knew I just wanted to let Annie deal<br> with that stuff so I could be free.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Ah yes, Annie Besant, Madame Blavatsky&#39;s successor to present-day theosophy.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> That&#39;s her.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I just wanted to stop being Grandma Helena,<br> the old occultist lady who founded theosophy.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to deal with the British SPR and their incessant complaining, the Theosophical Society... Even my beloved Mahatma!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I just wanted to be free of everything...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...and live an ordinary life as a kind,<br> gentle girl\u2013one full of hope and possibility.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But I guess I never will, thanks to the Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> It may not be the entire Clock Tower behind this. It could simply be Policies, or perhaps one of the other departments going off on their\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Who cares? It doesn&#39;t change my situation.<br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I was really looking forward to coming to the Himalayas. You were too, right?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> I was excited about seeing secret, winged Demonic Beasts in a land where no one else has ever set foot!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But instead of some Phantasmals...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...all we got were assassins and the Chimeras they<br> brought with them. Ugh. I&#39;m sorry you have to deal with this.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Reinforcements, hmm.<br> Stand back, Madam. I&#39;ll take care of them.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Thanks, Mr. Sigerson! I&#39;ll back you up!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Much obliged. Now, allow me to show<br> you once again what baritsu can do.</p><p>\uFF0491-90-05-01-3-0</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You threw a Chimera!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And you did all this when you were still alive!?</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Yup! Just picked it up, and WHOOSH!<br> I have to say, it flew surprisingly well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So your baritsu was just as strong when you were<br> alive as it is now... I should have known!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Remember, these were not the Phantasmals of Greek myth, but mere imitations devised by late nineteenth-century mages.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If slamming them against a wall was enough to shatter all their bones, it is safe to say they never truly posed a threat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In my estimation, they were no more<br> dangerous than, say, a wild lion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah, because those aren&#39;t dangerous at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And we all know how safe wild lions are.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Haha, a fair point. I certainly don&#39;t mean<br> to imply they posed no danger at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something on your mind, Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh? Did you just smile, Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Oh, uh, I was just...<br> How can I put this?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...I guess I was just a little...relieved to hear all that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> See, part of me thought that, now that Holmes had materialized here as a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...all the mystery surrounding him had been cleared up, leaving him with no more secrets.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> But clearly, I was wrong!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> It turns out that even when he was alive, he was breaking curses and throwing around man-made Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> So yes, I&#39;m happy to find that you&#39;re still just as much a mysterious gentleman as ever, Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Is that your way of paying me a compliment, Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> A mysterious gentleman, huh?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Mystery, mystery... Speaking of mysteries, there&#39;s still one big one about you, isn&#39;t there, Sigerson?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> We never did find out if you were originally a Rogue<br> Servant, or if somebody summoned you here. Which is it?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AScreen-Edge Phantom Gentleman:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> For that matter, how did you show up in the Sixth Singularity all on your\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Mmph.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Now, now, Ms. Blavatsky, I think that&#39;s quite enough for now, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> (That was close! She nearly ruined all the groundwork I&#39;ve been laying!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Professor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Professor?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> The spider!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, yes, I do beg your pardon.<br> It&#39;s nothing, really. Nothing at all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I know how it looks, but I simply noticed some magical energy pooling right around here and thought I&#39;d\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unhand the lady at once, Professor.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah, yes, of course.<br> My apologies, dear Madam.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> Anyway, did you handle this pool or whatever it was?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I did indeed.<br> Worry no more.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The man by which all other evil is measured.<br> The once king of villainy, and Napoleon of crime.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The wicked spider who trampled all over society without so much as a pang of conscience.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Surely I need not remind you of the many lives you ruined, or of the countless people you yourself hurt or killed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now here you are, claiming to be secretly good on the inside even as you remain steadfastly evil and unapologetic for your past crimes...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...and the first thing you do upon setting foot in<br> this room is sneak up behind Madame Blavatsky&#39;s back?<br> I&#39;d say this calls for a heaping helping of baritsu,<br> doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My, my, I could hear those knuckles cracking all the way over here! I suppose this just goes to show why one shouldn&#39;t indulge one&#39;s evil side too often!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Indeed, I have piled my misdeeds mountainously high!<br> Am I up to something even now? But of course!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Still, all that being said...let&#39;s not get ahead<br> of ourselves too quickly now, O Great Detective.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m hardly some cackling vampire going about making off with beautiful maidens, after all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Or did you genuinely think a few snide remarks<br> would be enough to get my goat at this point?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, Great Detective?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm. Great Detective.<br> What a positively stirring turn of phrase!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I take extreme issue with you calling yourself that, Holmes. Frankly, you&#39;ve got a lot of nerve, acting like you&#39;re some sort of hero of justice!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Or is my recollection of you naming yourself the ultimate arbiter of truth mistaken?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That you mediate facts in the name<br> of preserving human history?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is no need for humanity to know the full truth.<br> Indeed, they must never know.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is precisely why I was given this Ruler Spirit<br> Origin\u2013to be both a mediator, and an arbiter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is because I&#39;m meant to mediate facts and arbitrate all things to ensure that human history will always exist.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hehahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You created a noise block in the mainframe, caused a Valkyrie to go berserk, created a mechanical Elisabeth...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, it would take me days to recount your various misdeeds committed solely since coming to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You&#39;re the king spider, still scheming and plotting as much as ever, yet you act as though you are some benevolent protector of Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Where does the truth about you lie, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You wish to know where you can find it, old boy?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s enough!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If you two insist on fighting, you can do it<br> without getting Fujimaru and me mixed up in it!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Besides, just look at poor Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> M-me...?<br> D-d-d-don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m f-f-fine... Hahaha...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, no, you&#39;re definitely NOT fine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then what was Hyde doing there just now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re right, Senpai!<br> I thought I just saw Hyde there for a split second!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Okay, break it up! No more arguing!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> If you just can&#39;t help yourselves, then let&#39;s take<br> it outside the Command Room and into the simulator!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Would you do the honors, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go for it, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good idea! Let&#39;s let them get it out of their systems in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Arranging simulator settings now!<br> Um, let&#39;s see, how should I split up the teams...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Why, Team Detective vs. Evil Army, of course!<br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Mr. Hyde!?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> The hell you just say to me, gramps!?<br> All right, fine by me! I&#39;mma kill you ALL dead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now Jekyll\u2013I mean, Hyde is here!<br> And he looks like he&#39;s very, um, motivated to fight!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief. It would seem Moriarty has left us<br> with little choice but to clean up this mess!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like Holmes is raring to go too, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get this combat simulation started!</p><hr><p>\uFF0491-90-05-01-3-1</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Nooo! You got meee!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Oh, drat.<br> Now my favorite coat&#39;s all smudged.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Very well then, I think I&#39;ll be on my merry way.<br> Today&#39;s baritsu really did a number on my poor back!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, yes. That&#39;ll do, Hyde!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Huh!? The hell you talking about!?<br> I can keep this up all\u2013</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I said, that&#39;ll do.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> D-did I...turn into Hyde again?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, as they say nowadays... Sayonara, suckers!<br> Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief.<br> Seems he threw subtlety out the window today...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All that aside, this vision of London permeated by Demonic Fog certainly does bring back memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Fourth Singularity is where you accepted<br> that request from Babbage, right, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I still have yet to fully complete it, much to my chagrin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though the first murder of humanity was prevented when Goetia and his mass incineration plot were defeated...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...it was not long afterwards that a second plot to murder all of humanity began, in the form of the bleaching of Earth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is easily the largest murder case in all of history. As such, I must do everything I can to solve it, starting with finding out why the Foreign God did it...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, the Foreign God\u2013a mystery of truly unprecedented scale, and a being we still know nothing about despite having conquered numerous Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have no doubt I was given this Ruler Spirit Origin in order to unravel this mystery, and yet...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At any rate, as a detective,<br> I am obligated to determine what true evil is.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And given that I no longer have a human life to take care of, I am more detective now than I ever was in life.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, it may be no exaggeration to say that<br> I am the very essence of a detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Come to think of it...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never told you why I became a detective,<br> or what drives me to pursue cases.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have no doubt that Ms. Kyrielight is already<br> intimately familiar with my backstory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She has clearly read Sir Conan Doyle&#39;s novels thoroughly, as well as seen a number of their film adaptations.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But what about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course I know it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well thank you. I&#39;m pleased to hear that. In that case, I hope you&#39;ll indulge me in a quick refresher.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d like to hear it from you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As you wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Why did I become a detective?<br> There is one word that sums up my reasons nicely:</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Justice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Justice.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, justice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Believe it or not, I fight for justice\u2013<br> that is, what is good and right. Surprised?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While some famous detectives from modern stories seem concerned solely with solving mysteries for their own sake...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I am not one of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, I do have a fair bit of aptitude for making deductions as well, as you can most likely tell from the nature of my Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But even so, I remain the one and only Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And it is precisely because humanity is currently facing a true existential crisis that I must never completely forget where good and evil lie.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Murder is murder.<br> It cannot be overlooked, no matter what its scope.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So I will not turn a blind eye to one taking place before<br> my eyes, whether there is but one victim, or seven billion of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So we&#39;re really dealing with the murder of all of Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. We must not let it succeed, no matter the cost.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...What about the Lostbelts? What do you think of them?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What do I think of them? I think they&#39;re serial killings involving entire worlds.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And what&#39;s worse, the culprit has ensured that their blood is on our hands.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We are no longer merely fighting for our very existence.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In order for our world to survive, we have been forced to commit unspeakable atrocities. All the more reason that the one responsible must be held accountable.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I refuse to let this stand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I WILL see that the evil trampling over innocent people, sneering at the very idea of good and righteousness...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...and attempting to further their desires regardless of whom they hurt...is brought to justice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For whose sake, you ask?<br> Nobody in particular.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, I pursue these cases purely in the name of justice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At heart, that is who I am\u2013<br> Sherlock Holmes, protagonist of great adventures.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, the protagonist of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> True, I suppose I may have no right to call myself a protagonist any longer, now that I&#39;ve shown you a wealth of evidence proving I once genuinely existed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, be that as it may,<br> I am still the one and only Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am a detective, the revealer of truth, and the world&#39;s first consulting private investigator.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am also one of the first \u201Cgreat detectives\u201D that became the archetype for many detective stories to follow...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...which brings its own set of responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And...I have my pride as well.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> ...You never did answer my question.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> You really put on a show of it, too, with all that talk about solving cases in the name of justice!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> But you&#39;re still hiding some pretty big secrets,<br> aren&#39;t you, Sigerson?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief. I suppose it was a fool&#39;s errand to hope you would forget about that, Madame Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Nonetheless, I meant every word I said. I only attempt to solve cases in furtherance of justice in the world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, you are still correct.<br> I do indeed have secrets.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Furthermore, there is still a great mystery regarding me personally that I have yet to solve.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who summoned me in the first\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ............</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Sigerson?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I know.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is the most pressing question I face in this<br> materialization. I&#39;ll need to find an answer eventually.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Even if it means turning evil?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Are you saying you&#39;re willing to resort to evil means in pursuit of supposedly just ends?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Let me just make sure of one thing.<br> Would Fujimaru consider this to be evil, too?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...No, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] would not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If nothing else, Yelena, I can assure you of that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am resolutely on humanity&#39;s side,<br> and that very much includes Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Think of it this way: I am a detective\u2013one who has always fought for what is right, and will continue to do so.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am, Madam. But if that is not sufficient<br> for you...I will make you a promise as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Everything I have told you is the truth.<br> I swear it.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong><br> Hehe. And what exactly are you going to swear on? God?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I swear it on the sight I saw back in<br> that hidden cave in the Himalayas...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On the proud, final moments of your fulfilled life.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>...Oho.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>(So even throwing him to the ground wasn&#39;t<br> enough to release his grip on the knife.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>(The last of the Clock Tower&#39;s assassins is proving quite formidable.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>(But stabbing Yelena in the moment I stepped away from her is as far as you go!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>(I&#39;m going to rob you of every<br> last possibility you hold...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>(...so that you can never ever harm her again.)</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AHelena:</strong><br> No...don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Coughing up blood with every word,<br> her purple eyes pleaded with me not to kill him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I nod, and strike a vital point to knock the assassin unconscious, robbing him only of his current possibilities.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASigerson:</strong><br> Yelena...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why did this happen?
