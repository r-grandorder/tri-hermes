A while later, Kiritsugu walks in and orders the same dish\u2026</strong></p><p><strong>Track 1</strong></p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Although I have never had any clear desire, I have still had no shortage of torment from my physiological needs. The foremost of these is the need for food. When it comes to eating, although I recognise it as a type of desire, I only consider this desire to be a necessity for survival. Yes, it is only a procedure of placing food into the stomach to prevent it from becoming empty, this is what I think of the act of eating. I, who have had many missions overseas, have tried many different dishes from the East and West and have once anticipated that one of them could truly fill the emptiness in my heart. Unfortunately, it was all a futile effort. No matter how delicious the meal was, even if it could fill the stomach, it could never bring a sense of fulfillment to the heart. I would only mechanically put the dishes served into my mouth to fill my stomach and then leave my seat without any emotion. I have no more expectations. This is the conclusion I have arrived at regarding the taste of food. But even so, there is one thing that can touch my heart. \u2026Mapo tofu. Not just any plain mapo tofu. There is a restaurant in Fuyuki City - Hongzhou Feast Hall: Taishan. The mapo tofu that I had unintentionally tasted in this restaurant is the only delicacy I recognise. Although it looks like a mere disarrayed dish with chili peppers piled on top, the moment one puts the tofu into one\u2019s mouth, the stimulating scorch on one\u2019s tongue brings an indescribable taste. Yes! Spiciness must be the best, spiciness must be the ultimate experience of the sense of taste! Today, I will also release myself, blend into the crowd in ordinary clothing and open the restaurant door. For the sake of filling my stomach with that taste once more. Heh.)</p><p>(Opens door, sits)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Shopkeeper, order. I\u2019ll have this mapo tofu.</p><p>Sound Drama Fate/Zero Anthology Drama 4: Eat in Taishan</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (I should eat out - the reason I thought this was to save my strength for the Grail War coming up. Still, I have no interest in dishes made from high-class ingredients. In the nine years I spent with the Einzbern family, I have had my fill of those things. What I need now is an ordinary meal aimed towards the general public, a dish offered by a discreet restaurant by the street. Fragrant fish or meat, with deliberate emphasis on the scent of spices, may be considered simple and crude - but that is just fine. The world of cuisine closest to me is precisely there. In the days before I stayed at the Einzbern castle, I used such a mess of foods to fill my stomach. Then, in order to return myself to my condition in the past, I should follow my old eating habits and use the foods I was accustomed to before to fill my stomach. Yes, the point of doing this is to return myself to my condition in the past. It is absolutely not because I am tired of all the extravagant foods in the past nine years. Mhm, that\u2019s right, there\u2019s no way my heart would waver for mere food.)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Walking) \u2026Still, I can\u2019t go anywhere too noticeable\u2026</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (If I am to truly begin my preparations for the Grail War, I should not go anywhere noticeable and should avoid people\u2019s eyes and ears as much as possible. Right now, this city is gradually becoming a den for the gathering magi. Even so, a magus is still human. No matter how much they exceed humanity, as long as they are human, they will become hungry. Magecraft attracts each other, so if I\u2019m unlucky, the person sitting beside me may be another Master. To prevent such a near miss, I should eat somewhere not noticeable.)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Walking) \u2026Hmm? Is that a Chinese restaurant? \u201CHongzhou Feast Hall: Taishan\u201D\u2026hmm\u2026Chinese food, huh, doesn\u2019t sound bad. There don\u2019t seem to be traces of magecraft nearby, either. Right, I\u2019ll eat here.</p><p>(Opens door)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Eating vigorously)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (There\u2019s someone really focused on eating mapo tofu\u2026 Mapo tofu! Hmm! This could be good! As for a seat\u2026 The seat behind this guy is empty, I\u2019ll just sit there.)</p><p>(Sits down)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Excuse me, I\u2019d like to order. Please give me this mapo tofu.</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> What do you mean it\u2019ll take ten minutes? Get it done for me in five minutes!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026It\u2019s rather noisy behind me.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (A lava-like spiciness permeates my entire body. This spicy flavour that can burn up the brain with each bite is really a valuable stimulus. But this isn\u2019t enough yet, my stomach is still not satisfied. It\u2019s not strong enough.)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Shopkeeper! One more plate!</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Is that so\u2026 Is mapo tofu that delicious!? \u2026Perhaps, this place is also a symbol of our culture. If possible, I want to let Iri come here and have a look. \u2026Speaking which, Iri should have arrived in Japan by now. I\u2019ll have to contact her soon.</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah\u2026 The scent of spicy food\u2026! Is this a shop which serves food?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> It appears to be. This should be a Chinese restaurant.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah, so it\u2019s the one with lots of spicy things. I still can\u2019t really eat spicy things\u2026 Is there anything you can\u2019t eat, Saber?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No. There is no food which I cannot eat.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> \u2026I\u2019m jealous. \u2026Speaking which, in your day, Saber, what kind of food did you have the most of? As a king, you must have eaten plenty of good food, right?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No\u2026 I was not too concerned with such things, and allowed the cooks to do as they wished. Only\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Only?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Hmm, come to think of it, the food I ate at the time\u2026was all a little unrefined\u2026 Ah, I am not displeased with the food itself, it may have been made to match the tastes of my knight subordinates. After all, when I asked the Knights of the Round Table their opinions on the food, they all said that the taste was good.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> \u2026 (That should be because, to the king\u2019s face, they couldn\u2019t just say it tasted bad\u2026right?) I understand. Homunculi don\u2019t have the chance to eat often, either, so we don\u2019t know what kinds of tasty food there are in this world\u2026 But we still have some time, so let\u2019s think of this as a little break and go somewhere to eat something.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Yes, that does not sound bad. Then, what shall we eat?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Hmm\u2026 If we\u2019re talking about Japan, there\u2019s usually sushi, tempura, things like that\u2026 But let\u2019s go and find this dessert shop place first, we should be able to try red bean soup there\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Red bean soup\u2026is it?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes! It seems to be common in Japanese desserts, and has glutinous rice balls in it\u2026or something!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Oh? That certainly draws one\u2019s interest.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Right? Kiritsugu said he liked it, so I thought I\u2019d try it if I had the chance.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I understand. According to the map just now, after we pass this road, there will be many shops like this. We will have to walk for a while, is that alright?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It\u2019s no problem.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Alright, then let us go, Irisviel.</p><p>(Pause)</p><p>(Phone vibrates)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Hmm? Oh\u2026 The infiltrant in the Clock Tower has news. Perhaps he has found Kayneth\u2019s location.)</p><p>(Answers phone)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Hello?</p><p><strong>Track 2</strong></p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Is that so? Good work! Oh! Oh!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (What a noisy man. \u2026Speaking which, a similarly noisy Rin once showed off her Chinese cooking to me.)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Huh, Rin has cooked something, has she.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Yes. Father seems to have stayed in the workshop all the time lately and he hasn\u2019t been eating properly. I want him to be able to eat some good food.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I see. Tokiomi-shi will surely be happy. \u2026Then, what am I needed for?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Hmm. You should taste the food I cooked and give me some feedback.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Can\u2019t have some kind of strange flavour, can it.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Why do you say these things while assuming that I\u2019ll fail!? Didn\u2019t I say I made good food!?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> That may be true. I only wish to confirm, although I am the one tasting it, all the food is in good shape, correct? Ashes or mysterious objects cannot be called food.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Like I said, don\u2019t just assume someone will fail right from the start! Speaking which, you probably don\u2019t know that I\u2019m pretty confident in my cooking skills, and I\u2019ve been praised by Mother, too.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I see, that is not bad. Alright, although I do not know whether my opinions will be of use to you, I will still try it. Then, what do you plan to make?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Hmm\u2026 I\u2019ll make some of the Chinese food that Mother doesn\u2019t usually cook. Can you eat Chinese food?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Ah, that is not a problem. Also, Rin. You should know that if you want an actor, you have the wrong person.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Huh? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> That\u2019s right, this is your trial. Yes, I, who serve God, cannot tell a lie, even if it is for the sake of Rin, and when I think that the food tastes awful, I must clearly express that it \u201Ctastes awful\u201D! I will absolutely not lie\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> I said, don\u2019t just assume that I\u2019ll fail!!</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Eating) \u2026Tasty! No, this is honestly delicious! This is truly surprising. Rin, so you really are skilled at cooking.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> \u2026You aren\u2019t just being polite, are you?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I did say, didn\u2019t I, that I had no plans to lie. When he eats a dish like this, Tokiomi-shi would surely feel joy from the bottom of his heart. It is truly terrifying that you have such skill, and it is no wonder that you are this confident.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Of course! I\u2019m a daughter of the Tohsaka family, after all!</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Yes, at the time I had forgotten, forgotten the fact that she was a daughter of the Tohsaka family. Not long after, Rin presented her cooking to Tokiomi-shi. However, she seemed to have poured an entire bottle of chili sauce into the wok at the last moment. Also, nobody had noticed this at all. Still, even though the food was spicy enough to make anyone faint, Tokiomi-shi bore it without a single word. Indeed, it was somewhat surprising.)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Waitress:</strong> Mapo set meal has arrived, aru~</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Hmm? \u2026Oh, the food arrived. Just put it there. \u2026Apologies, I\u2019m eating right now\u2026I see! Kayneth is hiding there, after all\u2026! Do you have the hotel plans? \u2026Sent over already? That was quick\u2026 Understood, I\u2019ll pick it up. If there are any new developments, contact me again.</p><p>(Hangs up)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Right, I\u2019ll just call Maiya again.)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> (Munch munch) \u2026 (Yum! Not only is the cake colourful, its sweet flavour also stirs one\u2019s appetite. The flowery decorations are filled with novelty, the sponge cake is soft and bouncy, the fresh cream melts in the mouth, and the slightly bitter chocolate gives a touch that is just right. The chocolate cake and cheese souffle just now were also extremely delicious! \u2026Ah, such joy\u2026perhaps this is the first time I\u2019ve felt this way. I never knew before that the Fuyuki Hyatt Hotel restaurant would have such a wonderful cake buffet. Next time, I have to come here again.)</p><p>(Phone vibrates)</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> \u2026A call from Kiritsugu?</p><p>(Answers phone)</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> What is it, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Maiya, Kayneth\u2019s location has been confirmed. He is, after all, at the top floor of the Fuyuki Hyatt Hotel. Considering the worst possible outcome, prepare to demolish the entire Hyatt Hotel.</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> \u2026! (<strong>TL:</strong> Poor Maiya, no more yuetsu for her.)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> What\u2019s wrong?</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> Nothing. When will the preparations for demolition take place?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Within today. I\u2019ll head there after collecting the hotel plans. Maiya, prepare the tools and materials. Park the car at the Fuyuki Hyatt carpark at 16:00.</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> Understood.</p><p>(Hangs up)</p><p><strong>Maiya:</strong> \u2026Phew. (Either way, there are still two hours until the appointed time. Also, my stomach still has room.) Excuse me, extend my buffet time, please.</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Hangs up) Then, I\u2019ll quickly finish eating and hurry to the scene. \u2026Speaking which, when I said that we would demolish the hotel, Maiya seemed to choke for a moment\u2026? Just what was that about\u2026 Hmm, come to think of it, Fuyuki Hyatt is famous for its cake buffet. \u2026Hmm? Haha, such a cute side is something Maiya\u2026wouldn\u2019t possibly have! \u2026So, mapo tofu mapo tofu.</p><p>(Eats)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026Mm! (Spicy! Gah, it\u2019s spicy! Spicy! What is this!? It\u2019s much spicier than I expected!)</p><p>(Continues eating)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Uwaa\u2026 With each bite, my blood flow seems to reverse, my hands shake, my sweat can\u2019t stop flowing\u2026 What kind of spiciness is this!? Still\u2026)</p><p>(Continues eating)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (\u2026Hmm? Not too bad? This is OK! This boiling spiciness is great! I have a sense of my appetite being filled\u2026 Just like this! Even though I can\u2019t tell whether this feeling is spiciness of deliciousness! It\u2019s indescribably good!)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> One more please\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Hmm? Finished one portion this quickly? Still\u2026ah, I can understand. Like this, enjoying the spiciness with sweat running down my back, I sort of feel more mature! (<strong>TL:</strong> What\u2019s wrong with you, Kerry?) Mm! I happen to feel a little unsatisfied. I\u2019ll also\u2026) Excuse me! Could I please have another\u2013</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (What is this? The man sitting behind me is asking for a second helping as though competing against me.)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Oh, here it is.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (What is this, this unsettling feeling. No, could it mean\u2013)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (\u2013Hmm? What is this!? This chill down my spine\u2026! This tension makes me feel like I\u2019ve walked into a forest filled with traps\u2026! \u2013No, wait, that\u2019s not it. Could it be\u2026!?)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (The man behind me, I\u2013)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (\u2013That\u2019s right, the man behind me is someone I know!)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (\u2013I should, turn around, and confirm the identity of the man behind me!)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (\u2013I should know who the man behind me is!)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (\u2013Even if this is a fatal encounter that leads to battle? Should I, find out the identity of the man behind me!?)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (\u2013I can\u2019t. If my existence were to be exposed, all my tactics would fall apart. But even so, I will still\u2013)</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Stands up) You must be\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Stands up) You must be\u2013</p><p><strong>Track 3</strong></p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> (Abrupt awakening) \u2026! \u2026A dream? I never expected to dream of something that long ago. At the time, I did happen to eat in the same place as a fellow Executor. His name should be\u2026Jack? Or is it Gorou? (<strong>TL:</strong> Characters voiced by Koyama Rikiya, Kiritsugu\u2019s VA.) \u2026I have not eaten mapo tofu there for such a long time. Most likely, today or tomorrow, the Grail War will officially begin. If I do not know when the next chance to eat there will be\u2026 Alright, I shall go there for today\u2019s lunch.</p><p>(Pause)</p><p><strong>Taxi Driver:</strong> Eh? Isn\u2019t this the passenger in my taxi just now? What a coincidence!</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026Uh\u2026?</p><p><strong>Taxi Driver:</strong> The mapo tofu here sure is spicy, but it really suits my tastes, so I got addicted. I eat here pretty often. Ah, I should get back to work now, so\u2013 Shopkeeper, the bill please!</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026I\u2019m done. Excuse me, may I have the bill, too, please?</p><p>(Door closes)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> (Occasionally trying this kind of food isn\u2019t bad, my energy is surging up.)</p><p>(Lights cigarette)</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026Phew. (Collect the Fuyuki Hyatt Hotel plans, join up with Maiya. After planting C2 charges at the Hyatt, confirm Iri\u2019s current location.) \u2026Good. This will be a difficult war, but I cannot lose. Time to go, the Grail war begins only now\u2013</p><p>(<strong>TL:</strong> In case you\u2019re confused, what happened was this: Kirei had a dream about how he met a colleague with Kiritsugu\u2019s voice in Taishan a long time ago. Kiritsugu ran into a taxi driver with Kirei\u2019s voice just before the Grail War, like the crazy taxi driver in CANAAN. No, our wonderful protagonists did not meet. If you expected them to\u2026 the production team trolled you. For that matter, so did my synopsis.)</p><p>END</p>', 138);
