It doesn&#39;t have to be with Senpai, does it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

Sorry.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Why now, of all times!?<br> Geez, this is just great.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Now I feel awkward, like when you run into an old friend and you find out she&#39;s married and has children now...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m going to take it out on these...<br> What were they?

It&#39;s not polite to say, but unlike me,<br> Kiyohime can get the weirdest ideas in her head.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Tendencies for love at first sight aside, she often creates relationships in her mind without talking to the men involved.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Her imagination when it comes to these things could put virtual reality to shame. Every relationship she imagines already has marriage on the horizon.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Ultimately she traps the guy inside a bell and burns him to death. That&#39;s how she is, so I worry about her partner...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh, I should&#39;ve brought us lunches or something.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I hate to interrupt, but I&#39;m picking up something...<br> Yeah.
