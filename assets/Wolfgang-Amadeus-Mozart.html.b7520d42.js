The drink was cheap...<br> And there were no pork cutlets either...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh, but losing my travel bag was a bad blow.<br> I don&#39;t want him selling it to the pawn shop.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, that&#39;s Amadeus lying on the ground in front of us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He appears to have been bounced out of the tavern like a pinball.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You okay, scum?</p><hr><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh dear. You&#39;ve caught me at an embarrassing moment.<br> Fujimaru, Mash, are you two getting lunch as well?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I would advice against that tavern.<br> The meat and fish are excellent, but the drink is awful.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> And the customer service is abysmal! What kind of establishment throws you out just because you can&#39;t pay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amadeus, did you go in there without any money?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Of course I did.<br> I&#39;m a genius composer.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> God loves me and says I get an unlimited tab for everything.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> But the owner here knows nothing about music!<br> He doesn&#39;t even have a single piano in his tavern!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Taverns in this era don&#39;t have pianos, obviously.<br> From his perspective, you&#39;re the crazy one.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> How am I crazy? I played him a song on my flute.<br> It wasn&#39;t a full concert, but it should more than suffice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-That sounds wonderful. I think a song from Amadeus would be worth a full day&#39;s meals, not just one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. And what kind of song did you play for him, Amadeus?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s untitled, but if I gave it a name, perhaps,<br> &quot;A fugue to inspire sudden bowel movements.&quot;</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> As you can tell from my Noble Phantasm, it worked perfectly. It was hilarious seeing the line to the bathroom.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, he&#39;s bad news! He&#39;s the kind of Servant you can&#39;t let wander around on his own!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Hahaha! You&#39;re making me blush!<br> Still, excellent timing.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had my revenge on the owner, but he took my bag of instruments. I need to make money quickly.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Will you come with me for a while?<br> I just need a simple bodyguard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re all the way outside town.<br> What are we doing here, Amadeus?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh, there are bandits in this area that attack merchant wagons. If I get rid of them, I&#39;ll be paid in gold.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Look, here they come.<br> I&#39;m counting on you, Master. Teach them a lesson!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? They&#39;re as strong as raging bulls!<br> We can&#39;t beat&#39;em by ourselves! Bring it over here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Raging bulls is rather rude, isn&#39;t it Master?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Well, anyone would think that seeing the way you swing that shield. Then add in the size of your chest\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Monsieur Amadeus, one more word and your category might switch from ally to enemy.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh my. How scary. I&#39;d love to tease you more, but we&#39;re in the middle of combat.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Fujimaru, the bandits haven&#39;t given up yet.<br> The big one&#39;s coming\u2014</p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> Okay, take off the leash! Go, Patricia!<br> There&#39;s your targets! Go ahead and eat them!</p><p><strong>Wyvern:</strong><br> GRAAAAAWR!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-A stray wyvern...!<br> They must have a decent breeder with them!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m surprised, too. And disgusted.<br> Talk about a waste of talent!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> If they&#39;ve got the talent to train a wyvern, why are those idiots wasting their lives on this?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Well, wasn&#39;t that a nice haul? We got paid three times what I expected, Fujimaru, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.<br> I didn&#39;t expect to capture 23 people.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They were tough enough to have a wyvern with them.<br> Each one&#39;s worth a pretty penny, and all together they&#39;re worth even more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now you can live the high life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now you can pay off your debt.</p><hr><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I can pay my tab at that tavern, then at the others...And then I guess that&#39;s all of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You owe money at other taverns too!?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Yes. Most just wouldn&#39;t let me in.<br> Otherwise, why would I go to a new place?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...Amadeus&#39;s skills and appearance are so impressive, but he&#39;s got too many personality problems.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Next time we summon him, please summon him at an age where he&#39;s more dignified.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean when he&#39;s older?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. An old Amadeus should be a lot more calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean when he&#39;s younger?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. He&#39;ll be less powerful in battle, but a child of 12 won&#39;t be going to pubs.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s impossible Fujimaru.<br> A Servant is summoned at the height of their powers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s at the time of their lives when that Heroic Spirit was strongest. Otherwise there&#39;d be no point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as he&#39;s a Servant, Amadeus will carry this form.<br> Well, his age might change if he&#39;s in a different class...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I&#39;m never anything but a Caster.<br> So you won&#39;t see me old, or young.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll tell you something else, Mash.<br> There are only two kinds of artist Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Two kinds?<br> Um...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I mean their age when they&#39;re summoned.<br> Whether they appear as children or adults.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> I can promise you that artist Servants will all either be children or young adults. Nothing else.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,<br> right? That means when they were a genius.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> The ones who appear as children grew up to be decent, dignified adults.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they manifest as &quot;children,&quot; when they were called geniuses. Child prodigies who didn&#39;t care about the problems they caused.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, I see. An artist&#39;s talent comes from their instincts.<br> And they&#39;re summoned when those instincts were strongest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;re summoned as children, when they were pure geniuses. And the young adults?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Those ones are weirdos and scums, who would never change until the day they die!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It sounds so convincing when he says it...<br> And what an awful Servant he is...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s dinner time!<br> My tab&#39;s paid off, so it&#39;s off to my favorite pub.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> Oh, but I do need to thank you.<br> Here, Fujimaru. A present from me.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong><br> This is also my thanks for everything you do for me.<br> Buh-bye, then! You guys have a nice dinner too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s gone... Some Servants have no interest in the era they&#39;re summoned to,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And some Servants, like Amadeus, act like they belong there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There really are all different types of Heroic Spirits...</p>', 87);
