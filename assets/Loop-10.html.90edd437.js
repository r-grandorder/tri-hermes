Heading out?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, just came out of the shed. What about you? If you&#39;re going out to buy something, Number Two is over there.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Bicycle Number Two is exclusively for shopping.

If I really start pedaling, it breaks. What kind of vehicle is that? A vehicle is one that, for one hundred units of energy taken, produces one hundred units of work.</p><p>That is to say, in terms of speed, bike Number Two defies the laws of thermodynamics.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>No, this is the law of physics.</p><p>Driving something that was designed to go 20 km/h at 100 km/h is nothing short of suicidal.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut Number One is different from the sluggish Number Two, being equipped with a high-speed gear system.</p><p>With this, none of my concerns should be an issue.</p><p>It should also solve the power delivery problem.\u201D</p><p>...Now I have absolutely no idea what in the world Rider is planning.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Whew. What do you think, Shirou?</p><p>With that said, I thought you could perhaps understand my humble request.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t, not really.

No.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That was a quick decision, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Running wildly around neighborhood, a rocket of this kind shall not be allowed to be born in our garage.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Maybe... if I continue to ride Number Two, the slow speed stress will cause alopecia areata. Don&#39;t you think so?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Will it really? Even though Sakura will cry, the answer is still no.\u201D</p><hr><p>The birth of a Crazy Train isn&#39;t the only issue here.</p><p>If she uses this chance to increase her sphere of influence, the power balance at our house, already precarious at best, will start to slide even more.</p><p>To put it bluntly, my position is diminishing.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou.</p><p>If you refuse to let me use Number One, I have no choice but to resort to the radical measures.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Uh. Rider, d-does that mean... you are going to snatch my beloved Bianchi away by force...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s the last resort. I am not the same as Saber.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, Rider&#39;s view on Saber became very clear.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, Number One is not the only good transportation method in this world.</p><p>It is fine if you will not let me borrow it. I shall just have to look for even faster rides.</p><p>Starting with Taiga&#39;s scooter, then I shall borrow the Fujimura Group&#39;s big bike.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Geh.\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s venting her anger, and is venting it on me.</p><p>The big bike... would that be the old man Raiga&#39;s that I worked on? By my strength alone I can&#39;t lift that monstrosity if it were to fall.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou still think it is all right, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...It&#39;s fine either way.</p><p>Rider, do you have your bike license?\u201D</p><p>If she is going to charge around on the road, she needs to follow the traffic laws.</p><p>No one can interfere if Rider is on her Pegasus, but if she&#39;s riding a motorcycle, she has to follow human society&#39;s rules.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Riding skills have nothing to do with a license.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. If you want to ride a motorcycle, you need to take a course and get a license.</p><p>To put it bluntly, if you get in trouble with the police, our house is done for. Sakura will cry for sure.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh...\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s influence is not to be underestimated.</p><p>...But then, I can&#39;t see Rider letting herself get caught by police, either.</p><hr><p>Looking at the defeated Rider...</p><p>...Looks like she&#39;s finally given up.</p><p>Number One is a no-go, but when I have time, I&#39;ll try to assemble a Number Four for her to use, something better than a &quot;mama-chari&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...............Shirou...\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, a low voice appears beside my ear.</p><p>Rider walks up to my side, her icy hand stroking the back of my neck\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CThen... we shall play by your rules, equal trade.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh?\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf... you will let me use Number One, I will reward you... hehe.\u201D</p><hr><p>Her fingers slide under my chin.</p><p>Lips almost biting my ear and an unimaginably sweet voice.</p><hr><p>\u201CR-R-Reward...!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs Shirou desires... the things Shirou wants to do to me...</p><p>No part of me is off-limits... Shirou, what do you want to do...?\u201D</p><hr><p>Her voice echoes like an incantation.</p><p>What I desire from Rider...</p><p>What I want to do to Rider... Anything...</p><p>...Did she use some kind of a seduction spell?</p><p>My body is burning up. But the feel of Rider&#39;s skin is as cold as ground water.</p><p>My head starts spinning, the surroundings are muddled, and it feels like I&#39;m about to say something unthinkable\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Rider, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnything... is allowed. Shirou and I can\u2015\u2015\u2015fufu.\u201D</p><p>She gently caresses my cheeks.</p><p>Facing her, there is no escape from the seductive eyes that are now piercing me.</p><hr><p>\u201C.....................\u201D</p><p>Huh...?</p><p>That&#39;s strange, is Sakura staring at us?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Erm.</p><p>That was a joke, of course, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>With a swoosh, Rider&#39;s hand slipped away like a snake. Nonchalantly, as if nothing had happened\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u201CRi-Ri-<em>, Rider!</em>\u201D\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am heading out, you two can take your time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... no, Sakura...

The fruit of autumn is persimmon, but you know, chestnut is also good, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, like sticky rice with chestnuts... so a Marron pie?\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a small, neat one-person shape.</p><p>While a whole big pie is also good, it&#39;s more elegant this way.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, we did our best, all the way from the pie dough.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is... Sakura looked like she really needed help, and so I was allowed to lend a hand.\u201D</p><p>Saber making pastry... now that sure is unusual.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, folded pie dough makes for particularly great taste, but it does take quite a bit of work.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFolding it back like that several times is something that even I could do.\u201D</p><p>It certainly seems like endlessly folding that pie dough is pretty laborious.

How is the taste, Saber?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, the sweetness of the chestnut and the texture of the dough work exceedingly well together. My hat is off to Sakura&#39;s skill with pastries.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you. And to you, too, the dough work was worthy of a royal title.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that right...\u201D</p><p>How do I say it, the atmosphere between these two is unusually friendly.</p><p>They usually get along, but today, the sweet atmosphere is not unlike some secret girls&#39; tea party bond.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, right. Saber, how were the cakes in your country? Were there lots of unusual fruits and fillings?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... Unfortunately, sugar had not yet seen much use around that time. Such sweet confections had yet to be developed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... is that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor the banquets, the cooks tried their best with the skills they had......\u201D</p><hr><p>When she talks about her country&#39;s food, Saber dulls in an indescribable way.</p><p>However, England is the birthplace of afternoon tea. The rest of the cooking aside, shouldn&#39;t the snacks taste good even if they&#39;re a bit simple?</p><hr><p>\u201CThen... a cake like Mitsuzuri-senpai&#39;s was the usual fare, was it not?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? Wait, Mitsuzuri? She bakes cakes?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, I got a few from her. She&#39;s pretty good at making the kind with baking powder, didn&#39;t you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAmerican... that&#39;s right, mass production like that is something she would sure be great at.\u201D</p><p>Finding a breakthrough technique to improve a sketchy taste would certainly be Mitsuzuri-style.</p><p>I want to see her try making okonomiyaki one of these days.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe New World&#39;s cake... quantity before quality, and who cares what the others think.\u201D</p><p>With a clink, Saber puts down her fork.</p><p>The sampling of the marron pie seems to have promptly come to a conclusion.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis was a splendid display of skill. A sample like this will hold its ground even against La Fleur&#39;s Western confectioneries.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D</p><p>Personally approved by the Saber, the picky gourmand herself, the pair&#39;s marron pie is set to be a big hit.</p><p>Then, one more thing...</p><hr><p>\u201CHey Sakura. Is there still some left?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, everyone&#39;s portion is still baking, so let&#39;s have it as a dessert after lunch.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGood. Now the dessert for lunch is decided.</p><p>The thing is, I can&#39;t really think of a good lunch to go with it. After all, even after udon, a marron pie is...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t have a problem with noodles.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen pasta? We have some canned anchovies, olives and vegetables to go with it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right, then we&#39;ll go with a light lunch.</p><p>The masterpiece you two made cannot be truly appreciated with a full stomach.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, Senpai, everyone has a separate stomach for sweets.\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber nods vehemently in agreement.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Such overwhelming persuasive power. Our females&#39; formation is really reliable at times like these.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, let&#39;s not worry about making it lighter.</p><p>Since you made the pie for all of us, I&#39;ll prepare the lunch by myself. You two can take it easy for a while.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, we will accept that kind offer.\u201D</p><p>The two respond at once in harmony with each other.</p><p>Nodding and smiling, I leave the room.</p><p>Well then.</p><p>Let&#39;s go make some extra special tasty pasta to be a worthy match for the marron pie.</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-2-one-day-at-the-archery-club" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-2-one-day-at-the-archery-club" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 2 One day at the archery club</h3><hr><p>\u201COh...\u201D</p><p>The sound of rippling wind comes from the practice floor.</p><p>Is the archery club holding a holiday practice session?</p><p>It&#39;s been a while since I quit, but the sound of a quivering bow string still makes my footsteps stop.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I guess I&#39;ll just watch for a bit...\u201D</p><p>If a competition is coming up, it&#39;d be best to leave them alone, though.</p><p>At least Fuji-Nee or Sakura should be there, so just watching shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse me.

Well, she was like that right after she took over.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri reminisces with a sigh.</p><hr><p>\u201CI thought that being a captain might have been just too much for her, but I guess it all worked out?

Your greeting was so courteous, I was completely unprepared for it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh, I&#39;m impressed.</p><p>The captain&#39;s role really fits you well, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? Me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow that you&#39;re the archery club captain, I, ah...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, Mitsuzuri-senpai helped me out a lot at first.</p><p>And thanks to that, I was able to hold on and even receive the praise from you, Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaptain Matou, I have a request!\u201D</p><p>As we&#39;re speaking, someone calls Sakura from the range.</p><p>That voice...

The captain&#39;s duty comes first.\u201D</p><p>I see Sakura off.</p><p>The moment she stands up, her expression changes to that of the club captain.</p><p>I return the quiet bow she gives me on the way out.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Emiya-senpai.\u201D</p><p>On her way to the <ruby>makiwara<rt>straw target</rt></ruby>, Sakura looks back.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, it&#39;s a little difficult to talk here, so... would you mind going home together after practice?</p><p>If you could stay around for that long, of course...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COkay. I&#39;ll wait until it&#39;s over, so do your best.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will.

It must be the side effect of having seen me in my kendo uniform when he was a child. That must be why he&#39;s getting excited over girls in hakama now?</p><p>Right? You definitely are, right? Kya\uFF5E! Run away\uFF5E! All freshmen girls, run away\uFF5E!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei!\u201D</p><p>A thundering voice echoes throughout the range.</p><hr><p>\u201CSa...

I can never match her.\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri takes a stance with an imaginary shinai in her hands.</p><p>Side effect of having belonged to a vertical society that values physical strength above wit for a long time, I guess.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura-chan used to be such a good disciple of mine.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhoa, Sensei!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut then she became a captain and revolted against her own mentor overnight! Won&#39;t listen to her Onee-chan anymore, how sad...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTwo years ago Shirou quit, and down went my archery club privatization plan Number One.</p><p>And with Sakura-chan this year, everything was lined up perfectly for the plan Number Two. Or so I thought... now she&#39;s my arch-rival.\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-So is that why you recommended Sakura?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThus I hoped to make Mitsuzuri, another influential figure, my guardian in order to protect me from Sakura-chan, see?\u201D</p><p>\u201CB-But even then... I am due to retire soon, and I thought I&#39;d refrain from meddling in club&#39;s affairs.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, when Mitsuzuri-san graduates, I&#39;m going to be bullied by Sakura-chan every single day!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee, that&#39;s when I&#39;ll be leaving Minori to you. A shield, a substitute, a sacrifice. Use him however you like.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s no good. Mitsuzuri-kun is already one of Sakura-chan&#39;s puppets!</p><p>Mitsuzuri-san, you&#39;re not the kind of cruel pupil that would just leave her old mentor in times of trouble, right? Right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUhh...

Right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAuuuh!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith a competition upon us, seeing our advisor using up what precious time we have like this\u2015\u2015\u2015And you, Mitsuzuri-senpai, just what are you doing in this sacred dojo!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI didn&#39;t do anything!</p><p>And Matou, I always told you, as a captain, to keep the reigns tight on our advisor, didn&#39;t I?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, that is true...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait a moment, does that really fall under captain&#39;s responsibilities?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhen will you come out of your shell?

In that case, let&#39;s go buy some!\u201D</p><p>\u201CPerfect.

I feel kind of bad for Saber and Fuji-Nee, but we should enjoy them while they&#39;re hot at least.

Sakura, would you mind taking one of the grocery bags?\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura takes a bun from the bag and brings it near her nose, inhaling its fragrance.</p><p>\u201CThis one must be bean jam.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so... Hold on just a second. Let me put the bags down so my hands are free.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere you go. Eat up while it&#39;s still hot.\u201D</p><p>Sakura brings the bun in her hand close to my mouth.</p><p>The warm steam rising from it tickles my nose.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sakura, you aren&#39;t... are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSay &quot;aahhh,&quot; Senpai!\u201D</p><p>...S-Seriously!?</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, is it good?\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>gulp</em> ...Sakura, this doesn&#39;t embarrass you at all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEhehe.\u201D</p><p>Sakura is all smiles, but I&#39;m so concerned about the stares we&#39;re drawing that I can&#39;t really enjoy the taste.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou know...

Excuse me, but is this guy standing next to you your...\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh, guhuhhh!\u201D</p><p>\u201CEhehe, that&#39;s a secret.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKyaaaa! Poor Mitsuzuri-kun! Ahaha.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? Did something bad happen to Minori-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh, guhuhu!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhh, then please forgive me for interrupting the two of you. I&#39;ll be on my way then!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, wait just a second. Would you mind taking our picture?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour cell phone is so cute, Senpai! Okay you two, stand close together now... and say cheeeeeese!\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh?!\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s junior leaves to continue her errand, but not before glancing back at us several times.</p><p>\u201C...Uu... I thought the embarrassment was going to kill me...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not like I wasn&#39;t embarrassed, either. But can&#39;t you just go along with it and enjoy yourself?\u201D</p><p>She smiles radiantly.</p><p>...Ooh. There&#39;s nothing I can do if you look at me like that when you say it.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, say &quot;aahhh.&quot;</p><p>The cream-filled ones are really good, too. The inside is nice and soft from the heat.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry, the cream-filled ones are just too unorthodox for me. But thanks anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey hey, how can you say you don&#39;t like something you won&#39;t even try?\u201D</p><p>The sweet, lilting tone of Sakura&#39;s voice makes me gulp in an entirely different way.</p><p>Though she takes the prize for most levelheaded member of our household, she can be unexpectedly frank when we&#39;re out on our own together like today.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, nothing...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHeehee. You were surprised by what you saw at the archery range, weren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... yeah. I guess I looked pretty stupid, didn&#39;t I?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, not at all!</p><p>Everyone&#39;s practicing really seriously for the autumn tournament right now, so I&#39;ve got to hold it together as captain too. I must have surprised you, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe autumn tournament, huh\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s right, it would be about that time...\u201D</p><p>I still regret not being able to participate in any tournaments, since I quit archery in the summer of my first year.</p><hr><p>\u201CWho&#39;re the likely candidates this year?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, so you&#39;re interested, too, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAmong the third-years, there&#39;s the venerable trio of Mitsuzuri-senpai, Kudou-senpai and Kumehara-senpai!\u201D</p><p>\u201COoh, with all of them participating, it should be a sure thing... The only problem there is how volatile Mitsuzuri can be.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd from the juniors, we have Igaki-kun, followed by one Matou Sakura!\u201D</p><p>\u201COho, so you made it in too, Sakura? Good job!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I am the captain, after all.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou sure are. No wonder Fuji-Nee said she could practically taste nationals this year.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei is just an optimist, that&#39;s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can say that again. So, how confident do you feel?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow confident... hmm, let me think\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Sakura takes a big bite out of her obanyaki, deep in thought.</p><hr><p>\u201CI think the regional finals are a real possibility, at least.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve really set your sights high. I promise I&#39;ll be watching over you from the catwalk over the stage when you speak at the assembly announcing your victory.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh... m-me? In front of the whole school?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, aren&#39;t you the club captain?</p><p>Oh, now that I think about it, what happened to Shinji? You didn&#39;t mention him as one of the third-year candidates.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNii-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, he was one last year.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe said it was natural to quit now that he&#39;s a third-year, and stopped coming to practice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh...? Did he really?\u201D</p><p>Come to think of it, I haven&#39;t seen him at the archery range once since summer ended.</p><hr><p>\u201CI try to convince him to drop by once in a while, but, well, you know how he is.\u201D</p><p>She talks about Shinji with a faint smile.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that Sakura expressing her opinion of Shinji so openly would have been unthinkable.</p><hr><p>\u201C...He doesn&#39;t abuse you when he&#39;s angry any more, does he?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, no...</p><p>Mitsuzuri-senpai always says &quot;you need to let him have it!&quot; and stuff like that, but I still can&#39;t just smack him around like she does.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015No, Sakura, that&#39;s not what I was talking about.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeehee. Don&#39;t worry, Senpai.</p><p>Nii-san&#39;s not like he used to be any more, and neither am I.\u201D</p><p>Sakura smiles as she bites enthusiastically into the bun.</p><p>Not a trace remains of the fear that once crippled her\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Sakura tells me all about the archery club as we walk.</p><p>About how surprised everyone was when she offered to do the cooking during training camp.</p><p>The time the younger members dragged her to a bowling alley for the first time.</p><hr><p>The day she taught her massage skills to the club members, to great reception.</p><p>How she caught Mitsuzuri&#39;s brother and gave him a full-body massage after his shyness made him try to run away.</p><p>How Mitsuzuri just watched from the sidelines, grinning the whole time, and how all he could do the next day as a side effect of the massage was roll around on the floor.</p><hr><p>Sakura stops suddenly.</p><p>And I follow. Side by side, we take in the uninterrupted view of the sunset town below.</p><hr><p>\u201C...This must be the first time, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe first time?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Walking home with you, talking to you, stopping to eat with you... it&#39;s all a first.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>Sakura came to get me and we walked to school together every day, but we were always busy with club activities or part-time jobs and never got the chance to go home together.</p><hr><p>\u201CMy wish has finally come true.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWish?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. To talk about friends and club activities, and even myself, with you, Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015that was my dream.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI have a lot of them. There are so many things I want to do with you, Senpai, and I wished for this for so long... Am I asking for too much?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot at all. I&#39;m glad it was a wish that I could grant.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEhehe...\u201D</p><p>Maybe she suddenly felt shy, since she took another obanyaki and crammed it into my mouth.</p><p>\u201CUff, Sakura, this one&#39;s cream-filled...\u201D</p><p>But Sakura is busy trying to step on the tall shadow the setting sun throws in front of her, and doesn&#39;t hear a word I say.</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m really happy...\u201D</p><p>...Oh well, I think, stopping myself.</p><p>It tastes a lot better than I expected.</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you very much for keeping me company today, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs a few cheap buns all it takes to make you happy?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHeehee. Well then, next time I want to have dinner at a fancy restaurant all dressed up.\u201D</p><hr><p>Mmm... a high-level demand for an equally high-level restaurant.</p><p>Y-Yeah, I&#39;d say that&#39;s realistic.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I could make it happen right away, but as soon as I get the chance, I&#39;ll be able to grant this wish of hers too... I hope.</p><hr><p>\u201CA classy, elegant dining experience, huh? Got it.</p><p>If you don&#39;t mind waiting, I&#39;ll find a way to make it happen.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.

It&#39;s already fall, and it would be real nice to have the taste of the season.</p><p>\u201CYeah, like chestnut rice or something.\u201D</p><hr><p>Walking around like that, I come upon Caster.</p><p>Probably buying groceries, same as me.</p><p>Holding a grocery tote bag, she&#39;s looking at the store front. No need to call out to her, I guess.</p><p>Let&#39;s just quickly finish my own shopping here\u2015\u2015\u2015.</p><hr><p>All done. Mackerel pike was on sale today, so that&#39;s what today&#39;s main dish is going to be.

Aah, international track and balance ball training?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;ve been keeping up, Makidera.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell obviously, as an athlete I... What the, Emiya...?\u201D</p><hr><p>I meet Makidera once again in the bookstore.</p><p>...I wonder if she was taking the same path, or if she just decided to stop by the Verde.</p><p>Oddly enough, the two of us are now standing side-by-side in the same magazine section.</p><hr><p>\u201CAre Himuro and Saegusa still with you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYukicchi is over there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Indeed, Saegusa is standing there, reading some hefty manga volume.</p><p>It looks like she&#39;s only skimming through it, though.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd Himuro&#39;s right there.

I&#39;m getting distracted.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow that&#39;s just mean. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to keep you away from your books, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yet another chance meeting, and Emiya meets Makidera once again.\u201D</p><hr><p>Himuro notices me right as I&#39;m about to leave.

It looks like there is someone among the three of us he&#39;s interested in.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMakinoji, following that logic, you&#39;re the foremost candidate.\u201D</p><p>Himuro quips pointedly.</p><p>Hehehe, a joke of the colossal kind.</p><hr><p>\u201CEeeeh!? Maki-chan likes Emiya-kun!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe other way around! Not that anything of this hilarious sort could happen!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case, it would mean that Emiya has lost to Makidera&#39;s charm.\u201D</p><p>This is fun...</p><p>However, Saegusa&#39;s cheeks are already burning red. Her naive nature must have not caught onto the joke yet.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo way! Balderdash! Look, see? Even Emiya&#39;s eyes are saying that! Watch out for the Emiya-beam!</p><p>...And besides, isn&#39;t Kane more like his type?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That may be...</p><p>Emiya, you have quite a refined taste in women.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, so t-that&#39;s how it is!?</p><p>I-It&#39;s not me, then...!?\u201D</p><p></p><p>I can&#39;t tell whether she&#39;s relieved or disturbed.</p><hr><p>\u201CThey say that to bring down the general, shoot his horse first.

Laser-red lenses, I guess?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, the sunglasses?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh, there are quite a few athletes in this class. Not so good for me.\u201D</p><hr><p>The three have gathered around the magazine Makidera is holding, each one of them having something to say.</p><p>I glance over and see a wide variety of runner eyewear.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, Kane-chan, you do need glasses.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen they should be prescription\u2015\u2015\u2015Damn, that&#39;s expensive.\u201D</p><p>Prescription sunglasses, and sports ones at that... Must be even more expensive.</p><hr><p>I would like to say that track and field has seen new technology come in, whereas archery has remained basically the same since the olden times... but then, even bows have improved with the usage of carbon fibers.</p><p>As I&#39;m lost in thoughts like these, Saegusa happily...</p><hr><p>\u201CThis would so suit you, Maki-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u201CR-Really? What do you think, Himuro?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmmm... it&#39;s a tough call. What do you think, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Me?\u201D</p><p>Makidera with sunglasses? I let my imagination run wild for a moment...</p><hr><p>\u201C...It&#39;d definitely look like an evil villain straight out of an American comic.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Either way, perhaps it was a little too accurate.</p><hr><p>\u201CR-Really? That means it&#39;s cool... right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I can see what you&#39;re trying to say. Yes, a person does look naturally evil with their eyes covered\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CKeh! Why can&#39;t you just simply say that I&#39;d look cool and elegant like a black panther!\u201D</p><hr><p>So she just wanted a compliment.</p><p>What&#39;s this? I thought she was only violent, but she has a cute side, too\u2015\u2015\u2015Or does she?</p><hr><p>\u201C...At any rate, it&#39;d fit Makidera better than me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat goes without saying. Emiya, you wear it. If I&#39;m the villain, then you&#39;d be like a mid-boss.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat if the two of you have a matching pair?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Then it&#39;d be like a mafia boss with her henchman.\u201D</p><p></p><p>...Henchman?</p><p>And...

We can talk about today&#39;s menu\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C......Eh?\u201D</p><p>I stop and have a good look at her companion.</p><p>There&#39;s no mistake.</p><p>...A Caster-Sakura duo, huh?</p><p>I&#39;ve seen her around lately, but it&#39;s rather unusual for someone to accompany her.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Senpai!\u201D</p><p>Sakura turns around and calls over happily.</p><p>\u201COh my. Emiya-kun, isn&#39;t it? Good day to you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015None of that &quot;boy&quot; business.</p><p>That in and of itself is weird, but she&#39;s also standing next to Sakura and smiling happily.</p><p>A cataclysm, or a chance granted by the heavens?</p><hr><p>\u201CHello. You know Caster, Sakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? You&#39;ve met her before, Senpai?</p><p>Ah, it&#39;s because she&#39;s staying at Ryuudou-senpai&#39;s house. That makes sense.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI suppose I don&#39;t need to introduce myself.</p><p>Hello, Emiya-kun. I&#39;m friends with Matou-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai takes care of me at his home.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. We are both in a rather similar situation, and we just had a little chat.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I gulp down the retort welling up in my throat.</p><p>This Caster is not the Caster I know.</p><p>No matter how one looks at it, she&#39;s a well educated woman and a perfect, beautiful wife.</p><p>Well, this is a truly unbelievable situation.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Um, excuse me.</p><p>I have a small question, if you will... How did you two get to know each other?\u201D</p><p>The extreme shock made me go into news reporter mode.</p><p>\u201CRight, you see...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, what a cute young lady.</p><p>What was it called nowadays? A maid? Anyway, a family-oriented woman nowadays is great.</p><p>So, what do you say? If you&#39;re done shopping, why don&#39;t we hang out? I&#39;ll carry your stuff and all.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, um, t-that&#39;s...\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t be so scared. I ain&#39;t gonna run away with your groceries and eat them. I just like to enjoy life when I can, that&#39;s all.

I was talking to the lady, the YOUNG lady.</p><p>Understood? Not some old hag with no children. Take your mackerel and flounder and get your ass outta here!\u201D</p><p>\u201COld... hag?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHohohoho. I didn&#39;t quite get what you said, Lancer. Would you like to say that one more time?</p><p>Just so I won&#39;t need to hold back. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re rolling around on the grill like the worthless hotdog you are!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou dumbass, what are you doing!? Learn to recognize where you are and what you&#39;re allowed to do there!\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome to think of it. I am a customer, and you are, what, a clerk at a fish market? You should learn how to put a smile on your face to greet customers even if it doesn&#39;t suit you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKeh! Somehow the damn vixen managed to get used to shopping\u2015\u2015\u2015Dammit, today&#39;s really not my day! Screw this, I can&#39;t afford to get fired here toooo!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehehe, you are unwise, Lancer.</p><p>Shopping district is the housewives&#39; domain, better believe it...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry for all the ruckus, young lady. Perhaps I should not have intervened?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, n-no, thank you!</p><p>Um, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what&#39;s your name\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...And with that we became friends, see?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaster, do you mind, for a moment...?\u201D</p><p>I motion Caster toward a corner of the store.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, what&#39;s going on? I&#39;m thankful you helped Sakura, but... you&#39;re not planning something again, are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo not worry. I have no other intentions. I just didn&#39;t like Lancer&#39;s reckless behavior here.</p><p>Men like him have always annoyed me.\u201D</p><p>She curves her lips in a beautiful smile.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t look like this elegant newlywed wife is lying.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd Matou-san is Souichirou-sama&#39;s student.</p><p>She&#39;s been kind enough to tell me a lot about the school.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Oh? So Issei doesn&#39;t talk about stuff like that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHe... Well, he&#39;s kind of a brother-in-law to Souichirou-sama, and I wouldn&#39;t mind if we were a little closer...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen if you marry Kuzuki-sensei, you&#39;ll be Ryuudou-senpai&#39;s sister-in-law!\u201D</p><p>Wow... Issei&#39;s misfortune with women seems to never cease!</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;ll become less reserved with each other after that.</p><p>I&#39;m jealous of Ryuudou-senpai... Right, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah, maybe.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m envious. Newlyweds... it&#39;s so lovely!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehehe, oh no, I feel embarrassed now.\u201D</p><hr><p>She may be acting humble, but there&#39;s no hiding the joy overflowing from within.</p><p>All right, all right, Caster-san. No matter how calm you pretend to be, it&#39;s all there, in plain view.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd what about you, Matou-san? Have you met the man of your dreams already?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh?! U-Um...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI mean, um.... I n-never had a relationship where I thought as far as m-marrying, and it&#39;s still a while before I start considering it, and\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>B-But even though his parents aren&#39;t here, I do get along pretty well with his guardian, so, sometime in the future, I...\u201D</p><hr><p>Flapping about, Sakura makes weird motions.</p><p>\u201CHehe, isn&#39;t that cute?\u201D</p><p>And Caster just looks on with a smile.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s embarrassed because she comes here often and doesn&#39;t want someone to overhear, or something\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>Eeek! Isn&#39;t that Rider looking at us from over there...!!?</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Rider glares this way, not as if to jeer, but more like a snake focusing on its prey.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Isn&#39;t that so? Senpai!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAren&#39;t you my teacher at cooking?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, if you mean the basics, then I guess.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CReally?</p><p>It&#39;s good to be cooking for Souichirou-sama, but preparing meals as a couple is just lovely.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSouichirou-sama, would you please take care of this porgy that came straight from Akashi?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, there&#39;s no need for a weapon.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAaah, Souichirou-sama!</p><p>What skill you have at making <ruby>live sashimi<rt>ikezukiri</rt></ruby>! And with bare hands, too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlthough it differs from taking care of a living person...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA skill designed solely for snatching one&#39;s life away... To use it for peaceful food processing is a great experience. You have my gratitude, Caster.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, such kind words... oh!</p><p>Aaah, I want to see you in an apron...\u201D</p><p>...I suppose why they would make sashimi from a fish that&#39;s still alive in a Zen temple is a question best left unanswered...</p><hr><p>\u201CBut\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Looking at it now, perhaps the Sakura-Caster pairing isn&#39;t all that strange.</p><p>On one side, we have a housewife. On the other, a staunch domestic helper.</p><p>Both seem to be the type to hold back their feelings, so they might actually be pretty similar.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sakura and Caster are both magi, too.\u201D</p><p>Being in public, I keep my voice low.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, I can&#39;t do it at all!</p><p>Even learning from Rider, I&#39;m making no progress whatsoever. I&#39;m totally different from Caster-san!</p><p>I couldn&#39;t possibly compare to her!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t need to put yourself down. You have plenty of potential... your latent powers are unbelievable.\u201D</p><p>Mmm... Caster can see even those things.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha, &quot;As plentiful as the extra flesh you have,&quot; is what a certain someone once told me.\u201D</p><p>...I look around.</p><p>Perhaps it&#39;s not just Rider. Any chance that Tohsaka might be passing by...?</p><hr><p>\u201CI think that we, as women, have a lot of roles to fulfill in addition to being magi.</p><p>But even with all those responsibilities, you have such a lovely home, Caster-san.</p><p>Right, I will follow in your footsteps!\u201D</p><p>Sakura clenches her fists with determination.</p><p>As if saying, &quot;I have just now opened my eyes to life!&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd even being such a great magus, you are so kind and elegant. You are really admirable.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy, I&#39;m embarrassed. And I have plenty of imperfections, too.\u201D</p><hr><p>She laughs.</p><p>She sounds modest, yet, at the same time, somehow realistic.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmm, the combination of magic and everyday life.</p><p>Caster, what do you think about that?\u201D</p><p>Since I don&#39;t know a lot of magi, I&#39;m a little curious.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat thought in itself is incorrect, boy.</p><p>&quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;everyday life&quot; cannot coexist. You should not even think about combining them.</p><p>The fundamentals of magic are &quot;distortion and reversal.&quot; No matter what kind of magic it is, when used, it will distort the norm.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to live correctly, you have to separate magic from normal life.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You can&#39;t live in both worlds?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou must wholly live in both worlds, that is.</p><p>A magus is someone who crosses the boundary all the time. He is free to focus on either side, but he must never try to erase the line that separates both.</p><p>In order to fully immerse yourself in magic, you must exclude your normal life.</p><p>Once you choose that path as a human, you must create an inner and an outer face in order to master it.</p><p>Then you can start deciding how to live as a person divided between magic and real life.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen how about you?</p><p>You are Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s wife now, but what about your side as a magus\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s no different from what it used to be, naturally.</p><p>I have no doubts about the magus side of myself.</p><p>I just use my powers as I see fit.</p><p>...But it&#39;s true that, nowadays, I don&#39;t turn into my magus self as often as I have in the past.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is a long story.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight now, both of us are women before we are magi.</p><p>But when the time comes, should you have the power to support the man you love... isn&#39;t that part of the wife&#39;s duty, I wonder?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see... the power to make your loved one happy.</p><p>From now on, I must start on a rigorous training just as I did when I learned to cook!\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura seems enamored by Caster, who gives off a feeling of being a senpai in life.</p><p>...I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s a friendly exchange or a self-improvement rally.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight? That&#39;s how a caring woman should be! Imitating Miss Perfect is no good!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMi-.... Miss Perfect?</p><p>Who the heck is that?\u201D</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve heard the name many times before.</p><hr><p>\u201COf course, Nee...... To, Toh... Toh-Tohno-san! There&#39;s just such a person at this rival women&#39;s academy!</p><p>The one that they call Miss Perfect.\u201D</p><hr><p>Oh? Guess every school has somebody with that nickname... And here I was about to guess Tohsaka.</p><p>Well, not that Sakura would speak ill of her elder sister.</p><hr><p>\u201COh? What sort of a girl is she?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s really unbearable, this Miss Perfect. Everyone is fooled by her.\u201D</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m also a victim,&quot; her deposition seems to say.</p><p>...Hmph. It sounds like Sakura really got treated badly by that girl from the rival school.</p><hr><p>\u201CShe comes from a well-known family and is also a great beauty... her chest is flat, though.</p><p>She&#39;s a top student and even secretly excels in magecraft...</p><p>But she&#39;s basically one clumsy miser, and yet she puts on an air of superiority that has everyone in the dark!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh...\u201D</p><p>I&#39;d never have thought there would be another walking paradox of universe in this world.</p><p>I can&#39;t say whether the world is big, or Japan is small...</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd now she travels all over the world, goes to a foreign school, and has an international career arranged for her! It&#39;s like having a 40cm cannon for a toy! Bam, bam, fire wherever you feel like!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... she seems to be wearing a thick mask.</p><p>It must be troubling to have such a person as a rival.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-It definitely is!</p><p>She looks orderly on the outside, and everyone&#39;s getting fooled by that! And she has a flat chest, too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura, chest size aside, please continue...\u201D</p><p>\u201CO-Okay, we&#39;ll get back to chest sizes later\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShe&#39;s like a roller coaster, sucking innocent bystanders in for a ride, it&#39;s terrible.</p><p>But it&#39;s so high-class that these amusement park visitors are unable to complain, they are just forced to accept it. Without an attraction like this, the park&#39;s popularity would fall... Because everyone&#39;s attracted to Nee-.... I mean, to a Miss Perfect like this...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That... is definitely a problem.\u201D</p><p>But you&#39;ve been making an interesting comparison for a while now, Sakura.</p><hr><p>\u201CB-But the biggest problem is, she&#39;s turned one innocent boy into a mindless servant!</p><p>N-Not that I would resist doing that once or twice, if I could!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my. She sounds like a pro.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, n-no!</p><p>Um, maybe the boy got used to it or something, but lately he looks happy when Miss Perfect is ordering him around.</p><p>But I still think it&#39;s bad to order people around! I am definitely against that!\u201D</p><hr><p>She exudes an aura of determination.</p><p>I involuntarily take a few steps back.</p><hr><p>\u201CI-Is that so... Sakura is... um, err...</p><p>V-Very kind. Y-Yes, that&#39;s it.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hahaha,&quot; I squeeze a smile out of myself.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight! And so I would like to become a well-mannered wife like yourself, Caster-san!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I understand your story fully.</p><p>Matou-san, you want to rescue that boy and make him happy, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, um... that&#39;s... I just think that something should be done about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you have Emiya-kun, Matou-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... No, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m happy that you want to be like me, but...</p><p>Trying to imitate me would not do you any good.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... okay.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI have my bad side too, so please learn from it. Nobody else needs to fall into an evil man&#39;s grasp\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>One quick glare thrown my way is enough to send chills down my spine.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou are not that sort of a man, are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know that Senpai is a good person! Definitely!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo there you have it. How fortunate. Boy, this lady will definitely make you happy\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to answer that, so I just keep silent.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd you have nothing to worry about Miss Perfect.</p><p>The only important things are yourself and the one whom you hold dear.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CR-Right...!</p><p>Really, you are an inspiration for wives everywhere, Caster-san! You&#39;re so different from Miss Perfect...!</p><p>Kuuh... it makes me tear up inside!\u201D</p><hr><p>I guess this is what it feels like to be crying out of happiness.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing fancy to them, yet her words seem to carry about as much destructive energy as her Rule Breaker.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m glad that Sakura&#39;s problems are being solved.</p><hr><p>\u201CCould I call you Onee-sama, please, Caster-san?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, my. It looks like I&#39;ve made a cute little sister.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CS-Sakura... an older sister... don&#39;t you already...\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai, let&#39;s invite Caster-san over to our house and listen to her advice on how to live life the right way!</p><p>Especially the part about dealing with Miss Perfect!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is a tempting invitation. I&#39;ll think about it.</p><p>Right, won&#39;t you shop with us as well, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat sounds great! Senpai, let&#39;s go decide today&#39;s menu for lunch.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, right, that&#39;s what I originally came here for, after all.\u201D</p><p>...Something isn&#39;t quite right, but this isn&#39;t a good time to say &quot;no.&quot;</p><p>Sakura is full of joy and cheer, and Caster seems unusually happy as well.</p><p>...Calm, yet painful, time marches on, wrapping around my neck like a silk string...</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3>', 1380);
