How do you like them apples!?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed, you have outdone yourself.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> You see this face, Munerin? That&#39;s the proud face of a Demon King of the Sixth Heaven employing the Three Line Formation!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I tell you, even I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be just<br> as badass now as I was when I was alive...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...after becoming a Servant AND fighting in a simulator.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I mean, I guess I always knew it deep down, but yeah, I was definitely a one in a million Warring States falconry prodigy.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> You put up a good fight, Munerin, but you just couldn&#39;t quite measure up to my genius.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> But hey, don&#39;t feel bad. It can&#39;t be helped that you&#39;re a daimyo to Takechiyo while I&#39;m a ruler sent by the heavens themselves!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> (I never knew Lady Nobunaga to<br> be such a keen falconer.)</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> (Though I must say, she does not quite fit the picture my lord described...)</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> (Still, I suppose there is little<br> to be gained from dwelling on it.)</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Heh. Be that as it may, Lady Nobunaga, it would<br> seem we both fall short compared to Lord Tell.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say it! Don&#39;t say another word!<br> La la laaa, I can&#39;t heeear yooou!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Wait, hang on. He&#39;s not part of our falconry contest.<br> He&#39;s just shooting arrows willy-nilly!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> So I still won where it counts! I definitely didn&#39;t lose any kind of hunting battle here! I can&#39;t even see the mountain of game he racked up!</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hehe. Well, I am a hunter by trade,<br> so I can&#39;t say it was a fair fight.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Still, no reason you two couldn&#39;t&#39;ve used bows, too. Not sure why you insisted on sticking to trained falcons.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I have heard that hunting was a popular pastime among nobility out in my neck of the woods too, but I get the feeling that&#39;s not what this was about for you two.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> This is one of those \u201Crefinement\u201D things I&#39;m always hearing about, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It might be wabi-sabi stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hmm, gotcha.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Anyways, it was fun seeing how other people hunt.<br> Educational, too.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I just hope my own hunting style didn&#39;t,<br> uh...get in your way too much.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Worry not. I have long been looking forward<br> to seeing your skills for myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s not forget this was technically Nobbu&#39;s idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> No it wasn&#39;t! Tell there just happened to show up<br> when I was inviting Munerin on a falconry hunt!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> In fact, now that I think of it, you showing up in front of the simulation room right then seems less and less like a coincidence.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Ahaaa, now I get it. You basically tricked me into inviting you along, didn&#39;t you? Cunning! Veeery cunning!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Man, if I only had my prized falcon from back when<br> I was alive here, you&#39;d be singing a different tune!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ll never get a chance to show you what I can<br> really do! Which means this whole contest is invalid!</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Fine by me, of course.<br> Sorry you got dragged into judging for us, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No worries! I had time to kill, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> By the way, Lord Tell, may I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Was this hunt just now truly enough for you?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hmm. Saw right through me, huh?<br> Man, you sword guys are something else.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Heh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you guys talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I merely mean that the techniques and essence of a warrior engaging in falconry differ greatly from those of a hunter.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> So I suspect, Lord Tell, that only a fellow hunter can truly provide you with the competition you seek...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...and as such, our contest here has most likely<br> left you unsatisfied. Would you agree?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...You got me.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Just to be clear,<br> it&#39;s not that you guys were pushovers or anything.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> These are all my issues I&#39;ve got to work through.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little embarrassing sharing them, but since you&#39;ve seen through me anyway, what the hell. Mind hearing me out?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well I do!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t over, dammit! I&#39;ll be back as soon as<br> I&#39;ve raised a new falcon! No, wait. I just realized<br> I could have Da Vinci make me a mechanical one, too!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure she used to have something like that perched on her shoulder a while back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say this for Nobbu: she&#39;s nothing if not persistent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nobbu aside, I&#39;d be glad to hear what you have to say too, Tell.</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Thanks.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Basically...I guess it all boils<br> down to me being a hunter.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> And you are indeed an exceptional one.<br> Nobody would doubt that.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> The thing is, my story pretty much ends as<br> soon as I shoot the wicked Vogt through the heart.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, you think you could also be an Assassin?</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> You got it. I knew you were a sharp one, Master.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Anyway, yeah, I did shoot Gessler through the heart.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I might&#39;ve only did it &#39;cause I<br> didn&#39;t have any other choice...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...but I don&#39;t doubt that one deed was still<br> enough for me to become known as a hero.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Still, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;m a hunter<br> at heart, even if I&#39;m here now as an Archer.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I can tell myself that Gessler was<br> just more quarry to take down...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...but when you get down to it, I&#39;d rather stick to hunting animals than killing people.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> That&#39;s not to say this weighs on me all the time, but just like how you don&#39;t always notice it&#39;s time to sweep up until you see how much dust there is on the floor...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...sometimes, you don&#39;t realize you need to do something about your situation until you can&#39;t ignore it anymore.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> And you are feeling that way now?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Pretty much. Hell, maybe I wouldn&#39;t even be thinking about this now if I hadn&#39;t enjoyed our hunting contest so much.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Basically, what I&#39;m trying to say...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...is that I&#39;d like to get back to my roots as a hunter.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> At least until the other aspects of my current<br> manifestation stop bothering me.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hmm. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> What do you think, Master?<br> If I may offer my own opinion...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...I believe this simulator machine<br> could serve this purpose nicely.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Furthermore, there are other hunters in Chaldea who could provide Lord Tell with the competition he seeks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see what Da Vinci thinks!</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Heh, thanks. You&#39;re doing me a big favor.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Phew. That ought to do it.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I like fowl. Their skin&#39;s so soft I never have<br> to worry about my arrows being deflected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I can see from your score.<br> Orion, on the other hand...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, if this contest had been about who could slay ten lions from this forest (with their bare hands) the fastest, I&#39;d have crushed it, okay?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hell, I would&#39;ve even been okay throwing<br> some Lamia in there too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> But tracking down and capturing as many tiny wild<br> fowl as possible before a time limit runs out?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Now that I think about it, I&#39;ve never done anything like that before.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised. You give off such an intimidating hunter&#39;s aura that I could sense it throughout the forest.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, my hunting style basically boils down to<br> \u201CFind animal! Shoot arrow! Done!\u201D</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I never really had to bother with laying out traps<br> or driving animals into dead ends like you did.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Me being me, I knew I could just fire an arrow<br> from anywhere and it&#39;d find its mark.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure. I guess it goes without saying that you&#39;re<br> a much better shot with a bow than I am.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Though that much was probably obvious from the<br> fact I&#39;ve got to rely on a mechanical crossbow.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Looks like we were dealing with way more<br> different hunting styles than we realized.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Orion might have the overwhelming edge<br> when it comes to archery skills...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but I guess that doesn&#39;t help much when you&#39;re<br> trying to track down lots of small animals.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yup! The bigger the game, the better, if you ask me! It&#39;s a lot easier to hit, and there&#39;s more meat to go around.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Given the choice, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever<br> intentionally go after a little animal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really are wild, aren&#39;t you, Orion?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So your specialty is big game, huh...<br> Maybe this playing field wasn&#39;t as level as I thought.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry about that. I guess you guys didn&#39;t<br> get to have a fair contest after all.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t worry about it!<br> Fair or not, a contest&#39;s still a contest!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> And I now know without a doubt that<br> your skills are top-notch, Tell.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I could tell that much just from hunting in the same<br> forest as you. You won this one, fair and square.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m kind of reluctant to claim victory here, seeing how you still almost beat me when you were at a disadvantage...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> But either way, getting to hunt alongside<br> you&#39;s been a hell of an experience.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Thanks for doing this, Orion. I haven&#39;t been this proud to be a hunter in a long time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But you&#39;re still not totally satisfied yet, are you?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hehe, I guess I&#39;m getting a little greedy. Opportunities like this don&#39;t come along every day, after all.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> And hey, as a man of the mountain,<br> I can&#39;t help but be a little stingy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry!<br> Orion&#39;s not the only other hunter I called in.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve also got a few other hunting<br> spot simulations ready to go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So now that we&#39;ve come this far, I&#39;m happy to keep going until you&#39;re good and satisfied!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get started with Hunting Contest No. Two!</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hmm. You know, it&#39;s been so long since I got to spend time in a forest that I think I&#39;ll hang out here a little more somewhere out of your way.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> (I can see it now. By sheer coincidence, I meet-cute a beautiful woman here in the woods. Then, enthralled by my hunting skills, one thing will lead to another, and then... Hehe. Hehehehe!)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Welp, I&#39;m gonna get going.<br> Good luck to both of us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, nothing good&#39;s gonna come from this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be fine, Orion! I&#39;m sure things&#39;ll all work out somehow!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I see. So that is why you wish to<br> hold a hunting contest with me.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Looks that way.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Damn. First it&#39;s Orion, now it&#39;s another<br> legendary hunter from Greek mythology.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Almost makes me feel bad asking you to<br> compete against a nobody like me.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Do not be so modest.<br> I am told your skills are nothing to sneeze at as well.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Also, do not lump me in with that<br> muscle-headed would-be playboy.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I may not have his sheer strength, but strength is unnecessary when it comes to the hunt.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I swear, who was it that first proclaimed him<br> the best hunter in all of Greece, anyway?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She&#39;s not lying. When it comes to hunting, she might<br> well be an even more formidable opponent than Orion.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I&#39;d keep my guard up if I were you.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I know. Not only is she as good a shot as Orion,<br> she can also see clearly in the dead of night.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> And if that weren&#39;t enough...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...legend has it that she was a faster<br> runner than any man alive.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> So she&#39;s got a hell of a mobility advantage<br> when it comes to the hunt.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I do not brute-force my way through a hunt like Orion does, and I am exceptionally skilled at finding small prey.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I am also willing and able to use traps if necessary,<br> though it never is, since no quarry can outrun me.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Watch, and I will show you what a true hunt\u2013one without an ounce of wasted effort\u2013looks like. Be warned, I could not pull my punches, even if I wished to.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Heh. Now you&#39;re talking.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any special tricks or techniques. Everything I know&#39;s just perfectly ordinary stuff I picked up over the course of my life.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> But I know I&#39;m real fortunate to have a legend like you taking the time to compete with me, so I&#39;ll do my best to give you a good match.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, go ahead and get started!<br> And remember, safety first!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Good, this is all going well.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> You know, I cannot remember the last simple, ordinary hunt I went on... This is turning out to be a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Furthermore, since this is a simulator, I can hunt as much as I like without having to worry about the effects on the local ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I think I will try picking up the pace a little bit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Another one! You&#39;re doing great!</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Oh sure.<br> This is easily the fastest I&#39;ve ever gone on a hunt.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> But I can tell from the overall atmosphere out here that there&#39;s less and less quarry for the taking.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I guess the mythical huntress really is going all out against little old me. I&#39;m honored.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Hm? How&#39;m I gonna fight back?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hehe, simple.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> We&#39;re the ones out here hunting,<br> and we&#39;re already doing the best we can.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I can&#39;t pick up the pace any more than I can decide to grow another foot taller.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> When you get right down to it, hunting was never anything more to me than a way to put food on the table.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> It was never the kind of thing I&#39;d be willing to risk my life on for a contest. I don&#39;t have anything more to give to it than what I&#39;ve already got.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> If I had to give more than what I&#39;ve got,<br> it wouldn&#39;t be hunting anymore.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Hmm. That not-strictly-negative but decidedly resigned way of thinking about his own abilities definitely fits his character.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Heck, the way he so fully accepts things as they are almost strikes me as a form of enlightenment.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (He doesn&#39;t seek out or depend on anything<br> more than what&#39;s absolutely necessary.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (He even looks at his own abilities as just another<br> variable in the hunt, much like the weather...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (You really are a hunter&#39;s hunter, Tell.<br> Even more so than Orion or Atalante.)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> All that said, there&#39;s still<br> something I haven&#39;t done yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Great! Then let&#39;s try it!</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> All right... Hmm, this boulder ought to do nicely.<br> Hup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Go on, you have a seat, too. You could use a break<br> after all the work you&#39;ve been putting in.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I know what you&#39;re thinking.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> But the thing is, we just found out more about how<br> the other hunter&#39;s doing than we needed to know.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Whether we try to ignore it or think about it, it&#39;s gonna take up space in our minds and lead to us getting frantic.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> The animals out here will pick up on that,<br> making it harder to track &#39;em down.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> So if trying harder&#39;s only gonna slow us down, the best thing we can do now is rest and regain our focus.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Haste makes waste and all that.</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Exactly. Oh, and if you&#39;re feeling hungry...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...now&#39;s a good time to refuel. Let&#39;s see... &#39;Fraid all I got right now is apples, but they&#39;re yours if you want one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d love one! (Blushing)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> An apple from William Tell? Hell yeah I&#39;ll take one! (Excited)</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> All right, here you go. Catch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aw, I dropped it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh-oh, it&#39;s rolling down a slope! I&#39;ll go after it!</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> There&#39;s more where that came from.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hell, maybe it&#39;ll even give these<br> woods an apple tree eventually.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d be very surprised if that ended up happening,<br> seeing as this is a simulation and all...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> All right, next I will\u2013<br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Am I seeing things, or is that thing<br> rolling away over there... I knew it!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong></p><h4 id="it-is-an-apple" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#it-is-an-apple" aria-hidden="true">#</a> It IS an apple!</h4><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Khh... Wait. I must not go after it.<br> Settle down, right arm!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> That is an ordinary apple, not a golden one. There is no reason for me to be moved by the sight of it. None!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ......And yet...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> (Twitching with the urge to go after it)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> (No. No, I mustn&#39;t. I am in a forest right now. My hunting instincts are surging now that I am on a hunt again. An apple\u2013apple\u2013apple\u2013apple...)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> (Apple... Contest... Apple... Hunt...<br> No! This cannot end well!)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> (Twitching more strongly than ever)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong></p><h4 id="meooow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#meooow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Meooow!!!</h4><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hm? Odd. Now it feels like the powerful hunting aura Atalante was putting out there is fading from the woods...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Oh well, nothing we need to worry about.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> All right, what do you say we get back to the hunt now? On our own terms, of course.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> (Gasp)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong></p><h4 id="d-death-to-apple-rollers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#d-death-to-apple-rollers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> D-death to apple rollers!</h4><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> So, what&#39;s the final tally?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;ll spare you the details so as not to embarrass her, but it looks like you guys came out on top in the en\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait. Huh? Hang on.<br> What the hell&#39;s this signal\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait. Huh?

But why\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder what that was about...</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Stop! Stay right where you are, Master!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Whatever you do, don&#39;t move a muscle.<br> Don&#39;t turn around, don&#39;t even make a sound.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (What in the world&#39;s going on?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...!!!)</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (This pressure is intense... That thing&#39;s got to be the biggest predator on the mountain or something like it.)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (Why&#39;d it show up out of nowhere like this?<br> No, never mind that now. It&#39;s not important.)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (What&#39;s important is that it&#39;s in a real bad<br> spot\u2013way too damn close to Fujimaru!)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (It&#39;s obviously got [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] in its sights.<br> One wrong move, and [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] could easily end up dead.)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t wait around for it to make a move.<br> It could attack Master at any moment.)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t have time to move to the best vantage point.<br> If I&#39;m gonna shoot it, it&#39;s gotta be now. But...)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (Ugh, dammit, why&#39;d it have to choose that spot?<br> If I take the shot from here and miss, it&#39;ll hit<br> Fujimaru!)</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> (I&#39;ll just have to risk it. If it&#39;s my only option, there&#39;s no sense worrying about it...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Realize that Tell&#39;s decided to make his move, and wait.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Trust that Tell knows what he&#39;s doing, and wait.)</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Phew! Now&#39;s your chance, Master! Quick, get behind me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Tell!</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Don&#39;t thank me just yet. All that did was distract<br> it for a moment. It&#39;s not down for the count yet.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> As a hunter, I hate to inflict any wounds on<br> my quarry that aren&#39;t absolutely necessary...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> But I couldn&#39;t aim for a vital spot from that angle.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Now, it&#39;s time to finish it off for good.<br> I&#39;m counting on you to watch my back, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Sheesh. I&#39;m still cold sweating bullets.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did great, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew you could pull it off.</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Heh. Honestly, I was pretty damn scared.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> My hands were shaking, my heart was pounding,<br> my throat was completely parched...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> All I could think about was how much I didn&#39;t want to do this. Pathetic, really.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. It was just like the time<br> I had to shoot an apple off my son&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...This is a good opportunity to make something clear. As Servants go, I&#39;m pretty damn weak.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I&#39;m not descended from any gods, nor do I have any legendary weapons or armor.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I&#39;m just an ordinary guy who barely managed to shoot an evil man dead with the ordinary skills I&#39;d built up over my life.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I&#39;m an ordinary parent, an ordinary hunter...and I&#39;m just as weak and afraid of death as any other normal person.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> So, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...it doesn&#39;t feel right, having you look up at me with the same admiration you have for actual heroes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But even with all those human weaknesses,you&#39;re still able to make a shot when it really counts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You might be weak, but coming through when the chipsare down is anything but an ordinary strength.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you are an actual hero, just as much as any other.</p><hr><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Well damn. Is making me blush a hobby of yours<br> or something? &#39;Cause you&#39;re real good at it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey! You two okay!? You are?<br> Phew... What a relief.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey! You two okay!? You are?<br> Phew... What a relief.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry about that. There was some kind<br> of error or bug or something in the system...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and it ended up outputting an enemy that was a whole order of magnitude more dangerous than the high-level boss data I was using for the toughest quarry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s weird, though. I could have sworn I double-checked the code to make sure nothing like this would happen before executing it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. Maybe something wonky made its way into the simulator and threw off my calculations?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I could see a powerful Divinity&#39;s magical energy<br> manipulations having this kind of effect on the system...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh Daaarliiinnng!<br> I love it when you actually go out hunting!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Except when you&#39;re hunting for girls instead of game.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Dammit, figures I&#39;d catch just the kind of fish I wasn&#39;t out trawling for!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Why&#39;d it have to be the kind that practically<br> jumps into your net itself!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AArtemis:</strong><br> Why do you sound so disappointed, Darling?<br> And why are you running away from me, hmm?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AArtemis:</strong><br> Teehee, I guess I&#39;ll just have to make you tell<br> me what you were up to in here, one way or another!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That would sound hot coming from anyone else,<br> but from you, I can only imagine it means torture!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AArtemis:</strong><br> Well of course. After all, you were conspiring<br> to cheat on me, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Conspiring?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hang on. Isn&#39;t it every fisherman&#39;s right<br> to throw back the catches he doesn&#39;t need?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Besides, what&#39;s wrong with bringing home a different kind of fish now and then!? Even bears get sick of having nothing but salmon all the time!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AArtemis:</strong><br> And what about the poor fish who WANT to be eaten!?<br> Did you ever think about them!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AArtemis:</strong></p><h4 id="now-feel-my-love-mixed-messages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#now-feel-my-love-mixed-messages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Now feel my love! (Mixed messages)</h4><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Aaarrrggghhh! If only my muscles didn&#39;t<br> make for such a broad targeeeeeet!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, anyway, I just upgraded the security on these environments and password-protected them, so this kind of thing should never happen again.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Again, I am SO sorry about this.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t worry about it. Sure, I was taken aback when that thing showed up out of nowhere, but all that matters is that Master wasn&#39;t hurt.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Besides, while I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s exactly common<br> to go around hunting giant beasts like that...</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I can&#39;t deny they&#39;re a hell of an opportunity<br> for a hunter to show what they can really do.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> So this ended up being a great way to wrap things up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then, does that mean you&#39;re satisfied?</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I am. This was everything I was hoping for.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> I got to remember who I really am...<br> and to show Master what I can really do.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Sure, there might be more than one way to interpret that, but I got back in touch with my roots, and that&#39;s good enough for me.</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> ...Though not without my fair share of embarrassment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmph. Sounds like something big went down<br> while I wasn&#39;t around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This was the kind of story so epic you want to tell your grandchildren about it one day, wasn&#39;t it!? No fair!</p><p><strong>Tell:</strong><br> Hey now, cut me some slack. It wasn&#39;t all fun and games for me, you know? I had some seriously traumatic flashbacks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which is why it&#39;s going to remain our little secret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry Da Vinci, this stays between me and Tell.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait. Don&#39;t tell me apples were involved somehow?<br> Nooo faaair!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wait. Don&#39;t tell me apples were involved somehow?<br> Nooo faaair!</p>', 362);
