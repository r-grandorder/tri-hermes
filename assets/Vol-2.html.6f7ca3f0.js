That I can do it even without Chitose\u2019s protection, and even without a partnered Servant, for I want to convince myself that I can properly live alone.</p><p>Luckily, I was possessed by evil spirits.</p><p>I was pleased that I was able to make full use of even a mass of evil spirits that lurked within my blood, managing them as if they were my limbs, and even at times as weapons that were faster than a knife. I was sure in being undoubtedly able to not only protect myself, but even hunt enemy Servants\u2026 I was proud of myself like that.</p><p>And then\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><p>While I was submerged in the muddy waters of self-conceit, I had stepped into a certain incident.</p><p>A single male citizen I happened to meet by chance in a group therapy session had a difficult problem.</p><p>While struggling, this man was also looking for a place where he can belong to as he tried to live within this Mosaic City.</p><p>The man told me that he was a leather craftsman. He made bags and children shoes before selling them wholesale to shops.</p><p>In his quiet workshop where only his hammering can be heard from far away, the man always showed a gentle smile on his face.</p><p>His muscular, toned body that could mistake him for being a Servant was trained by going through ascetic gym work. In some respects, there was a similarity between our situations.</p><p>On no account could we both remove the uncomfortable feeling that followed our lives within this city.</p><p>An anguishing soul is here.</p><p>If so, I can get close to this <ruby>man<rt>person</rt></ruby>. I can understand him. In addition, by any chance, maybe I could even save this man\u2500\u2500\u2500I don\u2019t need to turn to Caren, nor Lucius; only to my own power. That\u2019s the most important point.</p><p>Ah, this\u2500\u2500\u2500is the first real \u201Cwork\u201D I\u2019ve found. Like that, I quietly shivered in pleasure.</p><p>However\u2026 that man was secretly ill mentally since long before I met him.</p><p>It was already so serious, he passed the point of recovery.</p><p>There were even many chances for me to notice it and escape from him. But I was young and foolish.</p><p>I didn\u2019t happen to have the experience to measure the depth of the man\u2019s darkness, and above all, I was largely lacking something important.</p><p>Nearby the leather craftsman, there was always a handsome-looking <ruby>Heroic Spirit<rt>Servant</rt></ruby> who could give somebody the impression of a white porcelain doll accompanying the man.</p><p>That dreadful child\u2500\u2500\u2500Louis.</p><p>The Duke of Normandy, \u201CLouis XVII\u201D. The last King of France at the end of the Bourbon Dynasty. The second son of Queen Marie Antoinette, who was put to the guillotine at Paris\u2019 Revolution Square.</p><p><ruby>He<rt>Louis</rt></ruby> was quite chatty, different from his <ruby>contractor<rt>Master</rt></ruby> who didn\u2019t open his mouth except for the bare minimum.</p><p>\u201CWhat did you say you were gathering in the city? \u2018Fragments of \u201Cemotions\u201D\u2019? You said such a thing, right Erice?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s unusual, Erice. Even interesting, Erice. Doesn\u2019t that mean you want to be human? That you\u2019re\u2026 not human?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Probably\u2026 Still-\u201C</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m positive! A dead person would still be more expressive than you and would at least feel pain. AHAHAH, now, this is getting more and more interesting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t pinch my cheeks. I\u2026 understand pain. I just don\u2019t know much about it, yet.\u201D</p><p>Even in the school class I was in at the time, I was a foreign substance.</p><p>The other students\u2500\u2500\u2500the new generation of classmates born after the War \u2013 everybody was kind, quick to understand things, and appeared happy. Not even a single student tried to do something nonsensical like participating in bullying, and they also didn\u2019t ostentatiously flaunt their partnered Servants.</p><p>Because they were content since birth, it wasn\u2019t especially necessary for them to ingest the drug called \u2018a sense of superiority\u2019. I guess even the charity that cared for me \u2013 who lacked just about everything \u2013 was proud of me.</p><p>As far as I\u2019m concerned, the school was just like a hospital. It was a lifelong ward that kindly wrapped me up with good intentions and thoughtfulness.</p><p>There was a time in my school life when, because of a trouble that started from my misunderstanding, I had a quarrel with a classmate, and that classmate ended up receiving a minor injury from me.</p><p>At that time, the Servant of that classmate promptly materialized, breaking the rule of prohibited manifestation within the school, and they worked to try to dispel my misunderstanding. I wasn\u2019t condemned at all, and even the people around me accepted and consented to that result.</p><p>When the classmate in question \u2013 who should be the victim \u2013 bowed their head to me for their lack of consideration and even robbed me of a chance in making a shameful apology, it was like I was punched in the face.</p><p>If I try to look back on it now\u2026 the Servants, I think they had been sensitive to the fact that I was a dangerous existence to them.</p><p>When I disclosed such a story to him while feeling ashamed, he kept silent for a little while, before saying:</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Wisdom that can\u2019t be learned at school, huh? I suppose there are even\u2026 several things like that. But I also wanted to receive education and try to savour things like freedom and equality that naturally comes with it. Well, Erice? Is something like emotions necessary in this city where one can live even without doing anything? What\u2019s the point in trying to understand things like the suffering and sadness of another person?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey\u2019re necessary. For a citizen of Mosaic City, and for the sake of continuing to live within this city. Because emotions are something that I, who doesn\u2019t possess a Servant nor a Holy Grail, can obtain. I\u2026 want to be wanted by everyone. I want them to accept me by saying, \u201CIt\u2019s fine for you to stay here.\u201D\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Is that so? Well, it seems that\u2019s a very important thing to you. Well then, at any rate, it\u2019s fine if you stay here. At this <ruby>leather workshop<rt>Atelier Quill</rt></ruby>. I\u2019ll never particularly care if you do, and I\u2019ll still be bored like before too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s\u2026 alright for me to call you by? Prince\u2026 Charles\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYuck\u2500\u2500\u2500Call me Louis. I\u2019m the last Louis.\u201D</p><p>I became friends with <ruby>him<rt>Louis</rt></ruby>. My first friend of around the same age. My young self had believed that it was a chance meeting. Even\u2026 a fateful one. I didn\u2019t know anything.</p><p>After that, I often visited the workshop where the leather craftsman and Louis were.</p><p>The Mosaic City Servants are loyal partners of their <ruby>contractors<rt>Masters</rt></ruby>. They protect their Masters and lend their powers to them for the sake of promoting their partners\u2019 self-actualization within this complex society.</p><p>I even believed in such a thing\u2026 the whole time.</p><p>However, the truth is different from that.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500Servants also\u2026 have \u201Cdesires\u201D\u2026 they want to fulfill.</p><p>The Holy Grail System, which created Mosaic City, surmises the latent aspirations of individual citizens before matching them with Servants that are most compatible to them.</p><p>The Holy Grail isn\u2019t omnipotent.</p><p>To those who truly hold no desires, and to those who completely refuse to follow around others, Servants were nothing more than meddlesome targets of their disgust.</p><p>Even group therapy, which I had been partially forced to attend, was a measure for <ruby>City Management AIs<rt>Caren</rt></ruby> to try to provide care for those sorts of people. Many of the therapy users were also people who were deeply scarred emotionally by the prior War.</p><p>Mixed into the therapy users, there\u2026 were citizens who desired the complete ruin of their very own selves.</p><p>The Holy Grail allocates Servants to properly heal such Masters.</p><p>He\u2026 the monster called Avenger Louis XVII\u2026 was awakened from the land of the dead and was released into this world again.</p><p>That\u2019s a bug of the Holy Grail that even Chitose didn\u2019t intend for.</p><p>It was an exposure of the carelessness and limits in changing and entrusting the act of measuring the people\u2019s hearts\u2026 to magecraft.</p><p>The <ruby>moral prosecutors<rt>Censors</rt></ruby> of Mosaic City were once again reminded that, at the root of humanity, there\u2019s no distinction between good and evil.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500The first murder case\u2026 occurred in Tama, one of the cities of Mosaic City.</p><p>The criminal had expanded their scope of activities to Shibuya and Shinjuku without having their movements caught.</p><p>Because the whereabouts of the victims were unknown for a long period of time, each murder incident wasn\u2019t recognized to be correlated to each other, and chances of that state of affairs being discovered were slowly disappearing.</p><p>The victims\u2026 were either people who avoided manifesting their own Servants for some kind of reason, or people where manifesting Servants is effectively impossible for them.</p><p>A typical case would be focused on a patient who has Servantphobia where they bore a psychological trauma as a result of a Servant killing their family before their very eyes during the War.</p><p>There was also a clever camouflage where traces of the victims\u2019 disappearance were purposely left behind so that people would misread the disappearance as a voluntary act of the victims.</p><p>They didn\u2019t disappear.</p><p>Each and every single victim was taken to a prison.</p><p>They were physically and magically isolated due to Louis\u2019 unique Noble Phantasm, \u201C<ruby>There is Salvation of Death in the Prison of Mud<rt>La Grosse Tour</rt></ruby>\u201D.</p><p>Once they were caught in the Noble Phantasm\u2019s area of effect, it was impossible for them to seek help from the outside.</p><p>The leather craftsman\u2026 processed them while carefully preserving their vital activities. They had brass tacks nailed into them, were meticulously tanned with chromium sulfate, and were sewn together with needles and threads.</p><p>They were made out into a work that expresses the anguish of idly staying alive.</p><p>Several months after the first disappearance, a work of his was discovered in a quiet park in Shinjuku. Forty-five minutes after its installation, there was not even an uproar about the work, and it was so delicately finished that it was recognized by passersby as avant-garde art.</p><p>This provocative act was projected as a great threat to the people of Mosaic City, who were trying to break free from the disorder of the postwar period and regain their peaceful daily lives little by little.</p><p>Authorities also responded promptly, spreading out a dragnet for this theatrical crime. Arrest was now a matter of time since Servants and personnel that were renowned in the fields of criminology and detective work were mobilized to take the lead in the investigation and come to grips with a solution to this case.</p><p>Since that has happened, arrest was now indeed a matter of time. The criminal\u2019s profile was narrowed down, and the dragnet had also steadily contracted.</p><p>\u2026 However, since it already reached this stage, the culprit wasn\u2019t really thinking about successfully escaping. I know that well. Even inviting the investigators closer to him was something done to meet the desires of the leather craftsman.</p><p>At that time, I was also aware that the pros that looked after the public order of Mosaic City \u2013 whom have a connection to Caren and Chitose \u2013 were hurriedly making every effort in dealing with the incident.</p><p>Nevertheless, I only remember a faint sense of anxiety and alienation, and never felt a sense of danger. Even despite being in the middle of the incident at that moment.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500That was the last conversation I had with him, before realizing the leather craftsman\u2019s true character. Looking back, it was the day I exchanged the most words with that man.</p><p>At that day, with just the two of us in the workshop, I stared at the leather craftsman\u2019s delicate working manner.</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500Utsumi. Listen. I want to have a talk with you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CErice. E-ri-ce\u2500\u2500\u2500Remember the name, Mr. Craftsman.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Listen. Don\u2019t come to this workshop anymore, Utsumi.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLouis isn\u2019t here just for today\u2026 So why do you say such a thing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat guy made me expend my Command Spells so that he could go out to the other cities.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy is that, <ruby>Craftsman<rt>Meister</rt></ruby>? You said it\u2019s fine for me to come visit this workshop at any time. Besides, you promised that you\u2019ll teach me how to use a knife. Were they all lies? Look, even these <ruby>deerskin shoes<rt>moccasins</rt></ruby>\u2026 you\u2019re still making them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll be busy. If there\u2019s something you want, you can take them as you please.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Are you going to close the workshop, and leave the city\u2026 or something? I wonder if you\u2019ll then say \u2018I\u2019m going to run away at night.\u2019 Because it sounds a little like that from the way you\u2019re talking. But you shouldn\u2019t run away. The leathercraft made by the Craftsman is something truly wonderful. Louis looked proud while saying, \u201CBoth the sacoche and baby shoes sold out instantly when I went to sell them to the stores.\u201D\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201D</p><p>As he stared intensely at the workbench, the leather craftsman won\u2019t reply with anything.</p><p>The sitting man \u2013 who shrugged his shoulders that have their deltoid muscles completely developed \u2013 has no spirit. He was like a puppy who was scolded by their master and didn\u2019t try to face their gaze. Even though he was a large man who also has about twice the height on me.</p><p>\u201CIs that\u2026 perhaps, my fault? Did someone catch sight of me going to this workshop and reported it as a good publicity stunt, or something? I wonder if they said something that didn\u2019t need to be said to inflate their absurd delusions? That sort of person is what I call a citizen with \u2018self-proclaimed good intentions\u2019. If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll even directly negotiate with that person and persuade-\u201C</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500That\u2019s not it. That sort of problem didn\u2019t happen. You\u2019re good at conducting yourself so that you don\u2019t have the public gaze sticking on you. You\u2019re also always watchful so that you don\u2019t have others tailing you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, but\u2026 Then, why in the world\u2026\u201D</p><p>I tried to look like I\u2019m only unhappy, putting on a brave front as much as possible, but I\u2019m actually shocked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t endure in completely losing this cozy place.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to worry about who I am when I can be here, in this corner of the city where only a little light of the world shone through a small dormer window of the semi-basement workshop\u2026 Even though it was such an important place.</p><p>I can\u2019t even see Louis\u2019 clear face, who frankly doesn\u2019t mince matters in making fun of me. I was extremely unlikely to stand with that kind of treatment.</p><p>More than anything, I\u2500\u2500\u2500haven\u2019t accomplished this work yet.</p><p>I haven\u2019t determined\u2026 what was tormenting this man\u2019s soul.</p><p>I\u2019ve never revealed to the leather craftsman and Louis that I\u2019m somebody who has a connection to Caren. To say nothing of the information that would make someone hold something like prejudice towards the grandchild of Minazuru Chitose; that also has been concealed from everyone. Even if someone looked me up in the <ruby>city\u2019s information network<rt>Network</rt></ruby>, work was also being performed on the main database so that they would be going over dummy information.</p><p>However\u2026 it seems that the child\u2019s crafty secrets were entirely found out by that man from the beginning. And yet, he still had me closely by his side because he was surely even willing to let all that come to light to him if it was through me.</p><p>The man looked at me.</p><p>His dark gaze that soon approached me\u2026 was crazed and bloodshot.</p><p>\u201CHave you never thought about\u2026 wanting to change this city, Utsumi?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026 The\u2026 city?\u201D</p><p>I was taken aback.</p><p>Even though it was I who wanted to change it despite not knowing it back then. Rather, it was this man before my very eyes who, on the verge of insanity, wanted to change everything about this world.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was just about\u2026 when you were born. That War\u2026 came to an end.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026 I wasn\u2019t present for the War. I sometimes hear stories about it from people.\u201D</p><p>Even if I\u2019m not part of the new breed of humans who possesses a \u201CHoly Grail\u201D, there\u2019s no mistake that I\u2019m still a human of the new generation of humanity.</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500The form of the world has been like this since the time I was born. I\u2019ve never thought about changing this world, just trying to familiarize myself with it the best I can instead. Though, I\u2019m aware there are such thoughts.\u201D</p><p>The leather craftsman urges me to continue while his gaze remains fixed at me.</p><p>\u201CIn therapy, one old man had said\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2019I didn\u2019t want something like immortality from the beginning. I just wanted to live, and die, naturally. The \u2018Holy Grail\u2019\u2026 it was not something good to obtain at all if there is not even a compensation for me in return. That does not recompense the lot who had died in the War. What the heck is the so-called difference between those people and us? There is no difference\u2019\u2026 So he said.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s the \u201Cemotion\u201D you learned, huh? However, that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s the feeling you\u2019re telling to yourself.\u201D</p><p>The man\u2019s fingers grabbed both my shoulders.</p><p>\u201CThat elder\u2026 he wants to go to the side of his family who died in the War. The \u201CHoly Grail\u201D\u2026 it does not try to grant that wish by any means. It just merely soothes him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe doesn\u2019t do that\u2026 because he can\u2019t kill himself? It\u2019s a very scary thing, and the Servants will stop him if he tries. Automatically.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo those guys have such a right? This\u2026 This is the land of humanity! IT\u2019S THE LAND OF HUMANITY! Why is it necessary to borrow the power of ghosts? Even if the outside of the city is a hell where humans can\u2019t live in even now, the reason we\u2019re receiving a treatment like this\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D</p><p>I wasn\u2019t bothered by his fingers digging into my shoulders so tightly that it left marks on them.</p><p>I was surprised by the fact that the man\u2026 has such strong emotions towards Servants.</p><p>That\u2019s still a mystery to me that I\u2019ve noticed\u2026 during our meager exchange. It was supposed to be an opportunity for me to know what kind of hope he\u2019s trying to entrust to his Servant, Louis.</p><p>\u2026 However, the man stepped back like he was in dismay when I stared right back straight at him.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 Sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201D</p><p>The leather craftsman \u2013 who spoke so fervently \u2013 averted his gaze, put some distance from me, and returned to silence again.</p><p>I wanted to hear more of the man\u2019s talk.</p><p>His hidden emotions can\u2019t be recited into words. What he personally felt in his heart\u2026 It seemed to me that the man wanted to convey such emotions to me at that time. That was a terrible mistake.</p><p>\u201C<ruby>Craftsman<rt>Meister</rt></ruby>. Do you hate this city? Do you think about wanting to destroy it completely, or something like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis city\u2026 I\u2026 love it. I want to save it. From the bottom of my heart.\u201D</p><p>His empty words reverberate.</p><p>\u201CNevertheless, I\u2019m still intending to go away.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026\u201D</p><p>I haven\u2019t changed in the slightest as of now; still a child, and still foolish.</p><p>Emotions\u2026 can only be expressed as actions. A true wish can\u2019t be fulfilled just by believing.</p><p>The people, the cities, and the world\u2026 can only be changed by shedding blood.</p><p>A few days have passed after that.</p><p>I nervously came in contact with the Borgia Siblings, buying information from them that was circulating through the underside of society for my work. During that course, I became aware that the search area for the aforementioned grotesque incident was narrowed down to the Akihabara District.</p><p>Regarding the works once again\u2026 the remains of who was once known as the victim was discovered, the surveillance network has left a blurred image of the suspect \u2013 who slipped past the heightened emergency state, and moreover, people have also noticed that a new missing person has been announced.</p><p>I was feeling suspicious of the leather craftsman and Louis, but I couldn\u2019t really get used to having a doubtful mental attitude towards them. Somewhere in my heart, I categorized them as ones whom would stand with the side of the victims of Mosaic City, and I couldn\u2019t throw away that assumption.</p><p>Even after the serious conversation with the leather craftsman, I visited the workshop without expectation.</p><p>Every time I saw the door of the workshop having its shutter down, I shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>I also met Louis \u2013 who was alone downtown \u2013 by chance. Although I was relieved to know that the craftsman has yet to leave the city, the words I emitted to him \u2013 who has the same attitude as usual \u2013 couldn\u2019t somewhat get to the point I wanted to make. While exchanging words with him, it soon became a little quarrel between us, and we awkwardly separated from each other.</p><p>Servants can disappear if they feel like doing so. He probably\u2026 let me find him on purpose. And yet, I overlooked the signs he was showing to me.</p><p>Something was different that day.</p><p>The closure of the workshop\u2019s shutter was incomplete, and the lock had traces of being picked from the outside.</p><p>There was no prior foreboding, or unpleasant hunch, or anything like that.</p><p>But suddenly\u2500\u2500\u2500my body\u2019s spiritual affliction spread out, and dark red blood seeped from my wounds.</p><p>The evil spirits were actively noisy and notified me of something abnormal.</p><p>Somebody died in the immediate vicinity of the workshop.</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Aah\u2026 Hii\u2026 Guu\u2026\u201D</p><p>I groaned in disgust and discomfort. One more. And another\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><p>While enduring the pain, I crept into the completely silent workshop, and saw an unknown man collapsed on the floor face down in a pool of blood.</p><p>He was an investigator with the authorities. A half moon-shaped round knife pierced deeply into his throat, having ended his life.</p><p>There were no signs of the investigator\u2019s Servant being here in the surroundings. But on the other hand, I caught with my eyes the door of a hidden passageway on an unexpected wall of the workshop having an open gap, showing me a view of some traces of blood that were scattered in drops, all heading towards the basement.</p><p>From the basement, a muffled and sorrowful cry, and a cheerful voice singing in French, were resoundingly leaking out.</p><p>\u201CLouis\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D</p><p>Having my attention caught by the lord\u2019s voice, and trying to get into the passage, I didn\u2019t notice that the criminal who caused this tragedy got behind me before I became aware of him.</p><p>And\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><p>Coming to my senses, I was pinned under the man\u2019s large frame, who didn\u2019t move at all.</p><p>After dozens of tense seconds have passed by, the workshop was in a terrible condition due to the damage caused during the life-or-death struggle.</p><p>The damage caused to me was also no less as awful as the workshop\u2019s condition. One of my shoulder joints was dislocated, leaving that one arm with no strength at all, and my ribs that were struck by a hammer appeared to be broken, the ribs on the verge of cracking.</p><p>I was crushed and couldn\u2019t breathe as I am currently, but I somehow pushed the man aside so that I could crawl out from underneath his arm, before standing up as I staggered. I\u2019m the only one alive in this workshop. One of my eyes was out of focus from being struck, and while I scolded that eye, I headed for the basement once again.</p><p>Rather than calling it a basement\u2026 it was more like the dungeon itself.</p><p>An unrealistic space where jails, furnished with evenly spaced iron bars, lined up left and right of the passage. It was also as dark as the night of a new moon, and the smell of filth hung in the air.</p><p>There were also traces of a violent conflict engraved into this place.</p><p>At the center of the intersecting passageways, in the middle of a pool of blood belonging to the victims that had turned into corpses and were scattered about, was <ruby>him<rt>Louis</rt></ruby>, blending in with the corpses.</p><p>His upper body was smeared with bright red blood, and he was kneeling on the ground without any strength, humming that song with his hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Louis?\u201D</p><p>While I felt a powerful magical energy, simultaneously, I felt an enormous flow of magical energy continuing to disperse from this place, the energy rapidly fading away.</p><p>A Servant who lost his <ruby>contractor<rt>Master</rt></ruby>.</p><p>The magical energy produced in compensation for the blasphemous abuse of life where the citizens are used as sacrifices is being directly supplied to Louis, allowing this space to be maintained. However, even the <ruby>remaining time<rt>lost time</rt></ruby> given should only be a short one.</p><p>Surveying each jail, there were people who were captured and were bound to become the next work of art. I fear that they were administered a drug, being forced to a listless and relaxed state. I\u2019m not even sure if they\u2019re alive or dead.</p><p>\u201CLouis\u2500\u2500\u2500your <ruby>Craftsman<rt>Meister</rt></ruby> died. I\u2026 killed him. If he had let go of his weapon, I wouldn\u2019t have killed him\u2026 because I\u2019m weak\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even when I addressed to him my words of apology, he had no response. Nothing will reach his ears or eyes anymore.</p><p>He was about to be released from his contract and return to the \u201CThrone of Heroes\u201D. His transient life bestowed by the Holy Grail will disappear. That\u2019s the death of a Servant.</p><p>What did he gain by being a supporting actor of this unprecedented grotesque crime that occurred after the postwar disorder period? What did he desired as a hero, or as an anti-hero?</p><p>Although the leather craftsman tried to change the world, it was just a failed attempt to spread death in the end, and wasn\u2019t <ruby>he<rt>Louis</rt></ruby> merely a victim of the Revolution?</p><p>Would he jokingly say: \u2018I\u2019m a Servant of the \u201CAvenger\u201D Class\u2019? Did he desired to be released from prison\u2026 and escape to the outside?</p><p>A tragedy that wouldn\u2019t occur\u2026 if neither the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D nor Servants exist.</p><p>(Is the War\u2026 still going on\u2026?)</p><p>I tried to digest the unwavering facts as I was overcome with surprise.</p><p>If the <ruby>contractor<rt>Master</rt></ruby> dies, then the Servant disappears. Even if I understood that, I couldn\u2019t understand the true significance of it. What the heck can I do\u2026 if I don\u2019t have the qualifications to be a Master?</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500The usual song\u2026 stopped.</p><p>\u201CWho\u2019s there\u2026?\u201D He muttered, perhaps perceiving my body temperature as I was standing stock still.</p><p>He\u2026 was no longer a beautiful boy who looked like a doll. He looked like he was starving and haggard, his cheeks are thin, and his limbs have shriveled as if he was an old person.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 The Grim Reaper, huuh\u2026 Fine, take it\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 a little worn out\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CLouis.\u201D</p><p>When he collapsed onto his back, I rushed over and supported him. I held his head with my knees as a substitute for a pillow, and peered into his hollow eyes that didn\u2019t look at anything even when they were wide open.</p><p>He, who became faint, may not recognize who I am anymore.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell \u2018It\u2019s me, it\u2019s Erice\u2019 to him. I wanted him to hear my apology.</p><p>But\u2500\u2500\u2500gasping, I was at a loss for words, speechless before my quivering lips. As I was in front of him \u2013 who was dying \u2013 I thought that I just didn\u2019t want to get my feelings hurt like that; nothing more than my awful selfishness.</p><p>I tightly grasped his bony fingertips, just trying to see him with my own eyes in silence.</p><p>He let out a deep, long breath, as if he was relieved.</p><p>\u201C<ruby>Mother<rt>M\xE8re</rt></ruby>\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500That was his last word before he vanished.</p><p>Soaked in the pool of blood, I hugged the empty space where he was before.</p><p>I writhed in regret and disgrace as I tightly closed my eyelids.</p><p>\u2026 Someone asked me a question. Without even any kind of advanced notice. And in a very astonished tone.</p><p>\u201CHey, aren&#39;t\u2026 you moved to tears?\u201D</p><p>When I raised my face\u2500\u2500\u2500right in front of my eyes, there was a terrifying appearance like that of a devil.</p><p>It was a dragon\u2026 no, that\u2019s not it; it was a dinosaur. An ancient organism of the carnivorous \u2013 and especially ferocious \u2013 type, and a creature that shouldn\u2019t exist in the modern era\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500Or, are your tear glands suddenly broken? That person who returned to the Throne just now, wasn\u2019t he someone special to you?\u201D</p><p>I unconsciously flinched.</p><p>With that, the scene of the prison that had surrounded me and the dinosaur faded away.</p><p>The lighting returned, illuminating the empty, undressed-concrete room. This is the original view of the basement. The effects of the Noble Phantasm of the vengeful Louis have worn off.</p><p>The abducted victims have collapsed and were scattered along the walls.</p><p>The dinosaur before my very eyes still has its huge body, its head looking like it was scraping against the ceiling.</p><p>\u201CIs this entity\u2026 a Servant?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s Momi.\u201D</p><p>A girl suddenly makes her appearance from the dinosaur\u2019s shadow.</p><p>Her age range is the same as mines. Her hair is short, and her height is a little tall. She has a boyish style with the Sukajan and short leather pants she\u2019s wearing. At that time, she still had a small build and had a contrastive form compared to me who grew out my hair long. If I didn\u2019t hear her voice, I thought I would\u2019ve mistaken her for a young man. Nonetheless, her tone is quite rude.</p><p>Yeah, it was her, and not the dinosaur, who addressed me. It was likely that her Servant was staring at us while being silent.</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500It\u2019s ok to cry. He just died. Although it was that guy\u2019s partner who kidnapped me, wasn\u2019t he a special person to you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 how to cry\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 ashamed\u2026 I\u2019m almost dead.\u201D</p><p>She embraced me, who was crouched and battered, from the front, like she was covering me with a shroud.</p><p>\u201CI see. That guy was unmanageable.\u201D</p><p>Good grief. I\u2019ve never been right in the middle of a mayhem.</p><p>A murderous urge that can\u2019t be suppressed. The death of a friend. A strange child with a sense of distance. And a dinosaur.</p><p>\u201CAah, you\u2019re tattered and bloody, huh? You\u2019re painful to look at, aren\u2019t you. Hey, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re living though. Well, I didn\u2019t take a bath yet, so we\u2019re similar in that we\u2019re both dirty.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026 Yeah.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahah.\u201D</p><p>As I received her baffling embrace, I became a listener to her story that I didn\u2019t even ask for.</p><p>I had confirmed that the magic communication line has already been restored and that reinforcements from the authorities are heading towards here. There\u2019s nothing I can do but wait quietly, and reluctantly go along with her story.</p><p>As expected, the girl was a victim abducted by the leather craftsman, and she eventually became one of the few survivors of the incident.</p><p>She was abducted while visiting Akihabara and was made unconscious through some chemicals. As a matter of fact, she was in the middle of running away from her home, and her family may not have submitted a missing person report.</p><p>So far, no child was included in the list of missing people. But in the end, I can\u2019t deny that the man was impatient enough to even target children, just like when he came to attack me. However, she wasn\u2019t kidnapped indiscriminately.</p><p>She previously participated in some therapy session at her parents\u2019 recommendation. It appears she was marked by the leather craftsman at that occasion.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve\u2026 never summoned a Servant...? You too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CToo?\u201D The girl tilted her head to the side in response. \u201CKarin. That\u2019s my name.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Karin\u2026 Then that dinosaur is your Servant?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah! It\u2019s my first time too. Today is my first time that I\u2019ve met Momi! Although it\u2019s not what I had imagined at all\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D</p><p>Her face lit up with excitement.</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500But, it\u2019s unbelievably cute! Right!?\u201D</p><p>Her cohort\u2026 the dinosaur growled lowly. Did she smile?</p><p>The True Name of the strange-looking Servant will eventually be identified as the Berserker, Kijyo Kouyou.</p><p>Karin was raised in a household where the summoning of Servants is strictly prohibited, so she has never attempted to <ruby>summon one<rt>do that</rt></ruby>, save for an accidental case where she was concerned about the preservation of her own life.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m secretly chatting with Momi in my house while keeping this a secret from my family. Well, rather than say, chatting, or a hazy feeling being transmitted to me, it\u2019s more like a feeling where we exchange messages and emoji? Do you dig?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine, not at all.\u201D</p><p>The master and servant relationship between Karin and Kouyou is a unique case, different from the traumas and phobias.</p><p>It seems that ever since she was born, she had heard a \u201Cvoice\u201D that spoke only to her. Kijyo Kouyou\u2026 was always at her side, watching over her.</p><p>\u201CUhh\u2026 Karen\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s Karin, not Karen. What\u2019s your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m\u2026 Erice, Utsumi Erice.\u201D</p><p>That was the encounter between me, Karin and Kijyo Kouyou.</p><p>After the incident, I was severely scolded by my teacher\u2026 Caren.</p><p>It was a reprimand that criticized my reckless moves.</p><p>However, the thing I was most afraid of\u2500\u2500\u2500was that I didn\u2019t care enough when it came to killing a citizen and having their Servant disappear.</p><p>She dealt with that indifferently by saying \u201CIt is legitimate self-defense. If it was something done by me as the City Management AI, it would be a huge legal and ethical problem, but Ms. Erice is a citizen who holds citizenship of Mosaic City.\u201D</p><p>I once again remembered that the AI is something like this, and that perhaps the person who was the model for Caren has a fairly lighthearted character at their foundation.</p><p>Chitose, my original guardian, was admonishing me at every opportunity about me living by myself up to the time of this incident, but it appears that the incident has made her refrain from interfering at every chance she got.</p><p>I was coldly informed by her, \u201CIf you can live your life, then you must be undoubtedly an adult by now, so congratulations.\u201D</p><p>It looked like she even felt proud that I was able to personally deal with the incident, although imperfect, as there was a victim in the form of the investigator and his tragic death. I remember the chills from Chitose\u2019s way of thinking, and I still strongly feel that it was correct to leave the Manazuru household.</p><p>She also said, \u201CIn the end, I have no choice but to confront the approaching danger by myself, as it was a situation that was eventually going to happen.\u201D The meaning of that\u2026 I don\u2019t understand it well even now.</p><p>\u2018For the sake of surviving, I\u2019ll kill any enemy that comes to me\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2019</p><p>Even if that karmic reply was normally used everyday in times of war, the heavy responsibility within me didn\u2019t disappear.</p><p>Really\u2026 I wonder if they were enemies, or if they were victims, and that kind of doubt stuck to my chest forever.</p><p>It was not <ruby>a human<rt>Chitose</rt></ruby>, nor <ruby>an AI<rt>Caren</rt></ruby>, but the Servant Lucius who got close to me as I was vexed about that matter.</p><p>At the time of my childhood, I was strictly trained in the art of self-defense and in violence-dealing skills by him, and I naturally understood that it was because of him that those became weapons that would save my own life and take away the lives of others.</p><p>That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t try to condemn me, nor try to comfort me with words.</p><p>He merely took his spear and once again gave me training, even during a time when there was a long silence between us for some time ever since I left my home.</p><p>In a spare time during training, he told me this sort of story that he was reminiscing about.</p><p>Around when he himself was still a boy, he was attacked by a robber in the suburbs of Rome. He bravely opposed the robber alone with a dagger in hand. Lucius narrowly repelled the robber, but due to an injury that he received from Lucius, the robber became unable to walk and turned to begging.</p><p>Every time he passed by the highway, Lucius was grieved at heart whenever he saw that beggar. It is said that before long, that beggar fell ill, threw away his faith in the Roman gods at the time when he was receiving care, and became a devout believer in monotheism while the amount of believers of that religion was increasing during those days. Unexpectedly, he became a believer before Lucius.</p><p>On the battlefield, Lucius killed enemies that numbered up to hundreds with his own hands as a soldier who held a single spear, further gave orders as a centurion who commanded a corps, and snatched away the lives of thousands of barbarians, but he\u2019ll never forget the fear that he felt when he was attacked by the robber and the sensation of stabbing a person for the first time\u2026 Such was the story he told me.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mdbuj9D.jpeg" alt=""></p><h2 id="chapter-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-10" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 10</h2><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And so, the Season of War came once more.</p><p>This truth is something the people do not accept. Exhausted and hurt, they refuse to even understand it.</p><p>Even so, I can feel it. Through my Servant.</p><p>The war for the Holy Grail that destroyed and rebuilt the world has not yet reached its end.</p><p>A few days had passed since the tragedy that struck at the Colosseum, and Mosaic City was trying to recover, little by little.</p><p>In Akihabara, the area which had suffered the greatest damages, the tranquil feeling of a resort-city that the district once possessed had yet to return. Even so, the city had calmed to a point where its citizens appeared to have returned to normalcy.</p><p>And I had a job to do.</p><p>In the midst of the massacre caused by the dreadful Servant Nzambi, when zombified people and manipulated servants ran amok, I was the one who had been responsible for handling the situation, and as such I was obligated to help with the cleanup after the fact.</p><p>Dealing with the post-processing with the authorities was a painful experience, one that served as a constant reminder of Caren Fujimura\u2019s absence. Though, looking at it another way, it was also time for me to calmly sort out what I was feeling in my heart, as well as an opportunity to restore my determination.</p><p>I knew what I had to do first\u2500 Request a meeting with a certain person.</p><p>The destination was the northernmost section of the Akihabara district, a place nicknamed \u201CYushima Tenjin\u201D. It\u2019s a shrine known for being the place to go to pray for success in one\u2019s studies, the official name of it being \u201CYushima Tenman-g\u016B\u201D.</p><p>Since the shrine is called \u201CTenjin\u201D after the Kami of Learning, the shrine must be dedicated to the God among scholars \u201CKankou\u201D Sugawara no Michizane, though that fact had little to do with my current visit.</p><p>I was advised to visit Yushima Tenjin by the City Management AI of Shinjuku, Caren Himuro\u2014 No, I\u2019ll just call her Himuro\u2013 after she heard out my aspirations.</p><p>The shrine I was heading towards was located in an area that used to be a part of a neighboring ward, one that was not considered a part of the Akihabara area prior to the war. After the reconstruction done by the Holy Grail it became an important location for the Spiritual Ley Lines, and was conveniently incorporated into Akihabara\u2019s northernmost area. This area was just one of the places I was forbidden from entering in the time right before the Holy Grail Tournament, along with the rest of the Spiritual Leyline Management Sites.</p><p>The area in front of the shrine\u2019s grounds are no longer Ueno Onshi K\u014Den\u2019s Shinobazu Pond, but instead a coastline where a swathe of willow leaves sway. I guess it wouldn\u2019t be wrong for you to say that the whole area in front of the shrine has been through a slip in time, returning to the scenery it originally had during the Edo Period\u2026 or that\u2019s what I would say if it weren\u2019t for the pure white sand and clear blue sea making it look like the beach at a tropical resort.</p><p>I walked along the twisted shrine road through Umebayashi Park by the sea side by side with Karin. The path we walked was crowded with beachgoers and visitors to the shrine at Yushima Tenjin, as usual.</p><p>\u201CHey, Eri-pie?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was just thinking, \u2018After that terrifying uproar, there\u2019s no way there\u2019d be a single person on the way to the shrine, right?\u2019 but\u2026 There are a lot of people, dontcha think? And doesn\u2019t it look like they\u2019re all going to the same shrine we are instead of heading to the beach?\u201D</p><p>I nodded in response to Karin\u2019s straightforward questions.</p><p>\u201C...Guess so. I wonder if they\u2019re religious people coming to pray for their families\u2019 safety or something.\u201D</p><p>Even though Servants have become an abundance in our everyday lives, the faith leftover from ancient times didn\u2019t just disappear from the citizens. Instead, in this chaotic world, that faith has become a stronghold and in this time it has once again become necessary for a God to take root in this land.</p><p>The sight of Master\u2019s accompanied by Heroic Spirits, spirits who have come from all across the world, times ancient and modern, going to worship at the shrine of the Japanese God of Learning\u2026 It was the kind of sight that was unique to the peaceful Mosaic City.</p><p>\u201CThis place is usually just full of tourists looking for a resort.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Have you been to this shrine before, Karin?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat strange? I guess I should say I didn\u2019t come here for myself, I\u2019ve been since Momi wanted to visit. Sometimes we drop by on the way to Akihabara, since the tempura manju is super delicious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm. For K\u014Dy\u014D you say\u2026? Tempura manju too\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, side note, is that alright Eri-pie? It looks like the kid is going to end up wandering off on his own.\u201D</p><p>Karin turned her head towards the boy in front of us.</p><p>\u2026Voyager.</p><p>My\u2026 He\u2019s my\u2026 he\u2019s a person like me\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s my very own\u2026 Servant.</p><p>His fluffy golden scarf fluttered in the sea breeze as he rapidly walked down a path I hadn\u2019t even told him about.</p><p>\u201CHmmm? Something about you and Pran seems\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CVoyager. His name isn\u2019t Pran, because you already know it\u2019s Voyager.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCrap, that\u2019s right.\u201D Realizing her mistake Karin quickly bowed her head down in apology. \u201CThat\u2019s my bad. You already identified his True Name, so Voyager should be called Voyager. In that case, Voyager and Eri-pie seem\u2026 like they\u2019re a bit awkward together?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...We\u2019re not awkward.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid you guys get into a fight?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2013? Absolutely wrong. Why would you think we fought?\u201D</p><p>That was a lie.</p><p>After all, it had been pretty awkward since this morning, and there was also a little bit of a fight between the two of us.</p><p>In the days since I discovered his True Name, Voyager\u2019s behavior had changed.</p><p>It was like his ego and his sense of purpose had risen to the surface in its own unique way, though that vague atmosphere around him was still the same in some respects.</p><p>He had always shown glimpses of stubbornness, but I get the feeling that something like a strong sense of fixation was born within him too.</p><p>He used to be brimming with curiosity when I would walk around the city with him, and he seemed to be interested in everything from the places I took him, to the things I showed him, to the foods he ate, like he wanted to absorb all of it. But not anymore.</p><p>This morning we had a dispute over breakfast. He seemed like he was unsatisfied with the cereal I got him, and said that \u201CIt would be nice if we had something different\u201D.</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re not happy with it then it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t have any, isn&#39;t it?\u201D When I said that and told him about the fact that meals are just a bit of stylistic beauty for Servants he just glared at me in response.</p><p>Seriously, what\u2019s the problem with having the same food every morning for a week or two?</p><p>And right after that, I guess so he could try to add some flavor to his cereal or something, he took some of my most treasured jam, without even asking for permission! Of course, I got angry about it and we got into a little bit of a scuffle and\u2026 well, you know what happens.</p><p>\u201CThat was totally a lie, right?\u201D Karin nodded her head in affirmation of her own assertion. I had no words with which to make a reply.</p><p>\u201C...........\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, I guess it\u2019s pretty understandable. Not only have you never had a partner to form a contract with before, but you\u2019ve also never had a real relationship with a Servant. The basis of all your interactions with them is basically banishing them or killing them, right? Like \u201CVANISH OR DIE!\u201D, ya know? Not really the right timing for an honest bit of communication.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh\u2026 It wasn\u2019t THAT extreme.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t even sweat it. You two can fight with each other as much as you want. Like Momi and I? We fight all the time!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh, that\u2019s\u2026 honestly pretty surprising.\u201D</p><p>I don\u2019t know of any other Masters and Servants with a relationship as good and well-coordinated as Karin and Kijyo K\u014Dy\u014D\u2019s. Then again, it did seem like Koharu and Galahad have a pretty volatile relationship on the surface.</p><p>\u201CHeroic Spirits are sorta like our senpai in life, so they don\u2019t really care about getting into fights.\u201D</p><p>Karin smiled and looked at the boy walking ahead of us.</p><p>\u201CI know I just said all that, but something about the kid does seem a little different\u2026\u201D</p><p>Different\u2026? What exactly is different?</p><p>As the Reaper I\u2019ve profiled Servants before. My studies of their exploits goes far in terms of both width and depth, but that experience has been totally useless to me in regards to the one Servant in existence who\u2019s ever become a familiar presence for me.</p><p>And although I\u2019m officially a Master myself, I still haven\u2019t been able to handle the information that has been directly imprinted upon me by the Holy Grail.</p><p>Voyager suddenly turned his head. Then he gazed toward the ocean on his right.</p><p>I followed his gaze and saw a houseboat that was operating as a water bus approaching a small dock on the beach.</p><p>This beach is supposed to be a point of transit for those boats, not a place for them to land to drop off passengers. One of the people onboard jumped off from the houseboat, and the ship immediately changed direction and returned to its original course.</p><p>The sole person to get off the boat was a female student carrying a large bag over her shoulder. Her pale skin and white blouse looked brilliant against the blue sea. Her light-colored hair fluttered in the wind, and I could tell she was a little bit taller than me. I felt like I recognized her face from somewhere.</p><p>\u201CHey, that\u2019s an Akijyo uniform!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, it is\u2026\u201D</p><p>Just as Karin said, the girl was wearing the summer uniform from the Akibagabara Jyogakukan High School, \u201CAkijyo\u201D for short. She waved goodbye to the people who stayed on the houseboat, all of whom were wearing the same uniform.</p><p>Naturally, she had to be older than Karin and I, who were still in Junior High School but\u2026</p><p>The girl quickly took off her shoes and socks, and instead of taking the long way around the wharf which would be an inconvenience for her, she chose to jump across the deck of a small boat that was moored at the dock.. With an agility filled leap, she easily jumped over several small boats as well, and quickly landed in the shallow water in front of us. She clearly didn\u2019t care if she got wet from the splash of her landing.</p><p>While we were watching such a situation unfold before us from land, she must have noticed us from the other side.</p><p>She blushed and blinked her eyes at us, and from her position on the beach pressed her lips together with her index finger as if to say \u201CShhh\u201D, telling us not to tell anyone. She was in the uniform of a prestigious young lady\u2019s school, and it appeared that she was aware of the fact that she was behaving mischievously while wearing it. And then\u2026</p><p>\u201CWELCOME HOME MY LORD!!!!!\u201D</p><p>From deep within the shrine grounds the sound of a voice filled with energetic cheer echoed out.</p><p>The owner of said voice came dashing towards the schoolgirl, and it was someone who I immediately recognized. A slender and tall female Servant, one with interesting features that you couldn\u2019t mistake:</p><p>Minamoto no Kurou Yoshitsune\u2014 Ushiwakamaru.</p><p>(Ushiwakamaru\u2026 I had a feeling about it but to think she really was a woman\u2026)</p><p>Today she looked like she was working a part-time job, the total opposite of the gallantly armored warrior she had appeared as in the Tournament.</p><p>She was wearing a bib apron and a triangular bandana in order to put aside her long black hair. Underneath the apron she was dressed in a light, swimsuit-esque outfit that, depending on the angle, made it appear as if she was wearing nothing but the apron itself. On her chest was a logo and illustration for \u201CYushima\u2019s Masterful Tempura Manju\u201D, the place that Karin mentioned earlier. She must have come straight from the kitchen of the tempura manju stall on the shrine\u2019s grounds.</p><p>The student girl was literally jumped at by Ushiwakamaru, and it was like she was being mobbed by a large dog who was overjoyed and over-excited by her return.</p><p>\u201CMy Lord! My Lord! My Lord!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep, yep, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s your lord.\u201D</p><p>The student girl acted as if she had gotten used to this. If that\u2019s the case then\u2026 I see, that girl must be Ushiwakamaru\u2019s Master.</p><p>During the Tournament she was wearing an elegant and traditional kimono, so the impression she gave here was quite different. Karin also seemed to have noticed, as we looked at one another and nodded.</p><p>\u201CAhhhhh~ It\u2019s not fair that you leave your Ushiwaka at home My Lord\u2026 My Loooord\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201COh c\u2019mooooon, cut it out already~! It\u2019s too hot~! And stop sniffing me!\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes opened wide as she yelled \u201CDossei!\u201D and executed a backwards pivot throw. Ushiwakamaru was thrown completely off, down onto the sand with a thump.</p><p>It was splendidly done.</p><p>The schoolgirl\u2019s movements were done in a manner that was casual and slight, but she performed an Aikido tenchi-nage.</p><p>Without a care in the world, Ushiwakamaru laughed gleefully as she rolled away on the ground, before noticing Voyager, who was crouched over the two companions in observation.</p><p>\u201COh? Aren\u2019t you the one from the other day\u2026?\u201D</p><p>From the position where she was lying on her back, Ushiwakamaru quickly reseated herself into a seiza position on the spot and politely bowed her head to Voyager.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m extremely grateful to you for your help that day. I didn\u2019t intend to leave you with the task of taking care of an opponent who was a bad match for me, so I\u2019m truly indebted to you. Were you injured?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201D</p><p>Voyager was likewise without any shyness, nodding his head to Ushiwakamaru. It appeared that the two remembered each one another from the arena.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s great to hear! Although, it seems that there\u2019s something different about you compared to our first meeting.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Do you think so? You\u2026 smell good\u2026 today. That\u2019s not\u2026 the smell of blood, this time?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe. This is the famed aroma of Tenman-g\u016B Shrine! The freshly fried food we provide is particularly exceptional! I\u2019d certainly be happy to treat you to some. Hey, My Lord? Rurihime-dono\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D</p><p>Ushiwakamaru called out a name as she looked back. The girl, called Rurihime, looked to Voyager.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Oh. Oooooh! You\u2019re the boy from the Colosseum! The kid who was able to defeat that atrocious Servant! The way you sparkled made you stand out, so I just couldn\u2019t forget about you. Thanks again! Seriously, thank you so much for the help. Gosh, I couldn\u2019t handle everything with just my dear Shana, so you know I was about to cry\u2013 just baaarely on the verge of tears.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was quite the predicament, but Rurihime-dono endured with such strength.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep, thanks for that.\u201D</p><p>She had a look about her that gave me the impression that she was so excited she was ready to go in for a hug on Voyager, knock him over as she grabbed him, and haul him away with her. She seemed like she was just barely resisting doing such a thing by putting both of her arms up in the air to stop herself.</p><p>The feeling she gave me screamed \u201Cstranger danger\u201D.</p><p>A second later, she turned towards me with an even brighter sparkle in her eyes.</p><p>\u201CSo, you must be that boy\u2019s Master? Or, is it you? You look so young! Oh wait, you two wouldn\u2019t happen to be middle school students by any chance would you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CC\u2019mon, it isn\u2019t me! Look over there, that one\u2019s who you want.\u201D Karin said as she pointed at me.</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah. I\u2019m Voyager\u2019s Master. Um\u2026 to be honest, I have a special favor to ask of you today, regarding the Tenman-g\u016B Shri\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D</p><p>\u201COho? A favor for me, you say? As long as it\u2019s not about studying, I can take care of you, got it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Shouldn\u2019t that be the other way around?\u201D Karin said with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>Right as it looked like Karin was about to unload a barrage of questions, Ushiwakamaru suddenly tugged on the other girl\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201C\u2500\u2500\u2500My Lord, your father is just over there.\u201D</p><p>When we looked back towards the shrine\u2019s grounds, there was a middle-aged man dressed in a Shinto priest\u2019s hakama standing underneath the great torii.</p><p>\u201CAh, father\u2026 I\u2019m home.\u201D The girl fixed the hem of skirt, which had been put into total disarray, and brushed the sand off of her.</p><p>As the man approached us, he recognized who I was and gave a slight bow with the proper posture.</p><p>Surprised, I corrected my own posture in response, bowing my head to return the courtesy.</p><p>Wearing a purple hakama with a white pattern, this man was the chief priest of Yushima Tenman-g\u016B Shrine, and the man whom I had been hoping to meet with, the one who I had been referred to by Himuro.</p><p>I had already met with him a few days before this at the Colosseum, at the time of a site inspection that was being conducted there. He already knew of me at that time, too.</p><p>Even so, I somehow never expected\u2026 I just didn\u2019t think that the Master of Minamoto no Kurou Yoshitsune, a very popular participant in the Holy Grail War Tournament, would turn out to be the daughter of this shrine\u2019s chief priest.</p><p>Karin and I were then given permission to meet with the chief priest of Yushima Tenman-g\u016B Shrine.</p><p>We were invited in, not to the shrine office, but to the inner sanctuary itself, which had been expressly cleared of people for our visit.</p><p>Due to the fact that the sanctum was a location with a powerful Bounded Field designed to keep out low-ranking familiars and other such magecraft, both Voyager and Kijyo K\u014Dy\u014D\u2019s presences were implicitly refused. As such, they were forced to remain outside.</p><p>The chief priest\u2019s only daughter, Rurihime, and Ushiwakamaru were also not allowed within.</p><p>I started with my request, which was in regards to handing over my role as Akihabara\u2019s Nightwatch to somebody else. I would give up the duty I had originally been entrusted with by Caren, since I would no longer be able to continue acting as one of the agents who &quot;deals with&#39;&#39;Servants for an unknown period of time\u2026. A plea I knew was self-centered.</p><p>I told the chief priest everything, without hiding any of the details.</p><p>From the existence of an enemy who had thrown Mosaic City into pandemonium, to the outbreak of a new Holy Grail War, which would bring about more harm to the public than the incident from a few days ago, rapidly approaching.</p><p>And of course, the fact that a Servant had manifested before me for the first time, someone who had not been able to form a contract with one before this point in their life.</p><p>Naturally, most of this information had likely already reached the chief priest\u2019s ears, but even so he listened to me in silence.</p><p>The chief priest of this shrine was assigned to an integral role and key location for the purpose of maintaining and preserving Akihabara\u2019s Spiritual Ley Lines. Alongside Kanda-my\u014Djin Shrine, which protects the city\u2019s weakest point, Yushima Tenman-g\u016B Shrine performs an essential duty within this city.</p><p>The divine majesty of Sugawara no Michizane, who possesses both the aspects of a God of Sincerity who prays for peace across the nation and that of a savage Thunder God, is only fully demonstrated here, at the Tenman-g\u016B Shrine.</p><p>Suppose that the attack the other day wasn\u2019t aimed at the Colosseum, but instead at destroying the Tenman-g\u016B Shrine. In such an event, not only would the Bounded Field surrounding Akihabara have collapsed, but a great many of the Servants in Akihabara who receive their Magical Energy from the Spiritual Ley Lines would have completely fallen into dysfunction.</p><p>Even if the scope of our roles was considerably different, both the integral role that the chief priest held and my own role consisted of protecting Akihabara. In a manner of speaking, our roles were two sides of the same coin.</p><p>The chief priest\u2019s reply was succinct\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u201CHave no worries. You can leave this to me.\u201D</p><p>With the threat from the outside made clear, the Shrine would lend its full support in dealing with any anti-Servant cases in order to prevent the spread of chaos in the city.</p><p>However, that role would not be left to the chief priest, as it would instead be entrusted to his daughter, Rurihime\u2014 Wait.</p><p>\u2014HUH?</p><p>This must have been Himuro\u2019s doing.</p><p>She must have been anticipating this development. She must have predicted my inner turmoil, must have been laughing to herself this entire time.</p><p>Damn it, the Caren Series really is filled with nothing but tricksters\u2026</p><p>I had expected that the chief priest himself would be unable to undertake the duty of handling the anti-Servant cases, considering how busy he already was, but even so I had been hoping he would be able to give me some kind of alternate plan or even give me advice on putting something else in place myself.</p><p>Not only was this outside of my expectations, but his response itself also managed to surprise me.</p><p>This was not a chief priest putting his faith in Rurihime\u2019s abilities, but instead a father who was forced into making a desperate, last-ditch effort for his daughter. Or at least that was the impression that I got from him.</p><p>(Ahh, could it be because of my\u2026)</p><p>When I came to that one objective fact, I felt just a little sorry for the man\u2026</p><p>Being forced to confront the sight of a kid, even younger than his high school-aged daughter Rurihime, already doing this kind of job most likely annoyed him\u2026 Or at least, I think that&#39;s probably what caused him to make the decision the way he did.</p><p>With some feelings of depression, I headed towards the area behind the inner sanctuary, where a small shrine stood. Conversing in front of that shrine was Rurihime, Voyager, and Kijyo K\u014Dy\u014D.</p><p>\u201COh, K\u014Dy\u014D\u2026\u201D</p><p>This was the first time today she had shown her face.</p><p>Rurihime, who looked as though she was more in her natural element in this form,, had changed out of her Akijyo uniform and into the red and white uniform of a miko. With the change, her elegant and graceful look from the Holy Grail Tournament had returned.</p><p>\u201CI see, so Akihabara\u2019s peace and future rests on my shoulders now, does it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, I\u2019m sorry for asking you so many times but\u2026 it really is a dangerous job\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh-huh, mhm.\u201D</p><p>When I went to tell her the details and discuss things with her, the girl gave me a pretty positive reaction to the whole situation, which left me bewildered.</p><p>\u201C\u2014Not to mention that it isn\u2019t uncommon for certain people to hold a grudge against you. Even when you\u2019re not actively doing your job, the dangers of it will always follow y\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep, yep. It must be a real pain to be an Ally of Justice.\u201D</p><p>\u201C....That\u2026 That\u2019s not what I was trying to say.\u201D</p><p>I understood that she was being earnest about things in her own way.</p><p>I understood that but, even so, I didn\u2019t feel like her seriousness about the matter was really coming through. I felt like I was finally able to infer the chief priest\u2019s true motivations.</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t think it was possible but\u2026 Rurihime, are you the type who feels the call to be an Ally of Justice?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNope, absolutely not. But I get the feeling the Holy Grail Tournament won\u2019t be starting back up anytime soon, right? I\u2019m going to end up being so bored without it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSigh\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 I guess that could make sense.\u201D</p><p>I noticed that Karin was glancing over at me, as if she wanted to jump in. Considering she was a girl who was never scared of talking back to her seniors, she seemed like she had been obediently following the conversation the entire time.</p><p>\u201CHey, Miss Rurihime? Hasn\u2019t Akijyo been on break from school this whole week? Didn\u2019t you go out of your way to go all the way to the school then?\u201D</p><p>Now that she mentions it, Karin\u2019s right. Since I was always in and out of classes I didn\u2019t even think about that at all.</p><p>\u201CYep, I did. I\u2019m acting as a class representative right now, so there\u2019s a lot of stuff for me to do, ya know? I also got called over by the student council asking for help, so I went over in the morning. We had to check on the safety of the students and stuff~, it was sooo hard to contact some of them through the Information Network~. Then, since the school had been turned into a temporary evacuation center, I had to lend a hand to clean things. So I asked my dear Shana\u2013 My dear Ushiwaka to do the house-sitting for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoooah, you had to do all that annoying crap? I guess that\u2019s what it means to be a High School Student.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh it wasn\u2019t like that! It made me so happy to see the faces of everyone from the school, it was the first time in a while.\u201D Rurihime turned to face me.</p><p>\u201CYour name\u2019s Erice, right? You wouldn\u2019t happen to have heard anything about Koharu, would you?\u201D</p><p>As a participant in the same tournament, she was worried about Koharu\u2019s safety.</p><p>\u201CLast I know she was going back to the Riedenflaus family to receive medical treatment for her injuries.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so\u2026\u201D</p><p>Karin furrowed her brow.</p><p>\u201CKoharu\u2019s arm was injured\u2026 right Erice? Was it really bad?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo idea. It wasn\u2019t life-threatening at least.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. In that case, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine!\u201D</p><p>Karin\u2019s reaction was typical for the next-generation, as modern medicine was capable of restoring the average injury back to its original state. However, Koharu was stabbed in her arm during a life or death battle with Nzambi. On her right arm, right above where her Command Seals were located.</p><p>\u201CAbout that I\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure\u2026\u201D After muttering that, Rurihime\u2019s expression darkened for a moment, before quickly turning back to a smile. \u201CErice, you probably have a better chance of running into Koharu than I do. If you do happen to see her again, can you please tell her I send my condolences? And also tell her that I want to fight her in the arena again.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. I won\u2019t forget to let her know.\u201D</p><p>I wanted to see Koharu again too. Right now, I was certain I needed her.</p><p>Rurihime flapped the sleeves of her miko outfit with excitement.</p><p>\u201CAlright, I\u2019m really motivated all of a sudden. Isn\u2019t this gonna be pretty neat? The Nightwatch! What do you think about it, Shana!?\u201D With a snap, the instant the girl raised her hand Ushiwakamaru came flying out from the manju stall, skidding sideways as she came.</p><p>\u201CI understand the situation! Everything, I get it all! Naturally, I already knew that My Lord would accept this undertaking!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know right~? Shana, your skills are probably getting dull too, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CActually, My Lord\u2026 While you may have some experience with martial arts, you do not possess any technical knowledge of Magecraft like Lady Erice, so you will need to start learning from the basics during your work. Do you not believe that starting out like that all of a sudden is rather reckless?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUrgh. I guess you\u2019re right about that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRegardless, this Ushiwaka will serve as My Lord\u2019s sword and shield in defense of her being, no matter the occasion!\u201D</p><p>\u201CO.K.! I\u2019ll make sure to be careful\u2026 What, is there something else?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. In addition to those concerns, I believe your Father has been pushing you exceptionally hard lately. You aren\u2019t trying to use this as an excuse to run away from your studies, are you\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoah, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t have to ya know! A-Anyway, I have high expectations for you Shana! Even more so than during the tournament!\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. I am the only one who is fit for this role. My Lord has had an exceptional instinct for fighting since she was young after all, more than most would know what to do with.\u201D</p><p>Rurihime blushed in response to the variety of things about her that were being spoken of so openly, while Ushiwakamaru held her chest out with pride. In spite of the carefree attitude she appeared to possess, it seemed as if she actually had quite a bit of courage and guts.</p><p>\u201CI think it\u2019s probably fine if you leave it at that.\u201D Karin muttered under her breath. She said it in a hushed tone, like she was trying to water her words down..</p><p>\u201CYou know something, It would be better if a job like this just didn\u2019t exist. I mean, what\u2019s the point of a job where the asshole who wants to do it the least is also the jerk who\u2019s best suited for the job?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Karin?\u201D</p><p>I thought I had gotten used to Karin\u2019s bad language, but I found myself getting a little antsy to try and gloss over the way she had spoken.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything like that, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to impose on Rurihime or anyth\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI already know that! I get that you don\u2019t really want to give it up to anyone else. You\u2019re not doing this stuff because you like it, and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want anyone else to take over, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Huh!? What are you trying to say?\u201D I suddenly lost my cool and started to talk back to Karin.</p><p>(Not wanting to give it up to anyone else? Me of all people?)</p><p>It was a painful decision for me to make, but I was just trying to fulfill my duties in my own way. I wanted to make sure Karin understood that, so I made sure to reach out to Karin today\u2014</p><p>\u201C.........\u201D</p><p>Before I knew it, a pair of pale blue eyes were staring straight at me. Voyager\u2019s serene gaze put me at a loss for words.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was worried about Karin and I arguing. I could feel that he had dangerous intentions, that he was trying to get me to make a more direct confession toward Karin. But what could I possibly say\u2026?</p><p>\u201C........ (mmrm mrmm mrm)\u201D</p><p>In his hand was a freshly fried tempura manju, given to him by Ushiwakamaru. His little cheeks were puffed up as he absentmindedly gobbled it down.</p><p>I felt my stomach muscles tighten up as I somehow managed to stifle any laughter as I asked:</p><p>\u201CV-Voyager\u2026? Did you remember to say thank you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C(Mrm)\u201D</p><p>Karin couldn&#39;t help but to break out in laughter. Rurihime on the other hand seemed impressed, arms folded and head nodding as she let out an approving \u201CUh-huh!\u201D.</p><p>\u201CYou guys are\u2026 pretty hard to deal with, huh? It\u2019s honestly overwhelming. It\u2019s like a whole different world from that of us carefree high school girls. And really, that\u2019s why taking this job sounds so interesting to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI think you\u2019re pretty hard to handle yourself Rurihime\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou think so? I feel like I\u2019m rather different from the next-generation children who were born into this world.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Now I get it. You\u2019re part of the Boundary Generation, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>As I was myself an exception without a Holy Grail, I knew that such a question was a complicated one to answer.</p><p>One way or another, we were able to secure a successful applicant to take over my Nightwatch duties.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even begin to properly convey how serious and demanding such a role was using words alone and, just as Karin once said, I still find it hard to approve of or understand the seriousness carried by the Holy Grail War Tournament participants.</p><p>I made a promise with Rurihime to call her at a later time, and our group made our exit from the shrine\u2019s grounds. All that remained from here was for Caren Himuro to get in contact with and assist her, and failing that find another unit in the Caren series to do it.</p><p>As I was considering all of this, Ushiwakamaru stealthily approached and stopped me before I could leave.</p><p>\u201CLady Erice, and Lady Karin as well. I must bow my head to your considerations. I must also express that your concern for My Lord is only natural.\u201D Leaving her master behind, Ushiwakamaru approached us by herself. &quot;Know that with my blade I shall sweep aside every spark that comes our way. But\u2026 As I avowed earlier, My Lord\u2019s vigorous and hotblooded nature in regards to battle has been with her ever since she was a child. She will not stop until she has taken the type of wound that slams into her with such force it makes her. That is why her father has been having such a hard time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, you mean Rurihime&#39;s father and why he looked so stern?&quot;</p><p>She certainly did seem like a disobedient girl who would cause worry for her family after all. Who do we know like that?</p><p>Ushiwakamaru smiled a bit, as if relieved.</p><p>\u201CBut it is exactly for those kinds of situations that I am here. It is my role as a military commander to weigh the skills of our enemies and ascertain when we need to retreat. If the situation goes beyond our control, it is my promise that I shall act as a shield that will block one thousand arrows to ensure My Lord escapes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you on about, Ushiwakamaru? Saying that kind of stuff is no good, ya hear!?\u201D</p><p>As Karin hounded her for it, Ushiwakamaru\u2019s eyes blinked incessantly in response.</p><p>\u201CMay I ask why it\u2019s no good\u2026 Such a disappointing reaction\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause it\u2019s no good, that\u2019s why! Seriously, you Heroic Spirits, why do you always\u2013 as if it were the natural thing to do\u2013 try to do the coolest things!? You\u2019re all so smart but so so stupid!\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Wait a second Karin! There\u2019s no need to be rude about it\u2013!\u201D</p><p>I consoled the newly dejected Ushiwakamaru and chided Karin before we said our goodbyes once more. As Ushiwakamaru swung her tongs in a wave, Voyager waved a small hand back in response.</p><p>\u201CYou know, it almost seemed like Rurihime knew you from somewhere K\u014Dy\u014D.\u201D</p><p>After I asked, Karin nodded in response.</p><p>\u201CHow do I put this, it\u2019s sort of like we knew each other before we actually got acquainted with one another? Since we\u2019ve come to pray at this shrine before she saw Momi and remembered who we were.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmmm. K\u014Dy\u014D, were you coming to offer worship to Sugawara no Michizane, perhaps?\u201D</p><p>Sugawara no Michizane was a person who lived during the early Heian Era. Meanwhile, Kijyo K\u014Dy\u014D lived during the middle-period of the Heian Era, which would have been around one hundred years after Michizane\u2019s death. That was around the time that his haunting storms would have been raging.</p><p>(Ah\u2026)</p><p>I had forgotten a much more important piece of the puzzle.</p><p>While I had my moment of clarity, Karin told me what K\u014Dy\u014D was saying back in her Spirit Form.</p><p>\u201CShe said \u2018No, that\u2019s incorrect. I was visiting the shrine to worship more ancient Gods\u2019.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 Now I understand. It\u2019s Togakushi Shrine. That small shrine was Togakushi Shrine, wasn\u2019t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTogakushi, as in the place from around Momi\u2019s hometown? I think it was near\u2026 Nagano Prefecture, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMhm. That\u2019s it. Mount Togakushi, Oninasato Village, the place where Mount Izuna used to be\u2013 Wait, Karin, shouldn\u2019t you know all of this as K\u014Dy\u014D\u2019s Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhaha, sorry, my bad.\u201D</p><p>Originally Yushima Tenjin was a shrine dedicated to the Gods of Togakushi, prior to the enshrinement of Michizane\u2026 In other words, it was dedicated to the Kami associated with the Legend of Ama-no-Iwato in Japanese mythology.</p><p>Since she can no longer hope to visit the Togakushi Shrine in the Shinsh\u016B Province, that shrine at Yushima Tenjin must have become a very important place for her.</p><p>To think that the shrine associated with Togakushi is protecting the Spiritual Ley Lines of Akihabara. It would make me incredibly happy if K\u014Dy\u014D were to pray for the peace of this city while keeping such thoughts within her heart.</p><p>Yet, in spite of that, I\u2019m currently denying such favor as I abandon my own responsibilities toward the same thing.</p><p>(Speaking of the Gods\u2026 There are Divine Servants too. Those bastards who attacked the city were Divine Spirits, no mistaking it\u2026)</p><p>Servants from the mythical era when the greater Gods roamed, Divine Spirits are those who have surrendered a part of their soul in order to become a Servant. They are particularly rare in Mosaic City, despite the fact that it\u2019s home to countless Servants. It\u2019s likely that there\u2019s only one per city, and among them, I still don\u2019t know of any related to Gods from Japanese mythology.</p><p>(There are some minor deities from a folk lore level registered here and there, but\u2026)</p><p>If such a being were to manifest, it would be a very powerful entity, one who would have an advantage from the land. But the fact of the matter is that this is not the case, and as such that is why I believe the citizens still maintain true faith.</p><p>\u201CK\u014Dy\u014D, thank you for this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Oh, you mean like for the prayers? If that\u2019s the case, you should know that Voyager prayed with us too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s just because he\u2019ll imitate anything he sees.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe\u2019s so innocent and fresh, right? It\u2019s like he\u2019s just been born!\u201D</p><p>We stared at Voyager\u2019s back a few steps ahead of us for a while as we walked through the park.</p><p>\u201C\u2014So then, what the heck is your plan here? What do you think you\u2019re doing, asking someone else to handle your work for you?\u201C Karin asked me in the serious tone from before.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not like I quit my job as a Nightwatch I\u2026 I\u2019d like to return to it if I can, if possible. Actually, I think I have to. Whether or not Rurihime will keep doing it when that time comes will depend on how she feels about it.\u201D</p><p>Karin stopped in her tracks and grabbed onto my hand tightly.</p><p>My left hand, which still felt uncomfortable from the Command Seals being engraved into it\u2014</p><p>\u201CEri-pie, answer this question honestly. This isn\u2019t about what anyone else wants. I\u2019m asking you. What do you want to do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CErice wants to go.\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s words swallowed us whole.</p><p>Voyager answered the question. Clearly, like the sharp ring of a ship\u2019s bell declaring that the time to put out to sea had finally come.</p><p>And the deflated sails of my heart swelled with a heavy sense of unease as the tailwinds of defiance blew through them.</p><p>I felt as though I had read this exact scene in a book somewhere before.</p><p>Even still, Karin continued to ask us questions.</p><p>\u201C...Where? Where do you want to go?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uapN5lO.jpeg" alt=""></p><h2 id="chapter-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-11" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 11</h2><p>Early in the morning, on the day I was to leave Akihabara\u2014-</p><p>In the midst of the cool haze that covered Station Square stood Karin, alone, at the spot where her voice had echoed along with the performance of a lone street musician.</p><p>I had sent her a message about my departure from the city last night, despite knowing that if I told her she would try to come with me.</p><p>Because that\u2019s the type of person she is. I knew that.</p><p>It troubled me greatly but\u2026 I knew that telling her was the only way.</p><p>If I went through with deceiving her about my exit and leaving without telling her, I would regret it for my entire life.</p><p>\u201CYo Eri-pie!\u201D She said with a smile that had a hint of bashfulness to it. \u201CAnd a \u2018yo\u2019 to you as well, Voyager.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMorning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood morning\u2026 Karin.\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s scarf swayed in the morning sun, and at its touch fluttered as if it were a golden torch. I still wasn\u2019t used to the sound of his voice, spoken with childishly broken language, coming from my side.</p><p>My feelings of wanting Karin to come with us and my feelings of not wanting her to follow continued to entangle themselves within my heart, turning into a massive lump of emotion that I could not untie.</p><p>The fact that she was able to come out of the recent storm of slaughter unharmed was something that I thought could only have been a result of all of her stockpiled good fortunes surfacing one after another.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that this was definitely different from any of the previous unpredictable Servant-related incidents. The enemy this time would be an organized opponent, and as a result merely traveling with me would put her in danger.</p><p>(Or maybe it\u2019s possible\u2026 Could it be that I\u2019m underestimating Karin and K\u014Dy\u014D\u2026? No, I\u2019m positive that couldn\u2019t be the case. I know for sure that K\u014Dy\u014D is a wise and sensible person. But, even knowing that\u2026)</p><p>There was one other reason to avoid traveling with them. A complicated question, one to which I had yet to find a way to give a definite answer.</p><p>(The \u201CHoly Grail\u201D with which I made my contract and the Holy Grail the citizens of Mosaic City are connected to\u2026 are they both truly an existence that stem from the same root?)</p><p>TL Note: \uFF08\u79C1\u306E\u5951\u7D04\u3057\u305F\u301D \u8056\u676F&quot;\u3068\u2026\u2026 \u30E2\u30B6\u30A4\u30AF\u5E02\u306E\u5E02\u6C11\u305F\u3061\u3068\u7D50\u3073\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308B\u300A \u8056\u676F\u300B\u306F\u3001\u679C\u305F\u3057\u3066\u540C\u3058\u6839\u6E90\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5B58\u5728\u306A\u306E\u3060\u308D\u3046\u304B\u2026\u2026\uFF1F\uFF09&quot;. This one was rather difficult for me to TL, due to the wording on the final part of the sentence: \u679C\u305F\u3057\u3066\u540C\u3058\u6839\u6E90\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5B58\u5728\u306A\u306E\u3060\u308D\u3046\u304B\u2026\u2026\uFF1F</p><p>Considering the Grail is a way to REACH the Root, the usage of the exact Kanji &quot;\u6839\u6E90&quot; stumped me somewhat. She could be asking &quot;Are they both an existence that stems from the root&quot; or &quot;Are they both an existences that contain the root&quot; with \u6839\u6E90\u3092\u6301\u3064, though that specific wording is more likely to be &quot;stem from&quot; as it&#39;s similar to &quot;\u539F\u56E0\u3092\u6301\u3064&quot; as in &quot;having the same origin&quot;. And yet, even with this, it was somewhat unclear due to the usage of \u6839\u6E90 which could just be another word for &quot;origin&quot;, yet it feels like a very specific kanji to use given the context of it in Type Moon works. I ended up putting Root, with a belief that Erice is referring to the Grail that acts as &quot;Administrator&quot; of the city as the &quot;Root&quot; in this instance and the thing with the citizens is referring to the fact they each posses one that connects them to it as the &quot;Root&quot; of their power, but... admittedly, I&#39;m still unsure about that specific sentence.</p><p>I just could not find a way to believe that the Holy Grail, which bestowed Command Seals and Servants unto all of the citizens, including Karin, would grant its blessings to me now, after I had already lived 14 years of my life. I did not WANT to believe it.</p><p>I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask the person most connected to the matter, Voyager, but when I had tried he just gave me a puzzled look, as if he was unable to determine what the answer was himself.</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t even really understand what a Servant was, so it wasn\u2019t really a surprise. After all, the Holy Grail was supposed to bestow knowledge of both the Holy Grail War and of universal information about things common to the modern world upon Servants.</p><p>Voyager was lacking in both.</p><p>(It\u2019s not like I\u2019m entirely without a means of confirming whether or not they\u2019re the same but\u2026 that method is\u2026)</p><p>Let\u2019s imagine what would happen if I were to use a single \u201Cstroke\u201D of the Command Seals engraved upon my left hand.</p><p>The result of such a thing should be obvious:</p><p>If my Seals were bestowed upon me by a Holy Grail that stems from the same root as the one that gives power to the citizens of Mosaic City, the Seal would be restored.</p><p>But even knowing that, at this point in time I absolutely could not afford to take such a risk. If the possibility that they were different came to be true the results of my test would be irreversible.</p><p>(And if they really were different then\u2026. That would mean that another \u201CHoly Grail\u201D has come into existence\u2026)</p><p>Until the answer to that question is known to me, it is too early to make a decision.</p><p>What Caren had said\u2013 \u201CThe Holy Grail War\u2026 is not yet over.\u201D</p><p>If there was anyone who had the answers I wanted, it would be Chitose or Lucius, but asking them about things relating to their Command Spells was not an easy thing to do.</p><p>Such a thing was considered strategic information, the secrets of a Magus. That information concerned their very existence, having won the Holy Grail War through great sacrifice.</p><p>There wouldn\u2019t be any family sentiment to help me there.</p><p>(Lucius had pointed his spear towards Voyager\u2026 he tried to destroy my Servant. Chitose must have decided that Voyager was dangerous\u2026 She had determined that he was an enemy to her!)</p><p>The morning train, still only sparsely populated by passengers, moved as if it were gliding as it crossed the railway bridge over the sea.</p><p>I sat in a cramped four-person booth facing toward Karin, with Voyager in the seat next to mine, face firmly pressed against the window. Today he had been extremely restless and excited since the morning, hurriedly pushing me to rush about. It was a bit like how a dog might act when taking it out for a walk around the neighborhood.</p><p>In the short time since the train had left the skyscrapers of Akihabara, the scenery outside the window had changed dramatically. The tips of ruined skyscrapers, which had been abandoned fourteen years ago and left uninhabited since, dotted the ashen horizon.</p><p>Karin and I had already become familiar with the landscape, a sight that had not changed for the better.</p><p>As he stared out the window with a devouring gaze, Karin called out to him.</p><p>\u201CThis your first time seeing the sea, Voyager? The beach we saw yesterday at Tenman-g\u016B Shrine was man-made ya know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHouse.\u201D Voyager said with a sigh, his forehead still glued to the glass of the train car&#39;s window.</p><p>\u201CHmm, a house? Where\u2019s it at? Oooh, under the sea, right?\u201D Karin and I peeked out the window together. We could make out the faint outlines of buildings below the surface of the ocean.</p><p>The apartment buildings and shopping districts in which people lived before the War were now drifting away at the bottom of the sea, where marine life had been drastically reduced and the past laid undisturbed like a sleeping beauty.</p><p>\u201CThe sea\u2026. I saw it. From the sky. The sea I knew was\u2026 much\u2026 more blue\u2026 more blue\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CA dark blue sea, you say? You must\u2019ve seen a tropical sea!\u201D</p><p>Voyager nodded in response to Karin\u2019s words.</p><p>I mumbled the name of a tropical sea that came to mind.</p><p>\u201CCape Canaveral\u2026. I think. It\u2019s the sea in Florida where some rocket launch pads were located.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. That\u2019s correct. Flo ri da.\u201D</p><p>The space probe Voyager was launched in the Summer of 1977, from a base facing the Atlantic Ocean. As of now, that would have been about half a century ago.</p><p>\u201CThen, I guess that is my house. Flo ri da. It must be. Florida.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour house is Florida? Hmm\u2026 I find it hard to understand when you put it like that.\u201D</p><p>The Voyager Program was supposedly spearheaded by a NASA-supervised research institute in Pasadena within the state of California, though the probe may have been assembled at the Space Center in Florida.</p><p>Where is the boundary line at which he would find his sense of self as a Heroic Spirit? Or does that sense trace all the way back to the initial inception of the Program, the point in time at which the concept of exploration was established?</p><p>\u201CHehehe.\u201D</p><p>I shrug my shoulders in response, and he simply smiles at me without worry before turning to the window again, narrowing his eyes with a look of longing.</p><p>\u201CI could really feel it. I was listening to it. The sounds of the winds from the ocean\u2026 and the sound of the waves.\u201D He quietly closed his eyes and pricked up his ears to listen.</p><p>\u201CThunder. Rain. Bubbling. Lava\u2014 The sounds of this star. I have to remember\u2026 all of it\u2026 But\u2026 It has changed. Entirely.\u201D As he leaned against the glass, Voyager followed the path to his memories. It was as if he were listening directly to Earth. \u201CI cannot hear\u2026 the song of the whales anymore\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201C....Do whales sing? How do they do that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey sing. It was a good thing.\u201D</p><p>He tilted his head as if to say \u201CDidn\u2019t you know that already?\u201D.</p><p>\u201CKyuuu.\u201D</p><p>\u201C....Kyuuu?\u201D</p><p>He performed his special mimicry once again.</p><p>Kyuuuu\u2026 Kyuuuuuuu\u2026. Kyuuuun\u2026. Kokokoko Korokorokoro\u2026.</p><p>The boy suddenly stepped down into the aisle as he began to sing and slowly swayed his body in a dance. He was clearly trying to imitate the form of a whale swimming in the ocean.</p><p>\u201C...Ahahaha! I\u2019m a whale too!\u201D Karin joined in without a moment of hesitation.</p><p>They sang a curious song together as Karin moved in and out of Voyager\u2019s reach, twisting and turning her body through the surrounding area with gentle steps. There was even a little bit of spicy belly dancing thrown in.</p><p>\u201CHey, cut it out Karin\u2026\u201D I was embarrassed, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say anything since we were in a car that was virtually empty.</p><p>As the boy\u2019s body swayed, his flowing golden scarf made it look as if they were really under the sea, and it made me think that I wanted to see more of their dance.</p><p>I had never seen a real whale, after all.</p><p>It was the same for every single one of us young people, but he and the whales lived in the same time period.</p><p>Though, it does feel ridiculous to say that a space probe \u201Clived\u201D.</p><p>(Voyager\u2026 A Servant. He\u2019s a genuine Servant.)</p><p>In the middle of an occurrence entirely lacking in altruism, it hit me once again.</p><p>Whales, fish, and all other types of marine life had seen their populations plummet. The birds of the ocean as well.</p><p>All of it is the fault of the Holy Grail War.</p><p>Before our train arrived at its destination I asked Voyager some questions, the purpose of which was to determine if the level of common information from modern times that the Holy Grail would introduce a normal Servant to had been given to him.</p><p>It would be an inconvenience if things that were normal pieces of knowledge had not been conveyed to him, especially in the case of an emergency\u2026 But in the end I was given almost none of the answers I had desired, and instead ended up giving a lecture.</p><p>On today\u2019s lesson plan we had \u201CThe Holy Grail War\u201D.</p><p>TL Note: the Japanese text is actually &quot;\u672C\u65E5 \u306E \u8B1B\u7FA9 \u5185\u5BB9 \u306F\u300A \u8056\u676F \u6226\u4E89\u300B \u306B\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002&quot; with a furigana &quot;\u30B7\u30E9\u30D0\u30B9&quot; over &quot;\u8B1B\u7FA9 \u5185\u5BB9&quot;. I found that to be a good use of the furi for a fun little joke and figured I&#39;d try to convey it here, since I am not using &quot;small text&quot; in English and am instead combining the words or fitting both into the sentence somehow. I hope the comedic effect still came across!</p><p>Ever since the days leading up to the forming of our contract, I had repeated the same lecture countless times. As expected for someone who said they knew nothing of war.</p><p>\u201C---We are taught about the war that transpired 14 years ago\u2026 \u2018The Holy Grail War\u2019, during the schooling that takes place over our compulsory education. It\u2019s our obligation to do so, even though not everybody wishes to speak about this event. Some families even aspire to make sure their children do not know anything of it, if at all possible for them.\u201D</p><p>Inferring what I meant through the expression on my face as I spoke, Voyager glanced over at Karin. She pretended not to notice, leaning on her elbow and looking out the window of the train instead.</p><p>\u201CA great war\u2026 happened, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C....Yeah. It happened. There was a great war. One that every living thing on this planet was dragged into, the biggest war ever in history. No nation, no person, not even any Heroic Spirit who had been summoned was safe\u2026 It was that terrifying kind of war. And as a result of it, our planet ended up in such an awful state. Voyager, the beautiful Earth that you knew is already gone\u2026 All that it left behind was a mockery, this imitation of its form.\u201D</p><p>This was the reality that every Junior High Student in Mosaic City knew.</p><p>He was dumbfounded.</p><p>His eyes were shaking as he stared at me in response. This was the first time I had ever seen such sorrow expressed upon his face.</p><p>\u201C......\u201D</p><p>In a change from her earlier festive look, the corners of the now listless Karin\u2019s mouth raised into a suggestive smirk. She put her hand onto Voyager\u2019s head and began to lazily ruffle his hair, like a big sister would do to her baby brother on a whim.</p><p>Voyager seemed discontent with this.</p><p>Naturally, considering I\u2019ve never done anything like that to him before.</p><p>\u201C....And the whales?\u201D</p><p>His naive question had to be responded to with a cruel answer.</p><p>\u201CI believe most of the whales became victims of the war. They were caught up in the large-scale drone operations.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDrone?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, drones. A drone is a weapon that flies in the sky, unmanned. A machine that makes offensive strikes against its enemies by using its own judgment regarding the progression of a battle. The war was a war of drones\u2013 It\u2019s estimated that at the height of the conflict there were over ten-thousand drones for every one soldier. From small drones the size of a miniscule insect to large drones that were the size of a passenger plane, they flew throughout the battlefield under semi-autonomous control. But there weren\u2019t just drones that flew through the sky. There were also drones that could dig beneath the earth\u2019s surface in order to infiltrate underground facilities, drones that could swim underwater, as well as various other abnormal types that were developed. There were even drones that were disguised to look like dolphins or whales in order to launch suicide-bomber style attacks on enemy submarines. During the war anything shaped like a fish that approached would be met with a thorough offensive, no matter what the creature truly was, in the name of self-defense\u2026\u201D</p><p>If any large marine mammals were still alive in the ocean today, it would have to be the result of a miracle.</p><p>The United States of America\u2019s space center at Cape Canaveral had become a battleground at the very beginning of things. Right now, it was a wasteland covered by craters who served to collect the filthy water there. Florida\u2019s beautiful waters would never return again.</p><p>\u201C....The drones are\u2026 machines\u2026 aren\u2019t they? Then that means they\u2026 are just like me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey are NOT like you!\u201D</p><p>The words came out with more intensity than I thought they would, causing Voyager\u2019s eyes to widen. Even Karin looked to be taken aback.</p><p>But I did not stop.</p><p>\u201CThey could not be the same as you. You\u2026 may not be unconnected to war and weaponry, but you and the drones are different.\u201D</p><p>Karin took over my words from there.</p><p>\u201C...Well, you\u2019ve got that right. Voyager, you\u2019re different from a drone, arentcha? &#39;Cause drones are sorta like evil spirits. For our parents\u2019 generation at least, they\u2019re a symbol of horror that you shouldn\u2019t even want to talk about. In our Mosaic City we somehow managed to eliminate them, but for a little while after the war there were tons of people who ended up becoming victims at the hands of some of the more stubborn drones while trying to deal with them.\u201D</p><p>\u201C....Eeeehhhh\u2026?\u201D He furrowed his brow and looked restlessly around the moving train car, surveying it.</p><p>Karin laughed at him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it was an unreasonable response. On a first look, the train would appear to be running through an awfully undefended area.</p><p>\u201CThese tracks are just fine, Voyager. The railways that connect the Mosaic Cities to one another are still inside of the Bounded Field of Mosaic City, so they\u2019re well protected\u2026 Though, outside of Mosaic City is Hell.\u201D</p><p>There were still a few cases in which single-function drones were permitted for the purpose of maintaining minimal urban functions and maintenance. They could be used to measure contamination in areas that humans were unable to trespass, as well as operate as surveillance cameras with strictly limited operation space.</p><p>Most of them were Old World wirelessly-controlled machines that required an operator to function, not unlike radio-controlled devices. If it is possible to substitute something with Magecraft, we do so to the best of our abilities.</p><p>In consideration of the public sentiment towards them, any airframe registered with the authorities was cleverly camouflaged in order to avoid contact with the public eye.</p><p>\u201CHell, huh\u2026 Ugh\u2013 the old me would\u2019ve never believed in something like that! But now I\u2019ve been hanging out with Erice for such a long time. I\u2019ve learned about those trespassers coming in from the outside, those unauthorized foreign Servants, and now I\u2019ve stopped doubting these kinda things.\u201D</p><p>Right, in our generation of youths there was no one who had personally experienced the terrible devastation of the outside. It was not something one would be aware of in their daily life.</p><p>That much was Mosaic City\u2019s peace\u2026 was\u2026</p><p>\u201CEven now, an unknowable number of drones are hidden away in the wasteland, waiting in hibernation. Because their life span is semi-permanent. If an airplane were to fly through the sky, any drone that sensed it would awaken and shoot it down in an instant.\u201D</p><p>The ocean was the same. If any ship tried to conquer the sea, it would be unforgivably unsafe.</p><p>Captain Hendrick and his Master, Ahasuerus, had set sail upon the wandering Dutch ship known as \u201CThe Flying Dutchman\u201D. They set off on their voyage together despite knowing full well that they would be in mortal danger.</p><p>Truly, God and the Devil of the Sea had cursed those two.</p><p>And the location I had my eyes on was Fuyuki, a place which I could only reach by traveling on foot through that Hell.</p><p>Therefore, I needed to be prepared. I needed a powerful weapon.</p><p>I needed something that Caren Fujimura had left behind.</p><p>Shinjuku.</p><p>The city where I was born. The city where I was raised.</p><p>The city where I had lived together with my mother and father.</p><p>Our train arrived at my old hometown without incident.</p><p>Ever since I had begun to live on my own in Akihabara I had only returned to this city a few times, but now, because it was necessary for me to come here for my \u201Dwork\u201D, returning couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><p>Naturally, I avoided visiting my parents\u2019 home, where Chitose dwelled.</p><p>Shinjuku was the core of Mosaic City and, as of now, had effectively become its capital. The city had grown so much that it had fully regained the prosperity it had in the Pre-War days, and the population count of its inhabitants was so much larger than the other cities that you couldn\u2019t even compare them.</p><p>While Akihabara was a place where coasts and resorts were the main selling points of the city, Shinjuku had a certain character to its liveliness, a certain passion, that was as different as could be.</p><p>If you compared it to the other Mosaic Cities, the most distinctive characteristic you would find was undeniably the way the city had been consumed by a large-scale revival of customs and public morals from both the early years of the Showa Era and the age of the Taish\u014D era.</p><p>I don\u2019t know just who among the people had their wishes reflected by the Holy Grail during the Post-War reconstruction of this damaged city but\u2026</p><p>Seriously, it was a totally drastic measure to take. The nostalgia and fondly-remembered days experienced in the minds of the citizens here was nothing more than a fabricated taste for the past, a manufactured nostalgia.</p><p>It had been one century since that time.</p><p>Who had personally experienced, or could even remember, the way of life that existed one hundred years ago?</p><p>That was the city where I was raised, Shinjuku.</p><p>I had felt utterly humiliated when I learned the reality of things, and then I became totally apathetic.</p><p>It was like the oceans from which the birds and whales had disappeared\u2013 Because this planet had forfeit its nature, the abnormalities of Mosaic City had become normality, had become the everyday life that needed to be safeguarded.</p><p>My very foundation, my beloved hometown, had become nothing more than a theme park.</p><p>As things were, it was a parody of infantile regression. It was impossible to love such a thing.</p><p>Even so, the people had chosen\u2026. Shinjuku had chosen that fabricated nostalgia.</p><p>\u2014Shinjuku Station overflowed with people in the morning.</p><p>Many of them were businessmen who were employed in Shinjuku, accompanied by their Servants, and in the wait for the train to depart some of them unfurled their newspapers while others hurried over to the station\u2019s shops in a rush to get their breakfast.</p><p>Less than a week had passed since the tragedy that had left countless deceased in its wake, and yet they worked through their daily routines quietly and with a lack of concern, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>A slight sigh of amazement came from my side, as next to me Voyager\u2019s eyes sparkled and brimmed with curiosity at the scenery spread out before us. Seeing the scene of a morning that was so different from the usual calm of morning in Akihabara excited him.</p><p>If I took my eyes off of him for even a moment, who knows where he\u2019d saunter off to.</p><p>\u201CYou know, we didn\u2019t come here today to stroll around\u201D</p><p>\u201C....Is that so?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that\u2019s so.\u201D</p><p>On the other hand, Karin stood pressed close to my chest, with an understandable look of dissatisfaction on her face.</p><p>The JP for this is \u79C1 \u306E \u80F8\u5148 \u306B \u8FEB\u3063\u3066\u304D\u305F which does literally mean &quot;against my chest&quot; or something like it, but can be tl&#39;d as something like &quot;close to my side&quot; or &quot;by my side&quot;, but with the later line about her feeling embarrassed from passersby looking at them, I thought the more literal version made more sense here. Especially since Karin DOES feel like the type to cling to Erice&#39;s chest and complain.</p><p>\u201CHey, Eri-pie? I thought we were headin\u2019 to Fuyuki today? Just how far away do we have to walk to get to our connecting train?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t just go there so abruptly. To begin with, the train to Fuyuki doesn\u2019t even exist anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoah, what\u2019s this? Oooh~ I get it! You\u2019re still looking for a good reason to back out this late in the game~? Must feel nice to know getting there is actually impossible, right? So, why\u2019d you go through the trouble of asking Rurihime to take over your Nightwatch duties then?\u201D I noticed passersby glancing at us a few times, and found myself feeling embarrassed.</p><p>\u201CYou listen here\u2026 Going off on \u2018adventures\u2019 without planning things out is one of my least favorite occurrences, got it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSeriously? I guess you\u2019ve got the thinking of a gamer who goes \u2018Now I\u2019m fully prepared! I\u2019ve grinded exp til I hit the level cap, I\u2019m finally ready to get started!\u2019, huh? Is that really any fun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t have to be fun. This is not some kind of game.\u201D Deciding to leave Karin to continue her angry complaints by herself, I turned over to Voyager. \u201CListen to me, Voyager. Shinjuku is a pretty big place, so I\u2019m going to give you a quick overview of the city.\u201D</p><p>He nodded in agreement, giving me the O.K.</p><p>While I gave my explanation to him, we left the first platform. The station was shaped into a half-circle, which we moved along as we headed for the passageway that led to the pedestrian deck on the upper level.</p><p>The view to the outside was poor from the underground area, and after leaving it the sky became barely visible through the windows.</p><p>\u201CTo begin, the large building where we are now is called \u2018Shinjuku Central Station\u2019. This is a hub station where trains to and from Akihabara, Shibuya, Tama, and the other cities arrive and depart. From here, you can also take a tram that wraps all around Shinjuku itself like the meshwork of a net.\u201D</p><p>Gathered in front of the transit map posted on the wall was a group of citizens, most likely those who came from other cities. Voyager floated over and took a glance at it.</p><p>After he was done we had to calm down a still-complaining Karin, and then we were able to walk our way out of the station. I had not seen K\u014Dy\u014D since this morning, though I knew she was probably still nearby in her Spirit Form.</p><p>\u201CThe whole of Shinjuku is a three-dimensional structure that looks sort of like the leaves on a tree as they overlap with one another. Generally it\u2019s one town per leaf, each divided into different blocks. Here, look, you can already see it just ahead of us, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoaaaaah\u2026\u201D</p><p>He had the look of someone who was absolutely inspired from seeing the Shinjuku skyline in person for the first time. He rushed out from the station building and ran forward as he leapt up to the railing at the handrail on the edge of the deck adjacent to it.</p><p>\u201CWah! Watch it, Voyager! Ahaha!\u201D The pigeons in the station&#39;s square were all startled by him and flew away in unison, the tips of their feathers tickling Karin as they went by.</p><p>The scenery of this cityscape had already become familiar to me, but for the Servant from the Old World who had just been summoned here, just about everything was brand new. I stood next to him as he motionlessly gazed at it with pure concentration.</p><p>\u201CIn a large city, a single block can be several hundred meters to a kilometer squared, though some are as small as a few dozen meters squared. For address notation and for the convenience of city administration, they\u2019re roughly divided into three layers: Upper, Middle, and Lower.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBuil\u2026dings\u2026 bill\u2026boards\u2026 neon\u2026 This is a big, big city, isn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s also\u2026 terribly tall. There are parts of it for the day and parts of it for the night, and all of it is overlapping\u2026 It\u2019s so pretty. It looks like corral.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike a corral? Oh, you mean it looks like coral, as in the sea creature? So that\u2019s how you see it\u2026 I guess it could look like that.\u201D</p><p>The only coral I knew was the fake coral from the artificial beaches. There was no way for me to know if the rough and bumpy texture or the brilliant hues of that coral were like the real thing or not.</p><p>Even so, that\u2019s how the city looked to him.</p><p>From the deck of the city\u2019s mid-level his blue pupils slowly scanned the scenery of the cityscape, before they swept back around to the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201CThis is\u2026 Tsunobazu, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah, that\u2019s right. The zone around Central Station is a block known as \u201CTsunohazu\u201D. It\u2019s the widest block here.\u201D I stuck my index finger out in front of me and spun around on my heel like the turning of a weather vane. \u201COn the west side you can find Kashiwagi and Yodobashi. On the south side is Junisou. To the east are Okubo and Bansh\u016B. On top of all those, you can find several other blocks snugly between, like Aizumi and Wakaba, but this should give you a rough feel for things\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CErice!\u201D</p><p>\u201C....?\u201D</p><p>As soon as I finished speaking, he called out to me.</p><p>The boy grasped onto the railing and pushed onto his tip toes with all his might, pointing to a section of the city that commanded a view from an upper level.</p><p>\u201CW-What is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat place over there is \u201CHanazono\u201D, right? The place where\u2026 Erice was born?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTch\u2026\u201D</p><p>The name of the block that I had purposefully left unnamed came spilling forth from his lips with a smile.</p><p>He had probably noticed that I was fully aware of that place.</p><p>Then he managed to guess what it was by comparing that awareness with the transit map of the Shinjuku area, which he must have put to memory in the brief moment he had looked at it.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s so pretty, this place. The people, the greenery, it\u2019s full of it\u2026 They\u2019re full of life.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yep.\u201D</p><p>As I nodded back at him begrudgingly, he gave me a smile and a giggle as if he had just found some kind of treasure.</p><p>\u2013That\u2019s right.</p><p>Hanazono, the \u201CFlower Garden\u201D, was the neighborhood where I lived with Chitose. For a brief time, my parents lived there too.</p><p>But, to me, it now looked like it was just a tiny flower bed buried in a mish-mash of junk and covered by a cloud of dust.</p><p>In this city, few Servants were materialized during the daytime, at least when compared to Akihabara.</p><p>And even when they were materialized, the Servants didn\u2019t just laze around, but they themselves acted with purpose, and most were wearing a suit or the uniform of an office in order to support their Masters in their work.</p><p>\u201CDo you come here often, Karin? To Shinjuku I mean.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha? Me? \u2026Nope, I don\u2019t come around here much. Shinjuku is a city dedicated to adults. Not really a place to play around in.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s what you think\u2026 Though I don\u2019t agree. I mean, it\u2019s true that the business districts are there solely for adults, but there are plenty of museums around, and even department stores all over the place. Not to mention restaurants and the like.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRestaurants, eh\u2026 Now that you mention it, I have come over here for dinner with my family before. We had curry at Nakamuraya.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was a long time ago. Besides, you can get curry anywhere. Not really sure why we came all the way here for it\u2026 And now that we\u2019re talking about food, I\u2019m feelin\u2019 pretty hungry. Let\u2019s go eat in someplace. Ooooh! I spy a bakery with some freshly baked bread over there~!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe didn\u2019t come here to play around. First of all, it\u2019s not even time for lunch yet. Second, there\u2019s someone here I have to go meet up with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CC\u2019mooon, you got an appointment with someone? Lemme guess, Shinjuku\u2019s City Management AI? Caren, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You got it in one. How\u2019d you know?\u201D</p><p>Sometimes this girl is weirdly perceptive.</p><p>Still, I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t managed to guess the actual details of my business here.</p><p>There\u2019s no way she knows that I\u2019ve tried to contact Caren Himuro countless times since handing over my duties as a Nightwatch, just to be put on hold or ignored. Or about the fact that I\u2019ve not received a proper response from her.</p><p>\u201CI knew \u2018cause my Eri-pie doesn\u2019t have any friends! If you were going out of your way to come here for something, there\u2019s really only one thing I could guess.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou were using that kind of sloppy logic?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t\u2026 have any? Any friends\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh\u2026\u201D</p><p>Voyager had looked at me with upturned eyes. A look of concern\u2026 No, his eyebrows were knit with an expression of pity.</p><p>Stop that.</p><p>Please\u2026 stop it.</p><p>\u201C\u2013No, I have some! I have some around here. It just so happens that... friends around my age are a species at risk of extinction. But it\u2019s not a question of \u2018how many\u2019 or \u2018how few\u2019 when it comes to these things, right?\u201D</p><p>TL Note: She actually specifically says \u540C\u5E74\u4EE3\u306F\u58CA\u6EC5\u72B6\u614B\u3063\u3066\u3060\u3051\u3067 in regards to the &quot;people from my age group&quot;. TL&#39;d more literally, that would be something like &quot;The situation is that my generation was decimated&quot; or something like that. I struggled with this one a bit, and decided to just make it a tl note and go less literal, simply because of the context of it, but I wanted to point out the literal translation of the line as well since I do feel it conveys something. The use of &quot;decimate&quot; feels like an Erice-ism, but I felt the Kanji doesn&#39;t come across the same translated.</p><p>He kept a look of doubt on his face as I finished.</p><p>Ahh, give me a break already\u2026</p><p>\u201CA-Anyway, Karin, that manager isn\u2019t called \u201CCaren\u201D... Her distinguished name is \u201CHimuro\u201D, so please call her that. Though there\u2019s no doubt about the fact that she\u2019s a member of the Caren Series.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Er, yeah, that\u2019s true. My bad for that one\u2014 Huh? The heck\u2019s that?\u201D</p><p>Noticing something strange happening nearby us, Karin shifted her gaze elsewhere. I turned myself around, since it seemed like someone had called for me.</p><p>A crowd of people had gathered in front of a shop on the station street, and voices from the group drew my attention.</p><p>\u201CERI~!\u201D \u201COUR BELOVED ERIIIIIII!!\u201D \u201CERIRI\u2019S here~!\u201D \u201CMISTRESS ERI!\u201D \u201CLADY ERI!\u201D</p><p>(What the\u2026?)</p><p>The high-pitched voices in my ears were filled with calls of \u201CEri\u201D, which was none other than my nickname.</p><p>What is going on here?</p><p>\u201CThey said\u2026 Eri, didn\u2019t they? Are those people over there\u2026 Your friends?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? No they\u2019re not\u2026 Er, I don\u2019t think they are?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWanna go check it out?\u201D</p><p>I began to approach the store, unable to resist the charm of the cheers calling my name repeatedly.</p><p>It said \u201CClothing Rental Shop\u201D on the front of the store, and it looked to be a newly redecorated store that had just opened its doors recently.</p><p>It was a relief to see that the reason for the crowding wasn\u2019t another uproar caused by a corpse.</p><p>A group of around thirty people was crowded around the storefront, and in the dead center of it all, surrounded by a group of noisy followers, was a group of gorgeous girls giving off such an energetic aura that it brightened up the surrounding area.</p><p>It was a set of female Servants, each with heads adorned with hair as red as freshly drawn blood, and two twisted horns to match. They also had the tail of a lizard peeking out from their waists.</p><p>(What\u2019s up with this girl\u2013)</p><p>I suddenly recognized those distinctive characteristics of hers.</p><p>Her True Name was \u201CB\xE1thory Erzs\xE9bet\u201D, also known as Elizabeth B\xE1thory.</p><p>There was a five person line-up of her all in one place.</p><p>They were each wrapped up in retro-style costumes, which they must have just put on, considering she was originally a Hungarian Countess who had become famously known as a classic example of a \u2018wicked woman\u2019.</p><p>As for why she had manifested in the form of a young girl, the Holy Grail must have, as usual, chosen a figure from when the balance between her inhuman side and her innocence were at their peak, due to its distorted style of command.</p><p>\u201CSo, how is it? What do you think, my Little Squirrels and Piglets? Does this \u2018Taisho Modern\u2019 outfit look good on me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlright, why don\u2019t you take as many pictures of me as your hearts can handle!\u201D \u201CWhich of us are you looking at!?\u201D \u201CTake a picture of me, my Puppy!\u201D</p><p>They wore kimono that had arrow feather patterns and a camellia motif, along with a navy blue hakama. This was one of the \u2018orthodox styles\u2019 of the female citizens of Shinjuku.</p><p>Each member of the group moved out to strike a charming pose one after the other, letting the audience capture as much footage as they wanted with their phone cameras.</p><p>\u201CHaaah\u2026 It wasn\u2019t \u2018Eri\u2019 they were calling\u2026 It was Eli. Like, \u2018ELIzabeth\u2019 Eli\u2026 Pretty easy to mix up\u2026\u201D</p><p>Voyager seemed to also recognize that the girls were all Servants as soon as we saw them.</p><p>\u201CThey all\u2026 have the same exact face? \u2018Quintuplets\u2019... I think is what you call that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot in this case. Those girls up there aren\u2019t quintuplets, just multiple versions of the same Servant who\u2019ve been summoned at the same time. I\u2019ve never seen so many Servants with the same Spirit Origin in one place though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWoooah\u2026 So that type of thing\u2026 is happening here?\u201D</p><p>Each of them may have a different Class, but even so that\u2019s still fairly rare.</p><p>The people surrounding them must be those girls\u2019 Masters, as well as overzealous fans of Elizabeth.</p><p>The Clothing Rental Shop seemed to be a store that offered a novel service to custumers visiting Shinjuku from other parts of Mosaic City.</p><p>For human customers, they would rent out actual clothing from the early Showa period and the Taisho period. For Servant customers, an expert Magus would craft them a temporarily effective Spiritron Dress to wear as a small layer on their clothing.</p><p>For example, perhaps a small jewel imbued with magical energy would be placed on their wrist or chest, in order to keep it inconspicuous.</p><p>There were already ordinary clothing rental shops in Shinjuku that conformed to the city\u2019s cultural standards, but the fact that this one included Servants among their customer base was an original idea.</p><p>After all, such technology was a kind of \u2018hacking\u2019 technique for Saint Graphs. In terms of Magecraft, such a thing was a very advanced technique, and in the past it would even have been illegal.</p><p>Considering the way it was being utilized so openly here, it seemed that the regulations had been relaxed.</p><p>\u201COh, so it\u2019s her! I get it now, so this is Liz\u2019s offline meet-up. That makes way more sense~\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou know her too, Karin? Elizabeth, I mean.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep. I see some of them around every now and then, since a few of the Liz\u2019s live in Shibuya. They\u2019re regulars at the Live Houses and you always see them on the electronic billboards around there. Heck, I even tried going to a live concert of theirs once, so I\u2019ve already learned my lesson about doing that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean? I think they have pretty nice voices\u2026 Anyway, those hangers-on around them must have come from Shibuya to mess around in Shinjuku too.\u201D</p><p>Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, Elizabeth is similar to K\u014Dy\u014D in a way, since both of them are reptilian creatures with big horns. Though Elizabeth seems to just have a dragon attribute, while Kijyo\u2019s dinosaur attribute is almost her entire being.</p><p>\u201CWhat a coincidence running into Lil Liz! You noticed those retro clothes too, right? They had a real \u2018modern girl\u2019 style, dontcha think? Like weren\u2019t they WAY too cute!? And hey, ya know, ever since we got off the train, my outfit has been kinda feelin\u2019 like it sticks out, right? That\u2019s why I was thinking about\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am NOT going to borrow an outfit. And I\u2019m definitely not going to make such a pointless detour.\u201D</p><p>I quickly grabbed Voyager by the hand and walked away.</p><p>If I catered to Karin\u2019s curiosities our time wasted here would stretch out into infinity.</p><p>\u201CEh!? Just lemme try one on! It\u2019s modern girl style! MODERN! GIRL!\u201D</p><p>At the same time, the gathering of Elizabeths (and friends) began to move, and we ended up getting caught up in the middle of them. jostled and tossed about at the mercy of the crowd, until we eventually managed to hop onto a tram that had entered the square.</p><p>For the sake of meeting up with Himuro\u2019s typically cold shoulder, we made our way to the entertainment district.</p><p>The entertainment district was a shady street located behind the kabuki theatre, marked by the dazzling glare of neon signs.</p><p>Based on the information we had gathered, we had decided that this was the location with the highest probability for us to find and catch Himuro.</p><p>(If we contacted her in advance she would just run away. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll come straight for her instead!)</p><p>The structures on the city\u2019s upper level blocked the sunlight here and, though it was still the middle of the morning, the surrounding area was covered in gloom, making it feel as if the area was approaching twilight.</p><p>That feeling was one made with intent, probably because it was the most favorable mood for a place built for amusement. A space style could suck in exhausted adults with the allure of comfort both day and night.</p><p>Even I, who has had the opportunity to sneak into all sorts of off-limits places to carry out my work, hesitated to enter such a place with confidence.</p><p>For one thing, this time around I had Karin and Voyager with me. And while he may be a Servant, Voyager still had the appearance of a little boy.</p><p>The barkers who pulled people in from around the street of the entertainment district wouldn\u2019t like it if kids like us were wandering into their work space.</p><p>This, of course, was for the obvious reasons such as \u201CIt\u2019s bad for your education\u201D and \u201CWe can\u2019t guarantee your safety\u201D but\u2026 Well, that was the official stance but, above all, anything that could remind the average person that they were being neglectful toward their family was an unwanted interruption in an adult\u2019s playground.</p><p>Right as we were disembarking from the tram, the smell of tobacco hit my nose. Then, a powdery aroma, one that was a little sweet, the scent of white facial powder.</p><p>Next was the languid song of a chanson singer. The somewhat lonely sound of a guitar being strum. The voices of drunkards as they called out in toast, the angry voices of a fight breaking out. The sound of mahjong tiles clacking against the board.</p><p>We stuck out like a sore thumb here, and would do so regardless of whether we were wearing retro clothing or not.</p><p>In fact, we were even stopped by adults several times, who proceeded to roughly try and shoo us away from here.</p><p>But I had been born and raised in Shinjuku, so I knew how to deal with it.</p><p>If you were up against a barker, you just had to drop the name of the area\u2019s yakuza boss to put them in their place. If your opponent was a meddling passerby, you would tell a lie that could get you enough sympathy to sidestep the encounter.</p><p>Though that kind of B.S. wouldn\u2019t work on people who make a professional living through offering guidance to the youth. When running into one of those, all you could do was run away.</p><p>When I was being given support from the City Management AI, Caren, I could get a free pass by stating that I was a member of the Nightwatch, acting to preserve the public order of Akihabara, but I could no longer hope to have such freedoms.</p><p>\u2026.In the past I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why such a filthy and disorderly place as this was necessary in this reconstructed Shinjuku.</p><p>However, now that I had stained my hands with the duty of killing Wayward Servants, had experienced firsthand the burning tenacity of their Masters\u2019 desires, I finally understood how important a place like this was to adults.</p><p>I had begun to have a hazy understanding of why Chitose allowed these immoral and hollow relics of the Showa and Taish\u014D eras to be revived via the Holy Grail in this Post-War New World.</p><p>\u2013The only thing that could alleviate the sorrow of the people was beauty.</p><p>It took us some detours, but our group eventually ended up face to face with its destination.</p><p>Our objective was known as \u201CReijinza Kaikan\u201D, or \u201CThe Belle\u2019s Gathering Hall\u201D-- In the Showa style of speaking, a caf\xE9. In modern style\u2026 a hostess bar.</p><p>\u201CA caf\xE9?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA cowfee?\u201D</p><p>Upon hearing the name of the location, Karin and Voyager tilted their heads in sync.</p><p>\u201CIf it\u2019s a caf\xE9, does that mean it\u2019s a coffee shop? So what, they serve drinks here or somethin\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis isn\u2019t just a coffee shop, it\u2019s a\u2026 caf\xE9, as in a\u2026 Well, you\u2019ll understand when we go inside. Wait, bringing Voyager in probably isn\u2019t a good idea\u2026 Maybe we can have him come in Spirit Form?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSpirit Form\u2026\u201D A look of bewilderment appeared in the boy\u2019s blue eyes. \u201CEnter Spirit Form\u2026 Right\u2026 How do I do that? I\u2026 don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Eh? You can\u2019t do it? What!? Wait, you\u2019re just telling a little lie, right!?\u201D</p><p>It was certainly true that he had not once yet attempted to dematerialize his body and enter Spirit Form.</p><p>In Mosaic City there were Servants who were extremely reluctant to enter Spirit Form, but in the end they would always obey their Master\u2019s will.</p><p>I had assumed that Voyager was a part of this group as well, and that such a thing was just in the nature of certain Servants. My thinking was that, with our contract bound by my Command Seals and our pact laid out by the Holy Grail, the situation would simply resolve itself.</p><p>To begin with, a Servant comes in the form of a Heroic Spirit\u2013 a being summoned through a ritual in which the summoner communes with the dead, the ghost of a person who properly lived out their life in a different axis of time from the one they are summoned into.</p><p>From a magical perspective, their Spirit Forms would be more like a flat, natural state of being.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the situation in Mosaic City, where the overwhelming Magical Energy supplied by the Holy Grail allows for the manifestation and materialization of an unprecedented number of Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Like some kind of idiot, I had been so lost in the joy of Summoning my very own Servant that I had forgotten to check that he could perform such basic abilities.</p><p>In my more detective-esque activities, overlooking such a weak point would have been a fatal error.</p><p>\u201C...Aw damn it.\u201D</p><p>As I began to turn pale, Karin stepped in and offered a solution with a happy-go-lucky demeanor.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s even the problem here? You can\u2019t go into your Spirit Form, right Voyager? If that\u2019s all, why not just watch how Momi does it? I\u2019m sure she could even teach you how to do it too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2026 see\u2026 Miss K\u014Dy\u014D\u2026 could teach me\u2026?\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s a good idea!</p><p>\u2026Is what I thought for just a moment, before quickly finding my mood turning back to disappointment.</p><p>How would she even teach him how to do it?</p><p>K\u014Dy\u014D is a Berserker, so she can\u2019t speak a single word.</p><p>There was no way the Mystic Code app I had installed to translate her nonverbal communications would be able to express how to go about entering Spirit Form with the same level of concrete detail as an individual with actual experience in the act explaining it would have.</p><p>And then we find the one person who can telepathically communicate with Kijyo K\u014Dy\u014D in Karin, someone who wouldn\u2019t even have the Magical Knowledge OR vocabulary to explain such a concept to anyone else!</p><p>\u2013That\u2019s when it happened.</p><p>From a back alley nearby, an unknown person leapt from the pitch black darkness with great power.</p><p>(Karin\u2013!)</p><p>She was on the collision course of this unknown person, but hadn\u2019t noticed them at all.</p><p>Using the enhancements on my legs, I pushed myself in front of her to give her cover.</p><p>But even faster than I could move was the thick tail of a dinosaur that surrounded Karin and I, protecting us from the danger.</p><p>(K\u014Dy\u014D!)</p><p>\u201CWoah woah woah!\u201D The tall figure leaping towards us stumbled just before they collided with it, somehow managing to stop their movement in the nick of time.</p><p>\u201CWh-What the heck!? What\u2019s the matter Momi?\u201D</p><p>It was a brief materialization.</p><p>Leaving behind nothing but a low and menacing growl, K\u014Dy\u014D had disappeared again just as quickly as she had manifested.</p><p>\u201CSheesh, you kids really need to watch yourse\u2013 Wait, aren\u2019t you guys\u2026?\u201D</p><p>Completely out of nowhere, a man we all knew had appeared on the scene.</p><p>A man with blue eyes and disheveled black hair, wearing a Hawaiian shirt that was completely out of place for the atmosphere of Shinjuku.</p><p>There was no mistaking it.</p><p>We had met this musician at the plaza in Akihabara!</p><p>\u201CKuchime\u2026? That IS Kuchime, right? Well ain\u2019t that a coincidence, ya oldie!\u201D</p><p>In spite of K\u014Dy\u014D and I\u2019s concerns, Karin\u2019s face lit up with a sparkle.</p><p>It seemed as if we had run into him in a really REALLY bad place\u2026 the upset attitude he turned towards us with gave me that impression.</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth twitched a bit as a wry smile appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m no damn oldie! \u2026Tch, so it really is you lot. My bad, but I\u2019m in kind of a rush, so\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt definitely looks like it. You seem to be breathing rather hard.\u201D I responded coldly as I confirmed that Voyager\u2019s presence was behind me.</p><p>\u201CLook, ditching you the other day was my bad, but I\u2019ll make it up to you some time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, what\u2019s the big rush? We just ran into each other, where the heck are you running off to?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo wait, I\u2019m seriously sorry but\u2013 See ya!\u201D</p><p>With a wave of his hand he went to take off, and as he did his neck was\u2013</p><p>Like a snake, a red cloth that was both thin and long coiled around him with a fwish.</p><p>The man struggled against it in a desperate attempt to escape, but the cloth continued to entwine itself around his upper body, tightening itself as it went.</p><p>\u201C--Huh? K-KUCHIME! What the hell\u2019s going on!?\u201D</p><p>Karin tried to help untangle him from the strange cloth, but was too weak to do so.</p><p>She was too late.</p><p>Pulled backwards away from us, Kuchime was dragged into the deep darkness of one of the back alleys nearby.</p><p>The man was like caught prey, whose fate had already been sealed. His struggle against the strength of the pull was swiftly brought to a halt.</p><p>\u201CThat cloth\u2013 It\u2019s\u2013!\u201D</p><p>That linen cloth, dyed in a brilliant scarlet hue and engraved deep within my memories\u2013 retrieving that was the objective of my visit to Shinjuku.</p><p>(It\u2019s the Holy Shroud\u2026! That\u2019s my teacher\u2019s\u2013 That\u2019s a memento from Caren!)</p><p>It was a first-class Holy Relic, a Mystic Code that targeted men in particular. Alongside the Holy Lance and the Holy Nails, it was a true model of an Artifact from the world of Magic.</p><p>After the incident at the Colosseum, Chitose had ordered it to be recovered alongside Caren\u2019s body. The new owner was to be the one who would inherit the role of supervisor of the Caren Series, the AI Caren Himuro.</p><p>And the only thing left in my hands were my teacher\u2019s broken glasses.</p><p>\u201CThat person\u2026 was the guitar man, right? Woah\u2026 That looked like it hurt.\u201D Voyager seemed to have some instinctive fear toward the Holy Shroud. His alarm was vaguely expressed through his emotion.</p><p>\u201C...Let\u2019s go.\u201D</p><p>The three of us moved towards the deep section of the back alley with a gulp.</p><p>After our eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, we discovered that there was someone there, as expected.</p><p>However, the person standing before us, clutching onto the end of the Holy Shroud, was not the woman we had anticipated.</p><p>\u201CThis ain\u2019t some kinda show. Get outta here, brats.\u201D</p><p>She dismissed us in a low, cold voice.</p><p>Dressed in a three-piece men\u2019s business suit that fit her form perfectly was a hardened looking adult woman. If you subtracted the height of her boots, she probably wouldn\u2019t have been much bigger than I was.</p><p>And yet, her presence came off with such intensity that I could not get such an impression from her.</p><p>In this moment it was even more impactful, her body poised like a statue of Bishamonten as he tramples evil underfoot in exorcism.</p><p>And as far as I could see, she only had one opponent.</p><p>Not Himuro, not even from the Caren Series. Who could she be?</p><p>At any rate, the woman was not a Servant. She was absolutely a human being, that much I was well aware of.</p><p>Because if she isn\u2019t the Servant, I have to be ready for her Servant partner\u2019s surprise attack.</p><p>Entirely oblivious to my caution, Karin rushed towards the fallen Kuchime.</p><p>\u201CHoly CRAP this is bad! Can\u2019t you see his eyes are turning white!? Are you okay old man!? Are you still alive, Kuchime!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C.....\u201D The woman in the suit narrowed her eyes in annoyance at the one who had ignored her warnings. \u201CI didn\u2019t kill him. Not yet at least. I need to make him cough something up first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-You can\u2019t keep doing that! Look how much you\u2019re hurting him!\u201D As she objected, Karin pulled out her phone and began to call the authorities.</p><p>\u201CTch.\u201D The woman clicked her tongue in annoyance, raising the middle and index fingers of her still-free left hand.</p><p>She made a small chopping motion, as if to cut something with them.</p><p>\u201CAh! What the heck did you do?\u201D Karin looked at her phone screen in astonishment.</p><p>The emergency call she had been dialing had lost its connection, and the phone was forcibly returned to its basic screen.</p><p>\u201CShe just used Higher Communications Authority\u2013!?\u201D</p><p>People who possessed Higher Communications Authority were capable of secretly intercepting or jamming communications between citizens from behind the curtains. I myself had been given the opportunity to temporarily utilize the Authority as a part of my investigations in Servant-Hunting, when the need arose.</p><p>Without authorization from the City Management AI it was extremely difficult to do such a thing\u2013</p><p>In other words, this isn\u2019t a mere lover\u2019s quarrel or some kind of lynching being done by a violent gang\u2026!</p><p>Close by the side of the miserably sprawled out Kuchime, Karin\u2019s reason seemed to dim as she raised her head towards the woman manipulating the flow of the Holy Shroud.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t7MO75G.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>(Yeah, this is bad, this is really bad\u2026 is Karin planning on bringing K\u014Dy\u014D out here!? To think she would get THIS angry\u2026)</p><p>\u201CWait\u2013 Wait a second, Karin\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CWHY should I wait!?\u201D</p><p>Putting my hand on Karin\u2019s shoulder, I could feel their tension from her anger and nervousness.</p><p>\u201CListen to me. That man\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s the bad guy here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou think he\u2019s WHAT!?\u201D</p><p>I understood Karin\u2019s confusion but\u2026</p><p>Please don\u2019t make me.</p><p>You absolutely cannot let me, of all people, have to hunt down a rampaging K\u014Dy\u014D.</p><p>\u201CExcuse me! Are you\u2026 this city\u2019s detective? No, that\u2019s wrong. Are you possibly\u2026 the Nightwatch here?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What\u2019d you say?\u201D She had a distinct reaction to the term \u201CNightwatch\u201D.</p><p>(--Now I get it. It\u2019s just like I thought.)</p><p>The woman looked behind me to where Voyager stood peering into the violent scene, before turning her gaze towards my person. For a brief moment I was certain that she was looking behind Karin as well, but I figured she was just on the lookout for any curious onlookers coming in from the main street.</p><p>\u201C........\u201D</p><p>She gradually nudged Kuchime over, slowly pushing down on his backside with the sole of her shoe, all while firmly keeping her eyes locked on mine. It seemed as if she was thinking things over, or simply waiting for something to happen.</p><p>A few seconds of silence and inaction passed us by.</p><p>Finally, she bluntly broke the silence while continuing to avoid answering my question.</p><p>\u201CHey, kid\u2026 You\u2019re the Daughter of Utsumi, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...! How\u2026?\u201D</p><p>She kept going before I had the chance to calm from the shock and open my mouth for a proper response.</p><p>\u201CYou made a pretty awful mistake at the Colosseum, don\u2019t you think? You not only failed to capture the lone suspect at the head of it all, you also allowed for countless people to become victims of said suspect, all resulting in Caren Fujimura winding up dead.\u201D</p><p>\u2026.I was at such a loss for words that I couldn\u2019t even attempt to say anything in response to her claims.</p><p>To my surprise, the woman seemed to know who I was, while I on the other hand had no idea what was going on.</p><p>\u201CHey! What the hell are you saying all of a sudden, you damn jerk!\u201D Karin shouted out with a violent tone to her voice. \u201CDon\u2019t you know Eri-pie\u2019s a victim too!? She was under suspension on the day all that happened, she just happened to be at the Colosseum! She did what she could as one person who happened to get dragged into the panic there! You think you get to complain about what she did like you\u2019re all high and mighty!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWooow, don\u2019t you just care about her soooo much. If no one else is willing to tell it to her, then I\u2019ll be the one who does it. As many times as it takes. So she never pussies out from that kind of situation for the rest of her life.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWHAT did you say!? Don\u2019t you DARE go making assumptions about us!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKarin I\u2026 it\u2019s fine. Everything she\u2019s saying is true\u2026\u201D</p><p>Even so, her blunt manner of speaking and that sharp tongue pierced right through me.</p><p>Clinging to Kuchime, Karin frantically pulled at the Holy Shroud until it was loose enough for a tiny opening to form around his mouth. With a wheeze, his labored breathing finally resumed as his body went limp.</p><p>The strength of a Middle Schooler would not have been nearly enough to loosen the binding of this Holy Shroud. The woman in control of it had to have intentionally adjusted the restraint, keeping him alive like one would a fish on the chopping board.</p><p>\u201C--The guy here is Malenkov.\u201D The woman told us.</p><p>\u201CHuh? He\u2019s\u2026 Malen\u2026 kov?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe calls himself \u2018Akiba\u2019s Malenkov\u2019. He\u2019s a street guitar player, goes from place to place in Shinjuku\u2019s entertainment districts to perform.\u201D</p><p>TL Note: Malenkov: Turns out, there was a fairly famous Japanese guitar player/singer named \u52A0\u85E4\u6B66\u7537 who started guitar in the 1940s, and then was popular from the 50s-early 2000s, dying in 2009. His life, in my opinion, definitely inspired Kuchime&#39;s character in a few pretty obvious ways, so I recommend looking up his wikipedia (JP Wikipedia) if you&#39;re interested in that kinda thing. The name Malenkov is because people thought he looked like the Soviet politician of the same name.</p><p>\u201CKuchime, that\u2019s the kind of thing you do? Wait, can you even talk right now?\u201D Karin poked at his head.</p><p>\u201CHah\u2026 I-I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Everything\u2019s totally not broken. <em>HACK</em>... Right, that\u2019s in fact the type of thing I do. It\u2019s a good way to earn some money ya know\u2026 When the folks around here have imbibed a bit too much, I\u2019ll play them those dear songs from the anime they used to watch before the war, and they got locked into a trance listening to them. They get all earnest, they even start to cry. Really makes playing worthwhile, ya feel me\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CTalking like that somehow makes you seem rather persistent\u2026 Or maybe you just have too much energy, Kuchime.\u201D</p><p>He was in pretty terrible shape, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any broken bones at least.</p><p>Karin seemed more or less relieved by this and no longer seemed intent on calling K\u014Dy\u014D forth, meaning the worst case scenario of an all-out battle had been avoided.</p><p>\u201CHmph. Just so you know, his REAL name is Kuchime, got it? If he\u2019s guilty of something like doing lewd stuff in front of a kid or getting it on with one, I\u2019ll hand him right back over. But before that, how about we start with a little bit of an interrogation?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Interrogation, is it?\u201D The woman seemed a bit hesitant about the situation.</p><p>I figured she was going to coolly dismiss Karin this time, but that didn\u2019t actually happen.</p><p>Maybe she understood that Karin and I were involved in the incident we were talking about earlier, meaning we wouldn\u2019t back down unless we got a good explanation as to what was going on.</p><p>She let out an exasperated sigh and began to talk.</p><p>\u201CThis guy works for me. As an informant.\u201D She gave us a totally unexpected answer. Karin was as dumbfounded as I was. \u201CWhen I talked with him for my investigation into the \u2018Command Seal Hunter\u2019 he gave me false intel. Thanks to that, Akihabara is still standing on shaky ground\u2026 Ask Himuro the rest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHimuro is HERE!? Like, inside the Reijinza!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep, she is.\u201D</p><p>The fact that she had been entrusted with something as precious as the Holy Shroud, combined with the way she mentioned Himuro by name, made me certain that this woman was in fact a Nightwatch.</p><p>But I had absolutely no idea that this person even existed.</p><p>She may have said to ask Himuro for the rest, but there was no way she would meekly offer up that kind of insider information.</p><p>\u201C...Are you going to do your interrogation there?\u201D</p><p>I asked meekly, with a sense of timidness. We were calling all the questioning \u201Cinterrogation\u201D, but in this case it was really going to be a cruel form of torture, to force the person being questioned to spill the beans.</p><p>\u201CNah, no way. My partners\u2019ll be here in a bit. They\u2019ll take him in. I told you before, this ain\u2019t some show for brats to be watching.\u201D</p><p>It\u2019s definitely not wrong that we are all children, but the woman\u2019s words seemed to be dressed with a nuance towards Voyager in particular. I\u2019d thought she had been completely disregarding us since we first showed up, but it would seem that the exact opposite was happening instead.</p><p>\u201CIt would be better\u2026 NOT to do such cruel things\u2026 right sis\u2026?\u201D</p><p>\u201C....\u201D</p><p>Voyager had said it to the woman with sadness in his voice.</p><p>He had called her \u2018sis\u2019.</p><p>That means she\u2019s a big sister now.</p><p>Despite being the same boy who had been so detached from everything in the face of the tragedy at the Colosseum, this time he seemed to be able to sense that there was an uneasiness in the air around us.</p><p>Perhaps, ever since forming a contract with me, something had begun to change in him\u2026?</p><p>\u201CYou know, that man makes really, really, nice music. He plays wonderful songs.\u201D Voyager was soft-spoken, uncharacteristically elegant, as he recalled the scene in front of the station where we had watched Kuchime\u2019s performance. \u201CBut he\u2026 His song seems a little sad too. It\u2019s probably that he\u2026 He\u2019s been searching for the person he TRULY wants to hear it this whole time.\u201D</p><p>In the middle of another coughing fit Kuchime let slip a weak laugh.</p><p>\u201C...I\u2019ll spare his fingers and ears.\u201D The woman said without a hint of emotion.</p><p>Such truly heartwarming kindness.</p><p>\u201CHeh\u2026 Hey, I\u2019m glad to hear it\u2026 Thank you kindly, kiddo.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait a sec, you stop acting like some kinda done-in yakuza right now! Are you TRYING to rush into old man mode!? It\u2019s like you\u2019re suddenly growing old man hair all over your body!\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust let it go\u2026 You\u2019ve got no idea, ya hear me\u2026 <em>cough</em>\u201D</p><p>(While I\u2019d love to let Karin argue all she\u2019d like for a few more minutes we\u2026)</p><p>We didn\u2019t have time for that.</p><p>I had to hurry up and make up my mind.</p><p>\u201CKarin\u2013 I have a favor to ask you. A serious one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDamn it, what could it be that you have to ask now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI want you to take Voyager and go to the Reijinza Kaikan, ahead of me. I\u2019ll catch up to you in a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...You want me to WHAT?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve been listening to everything that was just said too, right? If her suspicions of him are true, we can\u2019t just let Kuchime go free this easily. In order to be certain about him, we have to leave things to this person\u2013 So go, and take Voyager with you.\u201D</p><p>Karin did as I asked, keeping her head turned back towards us the whole time as she went.</p><p>With Kuchime on the floor between us, the woman and I now engaged in a one-on-one dialogue.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re the Nightwatch of Shinjuku, aren\u2019t you? And the Holy Shroud is something that you got from Himuro.\u201D</p><p>She nodded wordlessly in response.</p><p>\u201C--If you don\u2019t have any other business here, just go already.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI still have a favor for you. Please, can I talk to this man\u2013! Would you be willing to let me talk with Kuchime, just the two of us? Please! Even just one minute would be fine!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way. Are you some kind of idiot, kid?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-It\u2019s because it\u2019s a private matter!</p><p>\u201CLook, I\u2019ll give you the time, but I ain\u2019t moving from here, and I won\u2019t be loosening the Shroud at all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C....I understand.\u201D I resigned myself from the conversation, and crouched down next to Kuchime, who was lying on his side. \u201CKuchime\u2026 I just want to ask you a single question. What do you think of Karin?\u201D</p><p>With a look of feigned ignorance, Kuchime stayed in his silence and gave a slight smile.</p><p>I moved to make my intentions even more clear.</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re just screwing around with her with that suggestive attitude of yours\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to ever meet with her again. No, I won\u2019t let you meet with her again.\u201D</p><p>There was a short moment of reserved silence before he let out a sigh of resignation and a grumble. Just like he did that time before, his eyes turned downcast towards the ground.</p><p>\u201CGood ol\u2019 Karin\u2026 has a nice voice, don\u2019t you think?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe truth is I\u2026 I just want to listen to her singing voice for a little while longer. That\u2019s all I want.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that\u2026 so.\u201D</p><p>It was an unflashy confession, one made as an extension of our idle chatting and nothing more.</p><p>Kuchime had an attitude I couldn\u2019t quite grasp, and yet, for some reason, it seemed as if he was saying what he truly thought just then.</p><p>If he had been using Karin to get closer to myself or Voyager, I had been thinking of how I would give him an incredibly vicious beating, so his words had let me down a little.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s your minute.\u201D The woman said with a snap of her fingers.</p><p>Without the need for any sort of enhanced hearing, we could hear the distinctive sound that comes from the brakes of a large vehicle, followed by the sounds of footsteps ringing out one after another as a specialized team of the authorities approached with their unique equipment in hand.</p><p>But there was still one more thing I needed to confirm with her, to ensure it was no mistake. Something that was extremely important to me, a personal matter regarding myself.</p><p>\u201CUm, I have to ask\u2013\u201D I felt a premonition that this was a topic I should not touch upon\u2026 And yet, I also felt as though I could not help but to ask her anyway. \u201CEarlier, when you referred to me, you called me the \u2018Daughter of Utsumi\u2019! ...People who know my personal history always, without fail, refer to me as the blood relative of Manazura Chitose, her insolent granddaughter\u2013 so why?\u201D</p><p>As I asked, troops from the authorities clad in black surrounded Kuchime, tying him down with the latest model of restraints and loading him into a self-moving stretcher, as if he were just a piece of luggage.</p><p>The Holy Shroud, now finished with its duties here, folded itself up neatly into a compact form that easily slid into the suit breast-pocket of the woman, who was still standing in the alleyway.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything weird about it. It\u2019s because you, kid, are Utsumi and Nami\u2019s only daughter.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...kh\u2026\u201D</p><p>This person\u2026 This person knows my mother and father.</p><p>As she turned away to leave me, I desperately called out to her\u2013</p><p>\u201CA name! P-Please, could you tell me your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not really necessary at this point. If you\u2019re leaving the Manazura household behind, not to mention taking the liberty of abandoning your duties as a Nightwatch, our worlds no longer have reason to crossover with one another. Go live a peaceful life, as another member of the general populace.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo that\u2019s\u2026\u201D</p><p>There were no words with which to reply.</p><p>She began to walk away, having erected a barrier of rejection towards me, before suddenly stopping in her tracks, muttering something with a grumble.</p><p>\u201C...What\u2026? You know that kind of thing is ridiculously meddlesome, right? \u2026Fine, fine, I get it.\u201D</p><p>(Who is she communicating with? It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s talking to herself\u2026)</p><p>\u2026Of course not.</p><p>She had to be having a conversation with her Servant, who had never shown themself.</p><p>After a short argument, she reluctantly swung back around towards me, and said very bluntly:</p><p>\u201C\u2018Makki\u2019. That\u2019s the name. Bye, Erice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CQuite so. This is goodbye, I suppose.\u201D</p><p>In a private room within the Reijinza Kaikan, Himuro nodded her head. It was an entirely insincere gesture.</p><p>She was wearing a classical schoolgirl-style yagasuri hakama, as well as a face that was expressionless, simply unapproachable. At the same time, she also wore the same face, same voice, and same role over the Caren Series.</p><p>But despite all of that, their personalities and manners of speaking were utterly different. Strange.</p><p>I had always believed my teacher to have a touch of human kindness due to the way in which she pursued her obsessions, and just like her, Himuro\u2019s personality being entirely mired in a coolly indifferent style of acting was, in my opinion, also very much human.</p><p>However, such a thing was the vice of humans who attempted to appraise themselves by their own standards of judgment. For her, as the human interface for the Holy Grail, such traits were not something to be admired for.</p><p>\u201CThe girl, Makki, had no intention of coming into contact with you in any way, but now that contact has been made there is nothing to be done about it.\u201D</p><p>First, there was the Nightwatch with an intimate understanding of the underbelly of society, Makki, a person who was but a stranger to me. And now\u2026 the fact that this \u201Ccafe\u201D and its services were directly managed by Himuro\u2026 My image of her character as the straight-laced type had been shaken.</p><p>\u201C...Himuro, you\u2019re not always around at this business, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed, I am not. The job I do here is not full-time, though this store has its use as a place to meet with important persons for negotiations, while also acting as a lawful source of information that is both applicable and valid to utilize. When the time arises that I must leave for outside business, I entrust care of this store to the manager here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, so it\u2019s that kind of thing\u2026\u201D</p><p>I had made my way into the \u201Ccafe\u201D with heavy steps and a hung head, but what awaited me inside was a spectacle beyond my expectations.</p><p>The adult stylings and music. The dark brown of the mahogany furniture. The gaudy red and gold of the luxurious decor. The fragrance of the roasting coffee and the melodic flow of popular music\u2026</p><p>Wait, this stuff is just like a normal cafe\u2026</p><p>Instead, the problem came from Karin and Voyager, who had been guided into a semi-private room when they arrived ahead of me.</p><p>The cafe\u2019s \u201Cwaitresses\u201D, who were dressed in aprons made in a style that blended Western and Japanese clothing together and designed to resemble the uniform of a maid, were all crowded around the young blonde boy sitting upon the sofa.</p><p>Set before him was an extra bit of service, a parfait seemingly gifted for him to eat at whatever pace he pleased. The hostesses of the cafe all gave off a sense of distance to him that said nothing but \u201Ctoo close\u201D as they surrounded him, pampering away without reservation.</p><p>Out of nowhere, I heard the distant sound of voices whispering \u201CGrim Reaper\u2026\u201D at me, but I pretended not to hear them.</p><p>\u201C...What are you doing? Who do you think you are? Are you a prince now?\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>Chew, chew</em> <em>sluuurp</em> \u2026Do you know what this is, Erice? A banana\u2026 and cream and\u2026 pudding parfait. That\u2019s what this food is. It\u2019s super super tasty. It\u2019s really not bad at all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is NOT the part I was talking about, okay? Do you understand?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s amazing. It has so many flavors in it. We have to do more\u2026 research on it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C.....\u201D</p><p>For someone that\u2019s usually quiet without much to say, when he DOES speak he sure likes to run his mouth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Karin was being Karin and, obviously having forgotten my earlier concerns, was having a rousing chat with the hostesses. She looked like a total regular.</p><p>It\u2019s a matter of fact that minors are typically prohibited from entering this cafe, but Himuro had been aware of the situation at hand and chose to let them in.</p><p>Because it mainly operates during the night there are few customers during the day, causing the staff to have a lot of free time throughout the morning. It would seem the combo of the seldom seen young boy and girl arriving at the shop had resulted in them being received as welcome guests.</p><p>And, as I had expected, the hostesses here consisted not only of humans, but of Servants too.</p><p>(The gorgeous woman over there, moving so gracefully\u2026. That\u2019s the famous female spy, Mata Hari! To see her performing a dance on the stage here\u2026 She\u2019s a celebrity among Heroic Spirits\u2026! And not to mention, that dangerous looking woman with the brunette hair and a rifle at her side\u2026 is that the female sharpshooter, Annie Oakley?</p><p>This is a first\u2026 is she the actual bouncer for this store, or is she just here for show?</p><p>Wait, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real gun\u2026</p><p>And even though both of them are wearing those orthodox hakama, they really do stand out\u2026)</p><p>(Both of those Heroic Spirits were involved in showbusiness, so they should be compatible with the service industry\u2026. I guess?)</p><p>That sense of conflict that came from the Servants in the arena, between their pride and remorse, floats through my mind once more.</p><p>However, this store is different from the hostess club \u201Ccafes\u201D of history.</p><p>The misfortune brought by those businesses\u2019 unstably meager wages, the type that would cause the hostesses to become reliant on providing \u201Cexcess service\u201D in order to make ends meet, had not been reproduced here. In this place, supply and demand are exchanged under proper administration, after the mutual understanding of both the customer and the storefront had been reached.</p><p>And the person in charge of this store, as of the present, was the one I was currently in the middle of confronting, Caren Himuro.</p><p>\u201C--Indeed. The assignment of the Holy Shroud to Makki\u2019s possession was requested by myself, and granted approval by Chitose. Therefore, Erice, your wish for said request to be overturned will, as a matter of principle, not be granted.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Seems that way, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEver since the incident some days ago, the public has had an exponential growth within its sense of insecurity, one that must be resolved without a moment\u2019s hesitation. This application of the Shroud was a necessary action in order to preserve public order. Please, do understand.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I understand.\u201D</p><p>I already understood all that.</p><p>I knew that it was asking too much to have Caren\u2019s belongings given over to me.</p><p>We had gone through so much trouble just to get a meeting with Himuro that it would\u2019ve been completely nonsensical to just give her a greeting and then be on our way back home, so I decided to make my request just in case, but in the end it was a pointless conversation.</p><p>If you are going to be the owner of it, I was wondering if somehow you might allow me to be the one to use it?</p><p>\u201CEver since the incident there\u2019s been an increase in your duties as City Management that\u2019s been keeping your hands full. You\u2019re saying that you, personally, don\u2019t have the resources to directly solve the issues at hand through the use of Mystic Codes, isn\u2019t that right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is exactly right, Erice. The innumerable letters of complaint that you sent have been weighed in comparison to the demands of countless other citizens, and appropriate measures have been taken as a result.\u201D</p><p>So they were withholding their response because it was a lower priority for them\u2026 huh?</p><p>That was absolutely a lie.</p><p>That sort of thing could have been handled in the background of this little tea time in the split of a nanosecond.</p><p>Once again, Chitose is the one who instigated this!</p><p>\u201C...Well, I need to thank you for what you did with Miss Rurihime\u2019s situation but\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was for the best. We have been receiving regular reports from Tenman-g\u016B\u2019s Rurihime. Her inheritance of your duties seems to have been a favorable one. Servant Minamoto no Kurou Yoshitsune is also acclimatizing. After her training period has reached its conclusion, it is our desire that she begin activities as the Nightwatch of Akihabara.\u201D</p><p>That was good news. There should be no problems then.</p><p>It seemed like the right time to part with the store too, as the conversation had gone over rather polite and smooth, save for the fact that the answer to all of my requests was \u201Cno\u201D.</p><p>And right when I hoped that she would spare me another of her sarcastic quips\u2013</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s regrettable, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Himuro muttered those few words as she took a glass of iced tea into her hands. \u201CI had rather anticipated \u2018working\u2019 together with you, Erice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that\u2026 How you really feel?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCaren Fujimura appraised you so exceedingly high you see.\u201D</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but let a bitter laugh slip out.</p><p>\u201CMy teacher was always scolding me. The results of my work were never something for her to praise. Her evaluations of it were always a failing grade\u2013 or one that was could barely be called a passable score.\u201D</p><p>For a brief moment Himuro quietly fixed her eyes on me. Even if her behavior was nothing more than a performance put on by her fine-tuned personality, just what was she thinking at a speed of thought several hundred million times faster than that of a human?</p><p>\u201CIt was a pre-established configuration, the settings for the automatic succession sequence created with concern for kernel loss, and it did not leave the memories of Caren Fujimura\u2019s personal feelings about you within our Series\u2019 shared domain. As such, I am certain\u2026 Caren did not wish to hand those feelings over to anyone else.\u201D</p><p>\u2013I bit into my lip. To not show her any unsightly tears.</p><p>Makki\u2019s words, wedged deep within my heart, began to ache.</p><p>From there, we exchanged any unreported information relating to the incident.</p><p>From Himuro\u2019s side came the state of affairs surrounding the authorities\u2019 investigation, as well as the analyzed data of the city\u2019s surveillance network. For my part, I discussed what I knew about the movement happening within the underbelly of society that I had learned from an informant I was intimately acquainted with.</p><p>The investigation had gone exactly as expected, having made little progress and had uncovered no direct leads that pointed towards the culprit.</p><p>As we parted, Himuro said:</p><p>\u201COh, in the case that you are interested in working at our caf\xE9 as one of its \u2018Waitresses\u2019, please feel free to contact me at any time. I shall be waiting for you to do so with pleasure.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLook up the Labor Standards Act.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh how sudden. To think the great Utsumi Erice had such care for the law?\u201D</p><p>I suppose this too is just a part of Himuro\u2019s sense of humor, but I really wish she would\u2019ve stopped holding such a serious face when she said it. It made me take the joke too seriously\u2026</p><p>Just as we were taking our leave from the private area, a wild Karin and Voyager appeared from where they had been waiting in another room.</p><p>\u201CYo, Himi-pie! Gotta thank you for the waffles. They were great.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you for the meal.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou seem to be in good spirits Miss Karin, and Mister Voyager as well. If you enjoyed the meal I have cause to rejoice. Miss Karin, please send my regards to your father\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CWah\u2013 Blech, you can cut that out. A-Anyway, did you hear what you needed to Eri-pie?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s a loaded question. Which part that I needed to hear about specifically?\u201D</p><p>\u201CC\u2019mon, isn\u2019t it super obvious? That pudding haired big sister type from earlier. Who the heck was she?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere was pudding\u2026\u201D The boy tilted his head as he repeated a sweet tasting memory to himself.</p><p>But, pudding haired\u2026 Now that she mentions it, the roots of her hair were a bit unevenly dyed, so the black had returned to contrast with the blonde a bit.</p><p>Although, I have my own Mystic Code equipped in a way where the design resembles an extension of my bangs. Could that have been a type of Mystic Code too?</p><p>Well, no, that\u2019s beside the point:</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t just ask about that sort of thing so carelessly, Karin. It\u2019s no good to pry into the work of the Nightwatch without caution, just talking about their work is a no go and might get in the way of it. First and foremost, I\u2019ve already\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, so you wish to know about Makki, the agent that works for me full-time. That should be just fine, no?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Huh? I-It\u2019s okay? Could you really tell us?\u201D</p><p>Karin looked to me as her face changed into one of triumph, ready to gloat.</p><p>According to Himuro, Makki did not specifically ask her to remain silent on the matter. The only condition was that we could not ask questions that related to ongoing investigations.</p><p>It was a fairly standard condition to give, but it was enough to cause Karin\u2019s face to 180 into a look of total dissatisfaction, given that the number one item on her list of questions (and likely the one thing she was even expecting to hear about) had to do with Kuchime\u2019s arrest.</p><p>(As for me, I can\u2019t just leave things like this either\u2026 I\u2019ll go through with a more thorough investigation after this is done.)</p><p>\u201CThis is a topic that even some of the hostesses here would know of, those with the most discerning of ears at least.\u201D Himuro said as a preface to the conversation. \u201CSince the time in which Mosaic City was being founded, Makki has been acting as an agent for Chitose, providing her with assistance. This began even before my implementation as a City Management AI.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe Nightwatch has existed since even before the Management AI?\u201D</p><p>So basically, that would mean that lady\u2026 would mean that Makki is something of a senpai to me\u2026 I\u2019m starting to understand less and less.</p><p>\u201CIn those days the title and occupation of Nightwatch did not exist, however there was the rather free role of Spellcaster.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph. She\u2019s older than she looks. Must\u2019ve been rejuvenated by some eternal youth treatments. She\u2019s really overdoing it, don\u2019t you think?\u201D</p><p>\u201CKarin\u2026 That\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201D (...Of a strange thing to get so stuck on.)</p><p>Sometimes the next-generation will just casually talk about other peoples\u2019 problems regarding their age, with no real ill will behind it. Whether one looks young or old is up to the person in question\u2019s preference.</p><p>As for the old generation, the act of falsifying one\u2019s outward appearance was an unnatural thing, one done with a feeling of guilt, though they didn\u2019t have those negative values in the beginning.</p><p>\u201CErice? Allow me to say that, in spite of your intimacy with Chitose, it is of no surprise that you would not have any knowledge of Makki, despite her being someone you could call your \u2018colleague\u2019 within the Nightwatch. She is known to frequently make expeditions to the outside of Mosaic City as experiments, staying on-site for extended periods of time in order to conduct her investigative activities. Her current homecoming only began recently.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid you say outside of Mosaic City\u2026!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2013 No way! How the heck does she do that!?\u201D</p><p>This topic became one that I was no longer a stranger to. The simple fact alone was one worthy of admiration. Karin was amazed by this information as well.</p><p>\u201CIt is not unreasonable for you to be shocked by such a thing. Makki is possessed of the ability to evade great peril. If she was not, she would have been incapable of surviving within that place\u2013 at the site of such a fierce and bloody battle like Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p>(----!)</p><p>The instant I heard that name made my hair stand on end with a shudder.</p><p>\u201C...Fuyuki\u2026? Did you say Fuyuki? As in one of the battlegrounds of the Holy Grail War th\u2013\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed. Agent Makki numbers among the few who can call themselves a survivor of Fuyuki.\u201D Himuro let us see a slight smile flash upon her face. It was the first time that day her lips had stopped being so stiff. It was as if she was laughing at herself for making the mistake of saying too much to me.</p><p>Just like the nod, an entirely insincere gesture.</p><p>\u201CThe experience of having been at that place would be a truly gruesome memory, one impossible to wipe away, no matter the person. The woman in question has no desire to speak of her past. And because I myself only know about such things as a result of what I heard from Caren Fujimura, I have nothing more I can say on the matter\u2026\u201D</p><p>What follows is an unspoken \u201CPlease, accept my utmost apologies\u2026\u201D.</p><p>As she concluded her speech, Himuro hung her head with grace.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>After all was said and done, Shinjuku produced zero results.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t get our hands on the \u2018Holy Shroud\u2019, and I didn\u2019t think that the Nightwatch we met through that sudden chance encounter, Makki, was likely to become our ally. I proceeded to go around to some of the underworld\u2019s leading figures, as well as to my informant acquaintance, to look into the \u2018Command Seal Hunter\u2019, but the harvest wasn\u2019t particularly bountiful there either.</p><p>At a nook within Tsunohazu our party sat side by side on some concrete playground equipment to rest our feet for a short while in a small park.</p><p>\u201CEri-pie, aren\u2019t you gonna head home? I mean like, to your parents\u2019 house in Hanazono.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t wanna go and let Grandma Chitose see your face or anything?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...What is this? Are you being serious?\u201D</p><p>Karin, whether fortunately or not, had not been present at that scene.</p><p>She was not witness to the shocking moment in which Lucius turned his spear upon Voyager. When I told her about what had happened after the fact she was hardly able to believe the situation could occur.</p><p>And besides, even though Chitose tends to stay at home under normal circumstances, right now she\u2019s likely extremely busy, so she wouldn\u2019t even be there. All we\u2019d find is an empty and gloomy flat with nobody inside it.</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re so insistent on homecomings, wouldn\u2019t it be good to go home yourself? To your house in Shibuya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEw, no way. They\u2019ll totally ban me from going out again this time. I wanna see my cute little bros but I\u2019ll just have to put up with it strong as I can~ Hang in there Karin, hang in there\u2026\u201D</p><p>While insisting upon this point she took Voyager firmly into her arms and started to ruffle his hair while hauling him around.</p><p>\u201CEriiiice\u2026.\u201D The boy who was being jerked around gave me a look with moistened eyes that cried out he wanted it to stop.</p><p>Reluctantly, I began to reach out with him with the feeling that I had no choice but to do something about the situation, when something caught Karin\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201CHm? What\u2019s this under your scarf\u2026 leather goggles? And if it ain\u2019t the ones I saw in Erice\u2019s room before. You mean to bring these with you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI got them, from Erice.\u201D</p><p>\u201COoooh! Isn\u2019t that just the coolest! They look good on ya!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey do\u2026 right? I\u2019ve\u2026 been thinking so too.\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s expression did an about-face as he smiled wide with a giggle.</p><p>Seriously, what an upbeat little guy.</p><p>\u201CHold it a second Karin, don\u2019t go making any suspicious moves. And that goes for you too, Voyager. I\u2019d like to avoid getting chased around by people looking to take us into protective custody again, got it?\u201D</p><p>\u2026Those goggles are a memento of my father\u2019s. Or so I was told.</p><p>An antique aviation design. He would use them when he rode around on his motorbike. I had hoped that if, by some miracle, a defective thing like myself had a Servant summoned to them, I would be able to give those goggles to that Servant.</p><p>That\u2019s why this morning, when I finally handed them over to him as I was leaving my apartment, I was at a suitable level of emotionally moved.</p><p>Although, the size is just a bit too big for Voyager, so he has to either hang them around his neck or wear them on top of his head but\u2026 well, if the one wearing them likes them I\u2019ve got no problems.</p><p>That person\u2013 Makki, she didn\u2019t try to hide the fact that she was acquainted with my father. Not only that, she specifically called me by my father\u2019s family name of Utsumi. And she even knew my mother\u2019s name, Nami.</p><p>Grandmother, Chitose, she changed her family name back to her maiden name of Manazuru after giving birth to my father.</p><p>Was doing so a demonstration of her determination as the heiress to a Magus\u2019 family lineage, or was it due to a more personal separation involving her family\u2026? Whichever it was, I have no idea.</p><p>Regardless, if Chitose continues to keep her mouth as closed as it\u2019s always been about my parents\u2019 past, then I want to meet with Makki again.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I want her to tell me some heartwarming story about them.</p><p>I want to hear from her what Chitose and Lucius have never told me, what my teacher wouldn\u2019t tell me until the very end. I just want her to tell me what happened when my parents died.</p><p>And, if possible I\u2026 I want to know more about her past, the thing that Makki herself does not want to touch on. For the sake of getting closer to Fuyuki.</p><p>\u201CKarin, and Erice\u2026 both went away from home, so that makes you the same as me. Right?\u201D Voyager said with a look of self-satisfaction.</p><p>\u201CHehe, runaways is it? Well, if Voyager is saying so too. Er, that is what he\u2019s saying, right? Eri-pie?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmmm, running away from home and\u2026 Voyager\u2019s exploration as a space probe? I wonder if those are really the same thing\u2026?\u201D</p><p>A number of days or weeks from home, to which you can return anytime, is incredibly different from a more than likely permanent trip. No, I think what Voyager wants to say is\u2013</p><p>\u201C...But in the end, you know what we\u2019re doing? We\u2019re just running here and there around Mosaic City, blocked up by Bounded Fields so we can\u2019t even get out far enough to run away from home.\u201D</p><p>(So that\u2019s how Karin feels\u2026)</p><p>She gave a lonely laugh at her own words, and it felt like the weight of reality had finally fallen onto me.</p><p>How could we do something like set our sites for Fuyuki?</p><p>The voice of self-depreciation had been ringing within my heart the entire time, telling me I was being nothing but an enormous fool. Even though I already knew all of that, I had started walking.</p><p>It was at that point that Voyager gently shook his head.</p><p>\u201CThis is just a swing-by.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...A swing-by?\u201D</p><p>A very abrupt choice to use a space term. I believe it\u2019s also called a fly-by.</p><p>\u201CYep. You know, at first, you have to go here and there around the closer stars. But, before long you go higher and higher, reach a lot deeper, the whole time getting further and further away until\u2014\u201D He stood in place and pointed straight at the sky. \u201CYou go. And we\u2019ll go too.\u201D</p><p>Neither Karin or myself had the words to reply, instead looking at his fingertips. The tip of a small and all too fragile finger points the way.</p><p>The Command Seals on my left hand began to dully ache.</p><p>He told me he had forgotten something.</p><p>He said the thing that was forgotten was my wish.</p><p>He said we were going to destroy this world. But, this world has been destroyed enough already.</p><p>(Ahh\u2026 This is\u2026 the Wish of Ruin\u2026 the bloody revolution my master dreamt of\u2026 the very thing that is the black dog\u2019s seduction.)</p><p>If I could return to the Holy Grail everything that had spilled forth unto the earth I would undoubtedly reduce all of my loved ones, I would reduce my beloved homeland, I would reduce everything to ashes, and I would make an enemy of the World itself.</p><p>It would not bring back that which I have mourned.</p><p>Karin, who usually acted without restraint or any fear of causing trouble for others, had been acting completely docile today.</p><p>Despite the fact that I had made up my mind to go to Fuyuki, my dejected attitude had caused us to stumble from the start, until even she was discouraged by it.</p><p>As I was starting to suspect that was the case, I suddenly reconsidered what the reason could be.</p><p>(Ah, no, I\u2019ve got it all wrong\u2026 can\u2019t be due to my attitude, since it definitely has to be because of the stuff with Kuchime. That\u2019s probably it\u2026)</p><p>If falling in love was starting to weigh so heavily on her mind, then I can say I\u2019m growing less and less interested in the situation.</p><p>I walked around the city with Karin and Voyager, riding as passengers on the trams from one spot to another, but the city was perfectly calm and peaceful. If I were to sense the presence of a strong murderous intent or the feeling of death itself my Dread Spirits would have an immediate response, but there was nothing of the sort.</p><p>I suppose that means it\u2019s just a matter of course that Himuro would be dedicating the majority of her resources to the restoration of the city while the city\u2019s investigators and their Servants were positioned around and taking the utmost precautions.</p><p>(Phew\u2026 getting myself so worked up about this won\u2019t be changing things for the better\u2026)</p><p>I relaxed my shoulders and let out a disappointed sigh.</p><p>\u201CHey, Karin? How about we head over to a fruit parlor? There\u2019s a huge store in front of Central Station, right? It\u2019ll be my treat.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor real? Alright, Madame Eri-pie\u2019s come out! Such a rare sight, ya feel me? Is it seriously okay for you to treat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not that rare. No, actually, it\u2019s not even rare at all. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what percentage of the wages I receive are marked as \u2018eaten up by Karin\u2019. Besides I\u2026 want to go ahead and rethink my plans from here. It shouldn\u2019t be anything unnatural for a couple of Junior High School girls to go to a place like that, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CProbs. I\u2019ve never really been to a place like a fruit parlor, so\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. I haven\u2019t been either. But don\u2019t you think Voyager would like it? And with any luck K\u014Dy\u014D will be allowed to enter the store as well.\u201D</p><p>And so we made our way back towards the station, entering into the fruit parlor attached to the same building as a huge greengrocer. We could smell the delicious aroma coming from the shop as soon as we reached the storefront.</p><p>\u201CA flute parser?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t know what a fruit parlor is, do you? It\u2019s an English word though? Er, wait, maybe it\u2019s actually Wasei Eigo? In any case, it\u2019s a fruit-based dessert shop. And you\u2019ve been eating nothing but snacks since this morning\u2026\u201D</p><p>Just as expected, the spacious seating area was filled with women, as the male Servants who were present had read the room and made their physical forms disappear. There were also families, their children included, so our group didn\u2019t feel out of place being accompanied by Voyager.</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m really not good at going to places like this. I don\u2019t even like tropical fruits, but it\u2019s not bad to know that there are still such friendly and peaceful places around to experience.</p><p>(Be that as it may\u2026 there\u2019s still the usual initiation processes for a place like this\u2026)</p><p>Some of the Servants who were more well-informed, enough that they seemed to know my face, did not disguise their disgust as they gazed at me, though keeping their stares hidden from their Masters. A bad omen had appeared, and it was a question of what in the world it had come here for.</p><p>We had unconsciously made our way to the back-end of the restaurant in order to get away from the bustling crowd, and there, at the table across from ours, a pair of eye-catching female Servants sat facing one another in the midst of conversation.</p><p>\u201CAin\u2019t that Circe? No way, it\u2019s totally her right?\u201D Karin had recognized her right away. It was the woman who ran the live-broadcast at the Colosseum and the self-proclaimed Great Witch.</p><p>(Circe\u2026 she who lived on the island \xC6\xE6a in Greek mythology, and an exceedingly dangerous witch...)</p><p>Her legend is especially famous for the episode in which she turned a group of sailors into pigs, but the true threat comes from the knowledge she possesses\u2013 Her ability to manipulate and transform both matter and life, as well as the arts she uses to do so at will is power nearing the realm of True Magic. I couldn\u2019t tell you why they were selling her as some kind of groundbreakingly happy-go-lucky type character at the Colosseum\u2026.</p><p>And yet, that girl was not the slightest bit different from the image I had of her at that time, currently utterly immersed in her conversation as she rambled on and on. In contrast to her boisterous energy, her companion\u2019s reactions were rather weak, offering only slight nods in reply.</p><p>Said companion was wearing a dark colored robe like a haori, with the hood hung low over her eyes. A Servant from Greece or related to the general Mediterranean Sea, the same as Circe\u2026 at least that\u2019s what I was thinking, but she also had a peculiar atmosphere that made it so I could not say with certainty that\u2019s all there was to her.</p><p>(An unknown female Servant\u2026 and one who\u2019s totally unbothered in the face of that witch\u2026 who could it be\u2026?)</p><p>I leaned forward a bit in my chair to try and get a peek.</p><p>A ceramic-like pale complexion with a melancholy tone to it, alongside long unkempt wavy hair. She has a bigger stature than Circe\u2019s, though still fairly petite in size nevertheless. The embroidery on her robe seems to be geometrical patterns, but they aren\u2019t something I\u2019m familiar with so I can\u2019t identify a particular cultural sphere from which they originate.</p><p>(...Agh, I shouldn\u2019t have done that.)</p><p>Before I\u2019d even noticed she was staring right back. Peeking out from deep in the dark shading under her hood, a sharp pair of amber eyes was watching.</p><p>I had a hunch that she was offended by my prying eyes\u2026 or possibly even a Servant with knowledge of my unfavorable reputation, but that wasn\u2019t the case. The woman\u2019s gaze was focused upon the one sitting next to me with eyes sparkling at the sight of his grape parfait, Voyager.</p><p>After a bit Circe seemed to finally notice the situation, stopping her one-sided conversation and swinging around towards us.</p><p>\u201C--Are you listening to a word I\u2019m saying? Hm? Did you find a dessert that really catches your eye? You can order whatever you want, you\u2019re treating us both after all, so\u2026 Hey, wait a sec, where are you going!?\u201D</p><p>Without paying any mind to Circe\u2019s displeasure the woman made a start from her chair and moved to standing in front of our table instead.</p><p>A suspicion-filled Karin\u2019s words rang out \u201CSomething wicked this way comes\u2026\u201D</p><p>And, like a specimen in a museum, Voyager is examined with careful deliberation.</p><p>An unknown presence, one that creates a hanging atmosphere that contains both the feelings of awe in which a Heroic Spirit is naturally clad alongside a chilled fighting spirit different from the rest, and it causes me to feel a crawling under my skin. A bizarre sense of perfectly clear reasoning coexisting with confused, chaotic passion, the two sides not melting into one another.</p><p>(What in the world\u2026 is this the feeling of pure, distilled intimidation? Is this\u2026 the Majesty of a King\u2026?)</p><p>Within the past memories of Servants with whom I had crossed paths, that sensation seemed to be the closest one I could recall. Without even thinking, my body leaned forward as if to provide cover for Voyager, who was staring with a puzzled look.</p><p>With no regard for my movements, her mouth opened.</p><p>\u201C--You. You are, if my estimations ring true\u2026 You are the Servant Summoned twelve days ago, called in the middle of the night at Akihabara. That was you\u2026 am I correct?\u201D She asked in a detached voice that gently flowed, one faintly tinged with passion.</p><p>\u201CMhm. That\u2019s right\u2013 at Erice\u2019s call, I forged a contract.\u201D Voyager replied frankly and without any hesitation.</p><p>This is just an ordinary exchange, so why did it make my chest tighten?</p><p>\u201CVery well, then you shall become the final Servant\u2013 whether you aspire to such a thing, whether you do not aspire to such a thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe final Servant\u2026 is me, is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Mm.\u201D</p><p>At the end of that exchange the girl, with a sudden sense of self, seemed to realize what she had just done out of nowhere. She saw Voyager staring back at her as he marveled, as well as the dumbfounded amazement of Karin and I which had entered into her field of vision.</p><p>In that moment she hid her blushing cheeks, pulling her hood forward and shrinking into herself.</p><p>\u2014The girl\u2019s name was Euclides.</p><p>She had been introduced to us specifically as \u201C\u2018Euclides\u2019 of Alexandria\u201D by Circe.</p><p>It was the name of a celebrated mathematician and astronomer from the cultural sphere of BC era Greece. In English, the name is read as \u201CEuclid\u201D which, for the record, has become synonymous with Geometry itself. I think that if you were to list out the wise men who laid the foundations of our knowledge in ancient times, you could list Plato as a philosopher and Archimedes as a scientific engineer, you could then list Euclides among the mathematicians and not one person would be foolish enough to object.</p><p>It was rare enough to find a Servant who was a pure, genuine mathematician without any relation to tactics or strategy, but above all\u2013</p><p>(A Foreigner Class Servant! As far as I know, she\u2019s the only one in Mosaic City. And, once again, she\u2019s a girl\u2026)</p><p>There were few Foreigner Class Servants, and they were avoided as symbols of disaster that brought enormous suffering upon friend and foe alike in the last war. And Euclides, who was supposed to be a man as recorded in our history, is in fact a woman. Even that sort of discovery was buried in the midst of various other surprises.</p><p>After an invitation from Circe, now with spirits high, we ended up sitting alongside her.</p><p>\u201CNaturally, rumors of the \u2018Grim Reaper\u2019 going around hunting Servants down have reached my ears, but to think it\u2019d be a girl like yourself. Well, no need to worry here, I\u2019m totally harmless to both humans and animals, got it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho I hunt is\u2026 it\u2019s all depending on the orders of the Master.\u201D</p><p>Keeping my guard up I gave a cautious answer that caused Circe to respond with a \u201CSeems I got that right, hm?\u201D and a wry laugh. The massive order of desserts she called for were lined up on our table, steadily coming one by one.</p><p>\u201CCome on, it\u2019s okay to go and eat as many of the dishes as you\u2019d like, got it? Today is Euclides\u2019 treat after all!\u201D</p><p>\u201COoh, double lucky! Wait don\u2019t tell me, the commentator job you were working the other day\u2013 you decide to drop out all of a sudden or somethin\u2019 like that?\u201D Inquires Karin.</p><p>\u201CYep! That\u2019s just the thing! And I took the chance to call up this hiki homebody here on my way to Shinjuku.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2026 had a book I wanted to read. Though it is certainly true that there was something we needed to have a consultation about\u2026\u201D</p><p>Euclides had been entirely unaware of the Grim Reaper side of me. And yet, somehow, what she did know about was Voyager\u2019s existence.</p><p>\u201CWhen you call him \u2018The Final Servant\u2019, what does that mean\u2026?\u201D Wanting to know the true meaning behind her prophetic words from earlier, I forge straight ahead and ask her about it.</p><p>\u201CYour group is\u2026 You are middle school students, are you not? What happened to school? I don\u2019t find skipping to be praiseworthy.\u201D</p><p>Upon being called out straight to our faces, both Karin and I cringe with a jolt before shrugging our shoulders. At the same time, in comes Voyager with a far too candid follow-up. I mean seriously, he really held nothing back.</p><p>\u201CErice, she, you know, really hates school.\u201D</p><p>No way, I don\u2019t hate studying and stuff at all.</p><p>But it was too late, the woman\u2019s eyebrows had furrowed and she had drawn away from us in shock. Her lips were trembling.</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026? That sort of thing is\u2026 Not very Euclidean of you\u2026\u201D</p><p>I thought I was about to get reprimanded by some stranger in a place like this, but instead the reverse came true as the girl suddenly became crestfallen and dropped into a depression. Not only that, she was even timidly pushing strawberries around with her fork.</p><p>\u201COoooi! Won\u2019t you come on back to us, Eucie!? I\u2019m talking to YOU Euclides! You\u2019re not feeling like this is your fault, are you? The education system has totally sunk to terrible lows though, right!?\u201D</p><p>Circe gleefully cheers her on as if this were someone else\u2019s problem.</p><p>One way or another, Euclides ends up regaining her composure and turning to face Voyager.</p><p>\u201CYour True Name is \u2018Voyager\u2019, is it not? Allow me to give a tentative self-introduction of my own\u2013\u201D With her hood down Euclides reveals to us a clear view of her self, one that has the appearance of a young lady while still giving off an exceedingly mature look. Her physique is fairly slim and her eyes contain an expression of wickedness, giving the impression that she is in a horrendous mood at all hours on the clock. \u201CI am Euclides. A Servant that descends from beyond, a Foreigner. There is a library in Tama at which I have taken to occupying the role of custodian, on occasion. I wonder if you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps? \u2018Alexandria\u2019. While, yes, the name of my old home, that name has also been taken by the largest library in Mosaic City. It is there that I help to edit teaching materials and textbooks, while also providing consultation services to the patrons welcomed within our halls.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2026 In regards to the library, I think I know it. The building with the statue of the King of Conquerors, Iskandar, right? And what of the Masters of both of you, where are they today?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe is an elementary school teacher. As such, he has to teach classes. That is why during the day we usually conduct our movement separately, doing various things. Today, since I secured his permission, he gave me the ability to come this far alone with Independent Action.\u201D</p><p>That would mean they were consuming some percentage of their Command Spells in order to move about in remote locations.</p><p>Tama is a residential district that carries the left-over atmosphere of a Pre-War commuter town, a vast town rich with nature, abundant with average citizens and students. On the other hand Circe, whose homebase should be in Akihabara, says:</p><p>\u201CA shop owner\u2013 My Master came here to Shinjuku with me, got it? Isn\u2019t that a bit of a separate matter?\u201D</p><p>With that simple explanation given she urges Euclides to continue, and in response The Great Mathematician munches on a half of a strawberry before swallowing it down and continuing the conversation.</p><p>\u201CSome days ago, I was approached by medical personnel, an obstetrician, seeking a consultation with me. In recent days there has been a series of cases in which newborn babies born within Mosaic City have had the Servant that was supposed to be Summoned alongside their birth, for some reason, fail to materialize.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...So that\u2019s it. Well then, I understand. Since the time of Mosaic City\u2019s establishment, such medical cases have had a certain rate of occurring. However, you\u2019re talking about how there has been a rapid increase in the last few weeks. It\u2019s not become a major problem yet, but from a statistical standpoint the situation is an abnormality. There\u2019s also\u2013\u201D I already had an idea of where this conversation was leading us. That is because, since the very beginning of my work as a Nightwatch I\u2026 I personally have been nothing less than a person of interest in this incident. \u201CNot a single instance has been reported\u2013 of a return from Servant Loss.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Mhm.\u201D She nodded, her gloomy face dulling as it shadowed even deeper. \u201CCirce and I have been researching the source of the matter. We have yet to reach any conclusions though\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026 you all were at that place too. Within the Colosseum.\u201D</p><p>\u201CErice, you have to explain to me now.\u201D Voyager says urgently.</p><p>Karin as well seemed to have figured out the severity of the ongoing situation, holding the tip of her finger to her mouth in quiet contemplation. I\u2019d come all this way just to take a chance to relax, I can\u2019t believe it turned to this sort of conversation.</p><p>\u201C...I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve interrupted your story.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou seem to be rather knowledgeable. It\u2019s fine. You exposit the details to him.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight\u2013 Listen well, Voyager. Servant Loss is, quite literally, the loss of one\u2019s Servant. In the incident at the Colosseum there were countless Masters who lost their Servants. There was an unusually massive amount of Servant Loss that occurred.\u201D</p><p>\u201C....That\u2019s right. Lots of people\u2026 died.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah\u2026 But you know what? If you\u2019re inside this Mosaic City, a Servant will be Summoned again. Though it\u2019s unlikely that an identical Servant to the one from before will be Re-Summoned. But even so a Servant will be Summoned again. The period of time for the Re-Summoning is different from person to person too. For some people it happens the very next day, for others not until after an entire year.</p><p>\u2013And for some people, it finally happens after fourteen years.</p><p>Circe took over the explanation from there.</p><p>\u201C...So, I even personally investigated things using my tournament connections, and you know what? In the whooole time following the incident, not a single case of a Re-Summoning has been reported. That means those guys\u2019 Loss Status is continuing even as we speak.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s\u2026 weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMhm. Weird indeed.\u201D Euclides adds. \u201CFirst of all, in terms of statistical probability based on population size, it is simply not possible. If we are to additionally take into account the circumstances surrounding the newborns, the situation could only mean one thing\u2013 To make plain what I mean, starting from some fixed point in time Servants are no longer able to be Summoned within this Mosaic City. Such a line of thinking is merely natural.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...And that\u2019s why\u2026 I\u2019m the final one?\u201D</p><p>(Voyager, the Final Servant\u2026?)</p><p>The \u201Ctwelve days ago\u201D Euclides mentioned must reference the night in which I battled Kundry to a crushing defeat, the night when Voyager materialized before me. It was unthinkable that in that time, with hundreds of thousands of citizens in Mosaic City, not a single Servant had been Summoned. And there was still something I was questioning.</p><p>\u201C--The fact that he and I had signed a contract. Did you know about it?\u201D</p><p>When I direct the question towards Circe, the Falcon Witch responds by curtly shaking her head and pointing at the gloomy mathematician sitting at her side.</p><p>\u201CIt was my intuition. Merely intuition. I thought that you, the Servant from that problem, I thought, that was you, right? Aggh\u2013 no, I don\u2019t wanna\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 so non-Euclidean\u2026 I\xE4i\xE4\u2026 vulgtmm\u2026 vugtlagln\u2026\u201D</p><p>Seemingly unable to consent to her own actions, the girl suddenly buried her head in her hands and brought it down onto the table in prostration while grumbling and muttering strange phrases.</p><p>\u201CWhat, this again? Teehee, come ooon, intuition is really important ya know! Not to mention you, boy, I know just how special you are ya hear me? I don\u2019t sense any magical power belonging to one of the known Classes coming from you. And the Foreigner is a pretty special class itself. Don\u2019t you think that maybe there\u2019s something that draws you two together as fellow non-standards of the Holy Grail War?</p><p>\u201CThat must be it! Great work always comes from a witch, right!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am THE Great Witch, you know? Alright come on, go on and praise me more!\u201D</p><p>Karin nods with admiration and Circe breaks into a broad smile. She has a point and yet I feel like\u2026</p><p>I feel like we\u2019re being pushed around by the witch\u2019s sophistry</p><p>In any case, even the Heroic Spirit of a mathematician is still a Servant in the end, still a Magical existence; and as such they are not an existence unrelated to thoughts outside those of logic and reason.</p><p>\u201CRight, right! And while we\u2019re at it, how about this Great Witch bestows upon that young Servant a brand new Class name\u2013 I\u2019ve decided! \u2018Voyager\u2019! How\u2019s that!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That\u2019s good. Really good. Thank you.\u201D Voyager says so with a smile.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t mention it! Ehehe!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that\u2019s the EXACT same isn\u2019t it?\u201D I had a premonition that if this were left unchecked it would continue to derail things infinitely. I turned to Euclides, who was hanging her head with teary eyes. \u201CDid you report this information? Miss Euclides?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI did. I reported it to the City Management AI of Tama, Caren Gotou, as well as to the City Management AI of Shinjuku, Caren Himuro to be doubly safe. Because it\u2019s so important. Because it\u2019s an anomaly happening throughout the entirety of Mosaic City.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight\u2026 got it. Thanks for that.\u201D</p><p>Although, Himuro had nothing to say about such an abnormal disaster when we spoke.</p><p>It has not yet reached the point of actual harm, after all. If she was intentionally withholding information, it instead makes me understand just how real the severity of the situation is.</p><p>As I am now, even with the information I wouldn\u2019t be able to take the first step towards a method of dealing with the matter.</p><p>Seeing that there were now few customers within the store, Karin took the chance to call for K\u014Dy\u014D, but she did not materialize.</p><p>Karin had even specifically told the customers in our surrounding area \u201CIn a sec something big\u2019s gonna materialize, sorry for the bother\u201D to get their consent set for K\u014Dy\u014D\u2019s appearance, and yet she still did not show her form. It would have been nice if even just the tip of her snout appeared to get a taste of some of the fruit but, nothing.</p><p>The conversation flowed back towards the topic of Masters, causing Circe to beam with pride as she spoke.</p><p>\u201CMy Master is a particularly skilled chef, you know? The chain known as \u2018Kykeon Stock \xC6\xE6a\u2019? That\u2019s our chain of stores. As of now, my Master is the owner. I\u2019m the co-proprietor. You can find one anywhere in Mosaic City! Teehee! In Akihabara we even had TWO stores, \u2018Kykeon Stock Akihabara\u2019 and \u2018Kykeon Stock Colosseum\u2019, but well\u2026 it\u2019s unfortunate, but the Colosseum seems to have been closed indefinitely, yeah? Therefore, it has been our decision to reassign the staff. And as such, today we\u2019re here to inspect this block\u2019s location, \u2018Kykeon Stock Tsunohazu\u2019.\u201D</p><p>\u2026Now I understand. That means she likely chose this famous fruit parlor as their meeting place so she could study and observe one of their rival stores. I had been thinking she was just a witch that only cared for lazing about and indulging in pleasure, but in reality she\u2019s rather business minded.</p><p>The witch, who had spoken everything all at once, suddenly changed, her face abruptly turning to a more gloomfilled one. She still wore a smile on her face, though she looked at me with a tinge of loneliness.</p><p>\u201CYou said your name is Utsumi Erice, correct? Let me thank you. You fought for us. Risked your life to save the audience gathered at the Colosseum.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2026 I didn\u2019t do anything a person should want to praise me for. During that incident, I failed. Not a single thing went well.\u201D</p><p>I am the Grim Reaper\u2013 and completing the duties of the Grim Reaper is something done without the praise or admiration of others. But even so, Circe never ceased her gentle smile.</p><p>It was as if she was looking at an unworthy disciple, a smile filled with understanding, acceptance, and affection.</p><p>\u201CNono, look here\u2013 I couldn\u2019t do a damn thing, you know? I was only trying to get my own Master out of that hellish place, and that alone took everything I had.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAn admirable thing to do.\u201D</p><p>\u201CErrgh, I wonder about that\u2026 I know I didn\u2019t do super good at it\u2026\u201D She leans back in her chair while deprecating herself. She fiddles with her, which is done in a Taisho style allowing two braids to hang in front of her chest. The gesture of a maiden. \u201CYou know, my Master has been waiting this whole time. She parted with her beloved during the Pre-War period, but she still carries the belief he\u2019ll come home to her. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been waiting the whooole time for the day he will finally arrive in Mosaic City, waiting a whole fourteen years.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA Holy Grail War Refugee\u2026 I presume?\u201D</p><p>She nods with an \u201Cmhm\u201D.</p><p>Those who lived in the neighborhoods of the metropolis in the Pre-War times are not the only peoples among the citizens of Mosaic City.</p><p>The number of refugees who had been forced to roam the lands in order to avoid both the catastrophes brought on by the World Holy Grail War and the natural disasters that occurred was not a small one, and those who wandered were eventually welcomed into Mosaic City in the Post-War period. At the misfortune of those refugees, Mosaic City eventually ceased to accept such peoples. Mosaic City hardly receives refugees these days, save for in exceedingly rare cases like that of the \u2018Wandering Jew\u2019.</p><p>\u201CAnd so that girl goes all over the city: every day, every week, every month, all in search of her lover. I even tried to tell her that, should a visitor come from outside of the city, the Caren Series could surely tell her about them. But she just wouldn\u2019t listen to me, you know? And now we\u2019ve started this expanding chain of stores to see if they could help in her search, even if just a little bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that\u2019s what that stuff is\u2026 I really figured it was just one of your hobbies.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm? Naturally, it\u2019s a hobby too!\u201D</p><p>Without any hesitation the witch replies to Karin, her demeanor changing to one that\u2019s both bright and carefree, before humming out the tune from the Kykeon Shop commercials.</p><p>\u201C--Hmm, I see, so your little group is planning to go to Fuyuki is it?\u201D</p><p>We made the decision to share our goal with Circe, a choice we did not make lightly, and yet even so Circe\u2019s reaction was one that seemed to readily accept it. Euclides remained with nothing to say on the matter.</p><p>Were they underestimating the reality of how impossible it is to get there? Or perhaps, as would befit a Servant of Mosaic City, they were fundamentally uninterested in a future that was unlikely to cross paths with that of their Masters\u2019?</p><p>\u201CVoyager, a little guy like you is a ship that can conquer the sea of the stars, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYep. I\u2019m\u2026 a ship.\u201D He puffs his chest with pride.</p><p>Now that he\u2019s wearing those goggles he looks more like a little pilot than a ship.</p><p>Voyager, Pioneer, Challenger, Enterprise\u2013 These machines that set their sights towards the universe are a mish-mash of aluminum alloys and electronic equipment, entrusted with the indomitable spirit of adventure by humanity and the descendants of the seafaring vessels from the Age of Exploration.</p><p>\u201C--Very well, then you are fit for the task. As a show of thanks for the work you did with your captain in the Colosseum, I shall bestow upon you a piece of advice! It\u2019s the least I could do, really. Normally when you beg a witch for advice you must pay their price with your very life but\u2026 You have already paid that price, Grim Reaper.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAdd vice? Oh, you mean a hint, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s just the thing, little Voyager!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Thank you very much, Circe the Witch.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTHE GREAT Witch!\u201D</p><p>I thought it would be best to respectfully accept her favor.</p><p>Among the Servants in Mosaic City, there are those who feel ashamed of the fact that they cannot use their power as they wish due to the limited Magical Energy they receive as a result of their Summoning here.</p><p>Be that as it may, the wisdom of the witch gifted to the valorous Odysseus upon his departure from \xC6\xE6a has the same merit as the myth itself.</p><p>\u2013And, in conclusion, we heard some momentous things from Circe the Witch.</p><p>While it was not something directly connected to Fuyuki, it was still a conversation with relation to our enemy. I was certain I\u2019d be citing what we heard again to Voyager and Karin, who had yet to fully digest the contents of the conversation.</p><p>As we made our departure from the fruit parlor the witch tossed a harmless question my way.</p><p>\u201COh Erice, by the by? Did the person who named you happen to be someone fluent in the Greek language?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Eh? Not that I\u2019m aware. If I had to say, they probably had more of a preference for French literature.\u201D</p><p>Who exactly the person that named me was is something that I could not say for certain. Even so, at the time I answered as if I knew. In my parents\u2019 home there were quite a few Western books that had been left behind by my father. In addition to books written in English, there were a lot of different books written in French as well. Among the French literature was The Little Prince by Exup\xE9ry.</p><p>\u201CAh, I see. That\u2019s alright then.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Is there something you noticed?\u201D</p><p>I had no choice but to go along with the conversation. I hadn\u2019t planned on doing so, but I had become acutely aware of a curiosity welling in my heart.</p><p>\u201COh, it\u2019s nothing all that important but\u2013 Well, the sound of the word \u2018Erice\u2019 brings to mind the land of the dead in which heroes spend their afterlife. In Japanese they call it \u2018Eriyusion\u2019, but if you wanted to call it by its proper name you would say \u2018Elysium\u2019. I just find it a little ironic that you, with a name like that, are the \u2018Grim Reaper\u2019 of this city.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...It is a common name.\u201D At this point, Euclides hesitantly added her voice to the conversation. \u201C...In the French language \u2018\xC9lys\xE9e\u2019 carries the meaning of \u2018Elysium\u2019. The famous avenue in France is known as \u2018Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es\u2019, is it not? And the \u2018Jardin des Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es\u2019 is the paradise to which the spirits of those slain in war return after passing through the Arc de Triomphe. If you want the details, ask Bonaparte about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd that is the wisdom of a bookworm. You even know a lot about stuff outside your area of expertise, don\u2019t you now? Don\u2019t you think you should ask to be the commentator next time when the Tournament reopens?</p><p>\u201CBwegh\u2026 That wouldn\u2019t be very Euclidean\u2026\u201D</p><p>A smiling Circe giggles with a \u2018Teehee!\u2019 before adding a conclusion to the conversation.</p><p>\u201CIn Fuyuki that girl was\u2026 I heard that Medea had been summoned there. Well, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already long dead or returned to the Throne of Heroes, right? But if you DO see her, be sure to give her my best regards.\u201D</p><p>\u2026I will. Even if that person were to be an enemy of mine.</p><p>Because it\u2019s so frustrating when you can\u2019t see the people you want to see. Because it becomes too much to bear.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZWVIqGU.jpeg" alt=""></p>', 1429);
