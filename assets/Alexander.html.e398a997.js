His spear, his chariot, his body...the strongest is the only word to describe them!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I love it all. My tutor, Aristotle, gave me a copy of the Iliad a while ago\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (A while ago?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foufou.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Oh, no, no. In life, I mean.<br> In this form, I sometimes get it wrong.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you know this, but I love the Iliad and its heroes.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> You want to read it, Master? It&#39;s great! It&#39;s like an exquisite fruit, you never get tired of it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Someday when I go to battle,<br> I want to keep it with me at all times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Someday?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foufou?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Oh, oops. I got it wrong again.<br> Haha, sorry. It just all seems so strange.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> My personality and emotions from when I was young are very strong in this form. Somehow, my memories are being influenced as well.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I need to watch out for that, huh?<br> So, how about it\u2014Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The hero of the Iliad, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Achilles, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. The hero Achilles, the protagonist of the Iliad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One of Ancient Greece&#39;s greatest heroes.<br> But now\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I heard what you were saying, and unfortunately...<br> We haven&#39;t been able to summon him.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t, huh?<br> Well, that&#39;s even better!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? How is it even better?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Oh, I see. Even as his younger self, he still has a heart for adventure? I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Doctor!<br> Now we get to go look for him!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go in search of the great hero!<br> There was an era where you saw the Argo, right?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> If we go there, we might be able to find him.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Do you remember?<br> When I met you in ancient Rome\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. Your presence there seemed to guide other Heroic Spirits too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t analyze the data in real time then, but you&#39;re right. That big Berserker is your...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> My rival...or someone destined to be.<br> That&#39;s what I think now.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Yes, Darius III.<br> He was brought there by a \u201Cchained summoning.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, it makes sense.<br> Even with the Singularity repaired\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It might still be possible to chain summon in the Age of Exploration!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s settled!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master.<br> But the Third Singularity is\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Okay Doctor, get ready!<br> We&#39;re off in search of the hero of the Iliad!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> ???<br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> What? What is...this? This thing in front of me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I thought so...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> What is this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s gotten into him?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s looking in shock at the sea.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right\u2013 The sea has a special meaning to him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okeanos, the end of the world. What he would eventually seek later in life. The limits of his territory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that all his conquests in his later years were to bring him to Okeanos\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seeing the ocean should be a special thing for him...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s like there&#39;s a haze over it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I can&#39;t see it, or hear it.<br> Hey, what&#39;s that&#39;s over there?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> What can you hear?<br> I can&#39;t really hear anything.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I can see the land, and I can hear your voices, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe young Alexander is unconsciously choosing not to see it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He can&#39;t see or hear it, huh? Maybe Iskandar the conqueror would have wanted to\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But this young Alexander might not want to see it yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2013How romantic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of sad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. And very like him at the same time.</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know.<br> Maybe I should head over there with Bucephalus?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foufou!<br> ...Kyuu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, that&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine. Sorry. It was a joke.<br> Anyway, guys, looks like we have company.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right... A group of humans is approaching.<br> I&#39;m not detecting any trace of magical energy from them.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> They&#39;re... You know... Burglars or bandits...?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Who are ye callin&#39; bandits?<br> We&#39;re pirates! Real live pirates!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We just stopped here to resupply, and it&#39;s our lucky day! A pretty lady and a rich little brat!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Ransom &#39;em for all they&#39;re worth!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, men! With our skill and pride\u2014<br> It&#39;s super-plunderin&#39; time!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Aye aye! Let&#39;s finish this quick so we don&#39;t have to work overtime\u2013!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hahaha, you guys are hard workers, huh?<br> But you shouldn&#39;t mix up work and hobbies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, just think of them as a type of bandit!<br> Senpai, enemy group approaching!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare for combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re human, so don&#39;t kill them!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!<br> \u2013Commencing combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> No way\u2014!? He&#39;s seriously ripped for being a brat!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> H-he&#39;s like a bodybuilder... We are no match for him! Run... Run away!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Uwah\u2013!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Not a scrap of talent among you. Alright, run.<br> I won&#39;t kill you!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> If you run, it&#39;s because you&#39;re weak!<br> A true plunderer leaves with a victory song!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the future King of Conquerors for you.<br> He&#39;s very wild.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yup, very wild.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not many boys could say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s wild.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yup, I think so too. I see, the future King of Conquerors, huh\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I heard a kid just beat up some veteran pirates, and since I was sponging off of them I came to check it out.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But it looks like you&#39;re not an ordinary kid.<br> Interesting. And that book you&#39;ve got\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> What about the Iliad?<br> It&#39;s my favorite book.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> And who are you? You look \u201Cstronger\u201D than the others.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> ...May I have your name?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wait, you don&#39;t know who I am?<br> I guess that&#39;d be hard without my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou! Fou??</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Alexander, he is\u2014</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I know. He&#39;s a Servant.<br> So what&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re not gonna introduce yourself? You ask my name and you won&#39;t even give me yours? That&#39;s rather rude.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I apologize.<br> My name is Alexander.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I&#39;m the future King of Conquerors. Not that it seems real to me. This form is from before that.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Alexander, huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Man, I bet that lightning geezer would like that name.<br> It&#39;s a pain, but I&#39;ll remember it anyway.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My name&#39;s \u201CAchilles.\u201D The Greek warrior written of in that book. You know that name, right?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> !!! It&#39;s you! You&#39;re Achilles!<br> Oh, I can&#39;t believe this. I\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I found you so quickly! Mash, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is he getting excited?</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I can&#39;t hold back my excitement!<br> Haha, I&#39;m sorry, but this is so wonderful!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Even now, I feel an overwhelming desire to\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Fight him!<br> It&#39;s okay, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I thought you&#39;d say that.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I know a fighter by their smell.<br> Both you and I are the same type of punk.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> But\u2014Nah, I&#39;m really sorry.<br> I&#39;m just a freeloader, I mean, mentor now.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> I wanted to try copying Chiron for once...<br> And so I&#39;ve been looking after them.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> So I won&#39;t fight you.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> My job isn&#39;t to defeat you, it&#39;s to let these guys beat you.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Sir! Sir Spikey!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> You&#39;d really do that? For a bunch of no-name losers like us with zero attention span!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Did you hear that, men! No running! Gather up, Gather up! Let&#39;s show our teacher what we can do!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Let&#39;s use the Achilles-style technique,<br> \u201CGang up on a lone guy and beat him up.\u201D</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> AKA, \u201CWhat to do if you see a Lancer with an unkempt beard!\u201D Now is the time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think we just heard a name for a tactic that we can never let Hektor hear, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Feeling better, you losers?<br> Okay, now go get your butts kicked!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye aye, sir! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, there&#39;s no stopping them!<br> Resuming battle!!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. If a leader makes them stronger, that makes me happy.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I just have to defeat them all, right? Once the students are gone, the teacher will be out of work.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> And after that\u2014<br> We can fight, Achilles!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> So you don&#39;t even think the pirates have a chance, huh? You&#39;re pretty cruel, kid! Wahahaha!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Impressive. I&#39;m not a big fan of kings,<br> but you, I think I like.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> And that horse, too\u2014<br> It&#39;s splendid. Truly excellent.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Actually, I think there are no bad Riders.<br> That&#39;s my theory, anyway.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hah, hah... I agree, but I didn&#39;t think...<br> You&#39;d have this much talent as a general!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> The pirates&#39; tactics were as messed up as Elisabeth&#39;s singing, and you brought them together...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Fighting with soldiers, not just one on one...is so much fun!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Someday I&#39;ll learn this feeling for myself, although really I should already know it. But I think...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I want to... I want to fight you more. I want to share this excitement, and the honor of the battlefield...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> With more...people...someday...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Alexander\u2013?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> ...Zzzz.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He has the magical energy to keep going, but I guess he&#39;s just exhausted. He fell asleep.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> ...Wow, we just saw something amazing...<br> I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re still alive...</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> The world&#39;s big... It&#39;s too big...</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> There&#39;s flying horses that summon lightning and stuff...<br> I think I&#39;m reevaluating my life!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Yup, I can&#39;t do this!<br> Being a pirate on seas like this is suicide!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We&#39;re better off landlocked!<br> Teacher, we&#39;re getting out of the pirate business!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We&#39;ll pay the lesson fees later! Bye!</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> H-Huh? Later? If you guys go on land you&#39;ll be arrested and thrown in prison...</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Well, whatever. Take care, idiots!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Combat has concluded. No wounded on our side, and no casualties among theirs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was a fun fight, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is a different kind of fight altogether.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Alexander&#39;s charge on horseback and the way Achilles rallied the pirates were both amazing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The pirates that seemed so dangerous at first...<br> They were completely taken aback by it.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> \u2013Now then.<br> You guys fought hard too.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Good work. You&#39;re that kid&#39;s guardian, right?<br> I bet he gets you in all kinds of trouble.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> One day, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be a great king somewhere.<br> Until then, just keep an eye on him.</p><p><strong>Achilles:</strong><br> Right now he&#39;s just a little brat.<br> Man, look at his sleeping face.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> ...Zzzz.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yeah. He looks really happy, doesn&#39;t he Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No matter how cheerful he may seem, his actions and beliefs are filled with power. I can feel it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Even if that path is filled with turmoil and chaos.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The men he commands will probably lead happy lives.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Their lives will be busy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be hard for those around him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou.</p>', 197);
