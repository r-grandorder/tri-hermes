What some of you may not be familiar with though exactly what some of these Class Skills do...and I really wouldn\u2019t blame you!<br> Fate\u2019s writing is already pretty purple-prosey, but then this is compounded by the lack of officially translated materials.</p><p>This means that since translations keep being done by multiple people, four translations of the same thing can all end up sounding different!<br> And this isn\u2019t very fun to deal with when you\u2019re trying to create within these guidelines.</p><p>So, some time ago, I made a little personal list of all the Class Skills and the descriptions I wrote for them, as succinct and understandable as I could get without oversimplifying.<br> Now I\u2019m sharing it with you! With all that out of the way, below you will find:</p><ul><li>Descriptions of Class Skills held by the seven standard Servant classes.</li><li>Descriptions of Class Skills held by the handful of non-standard classes.</li><li>Descriptions of Class Skills held by Beasts (which are not Servants, don\u2019t listen to the T-M wiki on this I swear to g\u2014)</li></ul><p>What you will not find would be:</p>', 9);

They are practically invincible by the standards of modern magi.<br> [B]: It cancels spells with a chant below three verses, leaving it difficult for the holder to be affected by most magecraft, even if targeted by High Magecraft or Greater Rituals.<br> [C]: It cancels spells with a chant below two verses, but cannot defend against magecraft on the level of High Magecraft or Greater Rituals.<br> [D]: Only enough to cancel Single-Action spells.<br> [E]: Such an abysmal rank can\u2019t actually cancel spells at all, but it does somewhat reduce magical damage.</p><h2 id="independent-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#independent-action" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Independent Action</h2><p>A Skill of the [Archer, Faker] class, the ability to function without a Master&#39;s support.<br> [EX]: One\u2019s existence is almost similar to a human\u2019s at this rank, as they don\u2019t face resistance from the World or require magical energy to manifest.<br> [A+]: A Master is almost completely unnecessary. Even if the Holy Grail War has ended, the holder is able to maintain themselves for a potentially indefinite amount of time.<br> [A]: The holder is able to take action by themselves and survive for a week without a Master, but they\u2019d still require backup to use their Noble Phantasm.<br> [B]: So long as the holder conserves their magical energy, they\u2019re able to survive for around two days without a Master.<br> [C]: Without a Master\u2019s support, the holder can only survive for a day on their own.<br> [E-]: It\u2019s impossible for one of this rank to act on their own, so they\u2019re only able to stick around for half an hour.</p><h2 id="riding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#riding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Riding</h2><p>A Skill of the [Saber, Rider, Shielder] class, one&#39;s ability to handle mounts and vehicles.<br> [EX]: At this rank, one can ride pretty much anything.<br> [A+]: Even Phantasmal and Divine Beasts can be handled as mounts. This doesn\u2019t apply to dragonkind though.<br> [A]: Almost anything at all can be handled, excluding Phantasmal or Divine Beasts.<br> [B]: Most mounts and vehicles can be handled with above average Skill, including ones that didn\u2019t even exist during the holder\u2019s lifetime. They still can\u2019t handle the likes of a Phantasmal Species though.<br> [C]: Most normal mounts and vehicles can be handled with average skill.<br> [E]: A rank indicative of one\u2019s utter inexperience with all manner of mounts.</p><h2 id="territory-creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#territory-creation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Territory Creation</h2><p>A Skill of the [Caster] class, the ability to build a personal domain that collects mana from the land.<br> [EX]: No matter where they are, the holder is able to set up an impressive and completely unique kind of territory all on their own.<br> [A+]: An impressive rank denoting that one can quickly set up a specialized territory of considerable quality.<br> [A]: One can build a \u201Ctemple,\u201D a large structure that is vastly superior to a normal magus\u2019 workshop.<br> [B]: A \u201Cworkshop\u201D is an absolute necessity for any self-respecting magus, and it\u2019s at this rank that one can be built.<br> [C]: Creating something the size of an average workshop isn\u2019t easy, but a smaller, more personal domain is still possible.<br> [D]: Only a very small area can become one\u2019s territory.</p><h2 id="item-construction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#item-construction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Item Construction</h2><p>A Skill of the [Caster] class, one&#39;s ability to create objects both magical and mundane in nature<br> [EX]: Having it at this rank either means that one is able to create a truly vast amount of items, or that they\u2019re able to create one type of item with extraordinary quality.<br> [A]: The holder is able to manufacture a wide array of objects\u2014perhaps even something as extravagant as a potion of limited immortality.<br> [B+]: Though the quality of one\u2019s works are impressive, their variety is limited.<br> [B]: Various tools and objects are among the holder\u2019s specialties.<br> [C]: The holder is really only able to create one or two kinds of items.</p><h2 id="presence-concealment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#presence-concealment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Presence Concealment</h2><p>A Skill of the [Assassin] class, the ability to hide oneself.<br> [EX]: Seeing an existence on this level is virtually impossible\u2014and if you do, it\u2019s likely too late.<br> [A+]: Even other Servants will have trouble detecting the holder, as they\u2019re able to become almost completely imperceptible. Taking offensive action still drops it considerably.<br> [A]: One is able to hide themselves well enough to be nearly undetectable, but even so, its rank will still fall if the holder makes a hostile move.<br> [B]: It\u2019s extremely difficult for the holder to be detected once they\u2019ve disappeared. Its rank decreases if one attempts an attack.<br> [C]: Even if one\u2019s hidden themselves the best that they can, this is a rank that\u2019s really only suitable for spying, as an attack would be extremely obvious.<br> [D]: A rank unbecoming of an Assassin, as though it\u2019s still barely suitable for spying, an enemy Servant could infer their presence almost immediately.</p><h2 id="mad-enhancement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mad-enhancement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Mad Enhancement</h2><p>A Skill of the [Berserker] class, increasing one&#39;s parameters in exchange for their sanity.<br> [EX]: Though one\u2019s parameters are increased, they possess a uniquely volatile and strange state of mind.<br> [A+]: All parameters are increased, but every shred of what could be called a \u201Cnormal\u201D mind has been lost.<br> [A]: All parameters are increased, but almost all of one\u2019s reason has been robbed from them.<br> [B]: All parameters are increased, but most of the holder\u2019s sanity has been taken away.<br> [C]: All parameters except Magic and Luck are increased, but their sanity is skewed.<br> [D]: Strength and Endurance are increased, but one\u2019s ability to think clearly is hazy and imperfect.<br> [E]: While one\u2019s parameters are left as-is, so is their natural sanity. Some might still have a particular \u201Ctrigger,\u201D however.<br> [E-]: The holder\u2019s sanity is left completely intact, but of course, this also means they don\u2019t receive any parameter increases whatsoever.</p><h2 id="territory-defense" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#territory-defense" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Territory Defense</h2><p>A Skill of the [Shielder] class, reducing the damage done to allies within a certain range of the holder.<br> [C]: Though one&#39;s allies have their defense increased, the user isn&#39;t included in that boost.</p><h2 id="true-name-discernment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#true-name-discernment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> True Name Discernment</h2><p>A Skill of the [Ruler] class, sight that automatically reveals the status information of other Servants. A Luck check is necessary to bypass abilities that conceal such things, however. <strong>There\u2019s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes how much information the Ruler sees.</strong><br> [B]: Jeanne, Amakusa<br> [C]: Karl</p><h2 id="divine-judgement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#divine-judgement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Divine Judgement</h2><p>A Skill of the [Ruler] class, the privilege to use Command Seals against other Servants. In a Grail War, the summoned Ruler is granted two Command Seals per each participating Servant. <strong>There\u2019s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes the strength of the Ruler\u2019s commands.</strong><br> [A]: Jeanne<br> [B]: Karl<br> [C]: Amakusa<br> [\u2014]: Amakusa during Apocrypha. None of the Command Seals he was given were valid for the current Holy Grail War, so this Skill was useless.</p><h2 id="avenger" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#avenger" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Avenger</h2><p>A Skill of the [Avenger] class, the existence of an Anti-Hero who converts the hatred and resentment others feel towards them into a temporary power increase. <strong>There\u2019s no information regarding what different ranks give, but I assume it denotes how much one\u2019s power is able to increase, and the speed at which it does so.</strong><br> [EX]: Space Ishtar<br> [A]: Angra, Alcides, Dantes, Lobo<br> [B]: Jalter, Gorgon, Castor<br> [C]: Salieri</p><h2 id="oblivion-correction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#oblivion-correction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Oblivion Correction</h2><p>A Skill of the [Avenger] class, the constant state of one who will never forget the wrongs they&#39;ve suffered. <strong>There\u2019s no information regarding what different ranks give, but as its function is to \u201Cincrease critical hit effectiveness,\u201D I assume the rank denotes how strongly it does so.</strong><br> [A]: Jalter, Angra<br> [B]: Dantes, Lobo, Salieri<br> [C]: Gorgon, Castor</p><h2 id="self-replenishment-mana" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#self-replenishment-mana" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Self-Replenishment (Mana)</h2><p>A Skill of the [Avenger] class, a need for retribution that causes one&#39;s magical energy to endlessly surge forth.<br> [A+]: Jalter. The amount of magical energy is higher than it normally would be, because she\u2019s been spawned by a wish on the Holy Grail.<br> [A]: Gorgon<br> [B]: Lobo<br> [C]: Salieri, Maou<br> [D]: Dantes, Castor<br> [E]: Angra. Recovers only a miniscule amount of energy every minute.</p><h2 id="counter-hero" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#counter-hero" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Counter Hero</h2><p>A Skill of the [Savior] class, causing parameter reductions in Heroic Spirits who face te holder in combat. However, it isn&#39;t as effective on Anti-Heroes.<br> [B]: Reduces the parameters of enemy Heroic Spirts by two ranks, and reduces the parameters of Anti-Heroes by one rank.</p><h2 id="camouflage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#camouflage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Camouflage</h2><p>A Skill of the [Faker] class, allowing one to disguise their status information.<br> [B]: Iskandar\u2019s Shadow. At this rank, one\u2019s class and parameters can be obfuscated.</p><h2 id="territory-infringement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#territory-infringement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Territory Infringement</h2><p>A Skill of the [Watcher] class, allowing one&#39;s prying eyes to bypass the magical barriers and territories established to keep others out. <strong>DISCLAIMER! Though this is based on what we\u2019ve seen Watcher do in SF combined with what the name itself implies, Territory Infringement lacks a proper description.</strong><br> [A]: Watcher</p><h2 id="entity-of-the-outer-realm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#entity-of-the-outer-realm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Entity of the Outer Realm</h2><p>A Skill of the [Foreigner] class, denoting the holder&#39;s connection to a realm beyond man&#39;s comprehension. <strong>It doesn\u2019t seem to impart any special effect, and merely denotes the strength of one\u2019s foreign connection.</strong><br> [EX]: Abby, Hokusai, Yang<br> [A]: Van Gogh<br> [B]: Summer BB. Her eyes \u201Cjust happened to meet\u201D those of an Outer God, and from that a contract was made.<br> [C]: Voyager (FGO)<br> [D]: MHXX</p>', 36);
