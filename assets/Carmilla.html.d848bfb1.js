Nonetheless, there are many who believe in the existence of this torture device, so it has been esteemed as an exquisite Noble Phantasm that kills innocent maidens while they are filled with fear.</p><p>Floating above Carmilla\u2019s head, screams of her target are heard while the iron maiden is filled with their blood the moment it closes shut. It is both a recovery of health for Carmilla and an attack being used together. In the case of it being used against female Servants, damage increases.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronoun: watashi</li><li>Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females]</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Every factor of her life, such as her livelihood as a noble that spanned over many years, her contempt towards humans except for those who are her fellow blood relatives due to being hardened by them, and so forth, all pushed the former Elizabeth into a killer who seeks the bizarre. Haughty, proud, and conceitful, Carmilla\u2019s body is coiled around with every vanity; it is like sulfuric acid had turned into a human form. If one touches Carmilla, all fine things will be inflamed immediately. And yet, stupidity exists at her root\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014If one puts it in another way, it is even possible to say that Carmilla has a faint goodness within her that is just on the verge of barely stopping her audacity.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Naturally, Carmilla is clearly evil. She will betray her Master, and she will even embrace the recognition of being called a traitor. But still, even if she does not go so far as\u2026 to serve them, if it is probably a Master with a bottomless goodness, one who is aware of, and furthermore, accepts her past, in that case, she will appear to become willingly cooperative.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CYou make a pleasant cry. If you don\u2019t mind, can you let me hear more of it when we return to the castle?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI hate myself. Abhor myself.

Unlike Elizabeth, there is still room for correction in Carmilla (although there is no room for forgiveness); a cruel existence through and through. Unmistakably an Anti-Hero, if circumstances originally allowed Carmilla to be summoned, it would probably be by a dark killer on the same level as her.</p><p>The Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu wrote \u201CCarmilla\u201D in the year 1872. Languid, the female vampire Carmilla possesses a charming beauty in some respects, and this novel provided a great influence for Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201CDracula\u201D as well.</p><p>And one can conclude that the person who became the model for Carmilla is her\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Elizabeth B\xE1thory. Elizabeth B\xE1thory has anecdotes of giving somebody the impression of her as a fine sovereign, although even if meagre, but Carmilla\u2019s current state tore off that influence. Elizabeth is obtaining some power of the Dragon Kind due to her Innocent Monster Skill, but even that was lost due to Carmilla taking the form of a complete vampire.</p><p>Furthermore, Elizabeth hates that she is merging with Carmilla despite being an identical existence. Elizabeth thinks \u201CI musn\u2019t become like her\u201D, and if it is viewed from Carmilla\u2019s perspective, Elizabeth is the figure of her past glorifying her absolutely intolerable youth. To speak of this simply, if it is viewed from Elizabeth\u2019s side, it is \u201CSuch an incomplete thing that can\u2019t grow accustomed to being that sort of idol is not my future self and should just drop dead!!\u201D, and if it is viewed from Carmilla\u2019s side, it is \u201CMy former self who wonders if she should wake up or not from her FOOLISH dream that seemingly settles on a dark history such as being an idol should just go to hell!!\u201D</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong></p><p>Needless to say.</p><p><strong>Vlad III</strong></p><p>\u201CYou made me laugh at you when you\u2019re doing things such as denying vampires.

In her Final Ascension, I chose a scene that emphasizes insanity and inhumanity. It was very difficult to make her crinoline-like armour. Given that I love characters that are like a Queen, I delightfully accepted drawing her even though I was going to suffer doing so.
