I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re looking for Captain Kidd&#39;s treasure! How exciting!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Do you feel in your element, Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, my name is Romani Archaman.<br> &quot;Roman&quot; for short.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Adventures like looking for pirate treasures are part of what makes humans &quot;romantic.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Just before Kidd was caught, he told a fellow pirate the whereabouts of his treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> But he was a pirate, you know?<br> Stories you hear from a drunk aren&#39;t all that trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> So nobody ever found where Captain Kidd&#39;s treasure lay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How do you know where it is, Mary?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Oh, I found out later the treasure I previously gave up on belonged to Captain Kidd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You gave up on it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> By chance, I ended up on this island a little before I became a pirate.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Since I was here, I decided to look around\u2013<br> and I found the treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I think it was treasure.<br> I only saw it from a distance.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> At a distance?<br> You didn&#39;t get close?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...There was a reason I couldn&#39;t, you see.<br> Okay\u2013Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hehehe, I&#39;m looking forward to this.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Um, first we have to get through this forest,<br> I think...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Oh my, oh my.<br> \u2013There&#39;s something here.</p><p><strong>Pirate?:</strong><br> Gweh...<br> Money...

Sorry for taking so long.<br> Most pirates end up thrown into the sea.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I thought it might be nice to actually have someone pray on their behalf for once.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Past these wilds is a cave at the bottom of the mountain.<br> That&#39;s where the treasure is.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed no one found it if it&#39;s that easy.<br> Those pirates came so close.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Hmm, well it&#39;s probably\u2013</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Because of things like that wandering around.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hehe, Mary.<br> You need to tell us stuff like that ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Yeah, sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Preparing for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew.

Found it!<br> Look at all these chests!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Opening!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> It&#39;d be something if after all this, the punch line is<br> &quot;Try Again&quot; or &quot;Your experience en route was your treasure.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> ...If that happens we&#39;ll bring his ghost back and torture him.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Okay...

But it&#39;s not pirate treasure.<br> It&#39;s the treasure of the Knights Templar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, you mean the treasure that was hidden when the Templars were executed as heretics.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Pirates are definitely exciting!<br> This time around, I promise to fully monitor you guys!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> I hope so. Mary, I&#39;m amazed you knew about the Templars&#39; treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Remember how we went to all sorts of places during our pirating years?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Oh yes. When we got to port, you would always go out exploring.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> It was hard for you, Anne, because men would always follow you around even just walking down the street.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re so mean.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Hehehe. Um, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, what is it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I know most of what there is to know about the Templars, but I&#39;ll let you explain.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> It&#39;s too much of a hassle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yay! She shoved all the tedious work to me! Oh, well That&#39;s what a back-end support job is about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Knights Templar were a group formed by clergymen to protect pilgrims traveling through the Holy Land.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> One of their missions was to guard the treasures of knights and believers on pilgrimages.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As more pilgrims and crusaders started going to the Holy Land, the Templars gained more wealth to guard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They ultimately functioned as a bank, including loaning money. They were even entrusted with an entire nation&#39;s fortune.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But the Kingdom of France, heavily in debt, captured and tortured many of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> France wanted to get rid of their debts and take the money.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even though they canceled out their debts, a majority of the fortune France sought disappeared into the shadows.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Templars are even said to have possessed a Holy Grail, but everything&#39;s been shrouded in mystery.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I heard the story from an old man who said he was a descendant of one of the Templars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, can we trust him?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure. He was drunk, and he kept switching between yelling and crying.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> But the story itself seemed sensible.<br> From what he said...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The Templars had heard from their spies that their lives were in danger.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> So they loaded their treasure on a ship and hid it somewhere. Everyone involved in the transport was killed on the spot.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Their plan was to hide the treasure until the Templars could rebuild themselves.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The old man&#39;s ancestor left the Templars so he wouldn&#39;t be caught. Even the Templars didn&#39;t know where he hid.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> But the Templars never recovered. His ancestors continued to pass down the word to wait for the Templars&#39; reformation.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> After about four centuries, they stopped caring.<br> He sold me the story for a drink...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Sounds pretty sketchy to me.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Right. Sorry if it doesn&#39;t pan out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be fine since it&#39;ll be fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s getting to the treasure that&#39;s the fun part. There isn&#39;t much we could do with the treasure as we are now, anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it can boost our QP, and maybe we&#39;ll find something interesting! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The old man said it was back here.<br> But this is just a stone wall.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Was our lead a dud?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s too early to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give up.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, wait a second. There&#39;s a tiny bloodstain on this wall.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right. Same with the others... I wonder why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, please investigate the wall in front of us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Roger. Investigating now. Hmm... I&#39;m detecting a strong magical energy reading from the wall.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anne, try blasting it with your gun.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Servant now.<br> Your bullet should get some response.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Understood. Here I go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The wall started to move.<br> These are... Golems!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Woah. Come to think of it, I heard something about the Templars using black magic...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Was there such a tale?<br> Well, let&#39;s just beat these guys.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The golems are all down, but I&#39;m seeing more enemy responses up ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Proceed with caution.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Sure thing, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This makes me think the old man&#39;s story might be true. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Whew! This side&#39;s clear, too.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Security&#39;s tight. I&#39;m getting excited.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> We probably won&#39;t find a Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe we will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is to say, I don&#39;t mean the Holy Grails we recover.<br> I mean the true Holy Grail of legend.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> That would be an adventure indeed.<br> Master, do you want the Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want a future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I see. You aren&#39;t very greedy.<br> Or maybe you are.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The future or peace... Those are really big wishes, so you probably don&#39;t have time to be thinking about smaller wishes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As the guy paying for everyone&#39;s salary, that would be great. That aside, I&#39;m picking up some life-form signals. Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, a fair salary is an absolute necessity to keep talented people around. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Whew. Homunculi and zombies.<br> Were the zombies people killed by the Templars?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that is true, they must have been there a long time. Let&#39;s pray their souls find rest.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost to the end.<br> The treasure should be there!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Wow...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Treasure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mounds of riches!</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> We did it, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> H-Hold it! Hold it! I-In that cave, I&#39;m picking up a life-form signal that we have all become very familiar with!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Some say the Templars used black magic, others that they didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Maybe they were, maybe they weren&#39;t.<br> I&#39;m sure there are tons of stories like that.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> But would you normally go to these lengths?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A dragon!? Um... I can only say...well... F-Fight!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> We won. Victory!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Whew! I&#39;m exhausted.<br> I can&#39;t wait to take a bath.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty standard for a dragon to guard treasure, but I didn&#39;t expect the Templars to use one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re less like Templars and more like Temp-LATES, am I right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, when we get back, bite Dr. Roman on the nose.<br> As hard as you can.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fourururu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry! I thought that was a good one!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Anyway, this is a huge pile of treasure, Master.<br> Yeah, I like it.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> There&#39;s enough money here to easily buy a country or two. Any Grails?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nope, I&#39;m not picking up anything. But I do see magical energy here and there in the treasure.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Can you search for me?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Hmm, maybe it&#39;s this?This crystal skull.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A crystal skull!<br> That&#39;s a rare treasure indeed!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> What about... this?<br> It&#39;s a set of weapons and armor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Probably used by the Templars. Magically it&#39;s nothing special, but it&#39;s valuable as a treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> The right thing to do would be to return these to the Templars&#39; followers, but we&#39;re pirates, so we&#39;ll just keep it, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hehehe, this is also for saving the world.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Yup! Let&#39;s make good use of this to save the world. Right, Master?</p>', 216);
