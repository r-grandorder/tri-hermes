Because that salmon\u2019s fat remains imprinted on one of Fionn\u2019s thumb, if that thumb is licked, it is said that one will immediately acquire great wisdom. It is also the origin of the \u201CUisce Beatha: O\u2019 Lives Scooped with These Hands\u201D Noble Phantasm as that is viewed as something based on this Noble Phantasm\u2019s very anecdote.</p><p>Incidentally, salmon\u2019s fat contains mostly DHA which boosts one\u2019s powers of concentration.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: kimi / \u25CB\u25CB (one\u2019s full name)<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB (one\u2019s full name)</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A noble knight who honours impartiality and the path of righteousness. At the same time as being such a person, Fionn is open-minded and pleasure-seeking. He also does not bear any doubt, not even a tiny bit, about his own charm. \u201CCome now, for even these days, I\u2019m completely shining, no?!\u201D Similarly like his looks, his conducts are also elegant. However, his way of thinking is comparatively bold. Because he has the disposition of his youth that is suitable for this outward appearance, one would not particularly catch sight of that tenacious personality in the later anecdotes of his past life. He is self-conscious of his own beauty as a reality. Regarding his looks, it is something he was born with, so he does not have to boast about it, but it is a pet theory that it is something that can even be utilized.</p><p>Although he has a personality that is filled with a lot of love, even Fionn has that sort of love that is treated as unique and eternal, devoted only to his first wife. Only in the moments when he thinks about her, Fionn mac Cumhaill is not a knight leader, but one young man who is honest with himself.</p><p>Even though he does not realize it, as a matter of fact, Fionn is deeply jealous. After decades of years later from his present appearance, of which this present appearance was the prime of his life as a knight, there was an anecdote where he resented his subordinate Diarmuid for snatching away his third wife \u2013 the beautiful Gr\xE1inne; later on, Fionn chose to let Diarmuid die without helping him after the latter fell into a predicament, solely out of the resentment that stemmed from his deep jealousy. As a result, Fionn stirred the disappointment of many of his subordinates after that incident, causing a war where the Knights of the Fianna divided into two sides, and before long, even Fionn had lost his life in the middle of the conflict.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Fionn will not make changes to his elegant speeches and conducts in regard to his Master. Because he also worked for the sake of the High King of Ireland since while he was alive, he has absolutely no reluctance in regard to acting under somebody as a Servant. As a Hero, he takes into consideration that if he can work for the sake of the people, there will also be no problem of any kind for him because of that.</p><p>The wish Fionn wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cto fix his tendency to get into trouble with women.\u201D He thinks that perhaps all the tragedies of his lifetime stemmed from his fate of having trouble with women, no matter what. However, since that is his way of thinking at the occasion of having materialized in this form, in the case of having materialized in another form, there is even the possibility in that he may have a different view and wish.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CWhen it comes to beauty, it\u2019s my victory.

A Great Hero who established many valourous deeds, such as by aiding the capital by killing a wicked Divine Spirit that manipulated slumber and flames as well as by defeating invaders and monsters as the guardian of Erin (Ireland). Having mastered Celtic Magecraft and wisdom, Fionn is endowed with many abilities and Noble Phantasms.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Serving the High King of Erin, Fionn mac Cumhaill was a man who earned the achievements worthy for him to be declared the leader and further judged as the greatest knight of the Knights of the Fianna. The fallen Divine Spirit Aillen, the magical Demon Boars, the Horses of the Underworld\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014he defeated a large number of these wicked yet powerful monsters, and in the end, he defeated even the War God Nuada \u2013 who is his divine ancestor \u2013 in battle; however, when times of peace come about, it has been said that he was a magnanimous man who spent his time quietly while carrying out hunts and the like together with his subordinates in the order of knights.</p><p>Fionn willingly went on a journey as a Great Hero with nothing about that journey that can be criticized by others, but during his personal life, he had a fate of trouble with women. His first trouble was being charmed by a pair of beautiful sisters, having received a curse from that incident. His misfortune further continued thereafter, where seven years of his youth were stolen from him for antagonizing a fairy in a dispute concerning his first wife, and then, because of the dispute concerning Gr\xE1inne, his third wife, it resulted in the collapse of the glorious order of knights.</p><p>Troubles with women. Is it not that he himself is surely the problem of those, and not that there is a problem with women? Up to his final moments, Fionn mac Cumhaill never really took that into consideration.<br> \u201CWhat the heck went wrong?\u201D<br> Even now, having transformed into a Heroic Spirit and having materialized as a Servant, he still does not comprehend that.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Diarmuid</strong></p><p>As far as Fionn himself, who materialized in his youthful appearance, is concerned, because whatever happened around his later years were no more than \u201Cmemories of that time then, and not now\u201D, he will definitely say to Diarmuid, \u201CI\u2019m glad to see you again after a long time\u201D, without relatively minding about it.

I regret it in that I should have raised his tights even more for the times when the Celts all come to appear together in the distant future. Even though a perfect ikemen-like characteristic was specified for him, there were many more cheerful lines implemented for him than what I had thought, so I should have made his facial expressions more amusing, yeah?\u2026 Well, to be honest, this uncle is about the same age as me?
