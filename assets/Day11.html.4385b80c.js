Why are you in my room?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because my room is close to yours. I woke up early, so I came to look at you.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Man.</p><p>It seems she woke up before me and came here.</p><p>I don&#39;t care about that, but maybe Illya did so because\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. Was I having a nightmare?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. You were moaning in pain, trying to pull that cloth off your arm.</p><p>Well, I came here because I expected you to do that. I suppressed the pain while you were asleep, so it feels better now, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I now notice that my right hand is on the cloth covering my left arm.</p><p>.....Oh man.</p><p>If Illya hadn&#39;t come, I might&#39;ve taken it off in my sleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Thank you, Illya.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to thank me. It&#39;s between you and me.</p><p>And I promised, right? That I&#39;ll help you when you&#39;re in trouble.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her smile captivates me.</p><hr><p>I know Illya&#39;s just saying that out of kindness, but...</p><p>&quot;Fufu, and I wanted to see your sleeping face. You were in pain, but your were trying your best to endure it. You were so cute.&quot;</p><p>I slam the brakes on my panicking heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Illya. It&#39;s not good to go into someone else&#39;s room without permission.</p><p>Mornings and evenings are out of the question. I&#39;m an ordinary guy, so it&#39;s troubling.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, really? How is it troubling? I want to know in detail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015even that question is troubling.</p><p>First of all, you&#39;re a girl, so you can&#39;t go into a guy&#39;s room in the morning. It&#39;s dangerous. It&#39;s really dangerous. You&#39;re not just endangering yourself, you&#39;re putting the innocence of an adolescent boy at risk too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? But that makes even less sense. What&#39;s so bad, and what&#39;s so dangerous about it? I won&#39;t stop unless you tell me why.&quot;</p><hr><p>The silver-haired girl puts her hand down, gets on all fours, and...</p><p>&quot;See, I&#39;m closer to you now. So, why is it troubling for me to come near you in the morning, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot...!!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>I roll backward head-over-heels while keeping ahold of my futon.</p><p>That was close.</p><p>Guys experience a certain physiological phenomenon every morning.</p><p>I could be given a man&#39;s mark of shame if she comes close to me in such an outf\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I hit the back of my head hard.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s why... I said it&#39;s dangerous.&quot;</p><p>I make up an excuse.</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Okay. I&#39;m sorry, Shirou.</p><p>...Um, did it hurt...?&quot;</p><p>It hurts.</p><p>I saw stars and my head is throbbing, but I can&#39;t be whining if I hear a voice like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m fine. It was a good wake-up call, so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p>I shake my head and get up.</p><p>My morning issue has calmed down thanks to that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. It&#39;s about time, so I&#39;m going to go cook breakfast. What do you want, Illya? If there&#39;s anything you don&#39;t like, say so now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh? No way, you can cook!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I can cook like everyone else. I don&#39;t know about Western snacks... but I guess I can manage pancakes.&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s face lights up.</p><p>It seems the fact that I can cook is a delightful thing for Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... Then do you want to make it together? I thought I&#39;d go get you after breakfast&#39;s done, but it&#39;s better for you to be in the living room if you&#39;re awake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really!? Yeah, I&#39;ll go! I want to see you wearing an apron!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then let&#39;s beat Tohsaka together with the three of us.</p><p>I promised Sakura we&#39;d be cooking together this morning, so we&#39;ll have the strength of three with your help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No. I&#39;m not going if Sakura&#39;s there. You go by yourself, Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... Why? Because Sakura&#39;s there? Do you hate Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I actually rather like her. But I can&#39;t approve of her because she&#39;s not suited for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What do you mean by not suited, Illya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s true. You ought to know why, but you&#39;re trying so hard not to notice it. Telling you now won&#39;t do any good.&quot;</p><p>Illya goes out into the hallway.</p><hr><p>&quot;And I don&#39;t know what kind of trance you were in, but don&#39;t keep charging ahead recklessly. You&#39;re watching Archer&#39;s magecraft, not Shirou&#39;s magecraft.</p><p>...I know you&#39;ll eventually obtain the magecraft, but there&#39;s only the possibility right now. Your body will destroy itself from within if you try projection in such a state.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Projection\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I repeat Illya&#39;s word absentmindedly.</p><p>At that instant...</p><p>The cocking hammer goes down.</p><p>The dream I saw while I was treated.</p><p>I vaguely understand what it is and what it means.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s probably...</p><p>Projection taken to the utmost limit, reproducing every weapon you&#39;ve ever seen and making them your own.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm is &#39;magecraft&#39; that only he can use.</p><p>Archer is a blacksmith heroic spirit that can reproduce any weapon he sees. The power is something you can use too, now that you inherited his arm. You&#39;re probably not conscious of it now, but you&#39;ll remember the activation spell if you put your mind to it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t think about using it just because you can. That priest is right. If you remove the cloth and use projection even once, you will certainly die.</p><p>...So don&#39;t take it off, no matter what. I won&#39;t forgive you if you die like Kiritsugu. I&#39;ll never forgive you if you leave me alone before I kill you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya leaves.</p><p>Her warning contains both caring strictness and murderous hostility.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-bad-news" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-bad-news" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Bad news</h2><p>&quot;Senpai, I&#39;m done cleaning the turnip. How are the chicken wings going?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, I&#39;m done skimming the foam. Let&#39;s cook it once we&#39;ve cut those into four pieces.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. What are you doing with the curry powder, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m making the sauce. We&#39;ll put it on the sardines. Even if Illya doesn&#39;t like fish, she should be able to eat it if it&#39;s curry flavored, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, you&#39;re smart, Senpai! Then I&#39;ll cut the fish, so please check the simmering.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? No, I can cut the sardine without the knife, so you don&#39;t have to. I&#39;ll ask for your help when I get to the center bone, so can you make simmered pumpkin with broth and soy sauce? I think we should have at least one sweet dish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. Oh, you look like a sushi chef when you&#39;re cutting the fish one-handed like that, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura goes to the refrigerator.</p><p>Sakura must be feeling better after a good night&#39;s sleep, because she&#39;s in a good mood this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>And standing in the kitchen with her is fun for me too.</p><p>Sakura is thoughtful and is attentive to my needs, preparing things ahead of time.</p><p>It feels really good to cook with someone like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai? Sushi chef, your hands aren&#39;t moving.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, I was spaced out. We should hurry. It&#39;s almost seven o&#39;clock.&quot;</p><hr><p>I sigh so she can&#39;t see and continue cutting the sardine.</p><p>Sardine is soft, so it&#39;s better to use fingers than a knife. It&#39;s something even I, one with my left arm not moving, can manage to cook.</p><hr><p>&quot;But when did you learn such a technique? It&#39;s not normal to do it with just your right hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not a technique. This is about timing and determination. I&#39;m sure you can do it too if you try.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Techniques are things like cutting apart a cow with a kitchen knife or making an ice sculpture.</p><p>Here, take care of the rest. We&#39;ll cook it after you&#39;re done, so put it in the bowl.&quot;</p><hr><p>I move away from the cutting board and walk to the gas burner.</p><p>I put the frying pan over the fire and pour some oil onto it.</p><p>My body knows how to do this, so I do it absentmindedly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>I vaguely reply.</p><hr><p>&quot;...This might be none of my concern, but did something happen between you and Illya-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My hand stops.</p><p>But it&#39;s only for an instant.</p><p>I&#39;m sure Sakura didn&#39;t see my disturbance.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. We talked before I came to the kitchen. Illya has a lot going on. I really don&#39;t know how to answer her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Is that a problem as a Master?</p><p>Does Illya-san still want to fight?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I don&#39;t feel a will to fight from her. ...No, I don&#39;t think she had such a thing from the start. I think she tried to obtain the Holy Grail as the Master of Einzbern, but Illya had another goal.</p><p>But...&quot;</p><hr><p>...That goal disappeared long before the war even started.</p><p>Illya&#39;s goal.</p><p>Emiya Kiritsugu, the one she wanted to meet, died five years ago.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015what can I do and what should I do in his place?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Sakura. Is it all right if Illya stays here if she doesn&#39;t want to go back to her country?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015um. This is your house, Senpai. My opinion doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you saying? This is your house. I can&#39;t decide on something important like having Illya stay without consulting my partner.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m your partner...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Who else would it be?&quot;</p><p>Neither Illya nor Tohsaka can help me with cooking this perfectly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura, the frying pan&#39;s ready.&quot;</p><p>I take the sardine Sakura prepared.</p><p>Sakura hands me the sardine with an airy motion.</p><p>......?</p><p>What is it all of a sudden?</p><p>Did she get a fever again...?</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Okay, I understand...! I&#39;ll do my best to get along with Illya-san...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, it&#39;ll be great if you can. Illya said she doesn&#39;t hate you, so you should be able to get along with her if you talk with her.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Yeah, I&#39;ll be really happy if that happens.</p><p>After the Holy Grail War is over, Sakura and Illya will be here making breakfast without worry.</p><p>I&#39;ll pay any price for such a wish to come true\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning. You two sure are up early on Sunday.&quot;</p><p>...Wait.</p><p>Something amazing just passed by.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Senpai... did some strange person pass by just now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Ugh. If you saw it too, that means it wasn&#39;t just my imagination.&quot;</p><p>We timidly look into the living room.</p><hr><p>The person that shambled over to the table glowers as she pours herself some tea and turns on the TV.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m surprised. Tohsaka-Senpai isn&#39;t a morning person...&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Wait, Sakura.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t someone who&#39;s not a morning person, um, look cuter?</p><hr><p>Breakfast starts.</p><p>Sakura and I sit next to each other, while Tohsaka and Illya sit across from us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, wow. This has some refined taste, Sakura. I guess this deserves to be eaten.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know if Illya is attacking or praising Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez. I usually don&#39;t eat in the morning.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka complains as she eats the omelet.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>...Then, for some reason, she silently starts concentrating on eating.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Breakfast continues quietly.</p><p>The only loud thing is the TV Tohsaka turned on, offfering many topics of information.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm......?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A familiar scene is on TV.</p><p>I can&#39;t be mistaken.</p><p>The TV is showing a baffling story about a park in Shinto.</p><hr><p>&quot;......A missing person in central park? ...A lot of blood around the area...?&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a pretty vivid incident.</p><p>An old man was jogging in the park, found a trace of blood, and reported it to the police.</p><p>A policeman came to the scene and found what appeared to be one person&#39;s worth of blood and pieces of the apparent victims.</p><p>...But it seems the pieces are just scraps of flesh, and that they don&#39;t even weigh fifty kilograms when gathered together.</p><hr><p>&quot;...The police are trying to figure out the four victims&#39; identities... wait, why four people? There was only enough blood for one, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s probably because the scattered flesh came from four people.</p><p>I&#39;m sure there were only leftovers, but that must have been enough to figure it out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka.</p><p>By &#39;leftovers&#39;... do you mean this is a Servant&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015Zouken&#39;s doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? I can&#39;t tell if Zouken had a hand in this. But I&#39;m sure that shadow did this. See the corner of the screen? The grass has turned black. It&#39;s exactly like when the shadow appeared in the forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka states simply.</p><p>But I&#39;m not convinced for two reasons.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? No matter what that shadow may be, it hasn&#39;t done anything like this before. It has sucked up magical energy from people, but it never, um...&quot;</p><p>Directly killed people like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. The only reason I can think of is that there aren&#39;t any enemies now. There aren&#39;t any Masters now that can defeat them straight-on. So that means they can do whatever they want without worrying about whose attention they may get, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Does that mean they&#39;re being indiscriminate?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m the one that said it, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it. Even if Zouken and that shadow are related, I&#39;m sure this was an unforeseen accident.</p><p>I&#39;ll bet my omelet that Zouken is surprised to hear this news as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s omelet is gone as she speaks.</p><p>Her hawk-like eyes are looking at the only untouched omelet on the table, mine.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hm. Why do you think it&#39;s an unforeseen accident?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not cleaned up. With the blood aside, Zouken&#39;s not someone that would leave pieces of the dead body behind. In other words, Zouken was not at the scene, and that shadow was the only thing that ate there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. ...Then one more thing. How do they know there were four victims? There was only one person&#39;s worth of blood, and there was only one person&#39;s worth of flesh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s the shape, not the weight. I&#39;m sure there was four of something people only have one of. That way, you&#39;d know how many victims there are without any identification.</p><p>See. If there were four left hands in a pool of blood, anyone would know how many victims there were.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka states simply.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I imagine the scene and my appetite quickly goes away.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02-future-plans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-future-plans" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 Future plans</h2><p>After breakfast...</p><p>&quot;Shirou. We have to do some things, so come with me.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka takes me to the dojo.</p><hr><p>I had no reason to refuse and I also wanted to talk to Tohsaka, so it was a timely offer.</p><p>It was, but...</p><p>&quot;Hey. I only wanted Shirou. Why are you all following him?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is unhappy at the unexpected guests.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, you&#39;re menacing, so I thought it&#39;s dangerous for Senpai to be by himself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey now. I made a pact with Shirou, so I won&#39;t attack him. You know that, so why did you follow us, Sakura?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;B-Because it&#39;s my role to protect Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You declare, huh?</p><p>Then how about you? You should know what I&#39;m going to do. Did you come to heckle me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I&#39;m here for the same reason as Sakura.</p><p>I know what you want to do, but I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to do it. I came to make sure you don&#39;t do anything strange to Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well.

Can I say something beforehand?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Don&#39;t tell me now you don&#39;t want anything that hurts.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course.

I have a vague idea of what you might be doing. That&#39;s why I&#39;m putting every trust in you. I&#39;ll trust you no matter what you tell me to do. I promised you last night, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Heh. Then why did you stop me?</p><p>If you don&#39;t have any questions, then sit and be quiet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, this isn&#39;t about that.

I&#39;ll fight if someone attacks me, but I don&#39;t intend to start a fight myself. I don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen even if I win this Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I feel the same way as Illya-san. I don&#39;t think I can beat Grandfather.</p><p>The match is pretty much decided, so I don&#39;t think Grandfather will come attack us if we stay quiet here...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s thinking, but I want to believe she has the same opinion as me, since she&#39;s not agreeing with Illya or Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. I agree with concentrating purely on defense.</p><p>Sakura stays here to defend against Zouken.</p><p>Rider is with Sakura, so she should be able to defend Sakura and Illya if she concentrates on defense.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka and I will try to come up with a way to defeat Zouken.</p><p>We&#39;ll be attacked eventually even if we stay here, and we can&#39;t leave them be. We don&#39;t know if something like this morning&#39;s news is going to happen again.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka doesn&#39;t interrupt.</p><p>It means she intended for the two of us to fight Zouken, no matter what her true opinion may be.</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t ignore Zouken, but I can&#39;t ignore the shadow either. Tohsaka and I will start patrolling the town tonight, so Sakura and Illya are to stay here and keep watch.&quot;</p><hr><p>I confirm the plan with everyone.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What are you saying, Senpai...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sakura...? What? It&#39;s nothing ridiculous, right?</p><p>Tohsaka and I are the only ones who can fight, so we have to beat Zouken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the ridiculous part...!</p><p>You can&#39;t use one of your arms anymore! Do you really know what that means...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t get it. You&#39;re acting strange. Why are you going to fight even after what&#39;s happened to you?</p><p>You should know that things are out of your hands now because you actually took part in it. So why are you saying such a ridiculous thing?</p><p>I was relieved because I thought you wouldn&#39;t fight with one arm, so why\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...........Sakura.&quot;</p><p>Sakura is trembling.</p><p>She&#39;s hanging her head as she trembles at her words.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s trembling.</p><p>The only thing I can do is to answer her question.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. I&#39;m going to let you win. That&#39;s why I&#39;m fighting.</p><p>Yes, I don&#39;t want to ignore Zouken and the shadow. But more than that, I want the Holy Grail. Nobody&#39;s making me do this. This is a selfish wish of mine.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right.</p><p>It&#39;s a selfish wish I had ever since I decided to be Sakura&#39;s ally and not everyone else&#39;s.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........Is that for my sake?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes. It will be for your sake if we can remove the crest worm from your body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s all right, Sakura. If there&#39;s no chance of victory, we&#39;ll make a chance, and we won&#39;t fight while we don&#39;t have any chance of victory.</p><p>There&#39;s still danger even if we have a chance, but there&#39;s always a risk, so I can&#39;t promise you I won&#39;t get hurt.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But I&#39;ll definitely come back. I told you I&#39;d protect you, right? So I can&#39;t fulfill my promise unless I&#39;m by your side.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sen... pai...&quot;</p><p>Sakura looks down painfully.</p><p>It looks like she&#39;s apologizing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right, can you stop it there?</p><p>Our course of action&#39;s already determined, so it does no good to whine.</p><p>Sakura and Illya are to stay here. Shirou and I will patrol the town at night. We won&#39;t carelessly attack Zouken even if we find him. We&#39;ll chip away at their force only when we have a chance of victory.</p><p>That&#39;s our future course of action, right, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah... It&#39;d be great if that&#39;s your decision.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh. I don&#39;t even need to tell you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And, Sakura. Kirei couldn&#39;t completely extract your crest worm, but he suppressed its action. So it can&#39;t run wild unless they use a drug on you like Shinji did.</p><p>But at the same time, Zouken can&#39;t be the winner as long as you stay here in this house. He&#39;s going to come take you sooner or later, so refusing to fight is not an option. How can you say you won&#39;t do anything knowing that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That may be true, but\u2015\u2015\u2015Grandfather shouldn&#39;t do anything rough if we don&#39;t do anything\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura! Stop being so submissive. Zouken isn&#39;t your grandfather or your master. Do you still think he&#39;s human after all the terrible things he&#39;s done to you!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........No. I&#39;ve never thought he was human.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then prepare yourself. Shirou and I will be fighting outside, so you have to fight here too.</p><p>If Zouken attacks this place, you have to get away at any cost. The Holy Grail cannot be completed as long as Rider isn&#39;t defeated. You have a hope of being saved as long as Rider&#39;s alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice is firm.</p><p>...Is it the dignity of the older sister?</p><p>Sakura nods and replies that she understands.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-tohsaka-sensei-s-lecture-on-magic-drastic-measure-edition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-tohsaka-sensei-s-lecture-on-magic-drastic-measure-edition" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 Tohsaka Sensei&#39;s lecture on magic(Drastic measure edition)</h2><p>And after that.</p><p>I ask why she brought me here to the dojo.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see. Why don&#39;t you get naked to start with?</p><p>No matter what we end up doing, nothing would go right unless I take a look at what kind of a body you have.&quot;</p><p>And she gives me a ridiculous reply.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha-&quot;</p><p>&quot;WHA-WHAAAAAT!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Whaaat?&quot;</p><p>I continue in a small voice because she&#39;s more surprised than I am.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Is that such a shock, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-It is...! You want Senpai to be naked!? What are you thinking, Tohsaka-Senpai...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m thinking about Shirou, of course.</p><p>You&#39;re in danger, but Shirou&#39;s also in a lot of danger. You should know too that we have to get a lot of things done now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s true... but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you know, then don&#39;t butt in.</p><p>Hey there! Don&#39;t just stand there and take off your top! I&#39;m going to put on a warding sign, so I can&#39;t do it if you keep your shirt on!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh......&quot;</p><p>But Sakura&#39;s stare is painful.</p><p>It&#39;s uneasily asking me if I&#39;m going to go along with Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hurry up. We won&#39;t make it before tonight&#39;s patrol unless we give your body some time to familiarize itself with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Umm......&quot;</p><hr><p>This is no time to be embarrassed about something like this.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to take my clothes off, but taking off my top is like getting changed, so it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. All right, Tohsaka. So, what do I do now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come here. I&#39;ll transplant a small part of my Magic Crest onto you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! Over there!? You mean like this!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I have to touch your body with my left hand, comprehend it, and share my warding crest with you. It&#39;ll tickle and hurt, but bear with me.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka wiggles her fingers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I can&#39;t run away after coming this far.</p><p>I give up and go near Tohsaka.</p><p>...Um, Sakura&#39;s stare is more painful now.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to start now, but let me confirm beforehand. I said before that I&#39;ll put a switch in you, but I won&#39;t do that.</p><p>In your state, it&#39;s too dangerous to be able to turn your Magic Circuit on and off so easily.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;O\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay, I got it.&quot;</p><p>I manage to reply with a high-pitched voice.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that I&#39;m acting strange and can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>I&#39;m naked, and Tohsaka is near me.</p><p>It&#39;d be more strange not to be nervous!</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. You don&#39;t seem to be calm. Are you listening to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m listening. I&#39;m listening to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? All right, then.</p><p>So this operation is to suppress magical energy.</p><p>Your body is unstable right now, and we don&#39;t know when Archer&#39;s arm might flow magical energy into your body. I&#39;m going to put needles into your left shoulder, belly button, and your throat, so that your left arm won&#39;t be connected to you unless you really want it to be.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This is also a countermeasure against the shadow.</p><p>That thing sucks up magical energy just by being there. The sign I&#39;m going to carve into you will also have resistance to magical energy, so you should be less burdened when facing that thing.&quot;</p><p>Then, Tohsaka places her hand on my chest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Whoa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I barely stop myself from jumping back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, was it hot? Can you bear it? I&#39;m going to transplant the Magic Crest from my arm, so I can&#39;t lower the temperature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t care about it being hot or cold.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s hand is soft, and her touch sends a shudder through my heart.</p><p>Every time her slender fingers run across my chest, my temperature rises by a degree.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right. I think I have a grasp of your chest. Next is your belly button, but this is going to hurt. I&#39;m going to put my finger in, so try not to move. Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t injure you, and I won&#39;t move it around much.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015what do you mean by move it, Toh... saka\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My body convulses.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015My stomach.</p><p>Having Tohsaka&#39;s hand on my stomach is bad enough, but something rigid tears through my skin and into my body\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015h-hold on, that&#39;s, ba\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I said it&#39;s going to hurt. Don&#39;t make noises like that, it&#39;s distracting. It makes me feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A-Are you stupid\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>My face is going to get redder if you say something like that, you idiot!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. I&#39;m done with the belly button. All that&#39;s left is your shoulder and throat, so stay calm and don&#39;t run away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I would really love to run away right now.</p><p>I would love to, but doing so would seem like I&#39;m conscious of Tohsaka and I won&#39;t be able to excuse myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on. I&#39;m going to do the same thing to your shoulder, so suck it up. Grit your teeth and don&#39;t make any weird noises.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay. I&#39;ll try my best.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s embarrassing, so I look away from Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not just my face that&#39;s blushing. I think my entire body&#39;s turning red.</p><p>I&#39;m blushing even though I know this is only for magecraft, so I bet Tohsaka&#39;s having a hard time too.</p><p>...Man.</p><p>How can I ever face Tohsaka again after committing such a disgrace...?</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, that&#39;s it. I&#39;m going to put away the equipment, so you go cool yourself off.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka grabs something that looks like a first-aid kit and goes to the corner of the dojo, where her bag is.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My face is still red, but I&#39;m finally able to calm down and take a deep breathe.</p><p>...Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Sakura twiddles her fingers, looking like she wants to say something.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura? W-What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........Um, well...&quot;</p><p>She takes a look at me.</p><p>Then she takes a breath, as if preparing herself...</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai...! W-We, um... made love, right!?&quot;</p><p>...And she asks me a ridiculous question.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My face, which had finally calmed down, passes its boiling point and turns red again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um.&quot;</p><p>I feel dizzy.</p><p>Just recalling what happened that night is so stimulating that it makes me forget about our current situation.</p><p>So for Sakura to ask me fro confirmation like this, when I&#39;m already off-balance from Tohsaka, is like getting hit twice as hard\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the time to be speechless.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, I did make love to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;R-Right!? Then it&#39;s strange for you to lose your composure against Nee-san!&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura looks up at me unhappily.</p><p>...I finally realize why her stare was so painful earlier. It&#39;s because she was sulking.</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry. But Sakura, this had nothing to do with Tohsaka, and, um, it couldn&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I know, but please bear with it! You&#39;re m-m-my lover!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh. I... know that, but...&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#39;t fight against it.</p><p>I&#39;m a guy, and I&#39;ve admired Tohsaka since I got into this school, so I couldn&#39;t help it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll try to bear it next time. I&#39;ll do my best not to lose my composure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Really? I&#39;ll get mad if this happens again next time.&quot;</p><hr><p>She stares straight at me.</p><p>Repentant from the bottom of my heart, I tell her I&#39;ll do my best.</p><hr><p>...Man.</p><p>I only realized it just now, but...</p><p>Having three girls under the same roof might be a really stressful thing.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04-sisters-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04-sisters-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04 Sisters(IV)</h2><p>It&#39;s eleven-thirty now.</p><p>With lunch coming up, the kitchen is filled with a noisy, forbidding atmosphere.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Tohsaka-Senpai. I&#39;m thinking of making a dish that everyone can eat from. Do you have anything you don&#39;t like?&quot;</p><p>In the kitchen...</p><p>With the refrigerator at her back, Sakura speaks timidly.</p><hr><p>In response...</p><p>&quot;I see. Then I&#39;ll make mapo tofu.&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka cuts her off and selfishly starts cutting the tofu.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015They aren&#39;t getting along. What were you thinking, letting them cook?&quot;</p><p>Illya sits Japanese-style on the cushion and speaks without reserve.</p><p>Hm. It seems even Illya can tell Tohsaka and Sakura are tense.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s just going to get worse if you leave them be.</p><p>You should know that, so how did you let it come to this?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It just sort of happened.</p><p>We were wondering about lunch. Tohsaka said she&#39;d make it, and Sakura said it was her job. Neither one would back down, so I took both their ideas and suggested that they make lunch together.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You said that? ...I see. No wonder they can&#39;t back out now.&quot;</p><p>Illya seems to understand and takes a sip of tea with proper manners.</p><p>As expected from a princess. She shouldn&#39;t know the proper etiquette, but she&#39;s elegant even with something as simple as this.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Shirou. Couldn&#39;t you have made lunch? Why did you get Rin and Sakura to do it?</p><p>Tohsaka and Matou are enemies, and Rin wants to kill Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That was only up to yesterday. Tohsaka is working with us because she doesn&#39;t want to fight Sakura. And they aren&#39;t enemies. They get along, and I entrusted them with lunch because I thought it would go well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015they get along!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Is that so surprising? Illya and I are friends even though we were enemies, right? Then it should be the same for Tohsaka and Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... Well, Shirou and I are special...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Being special has nothing to do with this. You&#39;ll understand if you watch. Tohsaka is being more blunt than usual, but she warns Sakura every time she does something wrong. It means that...&quot;</p><p>&quot;......She&#39;s concerned about her. But she&#39;s putting on a cold face and ignoring her because she doesn&#39;t want her to find out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. And Sakura knows that, so she&#39;s making mistakes she normally doesn&#39;t. She&#39;s concerned about Tohsaka too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Now that you point it out, I can see it. Then what? They want to get along, but they&#39;re too embarrassed to start talking?&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod.</p><p>I don&#39;t know about Tohsaka, but I know how Sakura feels.</p><hr><p>Sakura likes Tohsaka, and she wants Tohsaka to like her.</p><p>Or she would never call her Nee-san.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So Rin is clumsy, in spite of her appearance.&quot;</p><p>Impressed, Illya murmurs and looks in the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I follow her example and look in the kitchen.</p><p>They must be half done with the cooking.</p><p>Standing side-by-side in the small kitchen, Tohsaka and Sakura are making their dishes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>One holds the frying pan while the other holds the ladle, but neither says anything.</p><p>...And after a silence that even gets us nervous...</p><hr><p>As expected from sisters, they start talking at the same time.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Go ahead, I&#39;ll listen to whatever you have to say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... um, it&#39;s really nothing. Didn&#39;t you want to say something?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s nothing. Well, different people cook differently, right? So I thought it might be useful if you can teach me some of your flavorings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right. I&#39;d love it if you could teach me your recipes, Tohsaka-Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s it? I don&#39;t believe this. At this rate, they&#39;ll be like that forever.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s scary that I can&#39;t deny the possibility.</p><p>Tohsaka is normally dominant, but why is she so shy when it comes to Sakura?</p><hr><p>And Sakura too.</p><p>She calls Tohsaka Nee-san when she&#39;s with me, but she&#39;s reserved when she&#39;s actually with her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, yes, what is it, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I need to talk to you. Can you come here?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai? Is there something outside?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, being outside isn&#39;t the important part. I just wanted to talk secretly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... talk secretly...? Um, is this something you can&#39;t let Nee-san hear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. That&#39;s exactly what I want to talk about.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m talking about how you address Tohsaka. You don&#39;t call her Nee-san when you&#39;re with her. It&#39;s obvious that you really want to call her that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015you mean it&#39;s obvious to Nee-san!?&quot;</p><p>...Whoa.</p><p>I just made that up, but it seems Sakura is more reserved about her sister&#39;s feelings than I thought.</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, Tohsaka doesn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know why, but she&#39;s really dense when it comes to you. ...But in the worst case, she might think that you hate her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not true...! It&#39;s natural for Nee-san to hate me, but I&#39;m happy to be with her. I never even dreamed that we could make lunch together...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Then why don&#39;t you just be honest with her? Even someone as dense as Tohsaka can&#39;t possibly miss it if you tell her straight-out. Then you should be able to...&quot;</p><p>Sakura should be able to realize by herself that Tohsaka wants to get along with Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s nothing. Just go call Tohsaka Nee-san.</p><p>I&#39;ll bet you she changes so much that it&#39;s funny.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Would it really turn out like that? I think having someone like me calling her &#39;Nee-san&#39; will only bother her.</p><p>I&#39;m a magus of Matou, and I can&#39;t do everything like Nee-san can. Tohsaka-Senpai is probably disappointed that a failure like me is her sister.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot. Don&#39;t bring other things into a sister&#39;s relationship. You like Tohsaka, and she&#39;s your big sister, right?</p><p>Then there&#39;s nothing more important than that. I&#39;ll guarantee it. There&#39;s mutual love between you two. To be honest, there&#39;s so much love that I&#39;m a bit jealous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... I-Is that so?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. So you call her Nee-san.</p><p>I think Tohsaka believed in it, just like you did. So there&#39;s nothing to be scared of. It&#39;s for her sake too. Please call her Nee-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015For Nee-san&#39;s sake.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in her mind.</p><p>But after putting her hands together, as if praying, and thinking it over...</p><p>&quot;Okay.

Sakura&#39;s tensed up. What happened?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? The rest depends on her courage. Well, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to go well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I sit down on the cushion.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Nee-san. Can I finish this fried chicken?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, all that&#39;s left is to fry it, so I&#39;ll leave it to you... wait, Sakura, did you just...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. If I&#39;m doing the chicken, can you cut the lettuce, Nee-san? I&#39;ll leave the serving to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay, that&#39;s fine, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>...Everything goes still.</p><p>They both fall silent, and the tension is much greater than before.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Not even breathing, they stare at one another.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Um, is it strange, Nee-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015i-it&#39;s not that. I was just surprised because I&#39;ve never been called that way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then, um...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I have nothing against it. You&#39;re free to call me whatever you want, and I&#39;m calling you by name. Well, it could get confusing because there are two Senpai here, so that should make things clearer.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka makes it sound like it can&#39;t be helped and looks away.</p><p>...But Sakura should be able to tell that she&#39;s blushing and can&#39;t hide her smile.</p><hr><p>...Their joint work got even more awkward after that.</p><p>They messed up so many times that lunch turned out to be a disaster. The fried chicken was covered in pepper, the mapo tofu was hot as hell, and the rice cooker was never turned on, so we ended up eating without rice.</p><p>But Tohsaka and Sakura both looked happy, smiling at every opportunity.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez, they sure are clumsy.&quot;</p><p>Illya sounds dumbfounded as she eats mapo tofu that&#39;s hot enough to numb your tongue.</p><p>I nod back silently and gratefully eat the food they made.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-05-choice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-05-choice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 05 Choice</h2><p>I return to my room to rest after lunch.</p><p>Tohsaka had something to do, so she went to her room with Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to take measures against Zouken with Illya&#39;s help.

You&#39;re just a bother, so get out of here.&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>One second after I knock, she kicks me out without time for a rebuttal.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, what&#39;s with that attitude? It could get scary later if you kick away someone&#39;s goodwill.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What goodwill? We&#39;re going to be using the Tohsaka and Einzbern&#39;s secret magecraft, so there&#39;s no way we can show it to other people.</p><p>I&#39;m glad to know you want to help, but your behavior itself is harmful.

I don&#39;t really know because I only wear glasses when I&#39;m alone, but... it doesn&#39;t look funny?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I might be tricked into believing that you&#39;re an honor student even though I know your true nature. Are you trying to hide your character?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Hm? Did the room suddenly get cold?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka?

My shoulders are shaking too, Emiya-kun.</p><p>I&#39;m thinking I should settle my match with you.

She&#39;s serious.</p><p>It seems she really wants to punish me for walking around when she told me to rest and save up my energy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sorry, I was being careless. I&#39;ll go rest in my room like you told me to.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph. It&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t you have something else to do if you can walk around like that? We aren&#39;t the only ones who might need your help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Who else needs my help?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right in the next room. For her, having you by her side is a big deal. You should know that. You&#39;re the source of Sakura&#39;s energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My face burns up.</p><p>It&#39;s really embarrassing to have someone else say that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, okay, I understand.

Do you need something, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Rider must&#39;ve been in spirit form, as she suddenly appears.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Well.</p><p>I came to greet her, but I get tense when I actually stand face to face with her.</p><p>I don&#39;t care about Rider&#39;s personality to keep everyone distant from her, but as a guy, her overexposing outfit is troublesome.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I asked you if you had any business.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, no. I really don&#39;t have any. I haven&#39;t greeted you today, so I just wanted to say good morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You must have a lot of free time.&quot;</p><p>Her response is direct.</p><p>But this is within my expectations. This is actually easier for me to handle because this is what I expect from Rider.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m bored. I have some free time, so I&#39;m just walking around. Are you guarding Sakura from here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I am Sakura&#39;s Servant.</p><p>I will not protect you or Tohsaka Rin unless she gives me an order to do so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? I&#39;m glad to hear you say that.&quot;</p><p>I sigh with relief.</p><p>I was worried, but it seems Sakura isn&#39;t pushing herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thank you, Rider. Please give Sakura your best regards in the future as well.&quot;</p><p>I wave and head for the yard.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Please wait. I have a question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I stop in front of the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? There aren&#39;t many things I can answer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, this is about you, so you should be able to answer.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Emiya Shirou. I do not understand your previous statement.</p><p>I refused to be your guard. How can you call that a good thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, that&#39;s your question?</p><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;d sleep better with knowing you were guarding me, but I&#39;m a guy, and guys are supposed to protect themselves.</p><p>Tohsaka is... well, I&#39;m sure she would deal with anything that came her way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......You are going to protect yourself with that body of yours? It only sounds like a bluff to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is. We&#39;re the weaker ones, so we&#39;ll lose unless we bluff.</p><p>...Well, to be honest, I can&#39;t help but feel uneasy. But I still want you to keep this stance. It will tire Sakura if you move around. I don&#39;t want Sakura to use any more magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Moving about will certainly burden her.</p><p>I burden her just by taking form. So you do not want me to take on excess work?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. I just want you to protect Sakura.</p><p>And if I ever get killed, can you protect Illya as well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...How convenient of you. You know I am a burden, but you want to rely on me in the worst case?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah... Is that asking too much?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Rider doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>Her blindfolded eyes stare directly at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... why not make a deal? I&#39;ll definitely help you if you&#39;re in danger. It&#39;s give and take, so can you take Illya into account as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I cannot respond to that. There is a high probability that you would already be dead if I were in danger. Your proposal is not attractive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah. You&#39;re right. It&#39;s meaningless if I&#39;m dead before you&#39;re in danger. ...Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I was really being convenient.&quot;</p><hr><p>...But I&#39;m troubled now.</p><p>That means it&#39;s better to take Illya to a safer place.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t want to go the church, but leaving her alone in her castle is even more\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez. You really are unreliable.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Did you say something, Rider?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I said I will consider your proposal. If you save me when I am in danger, I shall definitely do as you wish. Is that all right, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015really...!? I was being really convenient, you know!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is reasonable. It is only if you save me first.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m stunned.</p><p>...Um, I&#39;m glad that Rider accepted my proposal, but, more than that...</p><hr><p>&quot;Rider. Did you just smile?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. There was nothing to be happy about, so there is no reason to smile.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you were smiling, even if there wasn&#39;t a reason. It was really subtle, so I almost didn&#39;t catch it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is not possible. You are mistaken as I am denying the fact.&quot;</p><p>Rider declares.</p><p>Hmm, now that she mentions it, maybe she&#39;s right.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Hm... The air is getting strangely tense now.</p><p>I was going to go back to the main building, but I&#39;m concerned about Rider.</p><p>She&#39;s silent and cold like always, but it seems like she has something she wants to say.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>The air gets tense as if we&#39;re facing off.</p><hr><p>...But...</p><p>I know this is abrupt, but Rider is tall.</p><p>Long hair, slender limbs...</p><p>I&#39;ve only seen it once, but her face under the mask was beautiful.</p><p>Tohsaka and Sakura are beautiful too, but Rider has an entirely different sort of beauty.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you have a question, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, it&#39;s not much of a question, but can I ask it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not mind. What is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. You&#39;re tall, Rider. Exactly how tall are you?&quot;</p><p>I ask her straight-out.</p><hr><p>...Wait.</p><p>Why is she backing up?</p><hr><p>&quot;Rider?&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No, it is nothing. Please do not mind me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...All right. So, how tall are you? You&#39;re taller than me, so you must be over 170.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I will not answer that question. Please ask me something different.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You won&#39;t answer? You don&#39;t know how tall you are?&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No, that is not the case. ...Regardless, please ask me something different. I will be angry if you persist in this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm.&quot;</p><p>Rider is obviously disturbed.</p><p>The usually cool Rider is flustered, so could it mean that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Rider. Are you self-conscious about your height?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Rider freezes.</p><p>It seems I guessed right.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>We both shut our mouths.</p><p>She must not be able to bear the silence...</p><hr><p>&quot;...I-Is it strange...? For me to be worried about such a thing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? No, I was just wondering why, and not because I found it strange. Why does it bother you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Is it not obvious? A tall woman like me is unsightly, unattractive\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? It&#39;s good-looking.&quot;</p><p>Actually, she&#39;s asking too much.</p><p>I want her height. Really.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>And silence again.</p><p>It finally occurs to me that I could be distracting her from guard duty.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um. Am I bothering you, Rider?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I am hiding in preparation for Matou Zouken&#39;s surprise attack. However, it will do little good if you are talking to me like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. Then I&#39;ll be going back now. I&#39;m sorry I bothered you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015hold on, Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>She stops me, and I turn around for a second time.</p><p>Rider bites her lip in annoyance, then...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015If you have free time, please go nurse Sakura. It really matters to Sakura if you are there with her or not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... you&#39;re right, I&#39;ll go right away. Sakura pushes herself when I&#39;m not watching. I&#39;ll go see if she&#39;s really resting or not.&quot;</p><hr><p>Rider&#39;s right.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s room is near here, so I&#39;ll take care of her this afternoon.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. That&#39;s right. I remember why I came here.&quot;</p><p>I turn to Rider for the third time.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What is it, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good morning, Rider. I haven&#39;t greeted you yet, right?&quot;</p><p>Good, good.</p><p>It&#39;d just be stupid if I forgot to greet her when this is the whole reason I came here.</p><hr><p>...Then.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Good morning, Shirou. Then I shall also say something I held back.&quot;</p><p>Rider regains her composure and looks down at me coldly.</p><hr><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You waste effort on useless matters. It is too late for a morning greeting. It is already after noon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh, I&#39;m sorry. I honestly forgot about you until just now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought as much. Please take better care in the future.</p><p>And please forget what I said earlier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How you must think I am a nuisance. I misunderstood you, so I take it back.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a nuisance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand that. I would expect no less from a person who comes out to greet me.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015She smiles.</p><p>I&#39;m not mistaken.</p><p>She&#39;s really smiling.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-earnest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-earnest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 Earnest</h2><p>I&#39;ll go see how Sakura&#39;s doing.</p><p>She did go back to her room, but I&#39;m worried if she&#39;s really resting or not.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09-distant-twilight-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09-distant-twilight-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09 Distant twilight(I)</h2><p>&quot;You there, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>I knock quietly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Senpai...?&quot;</p><p>I hear a sluggish voice.</p><p>&quot;Oh, please hold on.

I was sleeping, so I don&#39;t know if anything went on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing like that. I didn&#39;t come here because something happened.

I was resting like you told me to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m sorry for waking you up. You should know about your own body. You wouldn&#39;t push yourself and move around if you&#39;re sick. ...It seems I was caring excessively.&quot;</p><p>I contemplate my actions.</p><p>But Sakura starts laughing.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ugh. I&#39;m worrying too much?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not true. You&#39;re pretty sharp.</p><p>To be honest, I wanted to continue cleaning.</p><p>I was thinking about sneaking out if you didn&#39;t come.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whoa... sneak out?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I didn&#39;t want to rest when I feel fine because it makes me feel like I&#39;m sick.

Nee-san scolded me.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura sounds happy.</p><p>......I see.</p><p>She knows that Tohsaka cares about her, no matter what she said.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then you have to rest.</p><p>No matter what you may think, your body&#39;s tired. Tohsaka and I can go outside without worries if you&#39;re resting like this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. But I&#39;m really healthy. I&#39;m just not feeling well right now, and I&#39;ll be back to normal tomorrow. This is just like that cold, and I&#39;ll get over it in a day.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You idiot. I know I&#39;m not one to talk after I woke you up, but you should rest. Sleep, if you can.</p><p>I&#39;ll come wake you up for dinner, so you just relax until then.&quot;</p><p>I get up to leave.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura grabs my shirt.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m going to sleep like you told me to, but...</p><p>Um, It&#39;ll make me happy if you&#39;re by my side.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura rarely demands something.</p><p>She must not want to burden others, so she tries to do most things by herself.</p><p>But Sakura is asking something from me right now.</p><p>Well, this is nothing, but it must be the most selfish thing she can think of.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why she looks so uneasy.</p><p>I&#39;ll do any favor she asks of me, but she only asks trivial things like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay. Then I&#39;ll stay here a bit longer.&quot;</p><p>I suppress my urge to embrace Sakura and manage to tell her.</p><p>&quot;All right! Then I&#39;m going to go brew some tea! I&#39;ll treat you the best Chinese tea!&quot;</p><p>Sakura heads to the door in a hurry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. I&#39;ll brew the tea, so you stay in bed. You&#39;re putting the cart before the horse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... Y-You&#39;re right. I&#39;m acting strange.&quot;</p><p>Sakura hurries back to her bed.</p><p>I pat her head as I pass by and go to brew us some tea.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>This situation is more nerve-wracking than I thought.</p><p>I&#39;m alone with Sakura.</p><p>She&#39;s right before my eyes, and I can see her bare neck and her captivating breasts.</p><p>That alone, um\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015reminds me of what happened that night, and I don&#39;t know where to look.</p><hr><p>&quot;But to be honest... I knew you liked Nee-san. Because you&#39;re always so happy in front of her.&quot;</p><hr><p>...So everything Sakura says goes over my head.</p><p>I&#39;ll lose control if I look at her too closely.</p><p>...I&#39;m a man, you know?</p><p>Recalling what happened that night makes me want to push her down and get a taste of her body again.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not attractive like Nee-san. And you seem to like Illya-san too.</p><p>...Um, do you not like girls with big breasts?&quot;</p><hr><p>I take a deep breath and calm myself down.</p><p>I can&#39;t push her down when she&#39;s not feeling well\u2015\u2015\u2015wait, having sex with her will help her.</p><p>Then it&#39;s not bad.</p><p>It&#39;s not bad, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right! Tohsaka is next door, first of all!</p><p>They&#39;ll notice right away if I do such a thing, so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll look down on me for doing it so early in the day\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;......Wait, Sakura...? ...Um, did I do something to make you angry?&quot;</p><p>Realizing that Sakura is unhappy, I come back to the real world.</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, you haven&#39;t done anything. That&#39;s the problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Um, I said something very suggestive. You weren&#39;t listening, though.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... I&#39;m sorry. I was spaced out. Um, I think we were talking about Tohsaka...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. We were talking about Nee-san. I was asking if you&#39;re happy now that Nee-san&#39;s staying here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>I was asking Sakura about our situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;So how is it? You like Tohsaka, right? So doesn&#39;t this make you happy?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, it is delightful. But I&#39;m also feeling uneasy. Nee-san is my ideal, and she has many things I could not obtain. That&#39;s why I want to look away when she&#39;s near me, and I can&#39;t be honestly delighted.</p><p>It feels like I&#39;m being condemned by Nee-san and myself for what I&#39;m doing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can understand Sakura&#39;s point.</p><p>It&#39;s painful to have your ideal in front of you because it makes you feel inferior.</p><p>...Well, I do understand, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura. Your ideal is someone like Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>I ask timidly.</p><p>Tohsaka might punch me if she was here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve always wanted to be like Nee-san. Oh, it&#39;s not as a magus, but as a girl.</p><p>Nee-san can do anything, and she&#39;s always dignified. I want to be as cool as her.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura sounds happy.</p><p>...Hmm.</p><p>I hate to admit it, but Tohsaka certainly is cool.</p><p>She&#39;s really manly in the sense that she takes responsibility for what she says.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. But you couldn&#39;t see Tohsaka until now, right? Something about the agreement between the two families. So how do you know about her?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You can&#39;t help but wonder.</p><p>Nee-san and I don&#39;t remember about when we were small.</p><p>It was so long ago.</p><p>But we both knew that we were sisters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why we were more interested, and we watched each other from afar.</p><p>We never sat down and talked, but I heard a lot of rumors about Tohsaka-Senpai, who was a year ahead of me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. You must mean the rumor that she&#39;s a perfect honor student.</p><p>Now that you mention it, you never run out of things to talk about her since she&#39;s famous.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. And it&#39;s not like I never met her.</p><p>She would often greet me at school and come watch the archery club.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...And I would always think at those times. That I&#39;m content that she&#39;s watching me. I&#39;m happy that she&#39;s worried about me, and I knew she would hate me if I ask for more.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? Why would she hate you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...My magecraft is not like Nee-san&#39;s. There is no set limitation on how you use your magecraft.</p><p>Senpai&#39;s magecraft is to accomplish something and to create a phenomenon. There is no restricted goal set from the start.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... You&#39;re right. Strengthening is one of the only things I can do, but you can use a strengthened object to do all sorts of things.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But the Matou magecraft is different. Matou&#39;s magecraft is limited to &#39;stealing away from others&#39;.</p><p>There is no other use for it. It only feeds on other people&#39;s pain, and there is no teaching to return their happiness.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t just nod in response to that.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of magecraft she was taught at the Matou household.</p><p>The magecraft she was taught is a heresy, and Sakura is ashamed of it.</p><hr><p>...The problem between Sakura and Tohsaka is the difference in their family&#39;s magecraft.</p><p>The more Sakura hates the magecraft of Matou, the more self-loathing she feels\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;So you hate magecraft of Matou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Senpai. That&#39;s like asking someone if she hates breathing.&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Sakura looks up and starts talking like Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t like it or hate it. I just couldn&#39;t live without it.</p><p>I was adopted by the Matou family for that reason alone. If I hadn&#39;t been able to succeed them, I would have died.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, please don&#39;t make a face like that. The teaching was certainly strict, but it wasn&#39;t as tough as you may think.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And if you want to talk about strictness, it&#39;s not even close to your training.</p><p>I&#39;m fine with getting hurt by others, but I&#39;m scared of hurting myself.</p><p>I want to live, so I can&#39;t end it myself.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind other people cutting my wrist, but I&#39;m scared to cut it myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But you can do either. ...Um, I&#39;ve seen your nightly training.</p><p>I-It was only once, though. I forgot something here, came back, heard something in the shed, and went to check it out.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura bows her head in apology.</p><p>But I don&#39;t want her apologizing for something like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to apologize. That&#39;s carelessness on my side. I&#39;m a failure as a magus if I can&#39;t notice the presence around me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...............Um.&quot;</p><p>&quot;More importantly, when was that? Was it right after you started coming here?&quot;</p><p>I really hope so.</p><p>I&#39;m improving, even though it may be really slowly.</p><p>If I didn&#39;t notice Sakura&#39;s presence recently, that means I haven&#39;t improved at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It was last summer. It&#39;s the day Fujimura-Sensei brought a watermelon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see, that&#39;s good.&quot;</p><p>I sigh with relief.</p><p>I guess I can excuse myself if it was half a year ago.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So, um, Sakura. ...Well, what did you think?&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s the first person besides Kiritsugu who saw me training in magecraft.</p><p>I practiced in front of Tohsaka these past few days, but that&#39;s different from the training I do in the shed.</p><hr><p>So Sakura&#39;s opinion is like a test.</p><p>Sakura is Matou&#39;s magus, so I might be able to get a good score\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Umm. I guess I&#39;ll use my right to remain silent. I&#39;m not Nee-san, but it&#39;d be terrible if I put a score on it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015does that mean I got a failing score?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahaha, you can say it&#39;s a really bad failing score.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t seem similar to her sister, but she actually is.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Senpai. That&#39;s the only time I saw it. ...No, I couldn&#39;t see it again because I was too scared.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Too scared...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Not only that, but I thought many times that I should stop you.</p><p>...Your training isn&#39;t normal. It looked to me like you were stabbing your own throat. It&#39;s not that I imagined it, but it really did look that way. ...Your training was that dangerous.&quot;</p><hr><p>I understand what Sakura wants to say.</p><p>Creating a Magic Circuit is close to death for me.</p><p>My body would explode if the concentration in me is off by a few millimeters.</p><p>But isn&#39;t that an ordinary compensation for a magus?</p><p>Kiritsugu was the one who told me that death is a magus&#39; constant companion.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Really? I hear that it&#39;s like that for all magi. Maybe it looks dangerous for me because I&#39;m unskilled.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s not a question of skill. First of all, you&#39;re special in that you can use magecraft when you don&#39;t have the talent.</p><p>magecraft is not something you use, but something you teach the body. No magus creates a new Magic Circuit for each spell the way you do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m talking about the final result.</p><p>...Every night, you did something that could kill you. Nobody forced you, and you didn&#39;t get anything out of it. But you stubbornly continued.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I think that&#39;s something even Nee-san can&#39;t do.</p><p>You follow through on what you&#39;ve decided until the very end, regardless of whether it&#39;s right or not. So you&#39;re probably the strongest one out of all of us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I-It&#39;s really embarrassing if you say something like that with a straight face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015You idiot, I&#39;m not giving you anything, not even if you flatter me!</p><p>F-First of all, Tohsaka&#39;s the strong one! A-And I don&#39;t know what kind of a magus you are, but you&#39;re the successor of Matou, and you also have Rider...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you are strong, Senpai. It&#39;s not because of your Magic Circuit or your talent, but because your mind is pure.</p><p>...I knew that from the very first time I met you.</p><p>I knew you would never betray anyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015well...&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to respond when she talks seriously like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Thanks. I&#39;m glad you said that, even if you&#39;re just flattering me.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m embarrassed, but I tell her how I feel.</p><p>Sakura...</p><p>Smiles happily and looks straight at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>This is bad.</p><p>The distracting thoughts I shook off earlier will return if she makes a face like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, I guess I&#39;ll get going now. You&#39;re sleepy too, right? There&#39;s always tonight, so you should rest well in the afternoon.&quot;</p><p>I cough intentionally.</p><p>I look to the wall... to Tohsaka and Illya on the other side.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right. There&#39;s tonight too, and Nee-san is next door.&quot;</p><p>She must understand how I feel, as she blushes and starts muttering.</p><p>...I bet I look like that too.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;m going back to my room. I&#39;ll come get you when it&#39;s dinnertime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015please hold on, Senpai...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What is it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;U-Um... I&#39;d be really happy if... you could stay here until I fall asleep...&quot;</p><p>I bitterly smile at her intermittent words.</p><p>Actually, it&#39;s something I want to ask her if I can.</p><p>She&#39;s so timid that she probably doesn&#39;t even know how much I&#39;ve fallen for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll stay here if I&#39;m not a bother. I&#39;ll go after you fall asleep. Is that fine?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Of course! I&#39;ll do my best to stay up!&quot;</p><p>But Sakura...</p><p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re saying that, but that defeats the whole point.</p><hr><p>Sakura suddenly falls silent once she lies down.</p><p>She must&#39;ve been tired. It looks like she suddenly got sleepy once she laid down.</p><hr><p>But still...</p><p>&quot;But Senpai. I&#39;ll get well if I rest today, but what about your arm?&quot;</p><p>She must have no intention of going to sleep, as Sakura keeps talking.</p><hr><p>&quot;My arm is doing fine. It doesn&#39;t hurt as long as I keep this cloth on, and it&#39;s slowly starting to move. At this pace, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll move fine by tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s good. It&#39;s been a while since Nee-san treated it, right? It looked like it was just first-aid, so I thought the effect might&#39;ve worn off.&quot;</p><p>Sakura smiles with relief.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015. What do you mean, it&#39;s been a while?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nee-san&#39;s at fault too. She&#39;s free to transfer her crest, but the Tohsaka&#39;s Magic Crest will never familiarize itself with anyone not from the Tohsaka family. She should know it was just a makeshift that won&#39;t even last seven days.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura says it like it&#39;s nothing.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;Won&#39;t even last seven days...?&quot;</p><p>It sounds very out of place.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s about to wear off, so you have to get properly treated. My magecraft can&#39;t solve the root problem, so I&#39;ll ask Rider if she has any good ideas\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura looks sleepy.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t reply.</p><p>...I can only convince myself that Sakura is saying strange things because she&#39;s about to fall asleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re there, right, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Good. Please stay by my side, Senpai.</p><p>I have nightmares if I&#39;m alone, so please\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Sakura slowly closes her eyes.</p><p>Her breathing becomes more gentle, and she goes into a deep sleep.</p><hr><p>I turn off the light and leave her room.</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>I saw Sakura fall asleep peacefully, but I don&#39;t feel any peace of mind.</p><hr><p>So please\u2015\u2015\u2015keep watch and be on your guard against me.</p><hr><p>...I think that&#39;s what she said unconsciously...</p><p>...Right before she fell asleep.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-10-distortion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-10-distortion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 10 Distortion</h2><p>&quot;I&#39;m coming in, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>He opens the door without waiting for a reply.</p><p>He has never waited for his younger sister&#39;s reply before opening this door.</p><hr><p>&quot;What, she&#39;s not home yet? What a slug.&quot;</p><p>He clucks his tongue and walks into the room.</p><p>Scratching at the wall, Matou Shinji wanders through his sister&#39;s room like a blind dog.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. Are you in the basement again? What&#39;re you doing down there, ignoring me?&quot;</p><p>He keeps asking questions that will not be answered.</p><p>There is no one in the room.</p><p>His sister has not been home the past few days.</p><p>It is obvious that the master of this room is not here, but Shinji wanders through it all the same.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s just like always. Haha, it really is like always!&quot;</p><p>He throws the clock that touches his hand.</p><p>The sound of shattering glass is more annoying than he thought.</p><hr><p>&quot;Where the hell are you? Keeping a secret from your brother?

I&#39;ll go too. It&#39;s dangerous for you two to go out alone, so...&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura.&quot;</p><p>...That must be why she&#39;s here.</p><p>I appreciate her concern. but our plan is already determined.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. You should know you&#39;re Zouken&#39;s target. Please stay here with Illya and protect yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. But you can only use one arm, Senpai. And Nee-san doesn&#39;t have a Servant, so...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Sakura. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re our enemy. I can&#39;t trust you with my back when I don&#39;t know when you&#39;ll turn into Zouken&#39;s puppet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But, Nee-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You just concentrate on protecting yourself. If you feel sorry for us, please don&#39;t trouble us about this. Just let Rider protect you and Illya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015whoa, hey...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, don&#39;t just stand there. Let&#39;s get going.

I&#39;ll leave Illya to you...!&quot;</p><p>I leave with Tohsaka pulling at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t say anything and stands at the entrance, lonely.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, wait, Tohsaka! I&#39;ll follow you, so let go of me already!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Humph. It&#39;s your fault for being slow.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka lets go and comes to a halt.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What&#39;s with that face? If you have something to say, then spit it out.&quot;</p><p>And it&#39;s like this all of a sudden.</p><p>Tohsaka is acting defiantly.</p><p>...Man.</p><p>If it bothers her that much, she shouldn&#39;t have said it in the first place.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. Then I&#39;m saying it, Tohsaka. It&#39;s about what happened now, but don&#39;t say such things to Sakura. Sakura isn&#39;t like that because she wants to be.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. But that&#39;s why I have to be firm with her. If we aren&#39;t, Zouken will be sure to take advantage.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...This is a good opportunity, so let me straighten this out. I don&#39;t feel any sympathy towards Sakura.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t concern me if she&#39;s Zouken&#39;s puppet, and I have nothing to do with what happened to her after she was adopted to the Matou family. It does no good for me to say anything about her problem.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look. I&#39;m at your house not because Sakura is there, but because you&#39;re there.</p><p>My goal is not to save Sakura, but to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>I&#39;ll keep watch on Sakura for that goal, and I don&#39;t care even if she hates me for it. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll say things like that, and I&#39;m going to keep treating her as my enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...So it won&#39;t bother you at all if she hates you? Her feelings don&#39;t matter because she&#39;s a complete stranger?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. Do you have any complaints?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You idiot. Of course I do.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Man, this is not like Tohsaka.</p><p>She should be able to say it like it&#39;s nothing. Instead, she&#39;s clenching her fists like she&#39;s trying to convince herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. If you want to act that way, then go ahead.</p><p>Sakura knows how you feel, no matter what kind of attitude you take towards her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015what do you mean by that!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m talking about how important Sakura is to you. I&#39;m an outsider and I notice it, so it should be obvious to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s a misunderstanding. I just...&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing to misunderstand. People can&#39;t get seriously mad about things they don&#39;t care about. You&#39;re strict to Sakura for a reason. You don&#39;t say it, but she&#39;s still your precious sister.&quot;</p><p>&quot;W\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What are you saying, you idiot!!? Stop saying such snobby things!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s face turns red with anger.</p><p>But I don&#39;t feel the usual intensity, and I know why.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh? Was it a bother?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is a bother. Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then while I&#39;m at it, I have something else to say. I want you and Sakura to get along. She likes you, and you like her. So I don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s this awkward between you two.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey now. She has to be my enemy. Making friends with her now won&#39;t do any good. I wouldn&#39;t even know where to start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t it fine as is? Have confidence in yourself, Tohsaka. Even I can tell that you&#39;re being a good big sister.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015E-Enough with the chatting! We&#39;re going to the place they showed in the news this morning!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks away and starts to walk.</p><p>I reply to her absent-mindedly and follow.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>She calls my name without looking at me and...</p><p>&quot;Um, thanks. That made me, um... happy.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka grumbles, embarrassed.</p><hr><p>...There&#39;s nobody at the central park.</p><p>The park that&#39;s deserted even during the day is even quieter after the murder yesterday.</p><p>The park is not a place for relaxation within the business district, and it is no different from a desert in an uncultivated land.</p><hr><p>&quot;...A murder, huh? It seems people are treating it as an accident rather than a murder case. Well, I guess you really can&#39;t call it murder when you can&#39;t tell who died and what the missing body parts are.&quot;</p><hr><p>I still see traces of blood on the grass.</p><p>...It looks like a bucketful was spilled in four separate areas.</p><p>The darkened patches have some distance between them, probably because the victims frantically tried to escape.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. You said this might be Zouken&#39;s doing, but what do you think now? Do you still think so after coming here?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Let&#39;s see. I thought it might be the black shadow&#39;s doing, but it doesn&#39;t seem that way.</p><p>All the magical energy in the area would be swallowed if that thing had appeared. But the magical energy here isn&#39;t exhausted. ...Well, I still think the incident here was an unexpected meal.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s all the information we can get out of this place.</p><p>Tohsaka and I leave the site of the tragedy behind us.</p><hr><p>...We didn&#39;t find anything in Shinto.</p><p>Maybe Zouken is not active tonight, probably because the incident yesterday was so vivid.</p><hr><p>The date&#39;s about to change.</p><p>A riverside breeze blows as we trudge home.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Sakura is the successor of Matou, right?&quot;</p><p>I suddenly feel like asking the question that was on my mind for a while.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why are you asking that now? I have nothing to hide.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant. If she&#39;s the successor, that means she&#39;s a magus, right? So I&#39;m wondering what kind of magecraft she uses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I see now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, I hear Matou&#39;s magecraft is in bindings and coercions. I also hear that the Command Spell wouldn&#39;t have been possible without Matou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. So Sakura&#39;s magecraft is restriction? But then...&quot;</p><p>On that day...</p><p>The magecraft Sakura used when the crest worm tortured her must have been Rider&#39;s power.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I don&#39;t think it&#39;s restriction. That&#39;s the Makiri&#39;s forbidden magecraft, and it&#39;s not their strong point.</p><p>But it&#39;s meaningless to think about it. Sakura doesn&#39;t have the magical energy to use magecraft. The crest worm will feed on such excess energy first, so she shouldn&#39;t be able to use magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see, that&#39;s good. So, how good is Sakura in your eyes? Is she about as good as you, considering she&#39;s the Matou successor?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have about the same number of magecraft-Circuits.</p><p>Did you forget that we&#39;re sisters?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>That&#39;s why they wanted to adopt her in the first place.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so she&#39;s about as good as you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so. My attribute is &#39;five elements&#39;, and hers is &#39;imaginary element&#39;. But the Matou family has a water attribute, so they changed her by force. What do you think would happen to a bird that has a potential to fly if it&#39;s put in water?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;ll die, or...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Adapting to the water would be all it could do.</p><p>She would&#39;ve had great success as a magus of Tohsaka, but she&#39;s no different from you because she was forced to change into a magus of Matou.</p><p>No, you&#39;re much stronger than her because you train your body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let&#39;s say you and Sakura fought using magecraft...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d win ten times out of ten. With her magical energy capacity, Sakura would never get past my barrier.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t figure out what kind of magus Sakura is, but I got to know their power balance.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t one to bluff, so she must be speaking the truth.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But I&#39;m embarrassed. I never knew Sakura was a magus, and I don&#39;t know how good she is. I&#39;m a dumbass for pretending to be her guardian all this times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey now. The crest worm eats the magical energy in her, so you&#39;d never know she&#39;s a magus even if you&#39;re by her all the time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...And she did her best not to let you know.

On top of you...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re doing it today, right? Just spread your legs and move yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I lie down and have Sakura come on top of me.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have anything specific in mind.</p><p>I just thought I&#39;d be able to connect deeper with her this way.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........Um, like this...?&quot;</p><p>Sakura puts her knees on the floor and sits over my crotch.</p><p>Sakura looks like she feels awkward being on top, but all that&#39;s left is to drop her body.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, Senpai. I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s all right. I won&#39;t do anything until you get comfortable. You can move at your own pace.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........Okay.

You&#39;re right...&quot;</p><p>She must be nervous, as her walls are different from before.</p><p>They still wrap warmly around me, but they don&#39;t squeeze.</p><p>It seems Sakura doesn&#39;t have the composure to concentrate on her hips.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...? You have to lower yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh, okay...&quot;</p><p>But she doesn&#39;t.</p><p>She just looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Is there a reason you can&#39;t?&quot;</p><p>&quot;U-Um... It&#39;s because... you can see everything in this position...&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s causing Sakura to get nervous.</p><p>Embarrassment and hesitation.</p><p>She caressed my penis so intently, but it seems having her vagina seen is embarrassing.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine.

Ahh... ah, hm...!&quot;</p><p>She slowly lowers herself.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015As she said, I can see everything from here.</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s weight causes my penis to penetrate deeply into her.</p><p>I can clearly see her slit and her clit showing underneath her pubes.</p><p>It&#39;s wet between us, and she&#39;s overflowing with her desires.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... This is certainly embarrassing. Did you have an orgasm back then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... ah... No...! I-I only started feeling good after being in this position...!&quot;</p><hr><p>She gives a cute excuse as she keeps lowering herself.</p><p>She must have wanted it so bad that she can&#39;t stop herself now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, hm...! No, Senpai&#39;s looking, but I want it in deeper\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her knees completely bend.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s soft butt touches my thighs.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... ha... hm, haa... ah...

Then lift yourself up now. Keep moving until you get used to it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm... All right. I&#39;ll keep moving, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>She slowly lifts herself.</p><p>My penis is gradually exposed to the outside air.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Haa...

It&#39;s heavy, and I can&#39;t stop my butt...!&quot;</p><hr><p>This position gives me too much pleasure.</p><p>My penis goes in and out like last time, but the sensation is different.</p><p>Is it because she&#39;s on top of me?</p><p>Sakura&#39;s body is more sensual than last time, and she seems to be wetter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The feel of her weight on me is so lovely that I reach out unconsciously.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...

I, again\u2026\u201D<br> Sakura apologizes.</p><p>\u201C---\u201D<br> But I\u2019m the one who should apologize.<br> The reason why Sakura\u2019s here.<br> I know well enough the pain she has to go through.<br> The crest worm feeds on her magical energy, so Sakura periodically needs to receive more from a magus.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I should\u2019ve gone to see you as soon as I came home. I\u2019m sorry for making you suffer.\u201D<br> I stand up.<br> I was so caught up with my left arm that I forgot about Sakura.

It\u2019s a bewitching sweetness, different from when she was licking my fingers.</p><p>\u201CUh---\u201D<br> I grit my teeth and hold back my voice.<br> My blood is being taken, but the pleasant feeling pours in in its place.<br> The pain from the cut becomes dim, and I can barely feel my right arm anymore.</p><p>Sakura is pressed to my arm, drinking deeply.<br> I know this is to replenish Sakura\u2019s magical energy, but to think it would be this sweet\uE011</p><p>\u201CMm, mmm\u2026\u201D<br> Sakura\u2019s murmuring voice stimulates my nerves.<br> The pleasure of her drinking my blood reaches all the way to the shoulder.
