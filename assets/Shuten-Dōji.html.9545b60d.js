The \u201Csake\u2019s\u201D only purpose for her is to pollute the surroundings with poison at once. By manipulating its concentration, she can bestow every bad status ailment. If it is at its greatest concentration, it will decompose all of the living body, leaving nothing but a few bones behind. The gourd for the sake, held underneath her arm, can further change into a weapon that holds a sword in its mouth, and also, it is said to even be a cage that locks up the spoils that fascinated Shuten-douji.</p><h1 id="bone-collector-the-riot-of-a-hundred-flowers-my-nickname" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bone-collector-the-riot-of-a-hundred-flowers-my-nickname" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Bone Collector: The Riot of a Hundred Flowers (My Nickname)</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>An ability Shuten-douji was endowed with since birth, or a super-high grade special move.

A demon wearing a girl\u2019s form, narrowing her eyes and licking her lips with her seductive tongue. It may not be known that although her outward appearance properly resembles a human girl, Shuten-douji is not a human being. Even though she seems to communicate with words like a human being, she is essentially different from human beings. Her preferences are similar to a human\u2019s, but for her to love something is especially said to be a theory, from the idea that if she suddenly killed the things she loved with her own hands, it could not be understood by humans as love. Although she knows love, requests love, and clasps love to her breasts, it is impossible to overlap that love with the right people. Her love is accompanied with blood; her love spreads death; her love tears one\u2019s heart. The impulse hidden below her white naked body is surely swelling up, being twisted, and rolling over from side to side.<br> Therefore; one can say with confidence that she is a demon.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Shuten-douji does not speak of her wish for the Holy Grail.

It appears that she attaches an importance to an article\u2019s rarity and the elegance of their appearance, so she is incompatible with, for instance, the Hero King who attaches an importance to an article\u2019s performance and history.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CHeehee.

There are various theories about Shuten-douji\u2019s origins. There is a theory where she is considered the child of a human and the Great God Ibuki of Mount Ibuki (- Yamata no Orochi), and there is another theory where she is considered the heaven-sent child of Mount Togakushi (- Kuzuryuu). At any rate, she is the child of a Dragon God, possessing a shared background with Sakata Kintoki.</p><p>Because of the disappearances of young men and princesses at the Imperial Capital happening one after another, Abe no Seimei was in the process of doing a divination to find out the culprit, and he ascertained the matter to be the deed of Shuten-douji. Raikou\u2019s Four Heavenly Kings, lead by Minamoto no Raikou himself, was ordered to subjugate her, arriving at the Oni\u2019s castle while dressed in itinerant Buddhist monk attires. At the banquet, Raikou and the others made Shuten-douji and her group drink poisoned sake, then attacked them while they were asleep, punishing them. Shuten-douji\u2019s removed head attacked Raikou, but it is said that the attack was thwarted due to the latter\u2019s helmet that was given by a god.</p><p>In this work, it was Ibaraki-douji who was the boss and ringleader of the Oni on Mount Ooe, and Shuten-douji was perching on the oni palace of Mount Ooe as some kind of house guest\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That was the taken point of view. However, the one who was viewed by the gods as the ancestor, Ibuki-douji \u2013 that is to say, the existence of Shuten-douji \u2013 was certainly adequate enough to draw the attention of the authorities of ancient Kyoto, Abe no Seimei, and the others. Surely, the most dangerous existence among the Oni of Mount Ooe was no doubt Shuten-douji, so to speak.</p><p>Whether she is the direct \u201Cchild\u201D of the Great God Ibuki, or whether she is a \u201Cdescendant\u201D who succeeded its blood, it is not clear. In the end, Shuten-douji herself does not speak about her origins. The alias called Ibuki-douji is just something attached to her by Ibaraki-douji, who saw the true nature of Yamata no Orochi\u2019s power in her. It may not be discovered that Shuten-douji herself has forgotten her past and the likes of it. As long as there is beguiling alcohol, brilliant banquets and enjoyable performances, she has no regrets.</p><p>And yet\u2026 from the way it seems, one cannot conclude that Shuten-douji had completely forgotten her past in regard to the existence of Sakata Kintoki \u2013 one who possesses origins similar to her owns (being the child of a man-eating witch and a Dragon God) \u2013 the man hanging in her mind ever since the time when he was young.</p><p>Shuten-douji\u2019s connection with Sakata Kintoki continues on since that time. Given that this companion was easy to tease on some occasions, she had a good time while being accompanied with snacks and alcohol. As far as Shuten is concerned, they are no more than drinking bouts, but as far as Kintoki is concerned, they are demonic banquets that would kill him if he took the atmosphere lightly. \u201CTo struggle for life while intoxicated in alcohol. Isn\u2019t it romantic to cheat each other while hugging our bodies?\u201D That is Shuten\u2019s eloquence.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki</strong></p><p>\u201CFufu.
