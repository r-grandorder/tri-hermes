He taught others the basics of the shinobi, its philosophy and logic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that wasn&#39;t enough.<br> Not nearly enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As long as one&#39;s memory is fresh, passing the teachings through oral instruction is the most accurate method. But as life goes on and one&#39;s memory begins to fade, that method becomes less reliable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At that point, recording teachings in text is the best method, but its accuracy is then questioned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In order to perfect the ninjutsu that Fuuma created, oral instruction and a clear mental acuity so one neither forgets nor is forgotten are best.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the fifth leader of the clan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I shake my head in denial. As long as the fourth leader still lives, I am not the fifth leader.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Incorrect. You will soon be the fifth leader. And the shinobi techniques that I have been entrusted with must be passed along to you in order for you to become what you are destined to be.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Everything...I shall teach you and pass down everything. Now please...give me your hand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And from then on, until I grew to adulthood, I called her Mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every time I called her that, she would tilt her head as if confused. But in my mind, anyone who teaches somebody something is to be considered a parent.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I thought I should call her Mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The age of the shinobi was coming to an end. The Houjou clan perished, and the nation was being unified.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Fuuma clan was convinced that their end was near. The Fuuma as ninjas, at the least, would end here.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s what the times have become.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame for the Fuuma clan to perish.<br> But there are still ways to survive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even if it meant taking on the guise of a burglar or a thief in order to keep the Fuuma clan alive...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But should that happen...what would happen to you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Do not worry yourself over that.<br> I can no longer move anyway.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> For five generations, I have been watching over the Fuuma.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> My operational period is long since passed, and I can no longer recall the faces of the previous leaders.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> The techniques of the shinobi...even throwing a shuriken...all gone from my memory.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> The only thing that remains within me is...your face.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, I ask that you do the role of my kaishaku, to behead me, in one sweep. I am asking you, personally, to do this for me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> And by doing so, I can declare you to be my greatest accomplishment and masterpiece of the Fuuma clan.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> The strongest...the last...the best ninja.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...My memory is a bit hazy. There&#39;s no way I could remember everything in my past life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah...but what did I do right after that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master.<br> We have failed to summon Katou Danzo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to our staff&#39;s analysis, it appears there was an error in the summoning path.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t understand the cause of the error.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. And that&#39;s why [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru...you will be heading over to the...\u201Cother\u201D Japan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Based on what I heard about the dream you had...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If an error occurred in summoning Katou Danzo,<br> its source likely lies in this dreamed-of Japan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You will need to settle the matter there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That woman you fought is the worst. I&#39;m sure she has no intention of becoming a Servant here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But that one planted some seeds and left them behind. Think of this as one of them sprouting.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And it has, in turn, caused this error.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I thought...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, I thought we couldn&#39;t go back?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely. And that&#39;s why you should head over there in its proper time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In that timeline, she&#39;s there.<br> So go save her.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And do you know which Servant should accompany you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already asked Miss Da Vinci to prepare a Rayshift. Now go and settle this once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go call him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, do so.<br> It&#39;s about time for him to settle matters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Going to that...proper age of that time?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> Then yes, it makes sense for me to accompany you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Not just as a Servant, but as Fuuma Kotarou...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I will happily accompany you, my Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> But first, I will need to prepare.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Yes. With this Spirit Origin form,<br> I&#39;m a little concerned about my defenses.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Nin!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Spirit Origin, released.<br> Now I can fight with my full power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was ninpou...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was ninjutsu...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It&#39;s very similar to magecraft.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s head out.<br> To that time period...to the village of the Fuuma...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Fuuma flourished for five generations, and those who learned the Fuuma technique numbered well over one hundred. But in my opinion...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The one who reached the Fuuma&#39;s true ideal was its fifth leader. And only him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He, in whose veins runs the blood of an outsider, and the blood of the oni, made manifest through magecraft.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His blood was mixed, and he himself had incredible latent ability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Naturally talented...is perhaps the best way to describe him. That innate talent was what the first Lord Fuuma strove to have; to be a ninja exactly like him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But there was one thing that god did not grant him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the desire for praise. The drive to get to the top, even if it meant sabotaging others, just did not exist within him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Had he possessed such characteristic, no doubt he would have been quietly by the bedside of the general who unified the nation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As a result, the Fuuma clan was on the verge of extinction. Or rather...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Fuuma clan&#39;s goal had likely been accomplished the moment the fifth Fuuma Kotarou was born.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The greatest shinobi, who, though human,<br> brought the power of the oni with him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps that was the first leader&#39;s\u2013and Kashin Koji&#39;s\u2013aim.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No... I am only a puppet.<br> Such things are not my concern.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I digress.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Some memory or record of mine was just wiped.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had no purpose in living...no purpose in dying.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah...so then why am I here?<br> Why do I stay here? Why am I bound here?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even though there is something I need to do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. We&#39;re detecting a strong magical energy response...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine, Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No matter who she is, or what she is,<br> our objective is the same.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> And I must be the one to complete this task.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Not as a Servant or as an Assassin, but as Fuuma Kotarou, fifth leader of the Fuuma Clan.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> This is my burden to bear.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Master, I am so sorry for dragging you into this!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Underlings are approaching.<br> I will eradicate them. Please stand watch, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t remember... I don&#39;t remember whether I beheaded her as she asked or not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe I would have been able to do it,<br> but I regret that I could not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both sentiments are there, giving me pain.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I could never get used to being called Mother.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Whenever I was called that,<br> something inside me squeaked, so I...oiled it.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I thought that, over time, being addressed that way would become second nature to me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Mother.<br> Did I ever do anything to deserve that title?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> The only thing I did was continue to teach the techniques of the shinobi to each generation.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Faster than yesterday, higher than yesterday,<br> smarter than yesterday, stronger than yesterday.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I was merely a being, a puppet, meant to make him that way. Ever since my own operational period ended, that was what I decided.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I have no right to be called a mother.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It was fine.<br> That was enough.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We only had one objective.<br> To complete the Fuuma clan.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So please do not belittle that fact.<br> You did everything in your power.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> And especially...whenever I perfected a technique, you always said to me:</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes, excellent work, Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Those words alone were the greatest reward for me.<br> That was all that I needed.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> They held such strong sentiment. Even if it was as minute as a dew drop, that was enough. No, I didn&#39;t need anything more.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Had I been fulfilled, I wouldn&#39;t have become complete. Being hungry for the smallest of sentiment was enough.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> So, please...do not try to satisfy my needs.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Your very existence is what fulfills me.<br> Such sentiment is usually unnecessary to a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Oh, but...perhaps I had already...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...served my purpose.<br> And now that I&#39;m not needed anymore, I am merely junk.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Perhaps that&#39;s why I find something so simple so fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost at the village of the Fuuma.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> This era was somewhat peaceful,<br> but it was quite tumultuous for me personally.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Our days were not calm,<br> and our fates unclear.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We fought, we killed, we pillaged...<br> We fought, we were killed, we were pillaged...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Despite our actions,<br> we were all desperate to find our destiny.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> As we were searching for some shining place without light, we mindlessly practiced our techniques.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you ever regret it?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No. Absolutely not.<br> I never had a single ounce of regret.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Just like you, Master.<br> I have never felt regret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nothing came of that?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Yes. You&#39;re absolutely right.<br> Nothing at all came about from our efforts.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> In extreme terms, the name Fuuma left a mark in history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve taken a bit of a detour it seems.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Were she here, she would be somewhere dark, where no light could reach.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> She did not like the sun, because she always believed that it mocked and ridiculed her.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...But I never thought so. She was a beautiful combat doll, and she was the one person I opened up to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, Kotarou...I&#39;m getting an intense response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve scanned the topography.<br> There seems to be a cave five hundred meters ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s likely there.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> Then let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I did not like bright places.<br> I hid that by saying it was because I was a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A lie that even children can see through.<br> But I didn&#39;t want to be seen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I hated myself, more than anyone else.<br> But without that hatred, I would not be a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A shinobi first and foremost works from the heart.<br> Without it, I would just be an inanimate object.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Voices...<br> I hear voices.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, human voices.<br> Don&#39;t come in here...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something dear to me is hidden here.<br> Something special is sealed away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must protect this place,<br> or else I would no longer be Katou Danzo...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Please stand back I believe we have arrived.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Go away... Go away...<br> Please. I beg of you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Mother.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who...? It doesn&#39;t matter...<br> I need to protect this place...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, you do not.<br> You must leave this grave to time now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> A shinobi is destined to disappear like dust.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Her lingering thoughts must have been used and manipulated by an abominable entity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you stop it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you fight her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Of course.<br> This is why I came along.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who...are you...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I will answer once I&#39;ve destroyed you!<br> Engaging!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Yah! Die!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All enemy signals have disappeared.<br> Good work, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I will make preparations for your return.<br> Please wait.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No. There&#39;s one thing that needs to be done.<br> Let&#39;s keep going, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...Who...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I am the fifth leader, Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...That name...oh...are you...really...the fifth leader?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Do you remember me?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> But...Fuuma...is here...<br> It&#39;s right...here...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> This must be the grave.<br> Our grave. The Fuuma clan&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Those who were left to die in the elements...those who have gone missing...those who were abandoned...or those who simply died...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It&#39;s the unknown and unmarked grave of us as ninja. Your task was to protect this place and to raise the next generation.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes...that&#39;s why...I must...raise the next...Fuuma...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> That is my duty.<br> The purpose of my existence.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that anymore.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Katou Danzo. In the name of the fifth leader,<br> I hereby relieve you of your duty.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I...refuse...<br> There is no proof...that you are the fifth leader...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> His face, his voice, and even his scent...all gone from my...memories... The truth...I no longer have...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Then touch me, Katou Danzo.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> This flesh of mine has been shaped by the Fuuma.<br> Should you touch me, you will understand.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...Ah...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Fuuma...Fuuma Kotarou...<br> My...their...coveted completed form...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...Then the final swing of a sword... If you are truly the real Fuuma Kotarou...you know what to do...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Kaishaku...assisting you by beheading.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I, Fuuma Kotarou, shall see this task be carried out.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I will see to it that the Fuuma line ends here.<br> That this is the end of the shinobi&#39;s journey.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Because that is our conviction.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes...precisely...<br> Ah...even though I cannot see...I can tell...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> The Fuuma...I have...most definitely...reached the end...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad...even with all my memories gone...I&#39;m glad to be able to see this conclusion...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Thank you, fifth one...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No.<br> The Fuuma should be the one thanking you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Mother.<br> Please have a pleasant journey.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Mother...<br> Mot...her...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Ah, that word...brings back memories...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Master, I know this may be pointless...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> But would you mind if I dig a grave?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Want me to help?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.<br> But actually, I want to do this on my own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> Then...if you would give me a moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No grave marker, no posthumous name.<br> Just numerous unnamed shinobi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> But at the same time, that is something to be proud of. That&#39;s what it means to be one of us.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> We do not strive to be celebrated.<br> We take pride in our anonymity.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure my grave is somewhere here too. Marked not as Fuuma Kotarou, but as an unnamed shinobi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> And now, Katou Danzo has finally joined us.<br> One of the few who knew the first leader&#39;s techniques.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> She completed educating and raising the fifth leader, and she understood that her duties were fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m satisfied.<br> Yes, what a wonderful ending.</p><p>I was able to include her to be one of us...as \u201Cjust\u201D another ninja.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Ah, but...just one last thing...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At the very end, I unthinkingly called her \u201CMother.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good work, Master.<br> And I have some news.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With the correction of the Singularity that you were just in, a new Spirit Origin was added to our list.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is:</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CBlack Kite\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Katou Danzo?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Nice to meet you.<br> You must be the fifth Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> You must be Katou Danzo.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Perhaps because my Spirit Origin was damaged, I have no memories of my past, other than my battle data.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> I do recall that I had something to do with the first Lord Fuuma, but...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I see. If we return to the village of the Fuuma,<br> we should be able to find your grave.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Though, we are in a completely different time period. I am the fifth leader.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Yes. It appears that I was most active as a shinobi long before you were born.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> That is what Da Vinci has told me.<br> So, this is the first time we have spoken.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> ...Well, I&#39;m relieved.<br> So the Fuuma really did fulfill their dream.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> After all, you, a perfect shinobi,<br> did indeed come to be.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> (...That was all thanks to your help.)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> (Everything that you did... Even the fact that I stand here today...all of it is thanks to you.)</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong><br> Hm? Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...I forgot to properly introduce myself.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Katou Danzo.
