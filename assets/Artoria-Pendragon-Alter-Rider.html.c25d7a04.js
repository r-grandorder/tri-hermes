And as the person in charge of their education, she supervises the Master around the clock for the sake of making them into a Master who can stand on their own; a Spartan maid. She assesses that her cold-hearted behaviour and strict words are all for the Master\u2019s future. She has a summer sweeper (cleaning shop) as well, making use of it to remove anything and everything that would become an obstacle to the Master with all her energy. Since there is no king\u2019s crown with her, there will also be a girlish side to her appropriate for her age that appears more often than the times when she was in the Saber Class. Though she will coolly pout if that does not matter to the Master.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CServant, Rider.

For you see, even I am surprised. Contrary to expectations, a swimsuit is fine too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI appear before you in a new Class.

It is summer after all. But because of some kind of conviction she found, she had put away the King\u2019s crown and had instead put on a touchingly lovely white crown\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014a white brim.</p><p>Yes. She is a maid.</p><p>Tempted by the Magical Energy of Summer, Alter completely changed her clothes for a swimsuit (though the person herself has not realized it, nor will she speak about it).</p><p>\u201CI am absolutely not what you would commonly call a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit. If you want to know why, it is because before being a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit, I am firstly a maid.\u201D</p><p>Indeed, it is a sound argument that leaves one lost for words. However, her personality, which was already too serious since the beginning, got even more serious by becoming a maid. She changed into a Demonic Head Maid who will in no way overlook the undisciplined Master.</p><p>Artoria Alter enters the Ishtar Cup together with Nero. Their team name, \u201CTyrant Shooting Star\u201D, was her idea. It is a fitting name for a miraculous team in which a famously selfish emperor and a tyrant maid joined hands.</p><p>Concerning the race, Artoria Alter\u2019s motive for entering it is to show everyone that she is the strongest. She justifiably wants a (physical) reward, but apart from that, she feels that it is fine to participate in it since it is on behalf of the Master.</p><p>Nero regards that \u201CAll the other teams are rivals\u201D, but for Alter, there is no team that would make her feel the emotion of \u201CI definitely cannot be defeated by these fellows.\u201D Nero and Alter. Although they are a pair whose rhythms do not match with each other since Nero aims to actively participate and have fun in the race while Artoria aims to vent out her violent impulses (stress) and win a reward, they still joined forces to participate in the Ishtar Cup.</p><p>Artoria Alter has no motivation at all to probe into the truth hidden within the race. Because she is under the impression that she is being cheered on the most by the Protagonist, her spirit happens to be constantly in a good mood. Though such a thing really cannot be seen from her outward appearances.</p><p>Artoria Alter\u2019s racing policy is \u201Cto race without going easy on anyone.\u201D Nero steps on the accelerator without thinking of the consequences, and Alter uses the nitro despite thinking about the consequences. Nero views \u201CBeauty and Speed\u201D as supreme, while Alter views \u201CSimplicity and Speed\u201D as supreme. One half of their views are in conflict, but because the other half perfectly have the same rhythm, they are two people whom staggeringly got along well with each other as a matter of fact\u2026 As expected, is this not a miraculous team then?</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Nero (Caster)</strong></p><p>Her intolerable teammate.

The fact is, the maid component was planned to be one of those materials, but it should be said that it was to be expected, for that became the attire that has the most impact, don\u2019t you think? She became quite the luxurious character where even her animation motions change in each of her Saint Graph stages. For the design of Alter\u2019s water gun, I got Mr. Hirai Yukio to be in charge of that. In each stage, actual firearms were used as the motifs, and I got to finish the designs by mixing in an Altered composition into them.
