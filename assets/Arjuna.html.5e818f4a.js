This is about 10% of its original power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Ten percent?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I accept you as my Master, Fujimaru. But that doesn&#39;t mean I pledge my loyalty to you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The most important thing in this world is trust. By fighting together, I was able to know you better.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But, that is not enough. Therefore, I would like to test you, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple. Just join me for three fights. During those fights, I will obey your every order.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> On the other hand, I won&#39;t do anything aside from obeying your orders. How well you utilize me as a weapon...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I want to see. Is that all right?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Oh, there&#39;s no problem if you want the other Servants to help as well.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking forward to it.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I know this is sudden, but enemies are approaching. As always, enemies this level are easy prey for us.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I seek a graceful, quick delivery of instructions from you, Master. That is all.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hmm, well done. Cutting off all thought and letting myself be controlled is not a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> However, don&#39;t get overconfident about beating those weaklings. The next enemies will be somewhat formidable.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You must be able to defeat formidable opponents with ease. Otherwise, you&#39;re unfit to be a commander.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t worry. At least there&#39;s no fear of getting killed.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I, Arjuna, guarantee it.<br> Well, let the fight begin.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Splendid! I acknowledge that there is no problem with Master&#39;s ability to command.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Now, this is the last test. Considering the type of enemies we may face in the future...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I had a Servant prepared for this. No longer will you be fighting a mindless beast, but rather a true Hero recognized by the World itself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> We must win. No matter how strong the enemy is, I must obtain a glorious victory.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...No, I guess WE must obtain a glorious victory. Come, let&#39;s fight.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I shall be a silent arrow! You just need to fire me toward the ones you recognize as your enemy.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That&#39;s the ideal relationship of a Servant and a Master. Now, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> \u2013Good. As expected, your talents as a Master are genuine. I trust you fully, and therefore pledge my allegiance to you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The name of my bow is Agni Gandiva. This divine bow granted by the God of Flame can shoot down anything.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I will show you its true strength in our upcoming battles.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> \u2013Heh heh, this bow is ideal for you. Why don&#39;t I show you the true brilliance of its flame now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> By the hellfire of Agni, God of Flame, be incinerated to ashes! ...No, this is not enough.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> O Shiva, God of Destruction... Rain down divine punishment upon my foes!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...How was that, Master?<br> No, you don&#39;t have to say anything.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> With this, my power has been proven. My weapon and Noble Phantasm are the most powerful of their kind.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You can proudly declare that I&#39;m the best Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The forest has been leveled.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Uh...uh...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I think I was a little too enthusiastic...<br> I am sorry.</p><h2 id="by-continuing-to-question" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#by-continuing-to-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a> By Continuing to Question</h2><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...There you are, Karna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> No obstacles remain for me.<br> Even if they did, I would destroy them all.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> This will be the end.<br> I may be called a coward, but I will kill you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I need to kill you!<br> You know me, after all!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...So this is karma.

If you say it,<br> you will be cursed for thousands of years!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You must say it, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> There is no correct answer.

I&#39;m just talking to myself. Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s time to wake up, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong><br> It&#39;s unlikely I will make another appearance anytime soon. You should forget about this whole dream.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I will not be appearing here again.<br> Farewell Arjuna. Farewell Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I will fade away too.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But I must apologize, Master. The numerous times you were put in danger...all of it was because of me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It is probably because the bond between you and I has grown stronger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The deeper the bond I form with someone, the more fearful I become of them learning of the existence of my Krishna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I called you to my dream,<br> and tried to kill you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m such a fool... A vile, detestable betrayer.<br> I would not protest should I be put to death.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Master.<br> Now you know all of who...of what I am.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And yet, you still embrace my everything...my light, my darkness, and my evil.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I see... Then I will never again fear that smile of yours, nor this darkness. Never again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This...isn&#39;t a dream, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> You have awoken, Master.<br> I thank you for showing me such a wonderful dream.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And I would also like to apologize for putting your life in danger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But I am in something of a bind. The crime that I committed should cost me my life, but if I do offer up my life, I would not be able to fight for you anymore.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Whatever should I do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Morning, Arjuna.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Good morning.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I will waver no more.<br> I will dedicate all that I have to serving you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I felt like I was on a long, long journey...<br> Yet it seemed a short thing at the same time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> There is nothing absolute in this world.<br> Various substances prowl, wander, and are transient.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Emotions are no exception.<br> Even love can one day change to hate and sadness.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Or the opposite might happen.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But there is just one thing that I can say with confidence.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I feel fortunate to have met you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am an Archer. My True Name is Arjuna.<br> I am a Kshatriya warrior and a Servant...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I lend my strength to a Master in order to win back the future. I am just an average Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am a descendant of a god, but not a god myself. I may have incredible power that ordinary humans lack, but I am still human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I simply fight. I fight for my Master.<br> My reason for fighting is my belief in my Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is all I require to see myself as a hero. For that purpose, I can embrace the darkness within me and not be abashed by it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am an Archer.<br> I am Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am Fujimaru&#39;s Servant.</p>', 356);
