Is that... Karna?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!</p><hr><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? ...Senpai? Karna!?<br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s my question. I was told that&#39;s the standard greeting in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who... Who told you that?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?<br> ...No way...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know such a wonderful greeting existed... Senpai, how come you didn&#39;t tell me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I came up with it yesterday.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry. I forgot.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Please say that to me, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Heyo, something.<br> The one you did, with the high-five.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> H-Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014I see. This has a wonderful effect. It makes you feel...light and relaxed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, Chaldea is on high-alert right now. So from now on, this greeting will be banned.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay, I&#39;m sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Mash can be scary sometimes...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, what are you doing, Karna?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m about to go buy some bread at the store.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At Da Vinci&#39;s store?<br> If you haven&#39;t had lunch, why don&#39;t we...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> No, Doctor... Roman was his name?<br> He asked me to buy some for him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> Doctor. It&#39;s me. Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to get to the point.<br> Why did you ask Karna to run errands for you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve been busy, so I just thought...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Using a Heroic Spirit... To buy bread? I&#39;m pretty sure there are other more useful things...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, I meant it as a joke!<br> But he just nodded and walked out of the room...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And you were okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Yes, what the Doctor said is correct.<br> There isn&#39;t a single false statement.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Did I do something wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No... I mean, I wouldn&#39;t know how to answer that myself...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I see. If nothing&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m going to the store.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry! Da Vinci&#39;s Super Special Delicious Bread just ran out.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Oh... I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He looks so depressed, Senpai!)<br> You always have extra, I wonder what happened?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, we finally used up all the flour we had.<br> Dr. Roman also told us not to waste it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I got it. Let&#39;s use this chance to procure a new supply route!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course you will help me, right? They sell good flour in France, around here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you can stuff it into my special Da Vinci Storage Bag,<br> you should be able to bring back some crops to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Normally, we&#39;d purposely realign Chaldeas to manifest resources from our Rayshift destination but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Using Chaldea like that would truly deplete our resources... It just doesn&#39;t balance out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So in times like this, we need cheat a little.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Understood. Commencing Rayshift.<br> Master, I&#39;m sorry, but please get ready.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He agreed immediately!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O-Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well. That&#39;s the reason we&#39;re in this French farming village.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. How did things end up like this in the short time I was looking at Magi\u2606Mari&#39;s blog?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s all the Doctor&#39;s fault!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> That village... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> Oh, a traveler... No, looking at that spear... Perhaps you are part of the French army?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> N-No way... It&#39;s been three days since the bandits seized our village...</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> Just when I thought someone had finally come to save us...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> That sounds terrible. I will help you.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> What? A-Are you sure? But... Only with this amount of people...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be a problem.<br> Karna... Let&#39;s hurry to the village!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> Hell yeah! Bring us some booze! Get me some women too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough! For your health, please refrain from alcohol and women!</p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> Who the hell are you? A kid, a girl, and some skinny guy...</p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> Ha! Hey guys, go teach them a lesson!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough. Do you want to spend all your remaining time on momentary desires?</p><p><strong>Bandit:</strong><br> What... What are these guys? T-They&#39;re too powerful!? L-Let&#39;s get out of here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Persistently aiming at their vital spots, and accurately reducing their wills to fight to make them surrender as quickly as possible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was totally one sided, artistic even.<br> I learned a lot.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> T-Thank you very much, traveler.<br> I have no idea how to repay you...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to thank me.<br> We couldn&#39;t just let your village be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> By the way, can you give us some wheat?<br> We&#39;ll pay the proper market price for it.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> W-Wheat? That&#39;s all you need?<br> Please take as much as you need!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...No, just enough to fill this bag.<br> I heard I can pay you with these silver coins.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong><br> Well, yes...then please take this.<br> Is that really enough for you?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Yes, I appreciate it.<br> I&#39;m sorry for the trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Karna...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right! This is Da Vinci&#39;s Super Special Delicious Bread Mark 2!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Splendid skill, or craftsmanship rather.<br> I can even feel divinity from the steam.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You used to bake pizza before... As expected from an almighty genius, this is an almighty oven. Hat&#39;s off to you.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Sorry to make you wait, Doctor. Were you able to withstand the hunger? This is the bread you wanted.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, thank you...<br> I&#39;m sorry about the extra work.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Oh no, it was a good experience.<br> Anyway, I will take my leave now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Karna is looking...a little bit strange, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Hero of Benefaction... I heard he even offered his armor when someone begged for it, even though it was his flesh and blood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Flesh and blood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Armor?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, as long as he&#39;s wearing that gold armor no one can harm him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s a hero who relinquished even that precious armor when asked for it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A widow&#39;s mite in a way... Takes only what is necessary and only the amount he really needs, that&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He is noble and aloof, yet engages with others as his peers\u2014 He is truly a model hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a wonderful person. I can&#39;t believe the Doctor would ask him to do such a mundane task.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was engaged in a task I couldn&#39;t leave, so... I am sorry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Next time I&#39;ll ask Arjuna!<br> You know... Since he&#39;s from India just like Karna!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-That&#39;s an even bigger issue!<br> Please let us do your trivial tasks!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p>', 130);
