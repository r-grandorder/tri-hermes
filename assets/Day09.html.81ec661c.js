I would like the compensation now.&quot;</p><hr><p>He weaves the words of contract.</p><p>After that, he changed as though possessed by something and saved people who could not normally be saved.</p><p>...Oh, so this must be how he became a &quot;heroic spirit&quot;.</p><hr><p>...Seeing it this way, it&#39;s nothing much.</p><p>I bet the people he saved were not even in the hundreds.</p><p>He cannot even be called a &quot;hero&quot; with such a number, nor would he be promoted to a &quot;heroic spirit&quot;.</p><p>But the number isn&#39;t important.</p><p>The qualification of a hero, one who surpasses humans, is to be able to save those that are fated to die.</p><hr><p>It is an alteration of fate.</p><p>It does not matter if he does not have power as a hero, as long as he averted a disaster that could not be changed, however small in scope.</p><p>No.</p><p>The world would obtain a &quot;heroic spirit&quot; in compensation for the miracle.</p><hr><p>He became a hero and saved those that could not have been saved.</p><p>As a result, he became a heroic spirit after he died, and he is now repeating what he was doing before he died\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Being a &quot;servant&quot;.</p><p>I guess compensation for a miracle is to become a convenient disposable tool that will fight for others even after one dies.</p><hr><p>Heroic spirits.</p><p>Superior spirits chosen from amongst humans. The guardians of humanity.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But they are not ones with free will like the Servants.</p><p>Heroic spirits are guardians of humanity.</p><p>Guardians do not have a free will, and they are treated as &quot;powers&quot;.</p><p>They are called forth to protect the world only when a factor appears that could destroy it. They are weapons that destroy these factors.</p><p>The Servant system is a summoning ritual that takes advantage of these &quot;guardians&quot;.</p><hr><p>The guardians are summoned into every age, eliminate the offending factor, and then disappear from this world.</p><p>...I would hate to be like that, but he must have been prepared to take on that role.</p><hr><p>No, he might have even wished for it...</p><p>That it would be perfect if he could save people even after he died.</p><p>Even though he did not have the power to save them when he was alive, he must have believed he could avert every tragedy if he became a heroic spirit.</p><p>With that in mind, he made a contract with the world to give up his body after his death, and he saved a hundred people.</p><p>...Believing that...</p><p>...He would be able to save tens of thousands of people afterwards.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015How... stupid of him.</p><p>That cannot be.</p><p>Because for a heroic spirit to be called upon, the place would already have to be a place of death.</p><p>Heroic spirits are summoned only into hell.</p><p>They appear only when the world is about to be destroyed by people.</p><p>Humans are the ones that will perish from their own doings.</p><p>So the process of destruction must always be the same.</p><hr><p>Jealousy. Hatred. Selfishness. Desire.</p><p>The man who loved people and tried to be of help to them was shown the same ugliness even after he died.</p><p>He was called into such scenes and served his responsibility as a guardian.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015He killed.</p><p>He killed and killed and killed and killed. He killed everyone that was around him when he was summoned to save humanity as a whole.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how many times he repeated that\u2015\u2015\u2015nor do I know how many times he will have to repeat it in the future.</p><hr><p>...So there&#39;s only one thing I can say.</p><p>He has been betrayed by many things...</p><p>But in the end, he was betrayed by the only thing he believed in, his ideal.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>When I wake up, that&#39;s all I can say.</p><p>My body feels tired and I can&#39;t move at all.</p><p>My mind is the only clear thing, and I blankly stare at the ceiling.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I knew it. So that&#39;s his memory, huh?&quot;</p><p>I sigh and stare at the ceiling.</p><p>...This is hard.</p><p>He could have told me that I might get a glimpse of his memory when I&#39;m asleep because Masters and Servants are connected.</p><p>If he had told me, I could have cut my consciousness so that I wouldn&#39;t see such a thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll get up. There are lots of things I have to do today.&quot;</p><p>I get up.</p><p>My body is heavy and my eyelids are heavier than steel.</p><p>I curse how I&#39;m not a morning person and start changing into my uniform slowly.</p><hr><p>&quot;But, well...&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know if this is as I expected or not.</p><p>But he used to be a hot-blooded man.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what hero he is, but it seems he was more honest before.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I guess it&#39;s natural to have a twisted personality if he led such a life and ended up like he has, even after he died.&quot;</p><p>I laugh it off.</p><p>My face in the mirror looks serious and about to cry, but I decide to laugh.</p><p>Because I have to do so or I won&#39;t be able to face Archer normally.</p><hr><p>I get ready and drink the freshly brewed tea in the living room.</p><p>I don&#39;t usually eat breakfast, so it&#39;s pretty quick.</p><p>I have fifteen minutes until I have to get going. This cup of tea is like a ritual I perform every morning to wake up my half-asleep body.</p><p>&quot;Rin, how long are you going to be playing around for?&quot;</p><p>But there&#39;s one fool that cannot read his master&#39;s mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to relax until seven-thirty. I&#39;ll be late if I stay here longer than that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not talking about school. I&#39;m talking about the Holy Grail War.</p><p>...It is not bad to cooperate with other Masters. But in your case, the partner you chose is too weak.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez.&quot;</p><p>That again?</p><p>Archer tells me to cut my ties with Emiya Shirou every chance he gets.</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you I have no intention of doing so. You say so, but I think he&#39;s rather suitable. It&#39;s true that he&#39;s not much help in battle, but he&#39;s perfect as an ally.</p><p>...Um, I think he would never betray me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Trust is usually established through tactics. I cannot trust someone without a reason. Look, he is not someone that will stay and win. If you are to choose an ally, Caster&#39;s Master is a smarter person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t kid me, Archer. Are you telling me to stoop so low?&quot;</p><p>I put my teacup down and stare at Archer.</p><p>Even if it may be sarcasm, I cannot ignore what he just said.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...The air freezes.</p><p>I&#39;m seriously pissed, and Archer has no intention of backing down.</p><p>We stare at each other for a while.</p><hr><p>&quot;It is true that Caster is a heretic, but she is indeed like a magus.</p><p>In that regard, you are not fit for fighting. If you are a magus, you should put results over your wishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s useless being cynical. I won&#39;t change my policy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Man, what is wrong with you? You&#39;ve gotten strange since you got to know Emiya Shirou. Where did that rationality of yours go?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Heh.</p><p>I realize that without having you tell me.</p><p>But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t have anything even though he&#39;s a magus, and is dangerously single-minded.</p><p>It&#39;s unproductive to scheme against such a guy, and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015he&#39;s, um...</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin? What&#39;s wrong? Did you finally realize your own foolishness?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, there is something wrong with me.</p><p>But Archer. This is all because you showed me unnecessary things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, forget about it. You&#39;re my Servant, so I&#39;m only going to do what I believe is right. I&#39;m not as loose as Emiya Shirou, but I do have some things I can&#39;t give up. I won&#39;t give them up no matter who&#39;s telling me so.&quot;</p><hr><p>I say so with anger.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And that makes me realize...</p><p>I don&#39;t feel any sympathy, even after learning about his past.</p><p>I&#39;m just mad at him.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. Where&#39;s your reply, Archer!?&quot;</p><p>I take it out on Archer and glare at him.</p><p>The knight in red makes his usual gesture.</p><p>&quot;I guess it can&#39;t be helped. It is the role of the servant to support his master when the master is not doing well. I shall look after you until you return to your usual self.&quot;</p><p>And he answers with a reply that&#39;s neither a &#39;yes&#39; nor a &#39;no&#39;.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I wake up.</p><p>I feel heavy, like there&#39;s lead inside my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What is this?

I have to go make breakfast.</p><hr><p>Saber sees me off as I leave the house.</p><p>I&#39;m getting used to this lifestyle, as the morning passes by smoothly.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t see Tohsaka at the gate.</p><p>Since the only suspect we had, Issei, turned out to be innocent, I bet she&#39;s busy running around gathering information.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait, it&#39;s not someone else&#39;s business. I have to investigate as well.&quot;</p><p>...But how will I do that?</p><p>I guess Tohsaka is investigating the people at school, so I guess I&#39;ll investigate the building.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, life&#39;s not convenient enough to let me notice anything I haven&#39;t noticed before.</p><p>I searched the school using all the breaks I had and the first half of lunch break, but I wasn&#39;t able to find anything strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. I don&#39;t know what you were up to, but good job on your work.&quot;</p><p>He must be done eating already, as he greets me while reading an old poetry book.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Thanks. I&#39;m getting some tea since I&#39;ll be eating here. Oh, where&#39;s the teapot?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s here. We only have kelp tea, but is that all right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Hmm, then I&#39;ll just take water. I just can&#39;t take the muddled feeling of that tea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then I shall go get some green tea from the teacher&#39;s office tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>I leave the laughing Issei to himself, pour some water into my cup, and sit down at the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Itadakimasu.&quot;</p><p>I clap my hands together and open my lunchbox.</p><p>At the same time, someone knocks on the door.</p><p>&quot;Huh? There&#39;s someone at the door, Issei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? At this time?&quot;</p><p>Issei slowly goes to the door.</p><hr><p>The visitor is Kuzuki, the one in charge of the student council.</p><p>I see Kuzuki-Sensei a lot here, but I bet it&#39;s &quot;Emiya is in the student council room a lot&quot; from his point of view.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I silently eat my chicken-sprinkled lunch.</p><p>There must not be anything important today, as Issei and Kuzuki-Sensei are just chatting.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Munch.</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sensei, it&#39;s almost time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm. I see. Sorry to take your time. I think you know without having it said, but do not forget to lock this place up. And make sure you leave school on time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes. I know.&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki-Sensei leaves and Issei comes back in a good mood.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Wow, I just saw something rare.</p><p>It&#39;s really rare to see Kuzuki-Sensei chatting about meaningless things with a student.</p><p>And with that shy Issei.</p><p>...Oh. They might get along since they&#39;re both stubborn, but it&#39;s still strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Issei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? What, Emiya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering for a while, but are you on good terms with Kuzuki?&quot;</p><p>Oh, he&#39;s surprised.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t want to answer. I just thought that was the case, so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, no. I just realized I haven&#39;t told you about it. It is only natural that we are getting along. Kuzuki-Sensei is like a brother to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki-Sensei is like Issei&#39;s brother?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. What does that mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you that he&#39;s like my older brother.</p><p>Souichirou\u2015\u2015\u2015Kuzuki-Sensei has been staying over at my place for about three years. He is a naive person as you can see, but he has a sincere heart. He is living under the same roof as me, and he is someone I can respect as a person. It is only natural for me to respect him as my older brother.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Kuzuki lives at the Ryuudou Temple\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>It feels like I got hit in the head with a hammer.</p><p>But I act calm and ask Issei to continue.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh yeah. You mentioned something about an unfamiliar woman at your place, right? Does Kuzuki know about her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She is more than that, as she is his fiancee. We are letting her borrow a room until they hold their wedding celebration.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A second shock.</p><p>&quot;Issei. You wouldn&#39;t call her an unfamiliar woman in that case, right?&quot;</p><p>I try my hardest to object with a dizzy head.</p><hr><p>&quot;An unfamiliar woman is an unfamiliar woman. Even if she may be Kuzuki-Sensei&#39;s fiancee, that is all I can say about her, as I don&#39;t even know her name.&quot;</p><p>Issei stops the conversation as if saying he&#39;s angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...A-Anyways.</p><p>This is something I can&#39;t ignore.</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou is coming from the Ryuudou Temple, and there is a woman that is said to be at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>I hear Kuzuki-Sensei&#39;s fiancee showed up about a month ago.</p><p>If that&#39;s Caster, all our answers are right there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;So, that&#39;s what I heard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>In the classroom after school...</p><p>We don&#39;t even have ten more minutes until we have to go home, but I tell Tohsaka about Kuzuki-Sensei.</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you think? Considering Issei&#39;s case, I don&#39;t think we should suspect him just because he&#39;s from the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kuzuki-Sensei, huh? He&#39;s not even a magus to start with, disregarding the fact that he doesn&#39;t have the presence of a Master.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s listening to me, as Tohsaka is frowning to herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s not a magus...? That&#39;s good. I guess we can count him out in that case.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? Someone as suspicious as him has to be a Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m starting to get used to this.</p><p>But I still can&#39;t keep up with Tohsaka&#39;s thought processes.</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;ll ambush him tonight. I&#39;ll try pulling some strings so that he&#39;ll have to stay the nightshift, so you be ready too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hold on. We can&#39;t do that.</p><p>Get him on night shift... Are you saying we&#39;ll fight him tonight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. There&#39;s no guarantee that Kuzuki will come to school tomorrow.</p><p>We won&#39;t wait. We&#39;ll make him stay at school until night and test if he&#39;s a Master or not on his way home.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let me ask you to make sure. How are you going to test if he&#39;s a Master or not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Using force. Just like I did to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>The phrase &quot;just like I did to you&quot; sounds a bit sweet.</p><p>...So, as I thought, Tohsaka is a bully inside.</p><p>Maybe I fought her over the playground&#39;s peace when we were small.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m against it. There should be a gentler way to check. We shouldn&#39;t have to take such dangerous measures.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not dangerous. I&#39;m not indiscriminate, you know?</p><p>I&#39;ll just shoot a light Gandr shot at him. If he&#39;s a normal person, he&#39;ll just sleep in for two days with a cold.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s a problem as well. If Kuzuki is a Master, we&#39;ll get into a battle right then and there. As we&#39;re the ones attacking him, we won&#39;t be able to talk to him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? I don&#39;t get it. That&#39;ll be even more convenient.</p><p>What part of it do you think is dangerous?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m the one that doesn&#39;t get you! I&#39;m talking about how dangerous it&#39;ll be for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka must have finally realized, as she stops the conversation.</p><hr><p>But that&#39;s only for an instant.</p><p>&quot;I see. That&#39;s fine as well. I&#39;ll just do it by myself in that case.&quot;</p><p>She easily concludes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I guess it&#39;s meaningless to say anything to her once she&#39;s determined to do something.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right, I&#39;ll go along. I don&#39;t know what reckless things you might do if I let you be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s my line. ...Geez.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s time to leave. Then we&#39;ll meet at seven at the park below the bridge. We&#39;ll probably end up fighting, so you better be prepared.&quot;</p><p>She looks away and walks off.</p><p>I leave the classroom after her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then we will attack Caster&#39;s Master tonight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We still don&#39;t know if Kuzuki is a Master, but that&#39;s pretty much the plan.&quot;</p><hr><p>I report to Saber about today as soon as I get home.</p><p>Saber must agree with Tohsaka, as she is hyped up already.</p><hr><p>&quot;So we won&#39;t be training today. I&#39;ll go make dinner right away, so let&#39;s get ready for tonight... Wait, is it bad to eat before going to battle?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? Why are you asking? I believe there will be a problem if we get hungry during battle\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I was thinking that it might be too heavy. We don&#39;t even have an hour left, so we might be better off eating after we come home.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I do not think that is the case. It is a quality of warriors to quickly digest anything we consume.</p><p>I do not think food will be bad if one has been training and has led a proper lifestyle...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Um. Does that mean I can cook dinner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I believe we will have more energy that way.&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>I have trained to be able to move right after meals, so I guess there&#39;s no problem.</p><p>But I&#39;ll make a light dinner just in case.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll be going to the living room.

I shall answer you if you question me, Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s about your wish. What do you want to do after you obtain the Holy Grail, Archer?&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a natural question.</p><p>A heroic spirit that is half immortal and has all the treasures in the world.</p><p>What can this man possibly wish for now?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What? You did not know?&quot;</p><p>Archer says so with surprise.</p><p>His face is smiling as if he found a small happiness.</p><hr><p>&quot;I allow everything that is magnificent. A splendid ornament is something I must admire the most. But\u2015\u2015\u2015I cannot stand giving it to the meaningless extras.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Extras...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It happened a long time ago. I chose ten servants and tried to kill the one that I did not need. What do you think happened, Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? They were all slaves, right? Then didn&#39;t you kill them all?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I actually could not kill anybody. None of the laborers were meaningless in the old world.&quot;</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders ironically and steps forward.</p><p>...A deeper darkness.</p><p>He raises his foot over the dark shadow.</p><hr><p>&quot;But this world is filled with extras. I believe there would not be a single meaningful person even if I sought through a thousand people.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Man, this world has gotten so friendly to humans.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? I don&#39;t get it. What do you want, Archer? You want the Holy Grail because you have something you want, right? Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer does not answer.</p><p>The golden man does not even turn to his master and...</p><hr><p>&quot;It is a simple thing. A lot of something is ugly by itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Lowers his raised foot into the darkness.</p><hr><p>...A smashing sound.</p><p>On the ground are numerous smashed bugs, with more swarming around.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She must have made a sound on purpose.</p><p>It is slow, and the black haze goes for Kuzuki like a pitcher&#39;s changeup.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A wind of disease that will cause him to be sick in bed for two days.</p><p>But two days of inaction is fatal for a Master.</p><p>There has to be some kind of a reaction if Kuzuki-Sensei is a Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;Crap\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka jumps.</p><p>...Kuzuki does not react at all.

Do you understand your position more now, boy?&quot;</p><p>Caster watches us with composure.</p><p>...Kuzuki is standing next to her.</p><p>We&#39;re about ten meters apart.</p><p>No matter how I think about it, Caster&#39;s finger would be much faster than me running into them.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I showed myself in spite of that.</p><p>I have to do something before I fight.</p><p>That is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka and Emiya, huh? So you two are Masters as well, like Matou? Fate has an odd way of doing things.&quot;</p><p>...To check the true identity of Kuzuki Souichirou, the one Caster is protecting.</p><hr><p>&quot;So? You have something you want to ask me?&quot;</p><p>He says so in his usual manner.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel a presence as a magus from Kuzuki.</p><p>No, I don&#39;t even feel his desire to win the Holy Grail War.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuzuki. Are you controlled by Caster?&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s possible that Kuzuki is controlled by Caster like Archer said.</p><p>I can&#39;t fight against Kuzuki until I get this cleared up.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Caster emits an intent to kill.</p><p>That alone tells me the question is off-limits for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What an annoying boy. I should kill you.&quot;</p><p>Her words are not a threat.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;Hold on.

But you&#39;re an honest human, right? Then you shouldn&#39;t be overlooking what Caster&#39;s doing.</p><p>But since it seems you are overlooking it, I thought you just might not know about it.&quot;</p><p>I say so while glaring at Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;What Caster is doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. She&#39;s putting up her fort at the Ryuudou Temple and collecting magical energy from the people in this town. All the coma incidents happening recently are her doing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;There will be more victims. I&#39;m sure someone will die as long as Caster keeps draining magical energy.</p><p>...She said everyone in town is her sacrifice. It won&#39;t be long before it&#39;s too late.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. A normal human being would not be able to let her be.</p><p>So you thought I might be controlled since I am letting her do as she wishes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. But if you&#39;re overlooking her deeds knowing what she&#39;s doing, then you&#39;re just a killer. We won&#39;t hold back on you. But it&#39;s a different story if you&#39;re controlled.</p><p>We&#39;ll just defeat Caster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. This is the first time I heard about this.&quot;</p><hr><p>Kuzuki declares so firmly.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a lie. Kuzuki Souichirou is straight-forward like when he is teaching.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>I sigh with relief, while keeping watch on Caster.</p><p>Kuzuki-Sensei is a victim if he&#39;s controlled by Caster.</p><p>Then all that&#39;s left is to defeat Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;But Emiya. Is Caster&#39;s doing so bad?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But still.</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou plainly says so.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh... at...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It does not concern me how many strangers die. And besides, Caster has not taken anyone&#39;s life.</p><p>...But I must say, you aren&#39;t very thorough, Caster. You should have drained all of their energy if that is the case.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s not any different from usual.</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou gives his honest opinion.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Kuzuki, are you going to involve innocent people in this!!!!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not care about anyone. ...Well, you correctly guessed my nature.</p><p>I am not a magus. I am just a killer that has rotted away.&quot;</p><hr><p>Kuzuki takes a step back.</p><p>He watches us from behind Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;You are right that I am Caster&#39;s puppet.</p><p>I do not care about the Holy Grail War. If Caster and you two are going to kill each other, I will just observe.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I value my own life. I do not care what Caster is scheming. I only kill those that are attacking me.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Do as you wish, Caster. You can kill them or not.&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster is standing in front of us with an expression of victory.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez, they&#39;re both big foxes...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka complains, but she doesn&#39;t move.</p><p>No, she cannot move.</p><p>In terms of skills as magi, we have no chance of beating Caster.</p><p>Masters are magi, so we cannot match an excellent magus like Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see.</p><p>Then you do not mind dying here, Caster&#39;s Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>I hear a voice from behind me.</p><p>Before I can turn around...</p><p>The Servant of the sword, Saber, charges forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber!?&quot;</p><p>Even my voice won&#39;t catch up to her.</p><p>Saber is already armed and charges at Kuzuki like the wind.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Stop, Saber!&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster confronts Saber with her casting.</p><p>She uses five verses for her spell.</p><p>If Saber is a wind for charging ten meters in a flash, Caster is a lightning for finishing her spell even faster.</p><p>It&#39;s a raging thunder at that.</p><p>She shoots off five bullets of light in under a second, and the bullets pierce Saber like fatal thorns\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>&quot;magecraft resistance...! No, I don&#39;t know a knight that can defend against my magecraft...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster screams.</p><p>Even Archer had to evade Caster&#39;s spell, but Saber is nullifying it just by glaring at it.</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s not looking at Caster.</p><p>Her target...</p><p>The one she has to slash is Caster&#39;s Master, Kuzuki Souichirou...!</p><hr><p>Saber slashes Kuzuki without hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Souichirou\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015sama.&quot;</p><p>...The intersection becomes silent again.</p><p>Saber stops after slashing her sword.</p><p>Everyone here thinks that the battle is over due to the incredible speed.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>Everyone except Kuzuki Souichirou, who is standing there calmly.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13</h2><p>&quot;...Crap. Now there&#39;s no way Kuzuki will come out from the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><p>After Caster and Kuzuki disappear...</p><p>Without caring for her wounded chest, Tohsaka grits her teeth in regret.</p><hr><p>...I understand how Tohsaka feels.</p><p>Since we attacked them, Kuzuki will now stay in the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>So we will have to go attack their territory if we are to defeat Caster.</p><hr><p>But the Ryuudou Temple has a gate watcher called Assassin, and Kuzuki and Caster aren&#39;t easy enemies either.

I will warn you that the temple is a treacherous place for us Servants.</p><p>There is not much chance of winning even if we get Archer and try to force our way through.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Heh. I know how strange that mountain is. I won&#39;t follow them out of vexation, nor will I drag your Master into going there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then you will give up on defeating Caster?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you kidding me? I don&#39;t like getting beaten, and more than that, I can&#39;t let Caster be. I think your Master has the same opinion on that.&quot;</p><p>She asks me by looking at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;[line13]&quot;</p><p>Saber must have followed Tohsaka&#39;s example, since she looks as if she&#39;s asking me whether that is the case.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. We can&#39;t leave those two be.</p><p>Caster won&#39;t stop collecting magical energy, and her Master, Kuzuki, said he won&#39;t stop her. Then we&#39;ll just defeat them.</p><p>It seems Assassin is at the Ryuudou Temple, but everything will be over if we defeat Caster&#39;s Master, Kuzuki.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t think Kuzuki-Sensei will easily let us take his Command Spell, but we should be able to do something if we capture him.</p><p>...I guess we&#39;ll have to stick to planning for now...&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but Tohsaka suddenly...</p><hr><p>&quot;By the way, what was that, Emiya-kun? Wasn&#39;t strengthening the only magecraft you could use?&quot;</p><p>She asks me with a serious expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Does she mean reproducing Archer&#39;s swords?</p><p>Well, I&#39;m still surprised myself, but I don&#39;t think she should glare at me for it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Answer me. You told me before that strengthening magecraft is all you can use, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s right. Projection is the first magecraft I was able to use, but I was taught to use strengthening magecraft because projection is inefficient. ...Oh, didn&#39;t I tell you about this?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No. I&#39;m mad that I haven&#39;t heard about it.&quot;</p><p>She glares at me.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but Tohsaka is really pissed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let me ask you. This isn&#39;t your first time using the projection magecraft?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... I guess not. I do it quite often to get myself together after I fail the strengthening magecraft. But it&#39;s not like I can project something useful like I just did now.</p><p>I can get them looking the same on the outside, but they were all empty on the inside.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Empty inside? What do you mean? Do you mean you can only reproduce the appearance?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m thinking about what&#39;s inside as well, but I can never manage to do it. That&#39;s why I&#39;m surprised right now.</p><p>What I imagine isn&#39;t close to the real thing, but the swords just now were pretty close.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then does it mean you acquired projection before strengthening?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s more like that was the only thing I could do.</p><p>My father told me it was useless and that I should use strengthening instead.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. I would have told you the same thing as well.</p><p>...But that&#39;s strange. You reproduced Archer&#39;s swords for such a long time, but you still can&#39;t project normal things.</p><p>...Maybe you have a limited attribute.</p><p>There are magi who aren&#39;t versatile, but very powerful in one matter...&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka starts thinking by herself.</p><p>She does not even look at me...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s go home for today.</p><p>It seems Saber used magical energy to heal herself, so we have to let her rest.&quot;</p><p>...And she goes home like that.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14</h2><p>Hi, is everyone doing well?
