That human nature is that of Rome itself, which reigns over the world. The Rome. All of Rome is the fruition of his very own flesh and blood, purpose, and destiny, and those who were born in Rome and those who died for Rome are equally his own children; in other words, he calls other Emperor Heroic Spirits related to Rome, such as Nero, Caesar and Caligula, \u201Cmy own children\u201D and loves them.</p><p>Towards Romans, Romulus is very kind. Even to companions who are not Romans, given that he interprets their nature as something \u201Cthat exemplifies the world; in other words, that exemplifies Rome\u201D, before long, he will come to interact with them kindly. That is to say, he is nevertheless kind to everyone.</p><p>Romulus usually has an air of composure around him, but he abandons himself to being crazy about blood to some degree and forgets about himself when he gets well into battle. He has an aptitude for the Berserker Class. When he is in a blood frenzy for a moment, he is out of control.</p><p>It is possible for Romulus to talk together with animals far and wide, and from the way it seems, the words are clearly understood by wolves especially since they are Romulus\u2019 siblings whom were raised up together with him. (One cannot also deny the possibility of Romulus simply starting a conversation with animals other than wolves just to get into a good mood.)</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Rome is the world; in other words, the world is none other than Rome.

Born between the God of War Mars and the beautiful princess Silvia, Romulus was raised by a wolf \u2013 which is a beast of the gods \u2013 as a friend.</p><p>After triumphing in the battle against Amulius, the King of Alba Longa who deceived his grandfather Numitor for the throne and persecuted his mother Silvia, instead of ruling over Alba Longa, Romulus established the city-state of Rome in the Italian Peninsula. And after overcoming the tragedy where he killed his younger brother Remus, who fought together with him in the Alba Longa War, with his own hands in a quarrel during the occasion of the founding of the nation, Romulus annexed the states around the Mediterranean Sea in an instant, building up the cornerstone of Rome, which will become a great empire that will boast a glory spanning over a long time.</p><p>The Great Nation Founding King. In his last moments, Romulus did not die, but rather had \u201Cdisappeared\u201D. After storms and lightning broke out suddenly at a field nearby the Palus Caprae (Goat Marsh), his figure was erased. Because of the words spoken by a farmer later on after Romulus\u2019 disappearance, the people of Rome interpreted this anomalous phenomenon as, \u201CThe Great Romulus had arrived at the queue to become a god due to the intentions of the God of War, Mars, who is his father\u201D, and that became the conclusive interpretation. The farmer encountered Romulus after his \u201Cdisappearance\u201D at Quirinal Hill, and from the mouth of the Great King of Nation Founding, he informed him that Romulus has now changed into a god referred to as Quirinus\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014It is said that this is what has been informed to the people.</p><p>Quirinus. That is the name of an olden god purported to be among the ranks of Jupiter, the Supreme Being spoken of in Roman Mythology, and Mars, the God of War. This anecdote was spread to the people of Rome, and this olden god was born again as a new god who became unified with the King of Nation Founding.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Nero</strong></p><p>\u201CA child of Rome who is my own beloved child.

Since I have heard that he will become the boss character in Chapter 2, I kept in mind of a way to show an air of importance to his frontal appearance so that it does not appear to consist of mere coloured clothing. His whole body being golden in his Third Stage is said to be Takeuchi\u2019s idea. The posing of his battle sprite had came up with tremendous impact, and I was relieved that surprisingly, from the way it seems, they were generally able to accept it(?). Hey, I also happened to draw something that does not look like a gigantic spear?
