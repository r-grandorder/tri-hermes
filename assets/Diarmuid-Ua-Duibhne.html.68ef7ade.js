I must say this army is fantastic.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is fantastic?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> How no one reacts to my face. Until now, I had to be careful merely walking around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh. I see, it&#39;s about your beauty mark, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s more like a curse than a mark of love. Nothing good ever came out of this beauty mark.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Well, even though I did not have any regret about the love I felt because of it.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Apologies, we&#39;ve strayed away from the subject. Master, what I want to talk about are my Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Currently, I&#39;m using two Noble Phantasms...<br> \u201CG\xE1e Dearg\u201D and \u201CG\xE1e Buidhe\u201D\u2013</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> But perhaps due to using two Noble Phantasms, neither one demonstrates its true potential.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> In other words, their power is sealed.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If I can release their power somehow,<br> I think I could be a bigger help\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m painfully aware of the feelings of not being able to fully utilize your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we have the Doctor investigate and see if there are any clues.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, so sealed Noble Phantasms...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Usually, there is some kind of clue in the era that the Heroic Spirit was living in, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm. I am not picking up anything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was such a long time ago when Diarmuid was alive... We may not be able to trace it completely...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Either way, there is a chance that you actually sealed the Noble Phantasms yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It could be a malfunction during summoning, or the Servant is subconsciously restraining himself\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not really sure. But if you want to unleash his Noble Phantasm, why don&#39;t you just dive into his heart. It&#39;s risky though.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> It&#39;s... Risky?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Because [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] as your Master and several Servants have to tag along.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I cannot let my Master take a risk. I decline your suggestion.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what he says. But what does Fujimaru want to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We should go look. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Oh, Master! You are so generous. How lucky am I to serve under such a wonderful Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see how awesome our man Diarmuid can be!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;m flattered that you say that but... Why did you just call me \u201Cour man Diarmuid\u201D...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I&#39;m a little embarrassed.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fine. Well then, let&#39;s get ready.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> So this is what my heart is like...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s your mental landscape. Diarmuid, you will lead us to finding clues about your Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Understood.<br> Well Master, let us proceed right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you have any ideas where to?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Of course. I know this landscape very well. There is a forest nearby where I used to hunt.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s also the place we passed when I ran away with her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her, does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, exactly whom you think.<br> Gr\xE1inne... A woman I used to love.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...There are a few suspicious presences. Is this why you told us to come with Servants?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, be careful.<br> There seems to be enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I see. White blood cells, so to speak\u2013 Something like guardians of my own mental landscape.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I feel bad about destroying them, but I have no choice. I&#39;m charging in. Come on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We are finished here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We got them all on our end, too.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I guess we are lucky the enemy was not formidable... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What happened?<br> The light was...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I see. I think I understand now.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> By defeating the enemies in my mental landscape, the true brilliance of my Noble Phantasm is restored.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m sorry to ask you but I would like to ask for your assistance a while longer.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s move onto the next spot.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> This place... Well, although the furniture is different, it reminds me of the castle of the king I used to serve.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By King... Do you mean Fionn mac Cumhaill?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Yes, he is the one. This is the place I used to drink with the king and my fellows.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Diarmuid...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> This voice... Are you the Knights of Fianna!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The king is not here.<br> Fionn mac Cumhaill is not here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The king is calling. If you don&#39;t see Fionn mac Cumhaill, the brilliance won&#39;t return.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The king is in this world?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> At the same time, we will stand in your way.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...You are threatening us.<br> What is going on?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We are not your true allies.<br> We are mere gatekeepers within your mind.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Though, our capabilities are exactly as you remember. Show us your skill, Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The skill of someone who deserves to be called a Knight of Fianna in the past, and the future!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I guess we have to fight.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Understood.<br> Master, please give me your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s win!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Understood! As you wish.<br> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne\u2013 Here I go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My spear&#39;s brilliance has returned once again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One more should do it.<br> Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> If the king is here, he should be in this forest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bad memories?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look glum.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes... This is the place where I died.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I came boar hunting with my king, Fionn mac Cumhaill, and I was killed by the boar\u2013 A demonic beast.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> What happened after that, I don&#39;t need to tell you. I was not granted the king&#39;s healing.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Certainly!<br> That&#39;s right, that&#39;s absolutely right, Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My king?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m your king, the all too perfect mac Cumhaill. But... Your attitude hasn&#39;t changed at all.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> What a strange man you are. Don&#39;t you feel any hate towards me?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes. In this forest, at this place, I refused to share water after you had collapsed..</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I could have saved you under the circumstances, yet I abandoned you on purpose, you see?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That is because of me\u2013<br> It was my fault.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahahahaha. You are a truly loyal knight.<br> But I think that&#39;s a lie.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> What?<br> No, it&#39;s not true!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You need not bite your thumb. I&#39;m sure your new Master completely understands that.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> For one thing\u2014 You don&#39;t regret it.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Even if you are summoned to a Holy Grail War somewhere, you&#39;d not hope to overturn this unfortunate death.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> If you trace the cause of this misfortune, it was actually caused by my queen, Gr\xE1inne.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You loved Gr\xE1inne, and you also reconciled with me.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Therefore, you should accept this ending\u2013<br> That&#39;s what you are thinking, right?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> O-Of course.<br> My king, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> However, while you feel you weren&#39;t wrong, your true self regrets and resents!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Why did I not give you water back then?<br> Why did I not heal your wounds?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> What should you have done back then, and such!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Augh... Shut up!<br> You are not the king!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Haha, correct! I&#39;m a materialization of your resentment. What you were ashamed of and had sealed away\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> The \u201Csomething\u201D that you cowered and ran away from, so you can keep pretending to be a knight.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Augh!<br> These...are my true...feelings!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Things happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Right, doesn&#39;t matter who I was in the past, I&#39;m a Servant now. My duty is to serve my new Master and eliminate the enemies.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> O&#39; Evil Fionn mac Cumhaill, created by my own mind. As a knight, it&#39;s my duty to kill you!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Ha! Nonsense, you are spineless!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you show me if your fragile heart can survive from being crushed by your own overwhelming guilt!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> \u2014Yes. Yes I know of this.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Diarmuid, the resolution in your spears, the clarity of your art.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Our pride and joy,<br> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne&#39;s battle art.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Then, I only have one more thing to ask of you.<br> ...Do you have any resentment, my knight?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...I must have some. But I will leave that here right now.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I have gained \u201Csomething\u201D more than that from my king. Something precious\u2013 Something I should not lose sight of.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Well done. Considering you tend to get lost, you found the correct answer quickly this time.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...Well, tendency to get lost is something I am guilty of myself.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> ...The powers of G\xE1e Dearg and G\xE1e Buidhe are properly released.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Move onward, Diarmuid. Grasp victory in your hand!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I appreciate it, King.<br> I do appreciate it...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My lord and Master. Thanks to you, my spears have returned to my hands.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I have no more hesitation. Using these twin spears, let us defeat our enemies.</p>', 154);
