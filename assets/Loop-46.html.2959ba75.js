What of it, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I&#39;m saying there&#39;s no need to rush.

Who you callin&#39; a monkey!? ...Wait, you mean Yukicchi, right!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, what are the two of you doing here today?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, well.\u201D</p><p>Impressive.</p><p>She easily cuts straight to the heart of the issue.</p><hr><p>\u201CI came for a tour of the school. Shirou agreed to show me around.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?? Who&#39;s &quot;Shirou&quot;? ...Wait, you mean Yukicchi, right!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWow! Then, Saber-san, could you be planning to transfer here?\u201D</p><p>...She really is impressive.</p><p>There isn&#39;t a hint of spite in Saegusa&#39;s voice. She is obviously thoroughly used to Makidera&#39;s performances already.</p><hr><p>\u201CNO. WAY.</p><p>C&#39;mon, say something! I&#39;m lonely! I&#39;m fine with being called a monkey, just look at me!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. Maki-chan, Emiya-kun&#39;s first name is Shirou-kun. You&#39;re in a different class so you probably didn&#39;t know.\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>sniff</em>... You&#39;re so nice, Yukicchi...</p><p>But no thanks, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d remember Emiya&#39;s name!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sorry again. Makidera&#39;s just the kind of coward who can&#39;t help but act like a jerk.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;d you say!? Whose side are you on, Kane!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe side that likes peace and quiet.</p><p>Now, Saber-san, is it true you have come to tour the school because you are transferring here?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, that is not the case.</p><p>I just wanted to see what the school looked like.\u201D</p><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s right. Fuji-Nee... Fujimura-sensei said that cultural exchange is important.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMs. Fujimura...? I see, indeed, she is the one teaching English. It wouldn&#39;t be unusual for her to arrive at that conclusion.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? So what are you trying to say, Kane?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo put it simply, I&#39;m talking about cultural exchange.</p><p>She likely wished for Saber to observe the lifestyle that isn&#39;t normally visible, and likely to be very different from hers\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmmhmm.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd I&#39;m not talking about anyone in particular, but perhaps she hoped that interacting with a person from abroad could help build confidence when dealing with foreign languages in general.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm, not bad, Fujimura-sensei.</p><p>I just thought she was a cool, if violent, hooligan!\u201D</p><p>...It takes one to know one, Makidera...</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. Taiga even thought that far ahead, as an educator.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Well, she is a schoolteacher, after all.\u201D</p><p>So she&#39;s carefree concerning most things in life, but wise when it comes down to the things that matter?</p><p>Well, our field trip did get approved quickly, with Fuji-Nee having taken care of it well in advance.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, Emiya. What&#39;s in that bag?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is the lunch I promised Fujimura-sensei. For starters, we&#39;re going to deliver it to the archery range.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen you&#39;d better hurry... We&#39;ll drive off the crowd of boys gathering over there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. They&#39;re just skipping practice and chit-chatting. That&#39;s why they&#39;ll never make it past qualifying.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, excuse us. Saber-san, please enjoy the rest of your day.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will, Yukika. Do not go through too much trouble on my behalf.\u201D</p><p>With a quick bow, Yukika hurries to help the two... no, rather, to stop Makidera from further abusing the boys track team.</p><p>The three of them balance each other out unbelievably well.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, let&#39;s go deliver the lunch.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Let us head to the archery range first, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>The dojo is quiet. I wonder if club activities are only scheduled from the afternoon today?</p><p>In the heart of the still-empty dojo, a tiger that just lay sprawled on the floor springs up to her feet.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, you&#39;re laaate. I got so tired of waiting I thought I was going to turn into a rug.\u201D</p><p>...You already have.</p><p>Just now, you most definitely have, Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry for the wait. But you&#39;re the one who ordered this much food. You would&#39;ve had to wait one or two hours anyway.\u201D</p><p>I put, or rather, pile up, the lunchboxes I&#39;ve been carrying onto the ground.</p><p>There&#39;s enough food for about six people.</p><hr><p>\u201CExcellent, excellent. Fine work, Shirou.</p><p>Hmm, this much should be enough. There&#39;s lunch for me, Sakura-chan, Shirou and Saber-chan, and Mitsuzuri-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTaiga, may I take lunch here?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course! You&#39;ve come all this way to see the school, so it would be a waste if we didn&#39;t do something special.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut I am not in the club\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t sweat the small stuff.</p><p>You&#39;re a visiting guest at this school, it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a club member or not. And besides, Saber-chan, you&#39;re Shirou&#39;s guardian, no, you&#39;re part of the family. If we had a Parents&#39; Day here, I&#39;d want you to come for sure.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am Shirou&#39;s relative?</p><p>Well, that certainly seems to have become the case, but...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. Rider-san&#39;s always here too, though I don&#39;t where she wandered off to just now.</p><p>Meaning, Saber-chan, you&#39;re here all by yourself, right? Sooo, you ought to do this once in a while too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Taiga.</p><p>Thank you for your consideration.</p><p>Including that matter from earlier, today my respect for you has only grown. You truly are different when you&#39;re at school.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah!\u201D</p><p>From behind Saber, someone wholeheartedly agrees.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, Saber-san, welcome.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, good work. Sorry, but I heard you were treating us today?\u201D</p><p>\u201CExcuse us. The two of you must have club activities today.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, today we start in the afternoon. Mitsuzuri-senpai and I were in a meeting for the cultural festival this morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHonestly, I can&#39;t believe we got so little done.</p><p>I&#39;m ready to give up. They&#39;ve received way too many applications for food events, and our club&#39;s members are strangely incompetent.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m sorry... I know the most useless one is me...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, well, we&#39;ll manage. If it comes down to it, we can always make Minori dance... Wait, no. If we&#39;re going to put on a dance show, then don&#39;t we have a master right here?</p><p>Hey Saber-san, are you free on the day of the festival? If you don&#39;t have anything else planned, we could use your help.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? M-My help?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYep. As long as you&#39;re fine with it, would you mind lending a hand to our performance?</p><p>Saber-san, you&#39;re talented and you&#39;ll stand out on stage. Not to mention that you&#39;re overwhelmingly better than Fujimura-sensei with the sword. Actually, as far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re better than anyone else.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>At a loss for words, Saber remains silent.</p><p>\u201CHold on, Mitsuzuri. You&#39;re just going to embarrass Saber by being so sudden.</p><p>She isn&#39;t even in the archery club to begin with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut she isn&#39;t unrelated either, right? Isn&#39;t that what Fujimura-sensei said earlier, that Saber-san&#39;s part of the Emiya family?</p><p>I don&#39;t see anything wrong with her participating in the cultural festival.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;How about THAT,&quot; her face retorts with brimming confidence.</p><p>\u201CMrgh... well, yeah.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat now? Or are you against Saber-san coming to our cultural festival, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGah, like hell I would be!</p><p>I-If Saber comes wearing a Homurabara uniform, I&#39;ll have no regrets of these past three years!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSee, it&#39;s settled then.</p><p>Hey Saber-san, just think about it a little. Fujimura-sensei and Emiya have already said this much.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, I will treasure the opportunity.</p><p>If you will have me, it would be my pleasure.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s voice comes out as meek as a kitten&#39;s.</p><p>...What&#39;s with me? For just a moment, even though I&#39;m not upset or anything, my chest grew tight.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right! Now that it&#39;s decided, let&#39;s have lunch!</p><p>C&#39;mon Shirou, open up those lunchboxes! My stomach is growling, so hurry, hurry!\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh, way to ruin a tender moment.</p><p>All right, I got it. Sakura, help me out with the tea.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine, Emiya. I&#39;ll handle it.</p><p>I&#39;m the one being treated, so let me do this much, at least.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. In that case... Sakura, I&#39;ll leave the lunchboxes and Fuji-Nee&#39;s guard duty to you... Don&#39;t look away even for a second.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey Shirou, what&#39;s that supposed to mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, no early starts for you. Not even one piece!</p><p>Now then, Sensei, shall we unpack the lunches?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure! I wonder what&#39;s for today...\u201D</p><hr><p>After finishing lunch, we leave the archery range.</p><p>The stacks of lunchboxes were weighing down our tour earlier, so they stay behind.</p><p>I&#39;ll let Fuji-Nee take them home, while we continue touring the school.</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you for the meal.</p><p>That lunch was very good as always, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.</p><p>...Though to tell the truth, I wanted to eat on the roof. Well, how about the next time we get a chance?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, by all means.</p><p>According to Rin, you often take your meals on the rooftop or in the student council room.\u201D</p><hr><p>We put the archery dojo behind us.</p><p>Next is... yeah, since she mentioned it, we might as well visit the student council room.</p><p>I see students scattered throughout the school building, so Issei might be there too.</p><hr><p>We head towards the student council room.</p><p>By now I&#39;ve gotten used to the high-pitched squeals whenever we pass students or classrooms in the hallways.</p><p>Have I just learned to tune it out, or am I not even noticing them?</p><p>Saber walks through the somewhat, considering it&#39;s a holiday, crowded halls with composure.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we come across Mr. Kuzuki.</p><p>Of course, we&#39;re at school so it&#39;s natural he would be here.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood morning... although it seems to have passed already. How is your health, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>A strange tension fills the air.</p><p>Saber&#39;s expression is somewhat tense, as well.</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki fixes Saber with a hard gaze.</p><p>He&#39;s no magus, but he&#39;s still Caster&#39;s Master.</p><p>He might take Saber&#39;s presence in the school as a sign of an upcoming battle.</p><hr><p>\u201CKuzuki-sensei, Saber is...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI heard from Fujimura-sensei. Take your time showing her around until the school closes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, yes. Thank you.\u201D</p><p>...I was the one who misunderstood.</p><p>This person isn&#39;t one to fight without reason.</p><hr><p>\u201CI should be the one thanking you. Please feel free to come by later.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI will, if there&#39;s time.\u201D</p><p>With a &quot;Good day,&quot; Kuzuki goes on his way.</p><p>He walks away silently, as always. What superbly balanced, flawless footwork...</p><hr><p>\u201CHold on. Saber, what just happened?\u201D</p><p>Why would Kuzuki be grateful to Saber!?</p><p>\u201C...It&#39;s nothing important.</p><p>Occasionally, Caster asks me to help her with her side business.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CB-Business...!? Caster has a job!?</p><p>W-W-What&#39;s up with that incredibly shady explanation!? T-There&#39;s no way someone like her could possibly be hurting for money, right!?\u201D</p><p>After all, she&#39;s a one-of-a-kind magus.</p><p>Feats like turning lead into gold would be child&#39;s play for her.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is what I initially thought as well, but she said something about the type of labor that enriches the spirit being a different endeavor than that of material riches.</p><p>...Though honestly, where does she receive those orders from? There weren&#39;t any dresses of that sort even in my time.\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber grumbles about something.</p><p>...Anyway.</p><p>\u201C...Well, that&#39;s another matter. But as long as she thinks it&#39;s worth doing...\u201D</p><p>And it appears Saber did not mind it, either.</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse us... as I thought, no one but Issei here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHello there, Emiya. I was wondering who that was.\u201D</p><p>He looks up at me from some documents and a calculator.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see you&#39;ve brought Saber-san as well.</p><p>I see, you must be the school visitor I&#39;d been told about.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hm,&quot; Issei nods.</p><p>Though he universally regards the female population with scorn, Issei seems to have taken an unusual liking to Saber.</p><p>According to him, he felt her divine presence, or something.</p><hr><p>\u201CI shall make some tea. Please feel free to help yourself, Saber-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you. It is good to see you again, Issei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre we keeping you? If you&#39;re busy, we can come back.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t mind, these are all routine tasks. Nothing requiring urgent attention.\u201D</p><hr><p>Leaving Issei to serve the tea, I take a seat alongside Saber.</p><p>We can hear the clamor of club activities coming through the window.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, Emiya. Why did you decide to bring Saber-san here, of all the places you could be touring? I do not think there&#39;s anything special to see here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is not true.</p><p>I have heard all about you and the student council from Shirou, so I have been wondering what kind of place it was.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see... Sorry, but if I had known the two of you were coming, I would have bought some fine tea cakes...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine! Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>In fact, we just ate. I can&#39;t think of anything better to soothe our throats than some hot tea.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. That&#39;s good.</p><p>But where did you have lunch? Isn&#39;t the cafeteria closed?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe archery range. Shirou packed lunches for us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat... Hm, I must have just missed you.</p><p>I visited the archery range during first period.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou missed out on Shirou&#39;s fine cooking, then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnfortunately. Albeit unavoidable, it&#39;s still a shame.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Saber and Issei complement each other frightfully well.</p><p>I only just realized this, but they might have really similar personalities.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, then. Today the school is fairly crowded because many students are here preparing for the cultural festival, but I&#39;m sure they will welcome you quite warmly, Saber-san.</p><p>It&#39;s a rare opportunity, so please take your time exploring the school. Or rather, I think you&#39;d like to go somewhere a little more interesting than the student council room.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot at all.</p><p>If possible, I would like to rest here a bit longer.\u201D</p><hr><p>I nod in agreement.</p><p>There&#39;s still time, so I&#39;d like to take it easy for a bit longer.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. Then shall we chat a little more?</p><p>I think that rather than a discussion about the campus, wouldn&#39;t you be more interested in hearing what Emiya is like at school?\u201D</p><p>Saber lets out a curious gasp.</p><p>But personally, I can&#39;t stand being talked about like I&#39;m some tasty morsel to be enjoyed over tea.</p><hr><p>\u201CH-Hold on, Issei. What are you planning to tell her!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing to be flustered over. That was my intention from the beginning. First of all, it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve done anything to be ashamed of... have you, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Well, no...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh my, Shirou. Are you hiding something from me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve got nothing to keep secret from you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen it is decided.</p><p>Issei, please indulge me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUh...\u201D</p><p>Ugh, they just went ahead without really asking me... These two get along way too well.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right. Even so, what should I talk about? There is so much to tell about him, that it&#39;s hard to decide.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat about the times Shirou has assisted you here, as I have heard?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. To put it simply, he would help repair school equipment and so forth.</p><p>We don&#39;t have the luxury of buying replacements for everything that breaks, so he&#39;s been a great help in that regard.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Oh man, this is embarrassing... it&#39;s like a parent-teacher conference...</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t mind it so much if it were Kiritsugu or Fuji-Nee, but for some reason, it&#39;s especially embarrassing to have Saber hear about me.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. That certainly does seem to be Shirou&#39;s field of expertise.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not all, but we end up relying on him for every event, as well.</p><p>Or rather, now that I think of it, you could say that he&#39;s always helping somebody out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I see. That does sound quite like Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaahaaha. Yes, I was thinking the same thing. That&#39;s just how Emiya is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt really is quite troublesome.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015About that, Issei. Could you describe in detail what he does?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll kinds of matters. It would take me all day to list them, so I&#39;ll talk about the interesting ones.\u201D</p><p>A couple of giddy honor students, these two.</p><p>...Whatever, just do as you please...</p><hr><p>...It dragged on for a long, tortuous hour.</p><p>The two of them were talking really excitedly, but at this rate daylight will be gone. We still haven&#39;t seen a lot of the school, so I suggest we take a break for today.</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry for keeping you.</p><p>Please, enjoy the rest of your sightseeing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo apology needed. Tt was a very valuable talk. Now I know about another side of Shirou, in addition to the one that Taiga described.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHa, ha, ha. Well, I shall be happy to entertain you again anytime you like.</p><p>If you wouldn&#39;t mind coming over to the temple next time, I&#39;d be glad to have you. That way, I can offer you some proper hospitality.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBy all means, if I get a chance.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Issei. You still haven&#39;t told her enough?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. Out of the album of memories I&#39;ve made over these three years, today was only a page of it. Next time, I&#39;ll tell her about your second year...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s go, Saber.</p><p>I had no idea Issei could be this talkative. If we stay, he&#39;ll keep us here all night.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-I suppose so.</p><p>Then, until next time, Issei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, our second year... we were getting ready for the main event, our summer training camp, and... huh, they&#39;re gone!?</p><p>...Well, yeah... Did I get carried away and make a shameful display of myself...!?\u201D</p><hr><p>We spent the afternoon leisurely.</p><p>We visited all the special classrooms like the music and A/V rooms, then the gym and library, and then the student cafeteria.</p><p>Showing Saber around, who had never seen a school before, turned out to be more fun than I expected. I think it was well worth it.</p><hr><p>We continued into the evening.</p><p>The students had begun heading home, and we started thinking of doing the same.</p><p>\u201CLast of all, I want to see your classroom, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>For the first time today, Saber asks to go somewhere on her own.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo this is your classroom?</p><p>......It really doesn&#39;t look much different than any of the other rooms.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, of course. I told you all the classrooms look the same. The only differences between the classes would be what&#39;s on their bulletin boards, and stuff like marks on the desks.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, hm, I see.</p><p>Then, Shirou&#39;s desk would be... this one, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>Using some kind of intuition, Saber points out my exact seat.</p><p>\u201CHrm! In the middle of this well-kept desk, I spy a grievous scar... It is as if it was dealt a horrific blow by an iron hammer.</p><p>Shirou, what in the world could have...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat was the time Fuji-Nee faceplanted on my desk and left a crater with her head. She kept teaching the class while blood gushed out all over the place.\u201D</p><p>In my three years here, that was the first Legend of Fujimura.</p><hr><p>\u201CI... see.</p><p>It is a mark quite unlike yourself, and I thought it unseemly...</p><p>...but if Taiga was responsible for it, then I should say it fits you well, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>With that oddly cheerful comment, Saber walks around the classroom.</p><p>Even though there shouldn&#39;t have been anything worth seeing here, she seems to be happier here than she&#39;s been all day.</p><p>Well, since we&#39;ve come all this way,</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Saber?</p><p>Sorry to ask this all of a sudden, but why are you so interested in my school?\u201D</p><p>The question&#39;s been nagging at me since morning.</p><hr><p>\u201CFor no particular reason.</p><p>I was merely interested in the life you lead at school, Shirou.</p><p>It is thanks to you and Taiga that I was able to experience it firsthand.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I get it. But still, I haven&#39;t fulfilled even half of that wish.</p><p>It&#39;s the school life that Saber said she was interested in.</p><p>Not the buildings, but the everyday life that people spend in it.</p><hr><p>\u201CI guess we should&#39;ve come during a weekday. You wanted to see the classes, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI suppose so. I would&#39;ve liked to watch at my own leisure.</p><p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t assume a spirit form.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong with that?</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just transfer in? I&#39;m sure Tohsaka can take care of the paperwork.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;I see,&quot; nods Saber.</p><p>\u201CThat would be splendid. I had not thought of that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight? Okay, let&#39;s check with Tohsaka after we get home.</p><p>Knowing her, she&#39;ll probably scramble to have it all set up before we know it. Fuji-Nee will surely help out with that too.\u201D</p><hr><p>I babble on like an idiot, as if in a fever dream.</p><p>\u201CYes. I very much look forward to it, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Saber answers with a lovely smile.</p><p>...Though I&#39;m wondering just what she&#39;s thinking behind that smile.</p><p>I still don&#39;t know the difference between a promise and a wish.</p><hr><p>And like that, our brief rest came to an end.</p><p>Just as it was this morning, our walk home is nice and leisurely.</p><hr><p>The view overlooking the town from the hill road is different than usual.</p><p>No, I should say that the view is always different.</p><p>I normally just don&#39;t take the time to pay attention to it.</p><hr><p>Stopping for a moment, Saber turns her soft gaze towards the town.</p><p>\u201CDo you see something, Saber?\u201D</p><p>I ask her as casually as I can.</p><p>I call out to her in my usual voice, so as not to spoil the fun we had today.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, nothing in particular.</p><p>This is the town of Fuyuki, as we have always known it.\u201D</p><p>A gentle breeze wafts through the air.</p><p>Her golden hair sways in the wind.</p><p>Our pleasant day is about to end.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen let&#39;s go home. You said there wasn&#39;t anything particularly special, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Still, I would like to stay here and look a bit longer.</p><p>So that I will remember this view, as long as I live.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you&#39;re exaggerating. It&#39;s no big deal, you know? You can come out here and look again tomorrow.\u201D</p><hr><p>Not just tomorrow, but until eternity.</p><p>The Heaven&#39;s Feel will never end.</p><p>Even if I were to die and she were to disappear.</p><p>I&#39;m sure this peaceful life would go on forever.</p><p>As long as the fighting never ends, and as long as no one wishes for an end to it,</p><p>that promise will never be reduced to a simple wish.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015But, you would never allow that. You wouldn&#39;t stand for it, after all.\u201D</p><p>The sunset was beautiful.</p><p>...No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p>What&#39;s beautiful is that she...</p><hr><p>\u201CIsn&#39;t that right?</p><p>In this Utopia where people know no loss,</p><p>only you try to see the value in things that are no longer here.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015above all, that she feels the beauty of this sunset.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I finally understood.</p><p>This whole day, she didn&#39;t hide her face even once.</p><p>She saw that promise off with a smile. The promise that she could fulfill, if she only wished for it.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right. I&#39;m going to settle the Heaven&#39;s Feel once and for all.\u201D</p><p>Such self-righteousness.</p><p>There&#39;s really no need to end the war.</p><p>I could just sleep until the fourth day.</p><p>I could just close my eyes and let the four days pass me by.</p><p>Just like that, all this strangeness would end.</p><hr><p>But, that&#39;s not something Emiya Shirou can abide.</p><p>He can&#39;t let go of things that are lost.</p><p>He won&#39;t surrender to ignorant bliss, a life without progress.</p><p>He won&#39;t accept the most convenient happiness.</p><p>He&#39;s not one to take whatever is thrown at him, this self-declared hero that&#39;s twisted to the bone.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. You, and many others, would find that reprehensible.</p><p>But that&#39;s what I find noble instead.</p><p>You will end the Heaven&#39;s Feel. Whether I try to stop or save you, I&#39;m sure the end result will not change.\u201D</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s why she didn&#39;t make any promises she couldn&#39;t keep.</p><p>Like watching a well-made tale unfold, she simply smiled and closed her eyes to tomorrow.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is that really alright? My own thoughts are a lot closer to being stubborn and fanatical.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I shall continue to protect that pride.</p><p>Until the very end, I offer my life as your sword.\u201D</p><p>Now, this one was a promise.</p><p>She swore an oath to fight alongside me.</p><p>Without a thought of regret, she continues cutting my dream spectacularly into ribbons.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease don&#39;t make such a sad face.</p><p>It will be all right. Even if the end comes, it won&#39;t be a farewell.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt won&#39;t?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo\u2015\u2015\u2015We shall each return to the future we desired.\u201D</p><hr><p>Well, of course.</p><p>Whatever that desired future is, we&#39;ll know when the dark night ends.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>The light of the brightest star of them all is guiding me forward.</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s go home, Saber.</p><p>Thanks for today.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot at all. I should be the one thanking you, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>We resume walking.</p><p>The curtain falls on another day.</p><p>Now\u2015\u2015\u2015when I wake up, I will have to keep living a life worthy of this sword myself\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="streets\u30FBday-3-bridge-on-an-ordinary-night-left" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#streets\u30FBday-3-bridge-on-an-ordinary-night-left" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Streets\u30FBDay 3 Bridge on an ordinary night - left</h3><hr><p>\u201CHuh\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>In the middle of the bridge, something strange catches my eye.</p><p>Stopping in my tracks, I look at the figure. I think to myself, but can&#39;t really understand what their intentions are.</p><p>\u201C......What are you trying to do?\u201D</p><p>I&#39;d be worried later if I ignored this.</p><p>As a friend, I should at least give a word of caution.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s this? I thought I mistook a spider crawling its way up here, but isn&#39;t it none other than Shirou-kun from the Emiya household?</p><p>What brings you to a place like this, something happen? The roads around here are dangerous, you know? Ah, could it be you&#39;re planning to jump off?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...............<em>sigh</em>\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, I feel drained.</p><p>For her to seriously worry I&#39;m going to jump off, I just don&#39;t get her thought process.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou know, Tohsaka. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right reaction to someone worrying about the well being of a friend.</p><p>Also, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s doing something dangerous.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? No way, you saw that earlier, Emiya-kun!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTch, I was seen...? The whole time...? So, I was completely found out, huh? Damn iiiit!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>0.2 seconds after I tilted my head in confusion at Tohsaka&#39;s eccentricities...</p><p>A single punch, as if to counter-attack, made explosive contact with the side of my head.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m sorry, it was a misunderstanding.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; she lowers her arms to her sides with a slight bow.</p><p>In addition to her study of Chinese martial arts, it seems like Tohsaka has taken up karate too.</p><hr><p>\u201C...No, that was incredible, Tohsaka. The way used your entire body as you threw it, that was one magnificent right hook. That may have even cracked my cheekbone.\u201D</p><p>Fu\uFF5Efu\uFF5Efu.</p><p>I don&#39;t say it, but I tell her through the look in my eyes that her feelings alone aren&#39;t enough to earn my forgiveness.</p><hr><p>\u201CL-Like I already said, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Everything just now was completely my fault. Everywhere, from top to bottom was my carelessness.\u201D</p><hr><p>It was unusual to hear such an earnest apology from Tohsaka.</p><p>Troubling people is like a hobby for this red devil, but the moment when one of her careless mistakes ends up making trouble for someone, she becomes unexpectedly meek.</p><p>...At times like these Tohsaka tends to do whatever she likes, but unfortunately, the place she chose is a two-lane roadway with a 60 km/h speed limit where even the slightest negligence can get you run over.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, try to slow down a bit next time. If your first reaction is to punch someone, I&#39;m worried about your future.\u201D</p><p>Not so much for her future as those of the innocent people in her near vicinity.</p><hr><p>\u201CH-How rude, I&#39;m usually more calm.</p><p>If it was anyone else that saw me, I would&#39;ve restrained myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat!? S-So in your mind I&#39;m guilty by default!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh? No, that&#39;s not it, I mean that, if it had been someone else I wouldn&#39;t have panicked, or felt so embarrassed... Ah, no, I mean, anybody in that situation would&#39;ve been guilty in my eyes, yeah.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I don&#39;t really see your point.</p><p>You&#39;re saying that only because it was me, that misunderstanding just now was a heavier offense?\u201D</p><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s right. Umm... R-Right! Because you&#39;ve got really good eyes, Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>So that&#39;s it.</p><p>At this point, even I can understand what&#39;s going on.</p><p>After eating devastating punch, I explained that I had just gotten here and she entered self-loathing mode.</p><p>After that though, no matter how persistently she says, &quot;Don&#39;t ask me why...&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C...I don&#39;t get it. Why did you climb up that steel frame? Are normal streets just too boring for you?\u201D</p><p>Bullseye, huh?</p><p>Apparently before I arrived, Tohsaka had been elegantly observing the city below from on top of that steel arch.</p><hr><p>\u201CA-Aren&#39;t you unusually sharp today, Emiya-kun?</p><p>...As I thought, you were watching from the beginning...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf I were watching from the beginning, I would have stopped you immediately.</p><p>Climbing up there is reckless, even for you. This isn&#39;t the circus. If you fall, you won&#39;t get away with just a few scrapes.</p><p>...Honestly, don&#39;t make me worry so much.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Idiot.&quot; I hit her head with a light chop.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka took my chop without complaint.</p><p>...Well, what can I say? It&#39;s a bit unusual, but a meek Tohsaka isn&#39;t bad either.</p><hr><p>\u201CI don&#39;t know what you were trying to do, but next time please just walk across like a normal person. If you do that then I&#39;ll call it even for that right hook just now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Fine. I can&#39;t make any promises, but I&#39;ll try my best not to do it again, unless it&#39;s do or die.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m done investigating anyway.\u201D</p><hr><p>Saying &quot;I can&#39;t make any promises&quot; is just like her.</p><p>At the very least, it means there&#39;s a possibility of her climbing that arch once more.</p><hr><p>\u201CSay, Tohsaka. You weren&#39;t investigating the monsters I told you about, were you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...! ...Wait, just what in the world is going on?</p><p>You&#39;re very observant, today of all days. Even though I was up on that steel frame, how did you connect that with the familiars?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, um, how do I put it? It&#39;s just that...\u201D</p><hr><p>...Damn.</p><p>I met someone here doing exactly the same thing as Tohsaka some time ago, but I&#39;m not sure if I should tell her that.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s just that Archer did something pretty similar right here.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I knew she&#39;d react like this.</p><p>The relationship between Tohsaka and Archer isn&#39;t really something you can easily explain.</p><p>Even though their contract has been released, there&#39;s no sign from either that they&#39;ve accepted that.</p><p>So like now, they show interest in the same things while acting independently from each other, calling it a relationship of &quot;give and take.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmm. I was wondering why he never came by to greet me and there he is again, sticking his nose where it doesn&#39;t belong.</p><p>So, what did he say, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s see... Well, nothing specific. He said he thinks of them as enemies and other stuff like &quot;if you defeat one more will come take it&#39;s place&quot; and to &quot;just leave them alone because they&#39;re harmless.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Anything else? Did he show any sign that he knew something about the source of these monsters you spoke of?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI don&#39;t think so. It looked like he was still at the stage of trying to figure out what their goals are.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExcuse me? He&#39;s already investigated here and couldn&#39;t figure out something so simple? These things could have only one goal!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s surprised.</p><p>Tohsaka, you know what those monsters are after?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re doing it, but their objective is obvious, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Emiya-kun. From what you told me, those monsters are only killing you, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015well,that&#39;s true, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn that case it&#39;s simple. They only appear on the fourth night and only go after Emiya-kun, who feels there&#39;s something off about the last four days.</p><p>They&#39;re gathering <em>to stop you from clearing it</em>.\u201D</p><hr><p>...For some reason, I felt a shiver go down my spine.</p><p>Just as she says, those monsters have only been killing me. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising at all.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;to stop you from clearing it&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Something about the way she said that was nauseatingly repulsive.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen again, I&#39;m starting to wonder what the point of this is. I want to see these monsters, but no matter how much I search, I can&#39;t find them.</p><p>...That damn Archer, how did he find them...?\u201D</p><hr><p>Archer had taken up position on the roof of the Shinto Center building and sniped at the monsters trying to invade.</p><p>The great field of vision from that building&#39;s roof and Archer&#39;s hawk eyes. Without those two things, the discovery would have been difficult.</p><hr><p>\u201C...So, did he say anything else?</p><p>Something like, &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t do this alone&quot; or, &quot;I could really use some help right about now.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, nothing like that.</p><p>Ah, he didn&#39;t say anything, but he did glare at Ryuudou Temple.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRyuudou Temple...? ...I see, the familiars are flowing out from that direction.\u201D</p><hr><p>I remembered Issei&#39;s ghost story.</p><p>The Kageyama Entrail Graveyard. The mountain used to abandon old women to die where not even the dead are buried. What is left is a mountain of discarded meat.</p><p>Truly, it is a suitable graveyard for these creatures.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, I think I understand the general situation now. It&#39;s a shame I couldn&#39;t find those monsters, well, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll show up in the end.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka stretches lazily, as if to say there&#39;s no point in investigating here any more.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m going home, but what about you Emiya-kun? Shall we head back together?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... No, I&#39;ve still got things to do in town. Let&#39;s part here.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Well, see you then. Don&#39;t wander around too late.\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka heads to the footbridge.</p><p>Jumping over there is no problem with her athletic prowess, but... she really ought to pick clothes better suited for these kinds of stunts.</p><p>Well, leaving that aside...</p><hr><p>\u201CHey\uFF5E! Is it really okay to leave Archer alone like that\uFF5E?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy not? Whatever he&#39;s doing, it&#39;s got nothing to do with me. You really shouldn&#39;t expect anything from him either, Emiya-kun. When it comes down to it, he&#39;s all talk and no action.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm... Then, can I count on you instead, Tohsaka\uFF5E?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. You have to finish what you start, after all.</p><p>If you make it to the end, I&#39;ll help you out however I can. As repayment for that right hook.\u201D</p><p>Without hesitation, Tohsaka jumps over to the footbridge and lands with a soft thump.</p><hr><p>This is different than the time with Archer.</p><p>Leaving behind a feeling of refreshment, the red magician gracefully exits the stage.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBStreets at night (battle)</h3><h3 id="night\u30FB2-finaleii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FB2-finaleii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FB2 (FinaleII)</h3><hr><p>No matter how often I come here, the church is always the same.</p><p>Saber never discovered anything, either.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing here.</p><p>Let&#39;s go elsewhere.</p><p>Though it would be good to have a definite objective the next time I&#39;m here.</p><hr><h2 id="day-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 4</h2><h3 id="demonic-nest-arriving-at-the-castle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-arriving-at-the-castle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Arriving at the Castle</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest-just-before-the-finale" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-just-before-the-finale" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Just before the finale</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest</h3><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015This will be the last piece above the ground.</p><hr><p>Avenger said to &quot;go to the <em>Heaven&#39;s Cup</em>.&quot;</p><p>Einzbern&#39;s secret artifact, the Third Sorcery, or the Heaven&#39;s Feel.</p><p>The girl of winter, who bears their name, ought to have known all the tricks behind it from the start.</p><hr><p>Passing through the long hallway, I exit into the courtyard.</p><p>The sky above the castle is always cloudy.</p><p>No matter what kind of grail it is, perhaps it simply couldn&#39;t invade this castle, owned by the true holy grail.</p><hr><p>\u201CIllyasviel.\u201D</p><p>I call out to her.</p><p>Out of unease and resignation, I&#39;m lacking emotion now.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>There is no reply.</p><p>I lift up my foot to walk a little closer.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s okay, I can hear you, so stay there.</p><p>Good day, Shirou.

I&#39;ll overlook your bad manners.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou see, the Grail that was the prize in Fuyuki&#39;s Heaven&#39;s Feel was nothing more than a swirl of magical energy taking the name &quot;Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>It just &quot;grants&quot; the owner&#39;s wishes in a broad sense with that excessive power.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut, this Grail is different.</p><p>It&#39;s not particularly powerful, but it tries to grant its owner&#39;s wishes as much as possible within the scope of its ability. It&#39;s puny, but it&#39;s a real Holy Grail.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNeedless to say, it is actually a Servant!</p><p>It&#39;s someone who was summoned in the third Heaven&#39;s Feel, taken into the Grail, and grew into a &quot;demon that grants people&#39;s wishes&quot; through the power of the Grail!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Demon that grants people&#39;s wishes&quot; is a misnomer.</p><p>To be precise, he grew into a &quot;demon that people wished for.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CBut I will not speak of the demon&#39;s name.</p><p>The Heaven&#39;s Cup might be something along the lines of that demon&#39;s contract.</p><p>That&#39;s where it all began, perhaps where the demon&#39;s precious contract partner is.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo that&#39;s where the Grail is? Where is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe highest point in this city. Someone who wasn&#39;t in the fifth Heaven&#39;s Feel fell to earth from there.</p><p>Everything&#39;s upside down. It&#39;s not Heaven&#39;s Feel, but Heaven&#39;s Fall.\u201D</p><hr><p>The highest point in this city.</p><p>That&#39;s not the central building, but rather...</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s impossible. How am I supposed to get up there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ah, I see, normally you can&#39;t actually go there.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I guess it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>Say, what do you think of this Heaven&#39;s Feel, Shirou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNothing.</p><p>This is all fake. The four days are just a lie.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen what happens after the fourth day? Does everyone disappear?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015No, that&#39;s...\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not that everyone disappears.</p><p>Only the events of these four days disappear.</p><p>They&#39;re just illusions that took place in a fake world.</p><p>No memory nor trace remains.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, exactly.</p><p>You called it a fake world, but that&#39;s not really true. Even if the setting is fake, the people are all real.</p><p>Take Rin, for example. Even if her role has changed, Rin is Rin, no matter what.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COnly one person in this world is a fake.</p><p>That person disguised himself as someone in this town, and restarted the Heaven&#39;s Feel in this world.</p><p>To continue the Heaven&#39;s Feel in accordance with the wish of the one who contracted him, he is experiencing the fifth war that he was not a part of.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Come to think of it.</p><p>So that&#39;s why the earth and the Heaven&#39;s Cup don&#39;t overlap.</p><p>Using the participants of the fifth war, she continues the fight using the script of the third.</p><p>But sometimes the faker screws up, and the third and fifth become connected.</p><p>The two wars aren&#39;t linked. Her war and ours were two different things from the beginning.</p><hr><p>\u201CAfter the fourth day everyone will return back to normal.</p><p>Everything goes back to how it should be.</p><p>It&#39;s as if those four days never happened.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut only that person disappears with the fourth day.</p><p>They can&#39;t go to the reality that awaits on the fifth day.</p><p>Just like their lost name, there is no memory of them in the world.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>After all, they were never in this town from the very beginning.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015But still.</p><p>If he&#39;s a fake, then he must be based on someone real.</p><p>What happens to the real one?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe switches places with the fake. As though nothing had happened.\u201D</p><hr><p>Is that so?</p><p>So when the fake disappears and the impurity is removed, the real one remains.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see... But there&#39;s something I don&#39;t get.</p><p>This will sound sort of strange, but is the fake really a fake?</p><p>No matter how similar he is to the real one, as long as he&#39;s not real, everything he does...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo. He&#39;s fake, but he&#39;s certainly real.</p><p>He&#39;s not a duplicate or an identical copy.</p><p>He just becomes the real thing only during these four days.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I don&#39;t really understand.</p><p>It&#39;s not the theory I don&#39;t understand, but why this girl is smiling at me like this.</p><p>Just from that smile\u2015\u2015\u2015I,</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Is that so?</p><p>Then everything he did was natural.\u201D</p><p>Having resigned myself until now, I sigh with relief.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. I said he was disguised, but he was a formless nothing to begin with.</p><p>Nothing can&#39;t turn into something, nor can it imitate anything.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015even if he takes shape using someone&#39;s body, he&#39;s still no more than nothing.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEven if he possesses... no, assimilates into someone, he has no influence over the host.</p><p>So, even though he&#39;s a fake.</p><p>His actions are unmistakably those of the real thing.\u201D</p><hr><p>It all makes sense now.</p><p>It may have been fake, but everything that happened there was real.</p><p>But, how do I put this...</p><hr><p>\u201C...It seems like he has his own will, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That&#39;s not the &quot;nothing&#39;s&quot; will.</p><p>After being assimilated into a body with a will, he&#39;s just deluded into thinking it&#39;s his own.\u201D</p><hr><p>I understand now.</p><p>To put it figuratively, if he disguises himself as a kindhearted person, all he can do is think like one.</p><p>The Servant called Avenger isn&#39;t something split off from &quot;all the evil in the world.&quot;</p><p>That personality is nothing more than a fabrication, created using the &quot;person possessed by the nothing&quot; as a sample.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen he...\u201D</p><p>He wasn&#39;t even a fake in the first place.</p><p>He simply didn&#39;t exist.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015No. I&#39;ll give you credit.</p><p>You are you, Angra Mainyu. You may forget this right away, but I will remember it to the end.</p><p>I will remember that you tried to bring an end to this wish through your own will.\u201D</p><hr><p>Maybe this is karma.</p><p>A descendant of the ones who summoned me is releasing and helping me.</p><hr><p>\u201CEverything in this world will eventually come to an end.</p><p>No matter how finely made this miniature garden is, you will know everything in time.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe flaws are visible.</p><p>If you want it to continue, then you must not act.</p><p>Unless you repeat only the minimum number of scenes and leave unknown events untouched, it will subside.</p><p>The existence of an unknown future. That in itself was the power that made this world work.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015you two couldn&#39;t do that.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D*</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>The two of us couldn&#39;t do that.</p><p>The real one, who sought a better outcome due to his natural warped personality.</p><p>The fake one, who wanted to see new things just because he found it fun.</p><p>That is the main character in this miniature garden.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D*</p><p>\u201CThis is all I can do for you. You were nothing more than an observer until now, but now you&#39;ve been recognized by a person.</p><p>The rest is simple. After all, even if you forget, I will remember.</p><p>You will reach that moon, as yourself.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You have finally arrived here, at long last.\u201D*</p><hr><p>It&#39;s as Illyasviel says.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any means by which to get to the moon.</p><p>The only ones who can reach the Holy Grail are Avenger&#39;s real form, which was there from the beginning, and Bazett, who formed a contract with him.</p><hr><p>I&#39;ve finished what had to be done.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to part with Illya before my fever returns.</p><hr><p>\u201CDid you have fun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Thanks, Illya.\u201D</p><p>Not for what she did now, but for enjoying herself for my sake, even as she knew everything.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re welcome.</p><p>It&#39;s a bargain sale of miracles, so I think it&#39;d be a loss if I didn&#39;t do this much.\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s no lie in her smiling face.</p><p>Rather than joy, a feeling of enlightenment overcomes me.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey. Is it almost over?\u201D</p><p>I avert my eyes from Illya.</p><p>\u201CYes. With this, I&#39;ve lost yet another star.\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, I&#39;m wrapped in something warm.</p><p>And when I realize it&#39;s someone&#39;s body,</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re so stubborn. You&#39;re allowed to cry at least once.\u201D</p><p>At last my suppressed emotions take over me.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Why? There isn&#39;t anything worth crying over.</p><p>Everyday life will continue. There&#39;s nothing lost.\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s only a matter of something that didn&#39;t exist in the first place returning to its state of nonexistence.</p><p>A return to the cosmic order.</p><hr><p>I leave the courtyard.</p><p>A brief moment,</p><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015, ack...\u201D</p><p>I get just a little dizzy, and my memory of the events just moments ago becomes fuzzy and disordered.</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks. Come visit again, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Rather than waving at me, Illya gives me a gentle &quot;farewell&quot; instead.</p><p>Still perplexed at my sudden memory loss, I wave her back.</p><p>...Even though the things we talked about turned fuzzy, our farewell stays vivid.</p><hr><p>I mean, how could it not, when she saw me off with such a lovely smile on her face.</p><p>I&#39;m sure those brief moments brought a bit of happiness to her, too\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-spider-ladder" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-spider-ladder" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Spider ladder</h3><hr><p>The curtains fall.</p><p>The buzzer signaling the end of the performance sounds, and the whole residence is sinking into a deep darkness.</p><p>Into a sleep so deep, none would revive and awaken before the fifth day.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Without anyone to bid farewell to,</p><p>nor any baggage to carry home, we depart, leaving the many doorways behind us, as we always have.</p><hr><p>The date will change soon.</p><p>On the night of the fourth day, the black moon is coming to do away with me, the only survivor.</p><p>That&#39;s the foundation I&#39;m going to destroy.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I continue on, stifling the screams.</p><p>This is the tower that I will reach the hollow sky from.</p><p>Since I already know what my true identity is, the path should appear here\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The date changes.</p><p>The atmosphere goes stagnant, time becomes vague, and even my body itself starts to undergo a strange transformation.</p><p>\u201C,\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>My chest is hot.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the fast breath, but this one heartbeat is no longer enough.</p><hr><p>\u201C,\u2015\u2015\u2015, \u2015\u2015\u2015, \u2015\u2015\u2015,\u201D*</p><p>Leaving the screams behind, I continue.</p><p>...JusT as I thougHT.
