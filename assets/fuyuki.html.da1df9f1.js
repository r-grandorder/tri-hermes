That&#39;s a simple question.<br> I really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> This is the passageway from the front gate to the Central<br> Command Room, which is in front of the Main Chaldea<br> Gate.</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Anyway, can I ask you a question, Senpai?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You were asleep, but I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d sleep in the<br> hall. Can you not sleep unless you&#39;re on a hard bed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was I sleeping here?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, like a log.<br> It was such a deep sleep, it was almost textbook.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes.

The rookie who just got assigned here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I&#39;m Lev Lainur, one of the technicians employed here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> And your name is?</p><audio controls><source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_2/BGM_EVENT_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Hmm, Fujimaru.<br> So you&#39;re the last of the 48 candidates.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Welcome to Chaldea.<br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I heard you were selected out of many public applicants, how long was your training?<br> A year? 6 months? 3 months?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll leave that to your imagination.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I see that you already know how competitive it is in here.<br> You&#39;re going to hide your info from your rivals?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dr. Lev, Fujimaru&#39;s training was less than a few hours. I think it&#39;s from embarrassment.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh? Well, now... I see. We had an emergency opening for applicants to fill out numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I didn&#39;t go through any training.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh? So you&#39;re a complete amateur?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Right... Come to think of it, we did call for applicants just to fill numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> So you&#39;re one of them?<br> Do forgive me, I was inconsiderate.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> But please don&#39;t be discouraged because you&#39;re a public applicant. We need all of you for this mission.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> 38 elite mages, plus 10 talented public applicants...<br> Somehow, we were able to gather all possible candidates.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s something to rejoice over. This year, 2017, all possible candidates capable of Spiritron Dives were brought to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t understand,<br> feel free to ask Mash or myself anytime... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Come to think of it, what were you talking about with [ \u2642 him / \u2640\uFE0F her], Mash? That&#39;s not like you. Did you know each other before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I&#39;d never met Senpai before.<br> I saw Senpai sleeping here, so I just...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Sleeping?<br> Fujimaru was asleep, here?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Ahh, you went through the simulation when you entered, right? Spiritron Dives can get to you if you&#39;re not used to them.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> After the simulation, the gate must&#39;ve opened and you walked over here before you returned to consciousness.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s a type of sleep-walking. When you fell, Fujimaru, that was when Mash spoke to you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You seem to be fine, but I&#39;d like to take you to the infirmary just in case...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Sorry, hang in there a little longer. The Director&#39;s orientation is about to start. You should hurry over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Director?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The Director&#39;s the director. The person in charge of Chaldea, and the commander of our special missions.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re a rookie from the public, you may have only seen the pamphlet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It would appear so.<br> Since the Director&#39;s profile hasn&#39;t been made public.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai has no connection to the Director.<br> Only mages from families that have been around for over a century show respect to the Animusphere name.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Right. Well, whether you know the Director or not, it doesn&#39;t affect your work as a Master, so it&#39;s not a problem.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> But it&#39;s good to not get on her bad side. If you wish to work in a peaceful environment, better hurry.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> There&#39;s an orientation by the Director at the Central Command Room in 5 minutes. She&#39;s putting on a presentation for the newbies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Orientation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, to greet the Master candidates assigned here today like you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> In other words, it&#39;s for the big boss to welcome the careless newbies.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Since the Director is not the type to forgive and forget, if you show up late, you&#39;ll be on her radar for the entire year.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The orientation begins in five minutes in the Central Command Room. Go straight down this hall. Hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dr. Lev, do you think I&#39;ll be allowed to sit in on the orientation, too?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Hmm? Well, if you stand way back in a corner,<br> I think she&#39;ll look the other way... But why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just thought I should take Senpai to the Command Room. It&#39;s possible that Senpai might fall asleep on the way again.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> ...If I leave you alone like this the Director might yell at me... I should tag along as well, eh?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Well, if that&#39;s what you want to do, Mash, go ahead.<br> You okay with that Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> If you have no other questions, let&#39;s head to the Command Room. Is there anything else you want to know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have no questions.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s get going.<br> Stand up straight, but remember to relax, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why is she calling me Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t worry about it.<br> To her, every human your age is her senpai.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> But it&#39;s unusual to hear her actually call someone that.<br> This might be the first time.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Actually, I&#39;m intrigued.<br> Say, Mash, why do you call [ \u2642 him / \u2640\uFE0F her] Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The reason? Fujimaru is the most human-like person I&#39;ve ever met.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Hmm. Which means?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t feel threatened.<br> So there&#39;s no reason for me to be hostile.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I see, that is important!<br> People at Chaldea are all a piece of work!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I agree with you, Mash.<br> I think you two will get along just fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...If you like Senpai Dr. Lev, the Director will probably hate Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well, why don&#39;t we hide in the restroom to boycott the orientation, then?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That will only make the Director more upset.<br> We&#39;re going to have to leave it to fate.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Shall we jump into the lions&#39; den, Fujimaru? Hey, once you get used to her, she can be a pretty sweet person.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the Central Command Room. Your number, Senpai... Single digit, you&#39;re in the front row.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Take an empty seat in the front row.<br> ...Senpai? You&#39;re looking a bit pale...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;m starting to space out again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Sleepy ...So sleepy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s an after effect of the simulator.<br> I wish I could take you to the infirmary...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> No more small talk.<br> See, the orientation&#39;s already begun.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Well, that wasn&#39;t on time, but looks like we&#39;re all here now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea.<br> I&#39;m the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Are you all right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Wait, was I asleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.<br> It seemed like you were in REM sleep...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, the Director&#39;s slap seemed to wake you up completely. Thank goodness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been left out of the first mission, Senpai.<br> I was taking you back to your room\u2014Oh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A squirrel on your face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Watch out!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, no, this is normal.<br> No problem at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou likes to attack my face, slide around to my back, and settle on my shoulder.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re used to that, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s been a year since Fou came to live here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, are you the one who named him?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. No special reason, the word &quot;Fou&quot; is the first thing that popped into my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you knew that, Senpai.<br> I see you&#39;re quite perceptive yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.<br> Kuuu, Fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm, hmm. Apparently, Fou&#39;s embraced you as one of his own, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But can a squirrel who sees humans as rivals exist in this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He sees me as a rival?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t look at me, I have no idea</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, knowing Fou as I do, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll forget it by tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually, we&#39;ve reached our destination.<br> This is your room, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see. Thanks for coming all this way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. If you ask me, Senpai,<br> I wouldn&#39;t mind even if it&#39;s treating you to lunch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What team are you on, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> First Mission, A Team.<br> Speaking of which, I&#39;ve got to head back now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyu... Kyu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou says he&#39;ll look after you, Senpai.<br> That sets my mind at ease.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, then, I&#39;m off.<br> If we&#39;re lucky, I think we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m in here\u2014Wait?<br> Whaaaaaat? Who are you?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> This is an empty room! It&#39;s where I slack off!<br> Who gave you permission to come in?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I was told that this was my room...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Your room? This place? Oh...<br> I see, so the last one finally showed up, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, who are you?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Who am I? Isn&#39;t it obvious that I&#39;m a healthy, diligent and hard-working doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Well, nice to meet you, Fujimaru. Didn&#39;t think I would run into you like this, but let me introduce myself again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m the head of the medical department, Romani Archaman. For some reason, people just call me<br> Dr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s easier to pronounce, so go ahead and call me Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fact is, Roman has a nice ring to it, no?<br> It sounds cool and vaguely sweet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice to meet you, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, nice to meet you.<br> I look forward to getting to know you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Oh, so you&#39;re the fluffy type?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fluffy? Oh, you mean my hair?<br> I&#39;m normally pretty busy so I just let it grow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? On your shoulder - is that the mysterious creature I&#39;ve heard so much about? Whoa, nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash told me a lot about him, but I didn&#39;t really think he existed... Hey, why don&#39;t I teach him some tricks?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, shake hand.<br> If you do it well, I&#39;ll give you a snack.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh, what? He gave me a really pitying look and then completely ignored me...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A-Anyway, I think I get what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re the rookie who just got here then got on the Director&#39;s bad side?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then you and I are alike.<br> Just so you know, I got yelled at by her too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You know the Rayshift experiment&#39;s about to start, right? The entire staff&#39;s been sent to help out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But since my job is to look after everyone&#39;s health.<br> I had nothing to do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The machines are more accurate at reading the vitals of the mages who are in the Coffins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Director said, &quot;When you&#39;re here, Romani, everyone slacks off!&quot; Then she threw me out. So I&#39;ve been sulking here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But that&#39;s when you showed up.<br> This is what they called a blessing in disguise right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since we both have nowhere to go, why don&#39;t we spend some time and deepen our friendship!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure. This is my room, anyhow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. So that means I&#39;m visiting a friend&#39;s room!<br> Woo hoo! I&#39;ve made a new friend!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I&#39;m a loner.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey... You already have a friend even though you just got here... What a people person! I want in!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s the structure of Chaldea. An underground workshop built on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Romani, we&#39;re going to start the Rayshift soon.<br> Could you come in case there&#39;s an emergency?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The A Team&#39;s in perfect condition, but B Team on down is less experienced and they are displaying some slight abnormalities.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It probably comes from anxiety.<br> The inside of that Coffin is like a cockpit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey Lev, I feel bad for them.<br> Why don&#39;t I give them some anesthesia?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Yeah, hurry up, will you? If you&#39;re in the infirmary, then you can get here in two minutes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t the infirmary, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...but you&#39;re just hiding and slacking...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa... Please don&#39;t mention that...<br> It&#39;s gonna take five minutes from here, no matter what...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I think they&#39;ll forgive me for being a little late.<br> A Team has no issues anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, that guy&#39;s named Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s the mage who created the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba\u2014 A telescope used to observe that pseudo-planet, Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sheba not only observes Chaldeas, but also serves as a surveillance system for most of this facility.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Also, it was the previous director who built the summoning/unsummoning system, which is the foundation of the Rayshift tech.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To actualize that theory, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine, (basically a super computer) was provided by the Atlas Academy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All these different talents have been gathered to carry out this mission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s pointless for an ordinary doctor like me to be there, but if I&#39;m summoned, I must go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thanks for chatting with me, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When you get settled in, come by the infirmary.<br> Next time, I&#39;ll treat you to some yummy cake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s this?<br> The lights are out.

You okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Only discover it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That would be nice and easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Roger that.

Today of all days, we at Chaldea will achieve something that will be written in history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The science of learning. The invention of religion.<br> The acquisition of navigation. The focus of communication. The voyage into space.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Our legacy will be on par with the &quot;Pioneers of the Stars.&quot; No, it will surpass them.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Rather than expanding civilization, we will be the hands of God protecting it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Stabilizing human history, we will transform the future into a solid resolution.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The principles of mankind\u2014<br> in other words, to ensure the continuation of humanity.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That is Chaldea&#39;s, and now your only and absolute purpose.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Chaldea has achieved many results to date.<br> The development of observation cyber daemon, Laplace.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The Global Environment Model, Chaldeas.<br> Completion of the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate, and the launch of the Spiritron Calculation Engine, Trismegistus.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> With these technologies, we at Chaldea have observed humanity&#39;s progress one hundred years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> We do not predict the future, but observe it. Like many who observed celestial bodies, Chaldea has been observing the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Whatever it sees, our job has been to ensure that humanity will survive 100 years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Look up. That is Chaldea&#39;s proudest achievement\u2014</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Created with advanced magical theories, the Global Environmental Model, our Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Planets have been defined as beings with souls.<br> We copied them into this miniature Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Because of the difference in scale, we are unable to read each single human mind.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> But whatever&#39;s on the surface, the city lights that can be seen on land, can be observed through Sheba.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Currently, it&#39;s been set to reflect the Earth one hundred years from now. Chaldeas may very well be the future of Earth itself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> As long as the light of civilization shines within Chaldeas, we can guarantee humans will exist a century further.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> As long as there&#39;s light people will live in cities, and serve as proof of civilization&#39;s survival.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> But\u2014 Lev, could you normalize Sheba&#39;s polarization angle?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> This is the current state. Starting six months ago, Chaldeas changed color, and it&#39;s become difficult to observe the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The light of civilization, our beacon till now, has become largely unobservable to us.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Hmph, the right response.<br> Good to see you&#39;ve got some sense.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The lack of light means that civilization has become extinct.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> This was considered highly classified, but you have the right to know.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Our observations indicate that the light of humanity is only visible up to the year 2018\u2014</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> In other words, we&#39;ve observed, no, proved<br> that humanity will become extinct in that year.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Obviously, this future is not possible.<br> It cannot happen, and physically speaking, is impossible.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> There&#39;s neither an economic collapse nor some sudden<br> seismic event. We can&#39;t explain how humanity would suddenly just disappear.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Over the past six months, we&#39;ve found the cause of this strange phenomenon\u2014the disappearance of the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> If the reason is not in the present, then it is in the past.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Using Laplace and the Trismegistus, we&#39;ve reviewed all data for the past 2000 years.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> We tried to find something that didn&#39;t exist in history, or was on Earth until this point in time.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> As a result, we finally found something new.<br> It&#39;s this\u2014</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Spatial Singularity F, a city in the Japanese countryside in 2004.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> We discovered an &quot;unobservable zone&quot; that did not exist in history up to the year 2017.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Chaldea hypothesizes that this is the cause for<br> humanity&#39;s extinction. We proposed the Rayshift experiment to the U.N. and received approval.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The Rayshift process transforms a human into spiritrons, sending them into the past and allowing them to alter it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Simply put, it&#39;s time travel. But not everyone can do it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Only people with exceptional magical circuits, and the ability to become a Master, can be transformed.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Now\u2014 I&#39;m sure that cleared things up.<br> Your task is the investigation of Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You&#39;ll travel 14 years into the past, find Singularity F, and destroy it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> We are now entering unknown territory.<br> There&#39;s no telling what you might find there.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> But you&#39;ve been selected from among people all over the world. You can do this, and we have high expectations for you.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The higher-ups want to know the cause of this<br> immediately. We don&#39;t have time to waste.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be performing the first Rayshift experiment in an<br> hour. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all had enough training.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> For the first experiment we&#39;ll send Team A, the top 8 scorers, to Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t told the later groups, but they&#39;re Master candidates who have been chosen from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Team A has been active for a month now.<br> You can call them trained warriors.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Team A will go on ahead and establish a base camp at Singularity F, guaranteeing your safety.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Teams B and below will monitor their situation and prepare for the next experiment.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Let&#39;s register your information with the Klein Coffins, the arks that will send you to the past as spiritrons.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> There&#39;s one for each person, and there are no spares.<br> Be very careful with them.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Teams B through D will be on standby, in case of trouble with Team A.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> \u2014What are you doing?<br> I told you what you have to do.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You were brought here as a potential Master.<br> You&#39;re practically a soldier now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You will obey orders and be ready for a fight.<br> Do not make me repeat myself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Or do you have more questions?<br> Hey you, the one who was late!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You look confused.<br> I&#39;ll give you the chance to ask one question.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is time travel possible?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it safe to change the past?</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> ...<br> Does the word &quot;Singularity&quot; mean nothing to you?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The singularity we found doesn&#39;t exist in any of our observation records.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a hole that just appeared out of nowhere.<br> The hole itself is cut off from the proper temporal axis.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The 2004 singularity exists apart from the past and<br> future. There&#39;s no need to connect it to our present.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s more stable than regular time travel, and whatever happens the timeline can still repair itself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Singularity F is like a tiny stain on the dress that is human history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> It ruins beauty just by its presence.<br> Your job is to extract it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s what will return humanity to its proper, observed course of history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> ...What is the Association thinking, sending me someone who doesn&#39;t know basic spacetime theory?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> I told them this plan was a Grand Order, the highest possible duty in the world of magecraft...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter.

Concepts.<br> They&#39;re all summoned as spiritual bodies.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Whether or not a hero truly existed, he or she is still &quot;information that was produced on Earth,&quot; right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> To summon a Heroic Spirit is to convert the information stored on this planet into something for the good of mankind.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> People today have the right to use legacies of the past, and with that right, the duty to leave behind a future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Do you see? What you made your contract with is greater than a human, and yet is a tool to serve humans.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they&#39;re called Servants. Even if they&#39;re<br> gods, they exist only to serve their Masters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Director. Your line of thinking may be extreme.<br> My cells are not agreeing with what you just said.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Hmph. Meaning the Servant you fused with must be an Earth-type Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I do have some basic knowledge.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Glad to hear it. Now I won&#39;t have to explain<br> rudimentary things like what a Heroic Spirit is.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br><span style="color:#FF0000;">Servants</span> are heroes of the past made into familiars.<br> Those who enter into a contract with them and use them are <span style="color:#FF0000;">Masters.</span></p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> There are seven classes of Servants, which vary depending on a Servant&#39;s legends and abilities.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> It&#39;s incredibly difficult to copy a Heroic Spirit entirely.<br> Human mages do not have enough resources or memory to achieve such feat.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s why only one aspect of a Heroic Spirit is fixed in our world, resulting in the seven classes\u2014</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Every Heroic Spirit will manifest as one of these classes.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s the true nature of Servants...<br> It&#39;s also a way to hide their True Names, as well.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> They hide their names because they are famous.<br> Take Achilles from Greek Mythology.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Achilles is an invincible Heroic Spirit, but his weakness is extremely famous, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> When a Heroic Spirit returns, their weakness returns with<br> them. That&#39;s why Servants hide their names behind their class names.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t know their identity, it&#39;s harder to figure out their past or weaknesses, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s not all.<br> There&#39;s another reason for hiding one&#39;s True Name.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> A Servant has a secret weapon worthy of their legend.<br> The crystallization of that Heroic Spirit&#39;s miracle and existence.</p><audio controls><source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_3/BGM_EVENT_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Director, sorry to interrupt you while you&#39;re having fun but we&#39;ve detected hostiles.

Please keep an eye on your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Even if Romani is monitoring us, this is a Singularity.<br> There&#39;s no telling what might happen.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Come here, Kyrielight.<br> You&#39;re hurt, aren&#39;t you? I can heal something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... right.<br> Thank you very much, Director Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Really, now.<br> When the director is calm, she can be dependable...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you should know...<br> The director is in a complicated position as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Initially, Marie was like you all, a Master candidate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Three years ago, the previous director, her father, passed away and she had to take over Chaldea when she was just a student.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since then it&#39;s been one tense day after another.<br> She had to take over as head of the Animusphere family.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was all she could do to keep Chaldea running.<br> Around that time, an anomaly was found in Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We could no longer see into the promised future of 100<br> years from now. There was huge criticism from the Association and our sponsors.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She was ordered to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To make matters worse, they found that she had no aptitude to be a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The noble Animusphere family, one of the Twelve Lords, the dominating faculty of Astronomy at the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh the scandal that would occur if the head of such a family was found to be unfit to become a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can imagine the level of gossip happening behind<br> the scenes. I&#39;m sure those rumors reached Marie too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She still worked to be her absolute best as Director.<br> This last half-year, she&#39;s just barely been hanging on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s worked herself so hard, I&#39;d like her to come for counseling, but with how things are...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any event, she&#39;s been emotionally stretched to the<br> limit. She doesn&#39;t hate you, or anything like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know. Director Marie isn&#39;t an evil person.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you think so.<br> But you know she is evil, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She isn&#39;t cruel, nefarious, and dishonest, that I can<br> promise you. She&#39;s just a rather serious person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I was just having fun.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, that&#39;s not nice! But I understand how you feel.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Director wasn&#39;t allowed to go out much growing up, so everything she says is honest and innocent...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But make sure you don&#39;t say that in front of her.<br> She&#39;ll just hate you more.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyhow, you&#39;re the only three I can trust right now.<br> I want you to continue investigating without fighting.</p><h2 id="section-4-innvestigate-the-port-ruin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-innvestigate-the-port-ruin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Innvestigate the Port Ruin</h2><audio controls><source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_5/BGM_EVENT_5.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The hostile lifeform has been removed.<br> Let&#39;s move on.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know what would happen with that monster, but I expected nothing less of a Servant&#39;s body. Such power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not that it makes them look any less scary...<br> By the way Director, I have a question for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Fuyuki in our data, and this Fuyuki are just too different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What happened in this city, exactly?<br> What are your thoughts, Director?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, history must&#39;ve been slightly disrupted.<br> That&#39;s the only reason I can think of.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru.<br> I&#39;m only going to say this once, so listen up.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Chaldea observes the future through an Earth model<br> called Chaldeas. At the same time, a familiar called Laplace compiles past records.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You can say it is Laplace&#39;s job to gather data on history that wasn&#39;t made public, and information that was buried in darkness that no one knows.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> According to Laplace&#39;s observations, an unusual Holy Grail War was confirmed in this city in 2004.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holy Grail War?<br> You mean the Holy Grail from the legend?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The magical chalice that is the root of all magecraft, the one that is said to grant its holder&#39;s wishes?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s the one.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Mages in Fuyuki City competed for the Grail, and in order to activate it summoned seven Heroic Spirits\u2014</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That was the beginning of the Holy Grail War. Unknown<br> to anyone, Servants were summoned to this town.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The Fuyuki Holy Grail War system is simple.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Seven Masters fight each other.<br> The last one standing gets the Grail.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Chaldea learned about this in 2010. My father...<br> I mean, the previous director used this data to build the summoning system.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes up Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate. Our third invention after Laplace and Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Third? Isn&#39;t that the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That was created by Professor Lev.<br> Well, I guess you can say we both worked on it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Anyway, this is where Servants come from.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Seven Servants fought here, and in the end, Saber was victorious.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The town wasn&#39;t destroyed, and the Servants shouldn&#39;t have been noticed by anyone, but...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Now this is happening. We should assume that<br> the outcome changed due to this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The anomaly in 2004 brought about an alteration to human history and as a result, we&#39;re no longer able to see 100 years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it&#39;s our job to repair this anomaly.<br> Somewhere here is the reason history has been disturbed.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Once we analyze and eliminate it, that will complete our<br> mission. All of us will be able to return to the present.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.

I can&#39;t even release its True Name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In fact, I don&#39;t even know what the origins of this weapon of mine might be.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In any case, you can think of me as a failed Servant.<br> Or maybe just a capable kouhai that can get even stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any leads on the Heroic Spirit that fused with me, but with you as my Master I will figure it out as I grow.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. Masters have the ability to analyze their Servants parameters, skills, and matrixes.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Fujimaru... As a Master, once you become good enough, you should be able to analyze Mash&#39;s Servant data.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Any Servants you make a contract with from this point<br> should be the same. First, you need to learn their True Name and Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> As your trust with them grows, your Servant&#39;s power will grow too.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not like you have that much potential in you.<br> The fact that you can&#39;t use Mash that well shows that.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Once we get Chaldea&#39;s Rayshift capability back online, we&#39;re going to shift a first-class Master here.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Then you&#39;re fired.

You&#39;re a Servant from<br> the Holy Grail War that broke out in this city, and the sole survivor?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> If by that you mean I haven&#39;t lost. Our Holy Grail<br> War changed to something else entirely along the way.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how it happened either. The city was engulfed in flames, and the humans vanished.<br> Only the Servants remained.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Saber was the first to resume the Holy Grail War. That chap began rampaging like a tiger released from a cage.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker,<br> and Assassin were all defeated by Saber.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> The survival of the Seven Servants...<br> That rule of the Holy Grail War was broken here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And in the end you won, Caster...<br> Or rather, you&#39;re the Servant who survived.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Yes. Any Servant that was defeated by Saber became like those two, corrupted by the black mud.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> They, and the monsters that sprung up like maggots, started looking for something together.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> The troublesome part is that I&#39;m one of the things they&#39;re looking for.

You helped us, but in the end,<br> it was for your own sake, huh?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> You want to defeat Saber, but don&#39;t stand a chance<br> doing it alone. That&#39;s why you zeroed in on us... Right?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

Things have settled down at last.<br> True, we can&#39;t have a decent conversation like this.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> My bad. If I&#39;d been summoned as a Lancer,<br> I could&#39;ve finished off Saber with just one strike.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Man, Caster is just not for me.<br> I don&#39;t like being a Caster in a Holy Grail War like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you were a Lancer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it hard being a Caster?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s been known to happen, Senpai. Some Heroic Spirits<br> have the attributes of multiple classes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He is not just a spear-wielder, but a high-level Heroic Spirit with qualifications to be a mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m only speculating, but he must be one of the top<br> Servants. The kind that&#39;s featured in the magazine Vivian.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Ahh yes, you said you were Masters of an organization<br> called Chaldea... I guess that&#39;s all I need to know.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> In general, Servants tend not to get overly involved in problems outside of their own time period.<br> We ultimately only cooperate as weapons.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Your goal is to investigate this anomaly.<br> My goal is to put an end to the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> We share mutual interests.<br> So how about we join forces?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> ...That is a rational proposition.<br> But if we do that, who will be your Master?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Well that [ \u2642 kid / \u2640\uFE0F young lady] there, of course. It doesn&#39;t seem like you have the aptitude to be a Master.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> I mean you possess high quality magical circuits, yet you<br> don&#39;t have the aptitude to be a Master. Is it a curse?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Oh, shut up!<br> What do you care?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Fujimaru, he&#39;s in your hands.<br> Use him wisely.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s settled.<br> The contract is only temporary, but I&#39;m counting on ya.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> That leaves one last thing, your goal.<br> What you&#39;re looking for is probably the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Greater Grail?<br> I&#39;m not familiar with that. What is it?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> This land&#39;s true &quot;heart.&quot;<br> If there is indeed a &quot;Singularity,&quot; it has to be that.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> But Saber is lingering around the Greater Grail.<br> The remaining Servants she contaminated, too.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong><br> Berserker and Archer are the ones left?<br> What are those two like? Are they strong?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Well, Archer can be dealt with if I&#39;m with you.<br> Berserker is the problem.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Even Saber had trouble with that monster.<br> But he won&#39;t attack unless you get close to him, so ignoring him is one option.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We understand the situation now. We&#39;ll team up<br> with Mr. Caster to obtain the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mr. Caster, would you show us the way?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Skip the &quot;Mister.&quot; I&#39;ll take you there.<br> The [ \u2642 kid / \u2640\uFE0F young lady] here will decide when to make our move.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Much obliged.

After all, Heroic Spirits and Noble Phantasms are the same thing.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> If the young lady here can fight as a Servant, that means at that very moment you can use your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> And yet you can&#39;t, which simply means your magical energy is not circulating right.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, maybe enthusiasm?

But I&#39;m<br> not that evil, I&#39;ll allow you to say a final prayer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The underground cavern&#39;s collapsing!<br> No, the cavern wasn&#39;t stable in the first place!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor!<br> Perform an emergency Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, we can at least save Senpai!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Understood!

Are you shocked that you woke up to the sight<br> of such a beauty? I understand, but I&#39;m used to it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m Da Vinci, a Chaldea collaborator.<br> Or perhaps the third summoned Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, we&#39;ll talk later.<br> Somebody&#39;s waiting for you, go to the command room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s waiting?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it the doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Roman?<br> Roman&#39;s waiting too, but he&#39;s not important.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Jeez, there&#39;s someone else, she&#39;s the important one.<br> Guess you&#39;re not used to being the main character yet.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> See? This little one says so, too.<br> Come on, time to get up Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From here on, you&#39;ll be the center of this story.<br> The choices you make will probably save us all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like the multitudes of brave souls who weren&#39;t remembered by history as they saved humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been given a role to fight, not as a hero, but as a human walking a path that was preordained by the stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai.<br> I am glad to see that you&#39;re okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good morning. Thank you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I should be the one thanking you.<br> I was able to stay conscious, thanks to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good morning. You were saved, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, thanks to you holding my hand. I now believe<br> that saying &quot;what happens twice will happen thrice.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem. I&#39;m all for your reunion, but could you bring your attention here, please.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> First of all, congratulations on surviving and completing your mission Fujimaru. Well done.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> While the situation was forced on you gradually, you bravely faced the challenges and overcame it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That earned my respect and appreciation.<br> Thanks to you, Mash and Chaldea were saved.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame about the Director, but we&#39;ve no<br> time to hold a service. All we can do is grieve.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If I survived, then maybe the Director...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Listen. We must defend humanity in the Director&#39;s<br> place. That&#39;s how we pay her tribute.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I got the report about the crystal from Mash, and what Lev said.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> From Chaldea&#39;s state, what Lev said was true.<br> We can&#39;t contact the outside world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The staff who left Chaldea haven&#39;t returned.<br> I fear humanity has already been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea seems to be the only place outside of the<br> normal timeline. Perhaps it&#39;s staying on the timeline right before the collapse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Think of it like a colony floating in space. The outside<br> world is dead, until we do something about this situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can we even do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there something we can do?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course. First, I want you to see this.<br> We tried scanning Earth with the resurrected Sheba.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s Earth of the past, not the future.<br> The Fuyuki Singularity was destroyed, thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we hypothesize that the future was unchanged due to another cause.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The result being\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This distorted world map. A newly-discovered<br> dimensional disturbance against which Fuyuki pales in comparison.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They say changing the past changes the future, but you can&#39;t overthrow the future by slightly altering the past.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> History has the power to heal itself.<br> You might be able to save a person or two...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...But the end of that era\u2014<br> Will still end up with its definitive result unchanged.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But these singularities are different.<br> These are humanity&#39;s turning points.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> &quot;What if this war didn&#39;t end?&quot;<br> &quot;What if this naval voyage wasn&#39;t successful?&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> &quot;What if this discovery was wrong?&quot;<br> &quot;What if this nation couldn&#39;t become independent?&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The ultimate decision point to determine the current state of humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Destroying them is like causing the foundation of human<br> history to crumble. That&#39;s what these seven singularities are.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The future had already been decided when these seven<br> singularities formed. As Lev said, humanity doesn&#39;t make it to 2019.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014But, we&#39;re different.<br> Chaldea has yet to reach that future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Do you understand? Only we can fix this mistake.<br> Now we have a chance to return the singularities to normal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So here&#39;s the deal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Rayshift into these seven singularities and get history back on track.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the only way to save humanity.<br> However we are still powerless.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All other Master candidates are frozen.<br> Mash is the only Servant we have.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I realize you&#39;re being forced into this situation.<br> Even so, I&#39;ll still say it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Master Candidate #48, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you wish to save humanity...<br> If you wish to have a future beyond 2018.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then you alone must go and face these seven singularities in human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder<br> the burden of Chaldea and humanity&#39;s future?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If it&#39;s something I can do.</p><hr><audio controls><source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_4/BGM_EVENT_4.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio> **Dr. Roman:** \u2014Thank you.

Our search target will be each era&#39;s relic and Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Our opponent is history itself.
