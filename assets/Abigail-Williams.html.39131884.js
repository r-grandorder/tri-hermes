Whether in a wasteland or a desert,<br> some things never change!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Only having two people around leads to price-fixing and exploitation, but with three, you have options and competition.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> In other words, that&#39;s when the gears of a real economy begin to turn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (It&#39;s David and the Queen of Sheba.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of noise. What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Master.<br> Hello, Abby.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The queen and I were just having a little chat.<br> Turns out we have a lot to talk about.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I know all that,<br> and it&#39;s beside the point!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> People were once pure, but they&#39;ve been consumed by the curse of gold ever since they left Eden.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Now they&#39;re divided into the haves and have-nots, and the animosity between them only continues to grow.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> It&#39;s not right. It shouldn&#39;t be like this.<br> It shouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> But as merchants, we can defuse envy with long-term loans, and pacify unquenchable greed with razor-thin margins.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree that&#39;s our duty\u2013nay, our responsibility?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure about that, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I thought you were a queen first and a businesswoman second. Are you sure you&#39;re supposed to let yourself get so wrapped up in worldly affairs?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> You may have materialized in this century, but that still seems to go against everything you stand for.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Th-these things don&#39;t exist in a vacuum! My queenliness and my business acumen are inextricably tied together!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just shrug it all off like some happy-go-lucky shepherd!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh? Then do you have something in mind?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Hehe... As a matter of fact, I do.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Chaldea may be a castle of might and Mystics, but it&#39;s not exactly flush with commercial endeavors or economic protections.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Aha. I see where this is going.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It&#39;s entirely possible that a figurative bucket of ice water could be dumped on Chaldea from an unforeseen direction.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Lofty as Chaldea&#39;s ideals and goals may be,<br> it is still a human organization!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> So if we enterprising entrepreneurs all buckle down and work together, we could make wonderful things happen.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> For starters, we&#39;ll definitely need to bring in Caesar and ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Kid Gil could be a hard sell, but there&#39;s definitely a fire somewhere under all that smoke...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> We could call it \u201CThe Chaldea Cartel.\u201D That rolls off the tongue nicely! Although, it might make us seem something less than honorable...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Ooh, what about \u201CThe Chaldea Merchants Association\u201D<br> then? That would be super \u201Cbene\u201D for a guild!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Hmm. You know, David, if you act now...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...I miiight just be willing to offer you a seat on the board so you can save face with Master... (Glaaance)</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Gosh, you&#39;d really do that?<br> I&#39;m flattered you think so highly of me.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> But, unfortunately, that&#39;s an offer I am afraid I must decline.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That said...I was really moved by how hard you worked for Chaldea. It was like you cared for us as much as one of your precious jewels.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I never expected to see a queen with your dignity work so hard. That made it all the more touching.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I think even King Solomon would have had the hots for you after seeing that dual nature of yours. I know I certainly do!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> T-touching?<br> Hots...!?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Man, all this talking&#39;s made me hungry.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> No, wait. It must be your sweet perfume that&#39;s whet my appetite.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Anyway, I think I&#39;ll go help myself to some rugelach in the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;ll call on me again the next time you want to read poems or put on a lyre concert. See ya!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...Da...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Da... Da...<br> Damn you, David!!!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I hope you fall off a camel and die!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Who do you think you are, rejecting a once-in-a-lifetime offer made purely out of the goodness of my heart!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> You will rue the day you declined to get in on the ground floor of my ServaCoin cryptocurrency!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Could I have a word with you, Queen of Sheba?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> (Snaps out of it) ...Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Personally, I am all in favor of frank, heated exchanges. To engage in one is the sign of a close friendship.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That said...I would urge you to control yourself better, especially in front of her. As you can see, she is rather distraught.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It is quite an unpleasant sight to see two close friends at each other&#39;s throats, after all.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even if one is perfectly aware of each party&#39;s good intentions.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Ack...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I... Yes, he&#39;s right. I&#39;m sorry you had to see me behaving like that...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Um... Please don&#39;t worry about it, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I appreciate you worrying about me,<br> Geronimo, but I&#39;m fine. Really.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t, um... Well, I don&#39;t really understand this business talk anyway...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> But just seeing you and King David here together is like a dream come true, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> It&#39;s so wonderful being in your presence that I feel like I&#39;m walking on clouds!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Oho. Perhaps my concerns were misplaced.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Phew... (Ears flop in relief)</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Thank you, Abigail. I promise I&#39;ll do my best to live up to your expectations.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Teehee, please, just call me Abby. Silly Tituba.<br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I should know that&#39;s not your name by now...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Hehe, that&#39;s quite all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tituba? As in your servant...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...Yes. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> She was my uncle&#39;s slave back in Salem...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I wonder why I keep calling her by that name...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> She was nothing at all like the Queen of Sheba...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...I think I&#39;ll just let that one slide.)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m so embarrassed...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be. We Servants are intimately familiar with our past and our future. I&#39;ve even heard some of us keep our memories from before we&#39;re summoned.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> So...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I can understand why you might get me mixed up with someone else you used to know. Please, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...Okay. Thank you, Your Majesty.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Abby.

Nobles.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oh my...! Which queen do you mean?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Hmm? You will. Find out. In the. Cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> O-oh my. It&#39;s making me so nervous,<br> getting a personal invitation...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Do you mean the break room?<br> Would you mind if I came along too?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Not at. All. You are. Welcome. To join.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> You can. See. How good my.<br> Oolong Tea. Is. For yourself.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you go with them, Sheba?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s okay. I have a feeling a certain green-haired shepherd may be there, and I&#39;d rather not see his stupid face right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you not going to the tea party yourself, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> No. I have business with you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Might I have a moment of your time?<br> There is something I need to tell you.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a coincidence.<br> There&#39;s actually something I need to tell you, too.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...No, on second thought,<br> I don&#39;t think this is coincidence at all.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s an ominous star core headed this way?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Correct.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, you saw a sign of impending disaster...?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Indeed I did!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Chaldea is a unique and blessed place...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Thanks to its cutting-edge optical instruments and interconnected network, it is possible to observe the stars in ways that were never before possible.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, there are skilled technicians here who are deeply versed in the ways of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> ...And yet, there is harmony and discord among the stars that even they cannot see.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Even now, there is an almost imperceptibly slight disturbance in the relationship between Saturn and the sun, the two celestial bodies that are supposed to comprise Capricorn.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Of course, there is not enough wisdom in the world to perfectly predict the movements of the stars...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> ...which is why I came to the conclusion that some sort of disturbance is making its way here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And you had a prediction, Queen of Sheba?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you big on astronomy too, Your Majesty?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Is that so surprising?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I have the stars to thank for my own wisdom too, you know.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> After all, astrology originated with the people of the sea who first used the stars to navigate the great oceans...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...and the people of the desert who crossed vast swathes of sand by night.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure today&#39;s scholars would rather pretend otherwise, but the fact is that economies have always been closely tied to the movements of the stars.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...I would have brought it up earlier,<br> if we hadn&#39;t been interrupted...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...but I was actually just about to mention this disturbance in the stars as well.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> I&#39;m heartened to see Gilles de Rais came to the same conclusion that I did.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid your agreement in this gives me no comfort. Indeed, it only strengthens my concern.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Oh... R-right, of course.<br> I&#39;m sorry, I should really know better. Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it. I&#39;ll make sure to keep my eyes peeled.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> Very well. I encourage you to act with the utmost caution...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go tell Da Vinci to remain on the alert, too.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...Good idea. I think that would be for the best.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for telling me about this, you two.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong><br> ...Very well.<br> That is all I wished to discuss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, can I talk to you about something?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...Me?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...Ah, now I see.<br> This is about Abigail.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong></p><p>Yes... I know she gets my name wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> And that it has to do with her memories from when she was alive.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Though it does seem like she&#39;s been calling me by the wrong name more often lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you make of it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but worry a little.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Like I told her earlier,<br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> She is surrounded by good friends looking out for her best interests here.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> To be perfectly honest, as one of Chaldea&#39;s Servants myself, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my place to say anything.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Still...if it bothers you,<br> I suppose there must be a good reason for that.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> In which case, as a mage,<br> and as her contracted Master...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> ...I believe it falls to you to step up and help her.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> If you&#39;re still not sure what to do after giving it your best effort, come talk to me again.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> That said, please don&#39;t forget about that disturbance with the stars over the last few days, either.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong><br> Good luck, and please be careful, Master...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>Chaldea \u2013 Midnight \u2013 Sleeping Hours   \n</code></pre><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Somebody&#39;s standing at my door...)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Master...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Master?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Um...

It would probably bother them if I went to see, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (We&#39;ve gone all around Chaldea, and still haven&#39;t run into anyone.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Something strange is going on here...)</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Say...[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Do you think Mash is already asleep?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I know she&#39;s a very good girl,<br> so I doubt she&#39;d be up so late...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> In fact...she&#39;d probably be upset if she found out we were staying up this late...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...Still...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...would it be okay...to stay together a little longer?<br> Just the two of us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think we can get away with that on a winter night.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Thank you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to see you again, Abby.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...You too, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re doing so well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re the Abigail from that Salem, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> ...Yes.

We should. Tell. The others. And call for. More help. Who shall. Return to. Reality?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> We can. Expect that. More ghouls.

Ask me. It is. A fall. From grace.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> Neither growth. Nor sublimation. But a fall.<br> She is. Indulging in. Her own.

Out of control.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think she&#39;s just lost right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Blaming her for not doing the right thing isn&#39;t going to help right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Now I understand, my friend. You will provide the weary traveler with shelter and respite.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s giving me too much credit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that, but I will do my best to cheer her up.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Very well. If that is what you want,<br> Master, I will not interfere.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> What!? So you. You mean. Both of. Us will.<br> Leave Master. Alone in. This dream?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If our goal is to have Abigail let her guard down, I think that it is a better option than for me to chase after her, weapon in hand.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Besides, I am not the one who saved her in Salem.<br> That was you and Master, Nezha.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong><br> ...Considering...
