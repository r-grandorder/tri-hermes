Sanson hates \u201Cevil\u201D, but not \u201Cevil people\u201D. He believes in God, but at the same time further understands that God \u201Cdoes nothing.\u201D For that reason, he bears the lamentable sense of duty of severing \u201Cevil\u201D with \u201Cevil\u201D. Extremely strict in regard to the law, he has a motive where if he is able to achieve victory against an enemy, then he wants the \u201Cdeath penalty\u201D to be called off, and while he accepts doing battle against Servants, he does not kill Masters.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Sanson basically revolves around the position of serving his Master with a neutral point of view. However, in the case that his Master attempted to coerce him into doing evil deeds such as eating souls, it will lead to hostile acts from Sanson, acts that could include his suicide.</p><p>Although Sanson appeared as Berserk Assassin in \u201COrl\xE9ans \u2013 The Hundred Years\u2019 War of the Wicked Dragons\u201D, his character on that occasion was obstinate since he had literally gone mad. He does not want to give pain to lawbreakers and evildoers. Even if it was an unconscious desire \u2013 a desire where he rather wished for a slash so swift and painless, it gives the victims the illusion of a heavenly paradise as consideration for their deaths.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CServant, Assassin.

Charles-Henri Sanson was involved with the executions of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, and many others. The reason that a mere executioner got so famous was that, in spite of being in an executioners\u2019 household that boasted a history of more than two hundred years, and in spite of being in the faction that opposed the death penalty too, it was the result of things like being the person who carried out the second most death penalties in history.</p><p>The Sanson House was a contradictory existence, having lived while being financially blessed despite having a low social status as \u201Cexecutioners\u201D. Even when the country turned around because of the French Revolution, a verdict of innocence was handed down against the execution of the Sanson House which had continued for generations. To guillotine without their will; that was their role.</p><p>Charles-Henri Sanson, just then in those turbulent times, became the Executioner\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Monsieur de Paris. Sanson executed targets from every social class, from figures such as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre whose reputations were literally linked with the history of France, to as far as obscure people.</p><p>In particular, the execution of Louis XVI seemed to be an extreme shock for even Sanson, and after Louis XVI\u2019s execution, Sanson entreated some priests to hold a Mass for the King. That was a counter-revolutionary crime at the time of the French Revolution, and it was something so serious, it became a capital crime, but even so, Sanson repeatedly held a Mass for the King.</p><p>It has also been noted that Charles-Henri Sanson was an exceptional advocate for equality even in those days. Sanson helped abandoned patients as a physician, and he accumulated research so that the people having their sentences carried out would have no pain and prognostic symptoms.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Supposing that\u2026 it was something anybody and everybody would not concern themselves with, and it was even something that would not be rewarded\u2026 Sanson would put up with the agony and respectably continue on with that role.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Marie Antoinette</strong></p><p>As everyone knows, a respected and beloved queen, maiden, and eternal existence. For what reason did Marie leave those words behind to Sanson without even any fear of sorts just before her execution?</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mozart</strong></p><p>As everyone knows, they have a relationship as fellow perverts\u2026 \u201CAs rivals, we are rivals!\u201D</p><p><strong>The Chevalier d\u2019\xC9on</strong></p><p>\u201CI am sorry, but can we not be together?\u201C d\u2019\xC9on said. Sanson wants to cry a little.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Not to mention the Noble Phantasm\u2019s guillotine and the 4 horse heads on his shoulders, the designs of Sanson\u2019s outfits, such as the wheels, ladders and crosses, are used as motifs of torture and execution tools. For the fact that Sanson is a Servant of the French Revolution, I looked up the details of his bloodline, career, etc. as well, and it was extraordinarily enjoyable reading them. He is fundamentally a serious character who also has an additional facial expression where he looks down on someone while laughing, but it turns out that sort of thing was unexpectedly in the BAMBOO BROOM DIARY\u2026 (Shima Drill)</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-034.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-035.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-036.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-037.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-038.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-039.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-040.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-041.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-042.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-043.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 66);
