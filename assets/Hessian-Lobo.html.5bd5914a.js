A mate. Cubs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, he had to fight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But a beast is only possessed of so much wisdom,<br> and the desires of humanity are without end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Which is why this was inevitable.<br> The beast had no reason to hold a grudge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, the beast was summoned as a Phantom Spirit,<br> and fused into a Servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Before, he could not hope to fight humans on equal footing, but now, he possesses strength far beyond human capability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So he exercised his right to vengeance and began wielding his fearsome jaws left and right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have no regrets.<br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/This is bestial instinct.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Intelligence torments me.<br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/That is what it means to sin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My pack is gone.<br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/I am no longer even a beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A lone, headless ghost appears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He neither speaks nor moves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No threat makes him flinch, and no glare seems to make him so much as budge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But what else could one expect?<br> He lacks a head.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He may look human, but he is something far removed from them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast thinks that is why he can put up with having him around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those two are similarly lacking in the scent of humanity, which makes them bearable as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Yes. It&#39;s all right as long as they don&#39;t smell human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But Servants still reek of humanity,<br> and the beast just can&#39;t tolerate it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have some tea!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine with just hot water.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Not for my teatime, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You&#39;re getting tea with lots of sugar,<br> and a little gingery zest. How about you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Give me a cup with the works.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Teehee.<br> You can be so greedy sometimes, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No sugar for me, please.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Teehee.<br> Yes, you&#39;ve got to watch those calories!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t you try to stock up on nutrients while you can? You are our Master, after all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Now don&#39;t be like that, Enkidu.<br> It&#39;s rude.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Is it? I see. So it&#39;s rude to treat health management and food preferences in the same way. I&#39;ll have to remember that.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s about what we were able to learn from him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Honestly, I don&#39;t think anything needs to change.<br> Lobo is useful as is, and he&#39;s not about to turn traitor.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s very true.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Every Servant has different baggage we bring with us when we fight alongside Master.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> The important thing is that we all share the same goal of restoring humanity.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> So I can see the sense in not requiring that we all get to be great friends!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But, even so...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...that would be so, so sad that I...I just couldn&#39;t stand it!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So...you mean you can understand those reasons,<br> but not accept them?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> True, we don&#39;t want our allies to be sad.<br> I understand that now, at least a little.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well, Master? What should we do?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...A familiar scent stirs the beast to wakefulness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He begins to growl, both as an alert and a threat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the footsteps continue straight toward him, undeterred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, the beast comes face-to-face with the [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want you to come fight with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast consents.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...He bears no ill will towards the [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is merely that his power comes from the fires consuming him from within.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To accept the Master in front of him would be to deny his thirst for revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So he barks. He growls.<br> He bares his fangs and keeps his distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For there can never be true understanding between man and beast.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p>b&gt;Enkidu**<br> Well that was easy.<br> Though I can&#39;t say I care for this city.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It feels as though evil and vice have soaked into every brick of every building.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like it here, either.<br> My lovely dress is going to get filthy.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now then...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It looks like a Demonic Beast has settled here in Shinjuku and is causing all kinds of trouble.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> How do we go about finding it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lobo, would you track it down for us?</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He barks affirmatively.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He will find this Demonic Beast hiding somewhere in Shinjuku, and finish it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He will follow its scent and ensure it has nowhere left to run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is his mission.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Although...doing this for his Master almost makes him feel like...a dog.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So the beast thinks to himself as he sneers in the darkness.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Looks like he found it.<br> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast breaks into a run, as if to keep the clay creature running off in front of him under control.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And then, the beast sees the being tying him down to this world, almost daring him to escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His Master, Fujimaru.<br> The one they call \u201Chuman.\u201D</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast likes the air in this city.<br> It makes him feel at ease.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There may not be much good food to go around, but maybe that&#39;s why he finds it so easy to take a bite out of whatever he encounters.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The bright lights are more vivid, and more garish,<br> than that starry sky he once knew.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as lonely here as it is under the stars.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Humans made this place. They permeate every corner of it. Normally, it would be anathema to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But now, the beast has no choice but to live within it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The girl with the faint scent of pulped wood looks at him quizzically, her face aglow with innocence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast growls as if to say \u201Cnothing\u201D<br> and turns his gaze forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Behind him, Master continues to follow at a respectful distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F She&#39;s} close, but not too close.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...The beast wonders what would happen if he suddenly tried to bite Master&#39;s head off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The clay and paper people would kill him mercilessly,<br> before he could so much as get near enough to try.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s why this distance makes sense. It&#39;s the right decision, both logically and tactically.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His whole body shakes with excitement.<br> He&#39;s found it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There it is.<br> Let&#39;s get it, Master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> This is no fun.<br> It&#39;s so very, very sad.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> A goat from the mountains, a lion from the plains, a snake from the grass... They could have all had happy lives if they had stayed where they belong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast heartily agrees.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But seeing this abomination, he also can&#39;t help but feel proud that it has the same spark as him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is a grotesque man-made Demonic Beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A monster with the freedom to wander anywhere it pleases because it has no place to call home.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If there is one thing the Demonic Beast all but shouts,<br> it is this: \u201CWe are strong.\u201D</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Hmm. It doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;ve caught up to it so much as it&#39;s been lying in wait for us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> An absurd number of Demonic Beasts stand before the wolf and his companions.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Uh-oh, that&#39;s not good.<br> Please give us your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In an instant, any sympathy the wolf had for the creatures before him is gone, replaced with an uncompromising will to fight...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...even though the monster is surrounded by his former brethren.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you do this, Hessian Lobo?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Of course I can.<br> Who do you think you&#39;re talking to, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you all okay to fight?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course.<br> We&#39;ll crush them.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Ooh, I don&#39;t like violence at all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But if I have to get my hands bloody today, I&#39;ll make sure this sunny day is Humpty-Dumpty&#39;s last!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These fangs are meant for crushing my enemies&#39; skulls.<br> These claws are meant for tearing them to shreds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And what&#39;s more...they are meant to help me survive, and to keep others alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A single roar, and half of the wolves gathered like familiars around the monster scattered in fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beasts&#39; instincts won out over their loyalty to their leader.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I shall show no mercy to any of my brethren who still remain. They have chosen instead to be my prey!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That takes care of the monster&#39;s entourage,<br> though they were stronger than I expected.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That chimera&#39;s Spirit Origin is as strong as the ones from my time. Maybe it&#39;s because of how much technology has progressed, or how human desires have built up over time...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Regardless, it would seem this is what it means for a city to grow. Maybe the emergence of some strange beast like this was just inevitable.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So, it&#39;s running away.<br> And it&#39;s much faster than I thought...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go after it, Master!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What a pain!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The beast tells Hessian to help Master onto his back.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...Oh my.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Interesting.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf goes after the Demonic Beast with all his might.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He can hear his passenger screaming above him,<br> but Hessian should take care of that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He does not regret killing his brethren,<br> but neither is he happy about it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf continues to run, not stopping to consider what that might mean.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These woods smell rotten.<br> But I won&#39;t stop now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I will kill that Demonic Beast.<br> I won&#39;t rest until I find it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Why do I hate it so much?<br> Why...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Because it reminds me of myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it never asked to be born.<br> I&#39;m sure it never wanted to kill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But at some point, that Demonic Beast lost sight of who it was.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At some point, it stopped being a Demonic Beast and instead became a monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No beast should ever cross that line.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I remember the fight to the death that took place here in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I went from beast to Demonic Beast,<br> and from Demonic Beast to monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I tried to stay a beast at heart, but I ended up consumed by the fires of vengeance burning within me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was already a monster when I answered Moriarty&#39;s summons.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And ever since the Age of Myth, there has only been one possible ending to a monster&#39;s story.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It wreaks havoc on its surroundings,<br> and dies afraid and regretful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well, not today. Today, I&#39;m going to finish that Demonic Beast before it can complete its transformation into a monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...There it is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf faces its prey, bares its fangs,<br> and gathers its strength.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Its rider gently helps Master down to the ground.<br> Now, there is nothing holding him back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...The hunt begins.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf jumps off a nearby tree, using the springy branches to launch into a spiraling slash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf&#39;s dark claws and the lion&#39;s glistening fangs clash fiercely in midair...again and again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On one side, the wolf who remained true to himself even as he became a Demonic Beast...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and on the other, a chimera, a grotesque Demonic Beast decried as an abomination from the day it was born.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The mountain goat&#39;s horns keep the wolf&#39;s fangs from finding their mark. The lion&#39;s fangs keep the rider at bay.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The snake tail harries the wolf with bites all over its body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The fountains of blood only make the wolf more ferocious. His roiling hatred is on the brink of awakening a wholly new form.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...What do you think? Can you do this?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The wolf is unsure if he just heard Hessian&#39;s voice,<br> or Master&#39;s, but it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His only answer is an affirmative howl.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He signals to Master, who nods back and activates one of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His body shivers as magical energy begins coursing through his body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...What do you think? Can you do this?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His answer is the same as before.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But now, he realizes that it is he who is asking the question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can do this.
