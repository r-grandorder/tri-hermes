So I decided to make use of the free time and drop by in the morning\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Tree canopies are painted white.</p><p>The blossoming floral pattern has been dyed a dazzling light pink.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...It&#39;s quite a surprise.</p><p>It&#39;s been about five years since I set foot in the Matou residence.</p><p>Until now, the trees in the yard had never bloomed. Now, they are bursting with blossom as if having been reborn.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Senpai! Welcome, please come in!\u201D</p><p>Sakura runs towards me, waving her hand.</p><p>Because of the brilliance of the flowers, Sakura&#39;s smile seems to glisten even more than usual.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura, is this what you wanted to show me? The cherry blossom trees?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, just as you can see.</p><p>The season may have passed, but these young beauties have been asleep for many years, after all. Late bloomers still need their time.</p><p>Ah, but this one here is a bit weird. It&#39;s already much older than me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? Is it really that old?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. It&#39;s been here long before I was born.</p><p>Since it was my grandmother who planted it here, it&#39;s really an old lady, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>It&#39;s no wonder she&#39;d want to show them to me, seeing how long they took to finally bloom.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is not the only amazing thing that happened.</p><p>Actually, this is the very first time that this tree has bloomed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? You said it was planted during your grandmother&#39;s time, so that&#39;s more than fifty years in the past, right? And there wasn&#39;t a single blossom until now?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s right. People thought it would never happen, either, so no one took care of it.</p><p>But as you can see, it&#39;s in full bloom now. It must have really wanted to.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Moved by Sakura&#39;s emotion, I look up at the tree.</p><p>This is the first time the old woman&#39;s flower has bloomed\u2015\u2015\u2015It is unbelievable.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s smile is so heartwarming, so proud.</p><p>For some time, the two of us just watch the flowers.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s coat swells in the gentle spring breeze.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, what good is it standing here and talking anyway?</p><p>Senpai, if you have time, would you like to come inside?</p><p>We can see the cherry blossoms through the window even better than here.</p><p>I will make some tea, then we can enjoy the view together.\u201D</p><p>She squeezes my hand tightly.</p><p>I grip her palm in return.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo is it alright if I stay for a bit?\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ll go prepare the tea, so please excuse me for a moment.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThanks.\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s room seems to have changed quite a bit.</p><p>With the flowers visible from the window, it is heartwarming and cozy.</p><p>However, today&#39;s highlight is the other side of the window rather than the room itself.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt sure is a luxury, viewing cherry blossoms without leaving the room.\u201D</p><p>I relax for a moment while watching the beautiful flowers.</p><p>How should I put it? I feel like this atmosphere is the very essence of spring.</p><p>The cherry trees through the window, Sakura&#39;s figure quietly watching the scenery, these all bring out that smell of the sun like no other.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, it sure makes me feel at ease.</p><p>You said it was your grandmother who planted it, Sakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have never had the chance to meet her, though.</p><p>It seems the cherry tree she planted just did not take well to this soil. It did keep growing, but they say it never had a single flower.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh. And this year\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThere are people called &quot;arborists.&quot;</p><p>They are doctors who heal trees by examining the ones that seem to be withering, and healing the bad parts so they can grow again.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAah... now that you mention it, I did hear of an occupation like that.</p><p>So you had one of those experts come over?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell... I thought perhaps I could do that sort of thing by myself.\u201D</p><p>Sakura smiles in embarrassment, as if she had just been caught committing mischief.</p><p>...So that means...</p><p>The one who healed that tree was Sakura herself?</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh... Ah, but it must have been pretty difficult, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but I did my best!</p><p>I did lots of research, and kept working at it.</p><p>I softened the soil, I placed my ear to the trunk of the tree and listened to the sound of the water inside it, I helped the branches find their way to the sun as they grew longer.</p><p>I still don&#39;t fully understand how it feels, but bit by bit it grew healthy, and finally gave all the flowers you see now.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s really amazing... I get it.</p><p>Sakura, something like that really suits you. Little by little, even if no one knows about it, your caring touch is the best thing about you.\u201D</p><p>Really, so much that I wish a certain show-off would take a lesson from you.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m still a novice, though.</p><p>Ah. It may have been easier for me to understand because we share the same name.\u201D</p><p>Sakura smiles and takes a deep breath.</p><p>It seems as if she&#39;s feeling the warmth of the wind from deep inside her body.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>We stop talking for a while and just gaze outside.</p><p>It&#39;s probably thanks to the reborn tree, and the quietly smiling Sakura.</p><p>This room&#39;s atmosphere is too calm, and it makes me want to feel the body heat of the one I care for.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. So that tree must have really wanted to bloom.\u201D</p><p>I mutter, recalling the words that I heard under the flowers.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Sakura&#39;s expression softens.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right.</p><p>All of them\u2015\u2015\u2015everyone wants to have their chance to bloom.\u201D</p><p>Her gesture of prayer shows no weakness of being reliant on anyone.</p><p>To Sakura, these words are just a desire that had long been accepted.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. I kind of understand what you&#39;re talking about.\u201D</p><p>I reach out with my arm.</p><p>This is not lust, but pure feelings of love,</p><p>\u201CI, too, want to see Sakura blossom.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>I embrace Sakura&#39;s body smoothly.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><p>As I feel Sakura&#39;s body on mine, a sudden impulse arises in me.</p><p>\u201CSakura... is here alright?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yes. I&#39;m glad, Senpai...\u201D</p><p>Our lips touch.</p><p>In a corner of an eye, I can see flower petals flutter by.</p><p>In but a brief moment, spring morning came to this room.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... um, Senpai... this is embarrassing.\u201D</p><p>She speaks with a faint, whispering voice from on top of the bed.</p><p>Absent-minded, I almost forgot myself because of the warmth of her skin.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmbarrassing? Why?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo... do you think that I am getting fat?\u201D</p><p>Sakura bashfully twists her back.</p><p>Even though the fullness of her body may overflow from underneath the arms she covers herself with, I don&#39;t think so at all.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally...? Nope, same as always. Don&#39;t worry about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...This is my first time in daylight... Ah...\u201D</p><p>I embrace her bare bosom.</p><p>The top of the bed shakes.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... Yah...\u201D</p><p>I kiss Sakura&#39;s heavy breasts.</p><p>Her breasts are like prized fruit that took years to grow, the pointed tip of which now touches my tongue.</p><p>...It isn&#39;t that sweet, and I&#39;m a little disappointed.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m telling you, you&#39;re not gaining fat at all.</p><p>Yes, your breasts are big, but the rest of you is just fine, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... Senpai, you&#39;re still touching my breasts while you&#39;re talking\u2015\u2015\u2015ah, nn...\u201D</p><hr><p>The plump fullness of her breasts dances in my hands. My fingers feel like they are about to be completely engulfed as I continue to squeeze them.</p><p>Slowly, I rub her breasts, which look like they&#39;re going to burst any moment now.</p><hr><p>\u201CKya, nn... Ha, ahaa...\u201D</p><p>No matter how much I touch them, Sakura&#39;s breasts remain soft, like marshmallows or butter.</p><p>A soft and flexible flesh is seen swaying underneath the bright sunlight, contrasting with the pink nipples.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, ngh... Haa... Aaah... Senpai...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll keep going, alright?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaa\u2015\u2015\u2015hnn!\u201D</p><hr><p>I firmly caress and massage Sakura&#39;s breasts.</p><p>Her face is on the verge of tears, but her body is honest. As I feel her stiff nipple with my thumb...</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015hnn...\u201D</p><p>A faint breath escapes as she bites her lip.</p><p>These breasts that have always seemed so tight beneath their clothes are now dancing in front of me.</p><p>Just looking at it makes my groin become hot, yet I rub them even more.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa, aah, nn... ngh, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She starts to get used to this calm rhythm.</p><p>A softly creaking bed. A gentle breeze passing through the wide-open window. Both bring the scent of cherry blossom with them.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpa...i... Haah, ahn, hn...!\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m squeezing tightly with my fingers, licking between my lips and sucking.</p><p>Her skin looks fresh and radiant under the sun. I indulge myself in it.</p><p>With my free hand, I stroke her stomach.</p><hr><p>\u201CAah, no, kya\u2015\u2015\u2015!?\u201D</p><p>Trembling, her skin wavers under my palm.</p><p>It feels just as nice and gentle as her breasts.</p><hr><p>\u201C...See, it&#39;s so jelly-like, and I&#39;m...\u201D</p><p>\u201CI told you, you&#39;re not fat at all... It&#39;s perfectly natural for girls to be tender, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAah, ha...ah... I guess... so...\u201D</p><p>I keep stroking and let my hand wander to her side.</p><p>Here, with so little muscle, it feels particularly good.</p><p>Really, it all feels so good that I&#39;m a little embarrassed.</p><hr><p>\u201COver there, it tickles... Haah, ngh!\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s body is shaking and swaying.</p><p>She&#39;s reacting way better than I expected. My head is starting to get burning hot.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, haa\u2015\u2015\u2015ngh...!\u201D</p><p>Away from the sides, I move on to her butt, then to her thighs.</p><p>It&#39;s like touching a peach with its soft, downy hairs.</p><p>That too has become ripe and soft, its fragrance alone sweet enough to make me dizzy.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, like that... Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>For the first time, I notice how sensitive Sakura&#39;s body really is.</p><p>Is it because we&#39;re doing it in bright daylight, or is it just the season?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Nnn...\u201D</p><p>I touch a hidden part of Sakura&#39;s body.</p><p>Much like dripping fruit nectar, the juice clings to my fingers.</p><p>Warm and wet, my fingers sink in.</p><p>As I push apart the folds, the feeling of touch evolves into stimulation that threatens to stick in my throat.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sakura...\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai... It&#39;s alright. Really, you...\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s hand reaches out and feels for my waist.</p><p>Her fingers coil around the flesh rod that keeps getting harder with every loving caress.</p><p>My back shivers in anticipation of pleasure.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease come in... I already...\u201D</p><p>\u201CGotcha, just relax\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I position myself above Sakura once again, shifting to get my hips firmly against hers.</p><hr><p>Suddenly\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura stretches out her hand.</p><p>Like two branches that grow together, our fingers intertwine.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015...I&#39;m glad...\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s voice sounds relieved between her slow breaths.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe have become connected, Senpai and I. Like roots and soil, tree branch and sky, flower and season are all connected to each other, the two of us\u2015\u2015\u2015see, a grip this tight\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Our warm palms are clinging to each other.</p><p>As if to answer her, I squeeze her hand, gently yet firmly.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes... We are together, the two of us.</p><p>I love you, Senpai.</p><p>Now and forever after\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...It&#39;s different from a definite desire earlier.</p><p>Telling herself that it&#39;s something impossible, something she shouldn&#39;t wish for. I just love that weakness way too much,</p><p>\u201CSakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, nngh...\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>To feel her warmth even more, I pull Sakura closer.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa, mmm, hn\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>Our hips are stuck firmly together.</p><p>My penis settles into Sakura&#39;s vagina.</p><hr><p>I start to move slowly.</p><p>Not to be left behind, Sakura is gently rocking her body as I embrace her.</p><p>A light rhythm that I&#39;ve experienced before.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Through the window, I can see the trembling branches.</p><p>Just like that, a quiet song resembling the whisper of the wind.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... Ahn, mn, haa... nngh...!\u201D</p><p>Calm breaths escape, growing familiar to my ears.</p><p>I wanted to feel the other side of Sakura, even more. I purposefully break our rhythm and stir around inside of her.</p><p>A warm and pleasant feeling starts building in my heart.</p><hr><p>\u201C... Ah... Senpa...i\u2015\u2015\u2015ngh, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Her body is trembling, and her chest is bouncing almost comically.</p><p>Her firm standing nipples are swaying. It&#39;s a gorgeous sight.</p><p>Sakura quickly adjusts to the perturbed rhythm.</p><p>I feel like there are still unexplored depths in this young woman&#39;s body.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... nn, haa, aahn, haa...\u201D</p><p>Our two bodies keep moving towards one another.</p><p>Our hands that held onto each other without letting up are stopped mid-air. Our bodies, on the contrary, are now pivoting around this point, heaving as they go.</p><p>With every sharp gasp, Sakura&#39;s pussy tightens.</p><hr><p>\u201CAha, haa... ngh, haa... ahn...!\u201D</p><p>I almost forget to breathe.</p><p>...This is the first time we have sex like this.</p><p>Bodies melt together in the light, hair swaying smoothly and voices getting ever hotter.</p><p>Like a pendulum, our waists keep pushing together.</p><hr><p>\u201CNn... haa, ahn... ngh...\u201D</p><p>With my free left hand, I caress Sakura&#39;s ass.</p><p>Her lively rear is soft and elastic. As I touch it, her body becomes tense and jerks at the change in movement.</p><hr><p>\u201CNn... Fua, hah...</p><p>Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015Sen...pai...i...\u201D</p><p>Her voice and breathing spread from her throat to my ears.</p><p>My movements speed up on their own, too.</p><p>Wanting to make Sakura feel even better, like before, I slam my hips\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa, yah, nn\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>However, her body does not let go.</p><p>Instead, Sakura&#39;s depths hold firmly onto me.</p><p>She hugs me mischievously\u2015\u2015\u2015and I feel like melting in the pleasant sensation.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, Senpai... fua, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s legs wrap around my waist.</p><p>Our hips meet as if to hug each other.</p><p>No matter how deep I go, I am met with the same loving embrace.</p><hr><p>With a bump, I felt myself reach the end to her depths.</p><p>Yet my hips keep twitching with the desire to go even further.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... it&#39;s, good... Hah, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015nn...!\u201D</p><p>It feels so good to make pulling out a serious problem.</p><p>Both Sakura and I are wet with love juices as we intertwine. Trembling, we keep repeating our search of pleasure and warmth.</p><hr><p>I hold Sakura&#39;s body as if dancing with her.</p><p>With a wet, bubbling sound coming from our genitals, we forge ahead with deep, intricate moves.</p><p>Our entwined hands covered with sweat, we renew our grasp many times.</p><p>Just because it seemed as if we would end up melting.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai... ngh... sen...pai.\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s gasps came as a whisper in bits and pieces.</p><p>I strain my arousal-muffled ears.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I grasp her fingers with force, firmly bringing them together.</p><p>Immersing her body in mine, I embrace Sakura tightly.</p><p>Our hipbones are rubbing together, hard, as if smashing her body against the meat of her butt.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhnngh, ngh, ngh, Senpai... nfuaa!\u201D</p><p>Bearing it all, Sakura tightens up.</p><p>Though her body may be tender, her vagina alone is more than supple enough.</p><p>I&#39;m moving violently as if trying to crush her.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, ku\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai... Naagh, ngh...!\u201D</p><p>Our joined hips move slightly apart.</p><p>Not only am I pressing against her, but now Sakura is moving with me, too.</p><p>We continued to knead together, sensitive parts resounding ever more forcefully.</p><hr><p>\u201CAahn, it&#39;s good, Senpai, haa, aah, hn, ahaah!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura...! Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Moving in an unchanging rhythm, I focus only on brute force.</p><hr><p>Twisting or shaking, anything remotely complicated is all but blown away.</p><p>It feels so good and fulfilling right now, I couldn&#39;t care less.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhn, haa, ahn, aahn, Senpai... good...\u201D</p><p>Sakura responds as well.</p><hr><p>Whether it is Sakura taking root in the soil inside me, or whether it is me, as a single grain, falling and budding in the vast land of Sakura, I just don&#39;t know anymore.</p><p>All I know is that my chest is burning hot in our embrace.</p><p>Pressing against each other feels warm and pleasant.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, haa, aahn... Haa, ya, aaaahn!\u201D</p><p>I go about rubbing Sakura&#39;s pussy single-mindedly.</p><hr><p>It isn&#39;t so much a penis and vagina as it is a connection like the intertwining roots of a nervous system.</p><p>I can feel that Sakura is feeling it.</p><p>Our fingers are intertwined, quivering and holding tightly.</p><hr><p>A heartfelt entanglement, never to be broken no matter how much you try.</p><p>A fire flares up from deep inside. I want to connect with Sakura even deeper.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015From before our bodies were lying like so, overlapping each other.</p><p>To fill the blank space from before I met Sakura.</p><hr><p>A white dazzling light.</p><p>Love and lust melt together. Not just pleasure, it is a climax of pure happiness that threatens to melt my backbone.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Hnn...!\u201D</p><p>My body comes back.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s body leans back in an arch, my arms embracing her deeply.</p><p>All that I had, contracted to a single point, is now bursting out to ejaculate inside Sakura.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaa... Aaaahn... nn...\u201D</p><p>It feel bliss as I pour into her.</p><p>To compensate for what was lost, a warm power comes flowing in from Sakura.</p><p>Embracing, our sweat covered bodies overlap.</p><p>An ease I never knew until now spreads out gradually, enveloping me completely, together with enormous exhaustion.</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Both of our bodies are drained.</p><p>Our skin is still hot and pulsing, the sounds of our rough breathing overlap.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh \u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai, please look.\u201D</p><p>Sakura speaks softly in my ear.</p><p>Still holding on to her hand, I nod in response.</p><p>Our clasped hands that look as if they had gotten stuck, tell us of one another&#39;s heartbeat.</p><hr><p>\u201CPretty... isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>Outside, white petals are swimming through the breeze.</p><p>They flutter as they are washed away, flying across the window. Some also land onto Sakura&#39;s skin.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai... we had all sorts of fun, didn&#39;t we?\u201D</p><p>Still locked in an embrace, she speaks.</p><hr><p>\u201CLike going to the pool, watching the autumn leaves at Ryuudou-senpai&#39;s temple, or meeting under the Shinto station&#39;s Christmas tree.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, we went out a lot, didn&#39;t we. And there was that time when Rider came in at midnight with no warning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat caught me way off guard, and I went hiding in a closet as fast as I could. Even Rider was troubled, bending her brow like so.\u201D</p><hr><p>I want to keep on talking like this forever.</p><p>But strength is slowly draining from our fingers.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s... not the end of it. We&#39;ll keep having fun, right? Nothing is lost forever, is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Of course. The fun things aren&#39;t going anywhere.</p><p>Let&#39;s say\u2015\u2015\u2015for instance, should either of us die, everything up until now certainly happened.
