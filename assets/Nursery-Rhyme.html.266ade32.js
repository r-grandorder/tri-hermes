No clue why.</p><p>[2] NR uses &quot;watashi&quot; and &quot;anata&quot; for &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; respectively in the beginning before switching to &quot;ore&quot; and &quot;omae&quot; at the end. &quot;Watashi&quot;, in formal or polite contexts, is a gender neutral pronoun; in casual speech, it is typically only used by women. On the other hand &quot;ore&quot; is a pronoun frequently used by men. &quot;Anata&quot; is a more polite way to refer to somebody while &quot;omae&quot; is a more familiar/rougher way to do so.</p><p>[3] NR uses the proper Japanese name here instead of the english one that is written in katakana.</p><p>[4] In the mats, when Nursery Rhyme&#39;s old Master, Alice, is mentioned, her name is written with hiragana as &quot;\u3042\u308A\u3059&quot; (Arisu), however, in Nursery Rhyme-Alice&#39;s case, it&#39;s written with katakana as &quot;\u30A2\u30EA\u30B9&quot; (Arisu).
