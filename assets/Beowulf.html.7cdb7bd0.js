I can&#39;t think of anything besides him that could influence the summoning process.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It&#39;s true there are nameless fire dragons out there...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> But Grendel was the only monster with such fierce hate and glory in my life.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> He was an evil creature who played with people&#39;s lives.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> The kind of evil that reveled in the meaningless slaughter of people trapped in their dwellings.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I can understand fights over territory,<br> or animals just fighting for survival.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> But\u2013Grendel had both reason and intellect and was simply evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> That&#39;s why his very existence...<br> is far more of a threat to me than that of a fire dragon.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Fire dragons are passive as long as you leave their treasure alone. But Grendel&#39;s a twisted monster who revels in evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> If he revived as a side-effect of my summoning\u2013<br> I gotta kill him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Then let&#39;s go. The last response was in the old castle up ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you take a look at it, maybe you&#39;ll figure something out.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Okay.<br> Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> There are some things that shouldn&#39;t exist in this world.<br> Grendel is one of them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s\u2013deserted.<br> Not a soul to be seen.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I can smell blood.<br> It seems we missed our chance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Mash, can you tell? Looks like every last human in this castle was slaughtered.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Damn.<br> This isn&#39;t good.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> The more human flesh he consumes, the more powerful and evil he gets. We have to crush him before he attains his perfect form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, where is he\u2013?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Something&#39;s close!<br> Mash, prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Damn... We didn&#39;t take it down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Was that a chimera?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Grendel is a protean creature.<br> He can change his form depending on the situation.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I need Hrunting,<br> because it tracks enemies.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go after him. Follow me!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> So, here...</p><p><strong>Soldier A:</strong><br> H-Help me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That...</p><p><strong>Soldier A:</strong><br> Help me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, now!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Stop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-Why\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Enough of this stupid farce, Grendel.<br> Hrunting is eager to bite into you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What, a fake\u2013?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Something like that!<br> Let&#39;s go, Master. It&#39;s not a human, so don&#39;t hold back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> He ran away again. Listen up, young lady.<br> Don&#39;t trust whoever it is you next meet in this castle.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Also, don&#39;t be surprised by who you run into.<br> He can read your mind like a book.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> When he appears again, he&#39;ll likely take the form of someone we know.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Brace yourself, it&#39;s gonna be painful.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Just a little more...<br> Hey, come on out already!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...T-These are all fakes!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Right. What looks like armor and clothes is hardened skin. The weapons are extensions of claws and hair.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Pretty nasty, right?<br> That&#39;s why he&#39;s evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> But luckily it looks like we can kill him before he starts talking to us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He talks?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Only based on the speech in the memories he extracts.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> ...N-No.<br> I&#39;m just...not...used...to this body yet.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...why I was...summoned.<br> But...I&#39;ll do what...I have to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What on earth...</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> I&#39;ll kill you...in a cruel way.<br> Every last one...in cold blood.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it is.<br> That&#39;s how it must be.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes me Grendel. Like how I feasted on the human souls back in that castle!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Shut up. You probably just heard that from your mom. I&#39;ll make sure the two of you are nice and cozy together in hell.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> D-Damn you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh... I feel queasy... I know they&#39;re fakes, but the sensation when you hit them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it&#39;s all over now, right?<br> There&#39;s no response. Let&#39;s head back.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Master, don&#39;t you think something&#39;s off?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, vaguely.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a sharp nose.<br> That&#39;s my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It&#39;s a vicious creature we&#39;re dealing with.<br> Not the sort to accept death without a struggle.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Something smells.<br> Can we search a little longer?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay... If you think it&#39;s a good idea,<br> there&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s nowhere to be found...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Below us?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh, damn, I didn&#39;t notice.<br> This castle has a cellar. Let&#39;s check it out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe the cellar connects to a place like this...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> So that thing faked his death and fled here.<br> Which means\u2013</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> Ugh... D-Damn you...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got you cornered.<br> Your mom&#39;s not here, buddy.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I&#39;ll send you to hell where you belong!<br> I, Beowulf, will show you no mercy!</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> I could say...the same...<br> I&#39;ve read the memory...of the one who killed you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It&#39;s over, Grendel.<br> You&#39;re a monster that&#39;s not meant to be summoned.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> We&#39;ll likely never meet again.<br> ...Dammit, I met the one I wanted to meet the least.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> Wh-Why...<br> The one...who killed...you...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Actually, you&#39;re the one I fear the most in this world.<br> The fire dragon simply dealt the killing blow.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It was strong, but didn&#39;t frighten me.<br> I also now have dependable allies, unlike then.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You&#39;re a fool to not see that.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Good riddance, masquerader.<br> You should&#39;ve had a bit more faith in your own strength.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong><br> D-Damn you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seems we really got him this time!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Guess so. My Noble Phantasm is unlocked now.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> In the future you&#39;ll face punks looking for a fight.<br> When that happens, let me help you.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Well then, I guess we should head back, Master! Time for our triumphant return! Hah hah!</p>', 115);
