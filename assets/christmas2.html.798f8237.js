Of course!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have sort of a care package for you from all the Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We expect you to be out for a while, so please take it with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> First... This is a portable heater.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be flying at over 7,500 meters, so this will make sure you don&#39;t get cold.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s made with Medea&#39;s magecraft, so it will definitely keep you warm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How helpful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And this is a lunch from Emiya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you pull this string, it will automatically warm up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He developed it together with Edison, or so he said...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, the one flaw is that it emits a strong smell of dumplings, so be careful when you eat it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rocket dumplings...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And this is from Marie.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CIt&#39;s a little early for Christmas, but this is warm spiced wine,\u201D she says.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CI&#39;ll put it in an insulated case, so drink it when you find yourself getting cold.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is all so thoughtful...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And lastly, Senpai, this is from Santa Alter and me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a talisman we made together. It&#39;s meant to give many effects, such as safe travelling...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At least, I hope it does.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, and I have a message from Santa Alter.<br> \u201CYou&#39;d better not make her cry,\u201D she says.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehehe, I guess Santa Alter is kind of worried.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This year&#39;s Christmas is going to be a little bit... crazy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make it work.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I need to undergo emergency maintenance, so I&#39;m staying here with the doctor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll be monitoring you carefully!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So um... If you would contact me too, that would make me happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Goodbye, Master!<br> Be careful!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All right, it&#39;s time for Reindeer Master to head out!<br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It is pretty cold outside, but we&#39;ll be fine!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Because I, Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter, am Santa!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s extremely logistical! I mean, logical!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay...what the actual hell?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, let me start from the beginning\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Time for you to learn a lesson...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh, Jeanne! Why are you summoning me at this late hour?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> If you wish to do a ritual of dark magecraft, can&#39;t it wait till morning?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, no, no. Definitely not.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care about those weird rituals.<br> I don&#39;t even think they work.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You know... It&#39;s almost time, right?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Time for what?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All the younger Servants are starting to get excited.<br> I mean, so are the adults.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Why are they getting all excited for? Can you even call that candy-loving book a legendary hero who left a mark on history?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ugh... Those so-called \u201Creal Servants\u201D are satisfied with merely existing, and not at all interested in bettering themselves.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> According to Master, someone once said that anyone without a desire to improve is an idiot.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who it was, but it&#39;s a great saying worthy of a Jeanne Alter gold star.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Haha, you&#39;re getting off track, Jeanne.<br> So, will you tell me what it&#39;s time for?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Basically, it&#39;s almost Christmas.<br> Doesn&#39;t it piss you off to see them in high spirits?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> On the contrary, when I see the children get excited, it makes me want to smile.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Though for reasons I can&#39;t quite understand, my smile seems to frighten children!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I see now what a stupid question that was.<br> Also, those kids are right to run away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Anyways, listen.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> When Christmas comes, she starts getting excited.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Who is \u201Cshe\u201D?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you know?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That awful, dark Santa with the skin the color of a corpse!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Last time I was just walking through the halls when I almost got blown away!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u201CYou aren&#39;t looking where you&#39;re going, fallen saint. Can&#39;t you tell I&#39;m in the middle of tuning my Llamrei Mark II?\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u201COf course you can! It&#39;s almost Christmas! It&#39;s almost time for Christmas fun. My sword shall save the world once more!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> She said it twice! She just wouldn&#39;t shut up!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And then she went into the combat simulator and started humming \u201CJingle Bells\u201D while blasting off her Noble Phantasm for hours before finally going home.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> (Is my Jeanne stalking Santa...?)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you see? She&#39;s much too merry to be a proper Santa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to steal\u2013ahem, borrow\u2013Santa Alter&#39;s sack.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What? The sack she uses to carry presents!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. And then I&#39;m going to hand them out before she can.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The children will cry. Santa Alter will cry.<br> It will be my best Christmas ever!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Do you see now, the genius of my plan?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> But, my Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> If I may point out, even if it is the middle of the night, she is still a Servant.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> And we do not even have Presence Concealment.<br> Won&#39;t it be quite difficult to steal from her?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmph. You underestimate me, Gilles!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! The cute little kiddie King of Heroes gave me a potion that makes you invisible!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ooh! So that the pitch-black potion you&#39;ve been holding...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yep. I&#39;ll turn invisible, steal her sack, and then spend the whole night delivering presents! It&#39;s foolproof.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And tomorrow, when the children are happily opening their presents, I will feast on the sweet salt of Santa Alter&#39;s tears\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> SERVES YOU RIGHT!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What a beautiful, perfect plan!<br> So all you have to do is drink that potion, my Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yep! All that&#39;s left is to drink this potion, Gilles! That&#39;s...all...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How strange. I&#39;m suddenly a little...nervous for some reason...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It should be safe, right? I was careful not to ask the scary evil Gilgamesh and chose the dumb kid, as a precaution.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Yes! I have no reason to be confident about that, but I am willing to bet your life on it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Gilles, feel free not to say everything that comes to mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But that&#39;s fine. If I stopped to worry about consequences, I wouldn&#39;t be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I am the witch of vengeance. Even if I&#39;ve been tricked into taking poison, I&#39;ll still laugh and gulp it down.<br> All the potion. All of it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Well, bottoms up!<br> (Swallow)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ugh! This tastes awful!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> They say good medicine is bitter, Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Right, right. So? Am I turning invisible?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> No, not really.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Grr. I knew he tricked me. Well, then I&#39;ll just go STEAL the real thing from\u2014 Ack, gah!?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> M-my body is on fire...Gyaaaahh!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh no, not again! Jeanne! Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> JEEEAAANNE!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;re being real loud, Mr. Gilles de Rais!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmph. Trying to turn invisible to stir up trouble.<br> The grown-up me is awful, huh?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Eh? Eh? Eh?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But I respect her desire to want to be Santa!<br> I shall carry on her will!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Wait... Wait... Are you...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am Jeanne Alter Lily.<br> I was born to become the next Santa!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh, Jeanne... Jeanne...!<br> You have turned into a child too adorable by far...!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! I&#39;m so excited I seem to have ascended! Prelati would be delighted!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, the grown-up me is a dummy to think I could steal by turning invisible.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Oh? So you have a plan, sweet young Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> A plan? Mr. Gilles, are you stupid?<br> I don&#39;t need a plan!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna convince Miss Altria Santa that I&#39;m the better Santa!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ooh! Even in youth my Jeanne was so very reckless!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Nothing good will come of this, but she may at least learn a life lesson...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...?<br> Off I go!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh, you stay here, Mr. Gilles de Rais. You sneaking into a woman&#39;s room at night is bad, bad, bad!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What&#39;d&#39;yuh mean you wannnabe Santa? ChristmasSwordOfPromised-calibur!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Huh? Did that voice sound younger or something\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Meh, whatever. Bedtime... Zzz...<br> Get lots of sleep f&#39; Christmas...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Ooh, Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> She&#39;s the sort who may bite if you get too close!<br> Well, she may bite whether you&#39;re close or not!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Perhaps the reason you failed was that you approached unguarded. Oh, how sad...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you tell me before!?<br> She was scary! She was really, really scary!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Nuh-uh, I&#39;m not crying!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Bulging-eyed Gilles... What is the meaning of your intrusion at this hour?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The Servants are one thing, but Master and the staff are sleeping.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> If you want to make noise, do it when everyone is awake\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> The properly grown-up me! It&#39;s Regular Adult Me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I see. That explains why Adult-Me is all panicking and stuff.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> But this year, Santa&#39;s job will be miiiiiine!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Gilles?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Wh-what is it, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> Is it just my imagination, or is your smile a little more strained than usual?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> How could it not be strained?<br> Now, tell me what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t tell me everything, I will poke those googly eyes right out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s what happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What? Just... What?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You don&#39;t seem very calm, my Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> If you&#39;re my Master, you need to be composted and remain calm at all times!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I see... So they multiplied again...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hey, Master. What&#39;s that attitude for!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Master.<br> Multiplying like bunnies is Altria&#39;s thing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Me multiplying is an exception to all exceptions!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. May I ask your name and class once more?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Of course. I am...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> \u201CJeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily Lancer!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> One more time, faster.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> F-faster? All right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> \u201CJeanned&#39;ArcSantaAlterLilySanta\u201D!<br> Huh? Waaait a minute... Um...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> \u201CSantaJeanneAlterd&#39;ArcLily\u201D!<br> No... Um...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> \u201CShantaJantaLilyncer\u201D!<br> Huh Um... Hmm... Um... Well...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Master, please don&#39;t tease her too much.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Tease me...? M-Master, what are you? A kid!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think I see what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter has become Lily. And the cause is the young Gilgamesh&#39;s potion. Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I&#39;m really sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not even kind of sorry, are you?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Nope. She woke me up in the middle of the night.<br> Not my fault I grabbed the wrong potion!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t deliberate. It was an innocent mistake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Forgiven.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...Well, if I were to make an excuse, it was because I was woken up at night and I grabbed the wrong thing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have opened the door to my treasure vault while I was still lying on the floor.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> That was very careless of you, Gil!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Hahaha. I never thought I&#39;d see the day Jeanne Alter had a good reason to yell at me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Adult-Me is a good-for-nothing!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I\u2013she is not that bad...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Deep down, she has the potential to become a proud Servant...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> The way the other me spoils me is the reason why I think of things like trying to steal sacks!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. So this is what that weirdo looked like before she grew up.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Miss Calls-Herself-a-Holy-Maiden, Master, come with me. I need to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never called myself anything like that!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Mash, you play with her for a while.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m too old to play.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> More importantly, Miss Altria Santa, give me Santa&#39;s sack\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Just play. Or you get the naughtygirl-calibur.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Whaaaaaa!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>I-I don&#39;t think Santa should be threatening people! (Shaking)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Should I call you Jeanne Alter Santa Lily?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or maybe something shorter? A nickname...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter is fine. Or Santa Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then for now, I&#39;ll call you Jeanne Alter.<br> Why do you want to be Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Because I&#39;d be the best Santa ever, duh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I can do a much better job of delivering the proper, ideal presents for everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The proper presents...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do remember Emiya&#39;s unreadable expression upon receiving Black Keys last year...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What&#39;s an Archer gonna do with Black Keys, anyway? That&#39;s why she&#39;s bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Good point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I know most of what happened last Christmas from grown-up me&#39;s memories.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I know I can give better presents, and that everyone will love them!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh. Listen to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Welcome back, Master. Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m back.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Wh-what is it, Miss Altria Santa?<br> Is it another-calibur? Whatcha-calibur again?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> D-do it, if you dare!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You are not fooling anyone, talking tough while hiding behind Master.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...But we talked, and I&#39;ve decided that you can be Santa this year.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Take this. This is Santa&#39;s secret sack.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s okay? Really?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Well, if you don&#39;t want to, I&#39;ll just be Santa again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> N-no! I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll do it!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Reindeer, this year will be different than last.<br> You take the lead.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> What you do is no different from last year. Gather the stockings that are the crystallizations of children&#39;s hearts.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Babysitting will be an extra task, but you can do it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Th-that sounds like I&#39;m just some useless kid!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Take that back! I demand a reduction!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I guess I have to babysit Master, then.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Fine. I&#39;m gonna lead the Reindeer to the best Christmas ever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do our best, Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Do our best? There&#39;s no need to work that hard.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hehehe. Why, you ask? Because my plan is perfect!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> (I have a bad feeling about this, but hang in there, Reindeer. Fujimaru is the only one who can control her.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Consider this a request from me as well, Master.<br> Please, make Lily into a great Santa...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m on it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Thank you...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I know this should be obvious, but Alter Lily is also a different being than myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Please treat her as a full-fledged Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Heh. That&#39;s the answer of one who knows what [\u2642 he /\u2640 she]&#39;s doing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll start by testing your power.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Santa, Jr., Fujimaru.<br> We&#39;ll start with Santa warm-ups.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Santa needs an iron will, an icy heart, and the fury of a demon! Fight without fear!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> To the combat simulator, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll show you my powers as a Santa Servant.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Very well. I will be your opponent, Santa, Jr.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> A-already!? Uuhhh...<br> Wait! I&#39;m not ready\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> There&#39;s no use arguing! I shall test you to see if you&#39;re a Santa worthy of my Reindeer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You passed. Barely. But, I suppose I must give you my secret sack.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Now, Reindeer. Work hard so you don&#39;t tarnish the Santa name.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Th-that was scary... That was real scary...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you okay? It looked like you were maybe crying a little, Jeanne Alter...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> No, I wasn&#39;t crying! There&#39;s no crying in Santa Claus!<br> It&#39;s a Class that delivers smiles!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Anyways, old Santa gave me her blessing.<br> Now let&#39;s go deliver preseeents!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Huh? It&#39;s still early?<br> What are you saying, Reindeer?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You know how the song goes!<br> \u201CSanta baby, hurry down...\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> V-very well, but we have to prepare, so hold on a little bit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may not be winter yet, but it is late fall. There might already be snow falling in some places.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should at least get some winter equipment ready!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s enough reminiscing.<br> Time to get going, Reindeer!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> There are Servants waiting for us to give them their presents!</p><h2 id="_2nd-night-the-gift-of-the-fool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2nd-night-the-gift-of-the-fool" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2nd Night: The Gift of the Fool</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Have you heard of the story called<br> \u201CThe Gift of the Magi,\u201D Reindeer?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Personally, the truly moving moment kinda falls flat!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hair can grow out, but the special family watch is gone forever!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> From the way the story goes, the husband prolly won&#39;t be getting a new watch.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> And every time the wife uses the combs, she&#39;d feel real bad, and every time the husband see the combs, he&#39;d feel kinda dumb.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> And that&#39;s bad. &#39;Course they wanted to be nice, but their gifts didn&#39;t make them magi, they made them dummies!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s why this is the perfect present for her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hum, hum, hum.

How about a drink, Martha?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> And this year Ushiwakamaru is drunk, too...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No, no, no, no. I am not all at drunk.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yooou...shall not pass.<br> (Talking to a Jizo statue)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Stop talking nonsense.<br> We only need one person who talks like that.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Maaarrrthaaa!<br> Make me your Steel Fist Yukhoe, Yukhoe\u2014!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Use your fists! Smash the meat! You know, the thing that magically tastes better that way!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Okay. Fine. You two are a pain this year, too!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> But Christmas is so much fun.<br> Why didn&#39;t you tell me last year?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Hey, Martha. Hey. Hey. Hey.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s just pains in the butt all over the place!<br> I thought this might happen!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Booooooo...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Jing Ke! Do you have any other requests?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I have plenty of alcohol, so just Yukhoe will be fine! (Belch)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, oh! Over here! Over here! I have a request.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Sure, what is it?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;d like a crockpot. Would that be okay?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> A crockpot?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> What is a crockpot? Is it for crocodiles?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No, I was hoping to make some soft-shell turtle soup.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, turtle soup...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Turtle soup, huh!?<br> That sounds good! That will invigorate you!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> We can always make our Master eat it!<br> It&#39;ll be one wild night!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Well unfortunately, I didn&#39;t procure any soft-shell turtles.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Why would you need to be invigorated on such a holy day?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Sure, I can see you celebrating a bit, but more than anything it is a time for reverence and\u2014</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hahahahaha, what are you saying, Martha?<br> There&#39;s a huge turtle right here.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s Tarasque!

Then how about giving it a try?!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Tarasque soup! Tarasque soup!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Do you see this, Reindeer?<br> Look at these weirdos...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is a terrifying scene...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> All the adults are ganging up on that poor turtle.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a scene from hell.<br> This is bad... This is real, real bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is so terrible in so many ways...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yeah, I feel bad for Tarasque, but seeing grown-ups acting like this...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Santa Alter told me what happened last year, but...<br> This is far worse than I heard...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Oh, Santa and Reindeer.<br> You came again? So soon?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes! We&#39;re here! And just like last year you&#39;re all sooo baaad!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You&#39;re all getting ingrate... inebred... Drunk!<br> Drunk in a cave! And you call yourselves adults!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Come onnn! Are you dummies!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Weren&#39;t you taller last year?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> H-hey! Don&#39;t pick on me!<br> I&#39;m going to grow! I&#39;m GONNA get taller!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Whaat? Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Eek!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh, Santa&#39;s here again!<br> Come, come. Have a drink.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Jing Ke, Santa&#39;s scared and hiding. That&#39;s no good.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We need to smoke her out. Like a mole.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If you want to chop off the head of every soldier in a fortress, it&#39;s best to just burn it down.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s burn everything!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> R-Reindeer! Reindeer!?<br> Ushiwakamaru is scaring me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> This is why I hate drunk people!<br> This isn&#39;t Christmas at all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s punish them.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Punishment... What a spirited idea...<br> I mean, splendid idea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Brother would just put his trembling fingers up his brow in frustration...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But my sister-in-law, Masako. Wow, was she strict.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If one didn&#39;t continuously demonstrate great martial might and feats of strength, she might take their head at any moment.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Punishment. That is good.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But if you don&#39;t give me a good punishment, I, Ushiwakamaru, shall bite back without hesitation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s punch &#39;em till they straighten out.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Let your fists do the talking... That sounds nice.<br> But we are an all-girls club.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Out of respect for our friendship, I shall be on their side! Also, I&#39;ll make sure you forget everything while I&#39;m at it, Master.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It would be awkward next time we saw each other. Right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Ha. A fight? Yeah! I can do that!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Come on, Reindeer, give me your orders!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> When I win, make sure you praise me a lot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sad drunk girls&#39; party is coming this way!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> (Panting) W-we won!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were great, Santa!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes, I am the bestest Santa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re cute.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Cu...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> N-N-NO! I&#39;m not! I&#39;m not!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You can praise me as much as you want, but for being the best Santa!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> No calling me cute! No, no, no! Boo...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Thank you...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh man, we lost! It&#39;s lose even if you drunk while you&#39;re fun!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> (Sigh) That didn&#39;t sober them up at all...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Anyways, here&#39;s your presents, weird ladies!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Ahahahaha. What&#39;s this? (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Some sort of new alcohol? (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> This tastes funny... (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s a detoxifier.</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong><br> What.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Servants shouldn&#39;t be getting drunk!<br> That&#39;s bad, that&#39;s real bad.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> This medicine...is so you always keep your sense of duty as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh, please do be careful. It also means if you drink any alcohol you&#39;ll take damage.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Th-that can&#39;t be!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I can&#39;t drink? Wh-what&#39;s the point in living now...?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Darn it... I see. So that&#39;s where this was going...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Whew. Did you see how great the presents I gave them this year were?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Things were finally about to get really wild and fun...<br> It&#39;s going to be tough being sober on Christmas.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Oh my. I can&#39;t use alcohol as an excuse to do things anymore...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> (Glance)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Reindeer?<br> Your face is all red...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Master?<br> Did something happen, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is there a reason to lock eyes with Mata Hari, Master!?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Umm, Santa. You didn&#39;t make this medicine... Did you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> No, I didn&#39;t know how, so I had a Caster make it. I don&#39;t know who he was but he wore white clothes\u2014</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Did he have long hair? It was long hair, wasn&#39;t it? Hahahahaha, let&#39;s go stab him. Stabbity stab stab!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I shall accompany you to the very gates of hell!<br> Haha, hahaha, hahahahaha...!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ll come along, too.<br> Martha, you handle the rest.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> What do you mean, handle the rest\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s head to the next one, Reindeer!<br> It smells like alcohol here, and it&#39;s making me dizzy...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Okay, you. Wait juuust one second. (Grab)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Gah.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Wh-what is it?! I&#39;m Santa! I&#39;m busy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You already got your present! Lemme go!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I need to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Call me Santa!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Okay, okay. Santa, Santa.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Now. What were you thinking when you chose those presents?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What I was thinking... I wanted to pick something that would be good for them.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Hmm... I think Christmas presents are more about making people happy than being practical.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> The celebration of Christmas began as an opportunity to celebrate His birth.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about having a good gift, but rather about making someone happy... Don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Nope!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> If Christmas is a day of blessing, then giving a useful gift is important.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s true everyone might not be happy with my gift, but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> If it ends up being useful, then their happiness really isn&#39;t that important. That&#39;s what I think.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I see. I suppose that way of thinking is\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> It makes sense, but...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Reindeer, can I leave the rest to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, I got this.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> ...Understood. That&#39;s all from me.<br> I thank you for your present.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> Good luck, Santa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Haha, yesss!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go deliver our next present, Reindeer!</p><h2 id="_3rd-night-we-are-middle-schoolers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3rd-night-we-are-middle-schoolers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3rd Night: We are Middle Schoolers</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s get going, Reindeer!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Time to deliver some good, practical presents for the good Servants of Japan!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Is it time yet?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hmph, Lord Amakusa. What is Fuuma waiting for?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Ah... He requested a present from Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hahaha! I see! I see!<br> Even the leader of the Fuuma Clan is still human, eh?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I thought ninja were just puppets on strings without human emotions. Man, that&#39;s so cute!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> We Servants find our psychological ages strongly affected by our physical bodies.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> A 15 year-old body means his mind has regressed to that of a 15-year-old.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Indeed. Memories of our older selves often feel like it&#39;s somebody else&#39;s business.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Servants are such strange beings.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But Lord Amakusa, is this \u201CSanta Claus\u201D really real? Handing out presents sounds like the work of a celestial maiden.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s exactly right. But word from [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] is that there&#39;s a bit of a problem this year...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Oh? A problem?<br> That sounds interesting. What is it\u2014</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> They&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Thanks for waiting! You must be Fuuma Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily has arrived!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see all the Servants of the Far East are gathered here... Are you having a banquet or something?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...A child?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a child! I&#39;m Santa! Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily! Aww, how come everyone calls me a child?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Mostly because you are, I guess?<br> Come now, want some candy?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> No. Thank. You.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Besides, everyone knows you&#39;re not supposed to take things from strangers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you want one?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Reindeer, where did you get that candy?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> A ramune flavored candy?<br> My faaavorite! Its fizziness is so grown-up!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> What do you mean, grown-up...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want some candy?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What? Really!?<br> Thank yo\u2014 N-no, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t um... I really don&#39;t like mint... It&#39;s a little too grown-up for me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. Mint flavor is for grown-ups, huh?<br> I&#39;ll ask the doctor for some next time.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> So, Santa. About my present... (Fidget, fidget)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes, I know. What you truly need is\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> This Japanese-English dictionary!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...A dictionary...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes! Your Noble Phantasm name has, um...<br> A lot of grammatical issues and things.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Fix it to proper English for a proper NP name!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hmm, even I can tell that this is no fun at all.<br> A Japanese-English dictionary for Christmas?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> That&#39;s as disappointing as getting a biography of Schweitzer. No, I mean Schweitzer was a great man, but...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s a terrible present.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What? Even Mr. Tawara is complaining!<br> This gift is for Mr. Fuuma&#39;s own good!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve heard Christmas is a time for celebrations, like New Year&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Everyone celebrates and everyone is happy. You want a gift like a festival prize, or something cheerful!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Which means it should be something they&#39;ll enjoy, not something that makes their life better, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...If it&#39;s not useful, then it&#39;s not a very good present.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Otherwise, giving a present is just about making yourself feel good. The giver just wants to take joy in giving something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s no good! It doesn&#39;t make the world any better.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> So that means no matter what the person says, the giver has to get them a useful gift to help them improve!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it means to be Santa.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...No, it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>IT IS NOT!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>IS TOO!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong></p><p>Grrrr!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hmph. Nothing for it, then.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> We are Servants. We shall settle this as Servants do, with a Christmas battle!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;m joining Fuuma&#39;s side.<br> It&#39;s childish to give someone a present they don&#39;t want.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Fine, then, be that way!<br> Santa will kick your butts!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I see. ...Then I shall resist with all I&#39;ve got.<br> I am Fuuma Kotarou, fifth leader of the Fuuma Clan.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I shall destroy this most pointless of presents!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> My name is Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily! You&#39;re gonna take my gift and like it, whether you like it or not!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...Understood. Leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I lost to a kid like her!?<br> When did I get so rusty!?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I guess I can&#39;t be touting \u201CPlaying is Justice\u201D anymore... Maybe I should take it easy with the eating, too...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;ve failed...!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> But a defeat is a defeat. I suppose I must now accept your Japanese-English dictionary.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Now you can fix your Noble Phantasm&#39;s name!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Hmm? I&#39;ve no intention of changing its name.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...The founders of the Fuuma clan were \u201Cijin.\u201D<br> Which is to say, they were not from Japan.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I&#39;m told my father was a large, red-haired, blue-eyed Westerner.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> For the founders, the fading memories of their homeland must have been hard to endure.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> It is the same with the children born here. We can no longer speak the language of our forefathers.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> So the least we can do is to use a few (cool-sounding) words of that language to bring them peace...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Such sentiment is embedded in my Noble Phantasm...<br> So I can&#39;t change it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t know that... And to think I tried to give you a dictionary...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, no. I will take it, and thank you for it.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> In the future, maybe I&#39;ll add something to my Noble Phantasm name. So, thank you...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Okay. Let&#39;s go, Reindeer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to move on.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Huh, she left in the middle of our bit of reflection.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> That girl\u2014</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> That girl doesn&#39;t feel any joy in giving presents, does she?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> No, she doesn&#39;t seem to. She&#39;s trying to do it right, but...it is sad, too.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> She focuses on usefulness because she doesn&#39;t know what kind of gifts bring joy.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But then... Why did she become Santa in the first place?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> No, I was just wondering...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Where did Lord Amakusa go?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Reindeer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Umm...

Not at all. I&#39;m just red and tanned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course not. Truly, your identity is shrouded in mystery.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Yes. Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Okay! Now I know who you are!<br> But how come you&#39;re bothering me?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Ahem. Jeanne... Oh Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t let Fuuma not liking your present get you down.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> It is Santa&#39;s job to always get back up and always deliver smiles.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Always... smiles...</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Stand and present. You must stand up... and give presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Even Scrooge made it in time.<br> There&#39;s no way YOU can fail, right?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Whenever you&#39;re lost, or in trouble, I shall appear.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Santa Island Mask...!<br> Does this make you my mentor?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Um... Sure... I guess...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Heheh.

Those are important, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Mister... Well, I guess that&#39;s right. If I tell her not to call me Mister then I&#39;ll sound even older.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh hey you two, wait.<br> Be careful with the noisemakers.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The sound will echo in a labyrinth. You need to be mindful of your neighbors, especially at festival time.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Sheesh... I had hoped to avoid a repeat of last year by spending this year alone in a quiet labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Um... Sorry.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. You got roped into this, too.<br> Don&#39;t be so timid.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I know this is foreign to you, but it&#39;s a celebration, so try to embrace it wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Master and I are almost from the same era.

Ahem, erm, sorry, I mean, such innocence is just like you!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> They say the dolls of us are super popular!<br> So we want one as a present!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh? Wait a minute.<br> That&#39;s no doll, it&#39;s an action figure\u2014</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Me too! Me too!!

Please, tell me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What should I do!?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Well, you should grant their request.<br> You&#39;ve taken back their gift.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Which means you have to grant them another wish.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> But children are selfish.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> So, if you don&#39;t grant their request, they&#39;ll keep throwing anything you give them right back in your face!

So, that&#39;s why you should at least start by granting their wish.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I promise you that if you do, you can be a real Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...I-I understand!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Jack, Nursery Rhyme.

Because you are Santa Claus. There is no such thing as a reward for completing your task.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Will you still continue?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I-I...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s something Santa must decide.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I... I want to grant their wish, instead of forcing a present they don&#39;t want on them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I want to give them both exactly what they wished for!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> If the two of you don&#39;t mind, I would still like to grant your wish. So let&#39;s go see... the ocean!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Okaaay!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I see. Then, proceed with caution, Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Fulfilling a wish is intrinsically an unequal thing. Unequal... That is, a problem of desire.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Be it a simple, casual wish or a desperate need with life hanging in the balance, it is Santa Claus who decides whether or not to grant it.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> The one who prays and pleads has their wish granted, while those who don&#39;t are not so fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> ...When you think about it, Santa may not be a saint at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Santa may not be a saint at all\u2014<br> That&#39;s what Santa Island Mask said.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wanted to argue and say it wasn&#39;t true.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wanted to say Santa Claus is a noble saint who grants everyone&#39;s wishes, and that&#39;s why I chose to become Santa.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t shake the feeling that what he said might really be true.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...When I think about what happens after Christmas, I start trembling with fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master.<br> Am I okay?

Well, we&#39;d be in trouble if we got dragged down to the ground anyway!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Let&#39;s leave the sleigh here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll retrieve the sleigh later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Luckily, we aren&#39;t too far from the ocean.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may be a little taxing for Master though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay, we can all walk.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I agree. Jack and Nursery Rhyme, are you two okay with that too?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Umm, then we have a favor to ask Reindeer.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, I have something to ask of Reindeer too.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Ready and... Let&#39;s all hold hands and walk!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hey, no fair...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> No, I mean, you&#39;re making it difficult for Reindeer Master to walk!

P-please mind!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> A Reindeer should not walk hand-in-hand with small children! Santa rules!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wanna join, Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...!<br> W-well, if you insist... Hey, you&#39;re out of hands!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What, your back? Piggyback?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> N-no, that&#39;s embarrassing.

This seems kind of ridiculous.<br> Why do we need to interfere?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Well, simply put, if her heart can&#39;t change, there&#39;s nothing we can do for her.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> For a wish-granter to try so desperately to avoid admitting her own wish... That&#39;s something of a paradox.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> She&#39;s deliberately blinding herself to what it really means to grant wishes.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> To even BE Santa Claus is to have the wish granted of being able to grant others&#39; wishes.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Unless you&#39;re pure evil, the feeling of so performing so many good deeds fills the heart.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> In a way, Santa Clause epitomizes that concept.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> A nice child receives a gift.<br> A naughty child receives a scolding.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see. But Jeanne, she\u2014</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Right. She lacks that. And that&#39;s the problem.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Left alone, she will lose sight of her reason to live, and maybe even lose her own identity.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...It would be fine for a Heroic Spirit whose name is engraved in history.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If someone has faith, and calls your name in awe, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a wish or not.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> However... That&#39;s not the case for Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nobody believes in her. Moreover, the world doesn&#39;t know of her at all.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Even if they know of Jeanne d&#39;Arc, nobody thinks someone like her existed behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> After all, she is a Servant born within Orleans.<br> A fake given temporary life by the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> She barely managed to materialize as a Servant after slipping past several trials and causing a nightmarish commotion.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But even materialization is uncertain in the Lily state.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s why Altria Alter passed her the role of Santa.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But, even given the role of Santa, she still carries a burden within her.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hopefully she&#39;ll come to understand it in the short journey to the sea\u2014</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...By the way, what is the meaning of THAT?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Heh, I have to at least hide my face.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> (So he is a bowman who knows nothing of disguises, I see...)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Reindeer Master, can&#39;t you sleep?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Jack and Nursery Rhymes both crawled into their sleeping bags.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Aren&#39;t those two Servants? It shouldn&#39;t be necessary to sleep when they&#39;re materialized.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> They are wasting needless magical energy.<br> Aren&#39;t they bothering you, Master Reindeer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> They&#39;re not...? How come?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to take my spirit form so I don&#39;t cause trouble. I&#39;m a good girl, aren&#39;t I? Ahem!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I prefer it this way.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Y-you prefer it that way?<br> But isn&#39;t it pointless?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I feel it&#39;s more proper for a Servant to stay in spirit form at times like this...

If what I know is right, don&#39;t people usually go to the sea in summer?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Winter seas are just for looking and not swimming.<br> So, um, what&#39;s the point in going?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> You really think so? I can&#39;t imagine that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> After all, unlike those two, I am an adult! Hee hee!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Waaah!

Mister Roman&#39;s voice sounds somewhat silly.<br> It warbles like a dying cat!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> He sounds like a really sad person who gave up on everything, and can&#39;t do anything but laugh!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Really, is that what you think?<br> I think that might be a bit much.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> May I finally make my appearance?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Wh-who&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ahem. Hem-hem!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hehehe... I am the cruel contortionist, Hassan of the Cursed Arm. I will not allow you to reach the sea...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Why not!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Why, you ask!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there a different Santa!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Could there be other Santas!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Ah ha! Yes, that! ...Hehehe, because the real Santa is right here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Um, that sounded kinda like you just thought of it when Master Reindeer said it.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hehehe... twist, twist. (Trying to dodge the accusation with suggestive contortions)</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Time to make your appearance!<br> The true Santa... Lord Santam!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heh... I ask of you: What is Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Who&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> And Santa is the granter of wishes!<br> Someone who brings happiness by bringing gifts!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I...um, well, I may not be the best at that yet, though...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Then, I shall answer you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Santas are faceless watchmen who wander from shadow to shadow, hidden from the world!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Take a look, this is the proper form of a Santa!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> My name is Santam! I! We! Are Santam!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Emiya... What are you doing there, Emiya?</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong></p><p>What!?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> What are you doing? Are you playing dress-up?<br> Should we join?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh, Mister Emiya. Playing make-believe masked heroes is embarrassing for adults, you know?</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> How did they figure it out...!?<br> They couldn&#39;t figure out Santa Island Mask...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ahem. Anyway, Santam.</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> I-I know. Hey, Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> I, Santam, was summoned to correct your mistaken view of Santa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Mistaken...view of Santa...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mister has it all wrong too.

I am, without a doubt, Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> As long as Reindeer Master doesn&#39;t abandon me, I&#39;ll always be the really real Santa Claus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Perhaps Emi... I mean, Santam may be a better Santa than me...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I mean, he can copy anything and everything.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> The nerve! First he copies Noble Phantasms, now presents!? He&#39;s the Counterfeit King!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> ...Forget about that!<br> This way I don&#39;t need to buy anything, at least.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...But!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> But, since Altria Santa has entrusted me with the bag,<br> I am Santa!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Please step aside, Mr. Santam...!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> All right. Come at me, young lady!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> By the way, I am an Archer, which doesn&#39;t really go well against a Lancer, but...never mind that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Victory!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> Heh... And defeat for me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...It felt like you were taking it super easy on us...<br> But we won! And that&#39;s what matters!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> Then move forward.<br> Never forget that you are a true Santa.</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> And no matter who the enemy is...<br> Do not forget your duties as Santa.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Jeanne is a great Santa!</p><p><strong>Santam:</strong><br> Then we shall disappear as the defeated should.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh, nothing!<br> We&#39;ve almost reached the sea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look too well...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing! I&#39;m fine, yes, I&#39;ll be fine...</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Let us hurry ahead to play the role of the final blockade!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You look like you&#39;re enjoying yourself, Ama...<br> I mean, Santa Island Mask.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s been a while since I had a chance to play the villain!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> And with this impending betrayal, I&#39;m getting all fired up!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahahahaha. Are you sure you&#39;re a Ruler?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Heheheh, whatever do you mean?<br> Right now I am just the mysterious Santa Island Mask.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> A masked man can only be a traitor, a villain, or a hero that cannot show his face.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;re not a hero?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I certainly will not call a man who gets in the way of a girl&#39;s dream a hero.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> ...Now onward!<br> Santa Island Mask is coming...</p><h2 id="_7th-night-last-present-for-you" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7th-night-last-present-for-you" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 7th Night: Last Present For You</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We&#39;re getting closer to the sea.<br> Our short but difficult journey will end soon.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Will I still be able to be Santa?

They grant wishes and give presents fairly, without bias.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Self-interest is unnecessary. All that is required is to embody the ideal that sustains the mechanism that is Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> You are lost, perplexed, and anguished...<br> Yet you still continue.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Is it bad to be lost and perplexed?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> It is. If you&#39;re Santa, then you must be rational.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Self-interest is unnecessary?<br> Even the desire to grant wishes?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> No. It is absolutely not needed for Santa.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Is...that true...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Um, um, Master?<br> What is \u201Cself-interest?\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s the desire to do something for yourself.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ummm, so we want to go to the sea!<br> ...Is that self-interest?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> That is correct.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Jeanne...

What is it?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ummm, you want to hold hands?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh, no. I&#39;m fine...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re trembling.<br> Then I&#39;ll hold your hand, too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> G-geez.

That was my dream when I was young.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The vast sea spreading across the horizon was a tale I had only heard about.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Even if I pretended a wheat field was the sea, I could not hear the sound of the waves.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My dream came true after everything was over.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, it was the winter of 1430. When I passed through Le Crotoy, I indeed saw the sea.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Even if everything was over.<br> Even if I understood the destiny that awaited me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That beauty. That sense of awe that made me tremble.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It was unforgettable. It was a scene beyond comparison to anything\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> This is really hard on a book, sheesh...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Oh\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The waves crashed and roared.<br> The violent winds howled.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It may not have been alive, but for all its ferocity, it may as well have been.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Wow, this is the sea?<br> Amazing. It&#39;s really amazing!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It&#39;s amazing, it&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s so pretty!<br> And the sunset is beautiful!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> The sun is setting!<br> It looks like it&#39;s melting into the ocean!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Can&#39;t we go swimming?<br> It should be all right, we&#39;re Servants!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s disgraceful.<br> Oooh, water is bad for paper!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Awww. Then what about you, Jeanne?<br> Jeanne, you don&#39;t mind, right?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Eh...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Ah, aah... Aaah...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...This. Right, this. I was wrong from the beginning.<br> I was wrong.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> This. Is. My.

For the longest, longest time, I wanted to see the sea...!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>Waaaaaaaaaaah...!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t come here to grant your wishes.<br> This is\u2014</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s fine. We don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You really did your best.<br> You did the best any Santa could.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Let&#39;s listen to the churning waves.<br> Let&#39;s watch the waves break.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> A primordial display, as fierce as the end of the world. And yet, it&#39;s such a beautiful scene\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad she realized...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh? Jeanne!? What in the world is going on here...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Wanting to see the sea...was my wish, my desire.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It was a silly dream I had in my childhood. So much so that when I departed at age 17, I had left it behind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...That girl is not a saint.<br> That said, she is not an Avenger, either.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> My young self was simply a child who enjoyed everyday life.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So, in order to maintain her body as a Servant, there was a need to become something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...But, she had wished to become Santa.<br> Even though no child should become Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Children should not become Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> A proper Santa is what Amakusa\u2014no, is exactly what Santa Island Mask said.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> The ideal Santa must be impartial in delivering presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...? I didn&#39;t mind that when I delivered.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Oh, please. But, for children, that is impossible.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Because children should be the ones receiving presents. Not the ones giving them out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Of course, it&#39;s different if they&#39;re giving something to someone specific. That&#39;s a gift given out of personal desire.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But Santa Claus isn&#39;t like that. Santa&#39;s purpose is to deliver love and presents impartially, to all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> But children desire presents more than anyone else.<br> All the more so if they haven&#39;t wished for anything yet.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I hoped her time as Santa Claus would teach her, somehow.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I wanted her, Jeanne, to harbor a desire.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...However, the story went...a little astray.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I never imagined she would be so stubborn.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I thought that after passing out two or three presents, she would realize she harbored her own desires.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Just how selfless are you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that my everyday life was fulfilling...<br> I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t that charming of a child.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I managed to figure out Jeanne&#39;s wish, and asked Jack and Nursery.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> I asked them to grant her wish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh? So this journey was...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Yes. This journey was never about her becoming Santa Claus\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> It was a chance for Santa Claus to become Jeanne Alter Santa Lily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone who appeared along the way...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> If she were to give up after one or two obstacles, we would&#39;ve been forced to take a different approach.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> But she trudged forward, so it must truly have been her dream to see the sea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> And, there is one more important thing.<br> It wasn&#39;t merely going to go see the sea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Even after all her struggles, she was able to go see the sea with her dear friends.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> As long as she has this memory, she will continue to exist as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Oh, so the cat&#39;s out of the bag.<br> Can I revive myself now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you must.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> My gosh. Even as a child, she was a formidable opponent! I couldn&#39;t afford to go easy on her.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I actually fought like I meant it, and she took me down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nope. Stay dead.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Ehhh? Aren&#39;t we done?<br> All three of them reached the sea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-whaaaa!? Santa Island Mask came back to life?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> My gosh. Well, we kind of railroaded the plot, but we managed to finish.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Thank you very much.<br> I never imagined you would help me\u2014</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahaha, of course!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> To have more Jeanne Alters you don&#39;t get along with! What could be better?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> So that was your ulterior motive. Geez!<br> ...But, I am happy with how this worked out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> She may not be me, but she has untapped potential that even I don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m happy.<br> It feels like I gained a little sister.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> You should say that to the original Jeanne Alter.<br> That will really upset her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> I know. That&#39;s why I won&#39;t tell her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... So everything was a scheme Amakusa and Jeanne cooked up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was completely fooled.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> No, it wasn&#39;t me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Nor was it me. I could have never gotten this far...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Though I was the one who mentioned Jeanne Alter Santa Lily would disappear as she was...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> The plan itself wasn&#39;t actually mine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh, then who was it? Santam?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What? No!<br> Heh... Mash, you haven&#39;t figured it out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The one who planned this is the one who understands Servants the most.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The one who understands who is best for which role, and who should guide her along the way.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And, it must be someone that THE Jeanne Alter trusts from the bottom of her heart, even in her Lily form.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Really, there is only one such mastermind in all the world, isn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Ah... Aah!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...MASTER!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Busted...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master, you set all of this up!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Yes, the way you improvised your way through situations, and the way the Servants were appropriately placed was remarkable.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> It was also Fujimaru&#39;s plan to make it look like Llamrei Mark II&#39;s engine was broken after the crash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...H-hold on a second!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t anyone tell me?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s because...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Master told us to stay quiet. We were told that Mash could not tell a lie, and telling her would ruin the plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>SEEEENNPAAAAIIIII!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sooorry!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! So when the Doctor said there was emergency maintenance...!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Of course he was playing along.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to the Doctor to protest right this instant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Try to go easy on him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. I have to save some energy for you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whew...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hate to burst your bubble, but brace yourself when you return, Master!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Heh. She&#39;s pouting.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Girls of that type hold grudges for a long time.<br> You should make it up to her soon.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> At a time like this, your best bet is giving her a present.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> (He seems quite used to this...)</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> (Indeed...)</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> (He must have had to do plenty of \u201Cmaking up\u201D during his lifetime...)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...?<br> (Sometimes this place is the worst...)</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Are we done? Did it all work out?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> It seems everything worked out for the best.<br> What a relief!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> Thank you all for your hard work.<br> I&#39;m sorry for roping you into this too, Asterios.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> No...worries!<br> Wish granted...I&#39;m...happy.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I knew...now is...the most...fun!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The other Servants are gathering in Chaldea.<br> This...will be quite the party.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong><br> ...Quick, everyone, let&#39;s hide!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Reindeer Master!<br> I figured it out now that I reached the sea!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m Santa, but I&#39;m still young.<br> I&#39;m immature, selfish, and helpless\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> But still, I&#39;m here right now!<br> I want to do my best to help you, Reindeer Master!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> So, um, well, even when Christmas is over, even if spring, summer, and autumn come...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Can I stay by your side?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Thank you sooo much!
