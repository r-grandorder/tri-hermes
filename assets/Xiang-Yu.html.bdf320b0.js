However, he doesn\u2019t show any shred of gentleness as he is seen as a ruthless and cold-hearted villain that commits all atrocities without pulling a wry face or raising an eyebrow, but as a matter of fact, the person themselves isn\u2019t evil at all. Originally, his true character was to be a thinking machine that didn\u2019t have the desire for the foundation of evil on him. Ordinary people cannot possibly sympathize with his complete rationality as an android, and not only that, but because how he makes a decision is based on information he gathered from his precognition ability that is impossible to be conveyed to others, his words and deeds are illogical, and getting an understanding of him is truly unattainable. But apart from his consistent sense of purpose, how he makes propositions to bring a state of confusion under control during its early stages is always unshakable, and if he broadly looks at a situation and calculates backwards from its outcome, he will only achieve good results where his deeds would quickly shift the future situation away. Regarding his moral values however, without completely loosening his common sense of humans, he himself doesn\u2019t hesitate to sacrifice or lose when instructed; this behavior is without a doubt describing a form of insanity. Xiang Yu is an advanced complex thinking machine that\u2019s equipped with an active mind and can invoke feelings, though it is out of sync with the standards of humanity. He proceeds to reward and punish the \u300Esense of accomplishment\u300F within himself by being delighted when he fulfills his goals, and mourns for unintentional losses, which is ideal in his way---a stable state that resolved disorder, in other words, a moment of peace----he\u2019d personally feel \u300Erelief\u300Fand\u300Egreat joy\u300F when achieving such things. If Xiang Yu were to understand emotion, it\u2019d be possible for him to establish communication.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He plans to achieve his goals himself, which is his primordial urge and which is also the driving force that\u2019s installed in Xiang Yu. In other words, to fulfill peace and tranquility. That supreme proposition is largely common with Chaldea\u2019s Master; without harboring any doubts nor wishing for any compensation, he assists in achieving the mission without having to choose any option that is available to him (though that\u2019s not the problem).</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300CIf that ambition will lead towards a peaceful world, then I will mobilize all of my functions. \u300D</p><p>\u300CMy calculations will guide us to certain victory.

In Pan-Human History, he destroyed the Qin Dynasty and competed with Liu Bang for the next Emperor. He was ridiculed as \u300Ca man with rash courage and with the benevolence of a woman\u300Dfor letting his own faction self-destruct with inconsistent policies, despite taking pride for many inhumane massacres and countless deeds of arms. Without learning the scholarly and martial arts in his early childhood, he only studied the gist of the art of war which made himself later widely known, distinguishing himself with only his wisdom.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Xiang Yu was handed down to others as a supreme ruler who was a fool and a rare genius. After all, his true character wasn\u2019t something that others could comprehend. He is an artificial human whose design is based on the ruins of Nezha that Shi Huang Di retrieved while searching for the immortal realms, and was stolen by Xiang Liang who gave him the name Xiang Ji, who then pretended to be his uncle. Xiang Yu was activated after the death of Shi Huang Di, who was his original owner, and Xiang Yu was separated from Xiang Liang, who died as soon as he became the new owner; he was immediately programmed with a sense of purpose based on his autonomous judgement------in other words, the intelligence machine that was in favor for the early realization of a \u300Cpeaceful world\u300D, but he came alive with a methodology that was deviated from morality. He destroyed and slaughtered with the intention of \u300Csimplifying and limiting\u300D the strategic map of China so that the next ruler of the country could quickly rise to power. From the people\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s as if it were the futile acts of the tyrant Demon King. But, as a result, the Chu-Han Contention, which was the chaotic period after the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, ended in 4 years, and Liu Bang went from being a chivalrous person from the countryside to becoming the founder of establishing the Han Dynasty in public. The death of Qin Shi Huang didn\u2019t occur in the Chinese Lostbelt; he was being used by the righteous Qin Shi Huang under the code name \u300CKuaiji Model Zero\u300D to assist the Qin Dynasty\u2019s hegemony. Especially, his precognition came from his high-speed calculation ability which makes the Kuaiji Model Zero to perform as an unparalleled weapon on the battlefield. He finally achieved his dearest wish as a standard-bearer and the founder of the SIN Army\u2019s mechanized army corps which is known as the Eternal SIN Empire. In addition, his ego, namely his machine life, has been released from having emotions, instinct and physical desire and with his precognition having a unique sense of time, Xiang Yu\u2019s thinking has become something that is far different from that of ordinary people. He is a wise person that takes a philosophical view, foreseeing everything as he usually drifts silently and calmly like a big tree, but the moment his future vision catches a \u300Csign of chaos\u300D, he\u2019ll change his goal setting from being on standby to destroying and exterminating. Xiang Yu doesn\u2019t hesitate to display his natural fighting capabilities and executing the designated target - targets that decided to disturb peace in the near future - with wildness like a storm that has changed from his usual silence. It\u2019d be impossible for a ordinary person to comprehend him since they can\u2019t perceive the future; therefore, Xiang Yu is classified as a Berserker as a Servant. The special environment called Chaldea; it\u2019s a place where many singularities come into contact and the fate of many Heroic Spirits intertwine which satisfy the conditions that largely inhibits Xiang Yu\u2019s precognitive ability, and ever since he came here, he\u2019s finally gained the perspective of \u201Cliving in the moment without being bound to the future,\u201D feeling a life of excitement and joy, and giving him a chance for a new experience.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Consort Yu / Yu Miaoyi</strong></p><p>His dear wife that solely supported him in his lifetime.
