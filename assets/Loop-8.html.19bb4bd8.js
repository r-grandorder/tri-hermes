It&#39;s not like there&#39;s something odd about taking a walk in the park.</p><p>Just something to pass the time. Aren&#39;t you here for a walk, too?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMe? I don&#39;t have that much free tim\u2015\u2015\u2015Ahh, that&#39;s right. You have lots of free time, eh?</p><p>Alright, then I have a job for you. Go see someone as a former archery club member.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRemember Saeda-san, third year?\u201D</p><p>\u201CKind of. A rather restless girl with a ponytail, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. She was suddenly hospitalized, and visiting her on behalf of the archery club ended up being my responsibility.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s the injury?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha. As usual, you only worry about somebody else&#39;s problems.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing serious, just acute intestine inflammation.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd so I need to get flowers, get-well gifts and stuff\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, the present captain Matou is busy with something, and so I volunteered as the former captain.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMm... huh?\u201D</p><p>The florist&#39;s storefront caught me by surprise.</p><p>...Before, it was filthy\u2015\u2015\u2015that would be kind of rude, but it certainly didn&#39;t feel very clean.</p><p>But now, it looks like a completely different store.</p><hr><p>\u201CWelcome.\u201D</p><p>Oh, the new clerk&#39;s coming, enthusiastic much?</p><p>A tall man in an apron suddenly emerges from the back\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201C....................................\u201D</p><p>He really looks like someone... that I... know...</p><hr><p>Haha, no way. That guy a florist? It&#39;s probably just a coincidence.</p><p>But he&#39;s actually looking at me with a smile\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201COh, it&#39;s you, kid. What&#39;s up?\u201D</p><p>...It&#39;s him, no doubt about it.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... Um, I mean, can I ask what you&#39;re doing?\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CCan&#39;t ya tell by just looking? Part time, it&#39;s a part time job. A youngster like you would know, it ain&#39;t that mysterious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFirst of all, the way that apron suits you is a mystery...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t say that. Can&#39;t knock on a stranger&#39;s door and expect their hospitality to include food and drink, not in this era. Gotta pay off at least the drinking allowance, ya know.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Is that right? Sounds like you have it rough, too.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. But still, there&#39;s a side benefit. This place is like a lure if I put some effort into it.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Whaddaya think,&quot; Lancer points to the storefront.</p><p>What&#39;s the side benefit?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Do you know him, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomeone I&#39;d rather not know as well as I do, actually.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm. You two seem rather close, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWelcome, miss. Are you looking for a flower?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, I need a bouquet for a hospital visit... Can I browse for something in my budget?\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri quickly puts up two fingers.</p><p>Nodding, Lancer starts picking out flowers skillfully.</p><p>...He really does act like an actual florist.</p><hr><p>\u201CFlowers for a hospital visit, you say. You look like a student of Homurabara. Was it a friend of yours that this misfortune has befallen?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Um, a fellow club member. The archery club, to be exact.\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-What...?!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGuh... in this day and age, when people have no sense of duty or honor, dedication to offer a flower to a fallen compatriot is something to be admired.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t quite get along with bow practitioners before, but sounds like you&#39;d be just fine!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>It seems that this man mistakenly sees the &quot;archery club&quot; as some combat group whose members watch each others&#39; backs in a bloody battle.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m moved. I mean, to tears. Passing away in the care of a woman like you must inspire him, too - it&#39;s more blessing than a warrior could ever hope for!\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, she isn&#39;t dying. What we want isn&#39;t a floral tribute... Ahh, what the heck are you making!?\u201D</p><p>I stop him as Lancer swiftly picks out a burial flower collection.</p><p>...But to be honest, his bouquet did show a pretty good sense of style.</p><hr><p>\u201CA warrior... Do you happen to practice martial arts, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Well, more or less, be it swords, bows, or even tanks. Spears are my specialty, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSojutsu? The ancient martial art?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>&quot;What kind of ancient art is that supposed to be?&quot; his expression seems to ask.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Um, Mitsuzuri. I think, uh, you should leave it at that.</p><p>That aside, Lancer, mind making us a get-well bouquet instead?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that attitude, Emiya? Are you saying I shouldn&#39;t be interested in martial arts?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha, this fella had a lot happen, bet he&#39;s still holding a grudge. One persistent guy he is. You&#39;re alive now, how &#39;bout ya call it off?\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I have a dreadful hypothesis.</p><p>Lancer is the kind of guy that goes, &quot;It ain&#39;t no murder if no one found out&quot; after stabbing someone&#39;s heart.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya. I don&#39;t know what it is, but being a sore loser isn&#39;t nice. You may have given up the bow, but please don&#39;t lose the martial artist&#39;s spirit with it.</p><p>Sulking over something so trivial, what&#39;s with that.\u201D</p><p>Fool.</p><p>Brushing it off with a, &quot;you&#39;re alive, so what&#39;s the problem&quot; - this world ought to be one big coliseum with fountains of blood and gore.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut you know, I&#39;ve never met a spearman before. Actually, I practice with a naginata myself...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, now that you mention it, isn&#39;t that your specialty?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. It has a strong reputation as a kind of martial art suited for weak girls, so it&#39;s not very popular with guys.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh. Something like a halberd, basically... But, you know, there&#39;s no such thing as gender among warriors. It&#39;s only about whether you&#39;re fit for the job or not. And at any rate, my own spear...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, wait.

Too bad it&#39;s not well known in this land.\u201D</p><p>Not a single petal fell in the flower-filled shop, and nothing but the desired flowers were plucked out.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Strange stuff, wow... I mean, it sure is an unusual technique.\u201D</p><p>An unusual guy whipping out a spear to cut some flowers, more like it.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, young lady, perhaps you and me could be Spear Brothers?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, n-not at all! A skill this magnificent, someone like me could not stand to compare.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNah, more so than skill, the utter lack of common sense needed to wave about a spear inside a flower shop...\u201D</p><p>Huh? Not you, too, Mitsuzuri?</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, where did you happen to study spearmanship? I&#39;d definitely be... ah, happy if you could spare some time to tell me about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have as many old stories to tell as there are flowers here, if not more\u2015\u2015\u2015 Right, all done.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><p>Lancer hands over the finished bouquet.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s soft and tender... as if expressing its creator&#39;s feelings. And with such an amazing skill of his...\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri keeps admiring the bouquet.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm, it really is great.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFlowers look their best especially in the hands of a beautiful martial artist. What a sight for sore eyes.\u201D</p><p>Lancer laughs as he brushes off his apron.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat ain&#39;t flattery. Just the truth.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAha... But, you know, it&#39;s all fine with me.\u201D</p><hr><p>Mitsuzuri smiles happily.</p><p>I&#39;ve known her since she came to Homurabara, and this is the first time I see her act girl-like.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, this one&#39;s on me.\u201D</p><p>He gives surprised Mitsuzuri one more flower.</p><p>\u201CUm, this is?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor you, who remembers her comrades in arms\u2015\u2015\u2015amber color, wonder if I guessed right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, um, it&#39;s really not... I was just a little surprised.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhich reminds me, I didn&#39;t ask your name. I&#39;m... well, just call me Lancer.

So you came here to pick some...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, I just went out to have lunch, and it was more for you than the flowers, Ayako.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat does your lunch have to do with me!?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Time for another of Rider&#39;s bad habits to show up.</p><p>Seems that she took a liking to Mitsuzuri, and is now closing in as if already on a date.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll I want is a NORMAL love!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat!?</p><p>Hey, miss!

I did promise, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike the current state of affairs and stuff?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, she did say to let her know if something were to happen.</p><p>I&#39;ll write it myself.

Can&#39;t think of anything right away.</p><p>How about I give you my comments later?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSure.</p><p>I&#39;ll be writing it after dinner, once I think it over. You can come to my room around then.\u201D</p><hr><p>A promise to deliver a message to a distant foreign land, just like that.</p><p>Leaving Tohsaka&#39;s room to Sakura, I&#39;m off to the neighboring guest room. Turning towards the hallway,</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>I notice her looking around the room with distant longing in her eyes.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ah. I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. This room has a nostalgic atmosphere about it, and I got lost in my thoughts for a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I see. Still remember the past?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, almost none of it.</p><p>Seems like I had a room of my own, but it&#39;s gone now as well.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She picks up a picture frame from the table.</p><hr><p>\u201CI do remember the events around this time quite well, actually.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTohsaka gave you that hair slide, didn&#39;t she?\u201D</p><p>I heard that the ribbon Sakura clips to her hair was actually given to her by Tohsaka, a long time ago.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt was my favorite ribbon, made by Nee-san herself.</p><p>Hair and hair slides are female magus&#39; final trump cards, so she made me a special one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd then gave it to you when you were separated.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Nee-san tied my hair, too.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>So Tohsaka at least gave her sister, whom she would never see again, a precious parting gift\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201C...That Tohsaka, she&#39;s never this nice in daily life, and yet...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd then, she charged me a reasonable 3-carat emerald, at 3% annual rate, interest paid in installments, &quot;bonus&quot; payment possible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally now, a loan shark at that age... wait, whaaaat!!!?\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka, you were a scrooge even at that age!</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, thinking as a child.</p><p>With an interest rate of 3%, compounded annually, wouldn&#39;t that make it a 4 or 5-carat emerald after 15 years? And when she says &quot;installments,&quot; does she mean 12 times a year, 24 times a year? What about early repayment? Can I substitute with a diamond\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHold on, how did this degrade to a discussion about loans!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Nee-san was always like that, actually.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Tohsaka, you. How mean. Guess I&#39;ve experienced but a tenth of her dreadful potential myself\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe. By the way, Senpai, that&#39;s not really it.\u201D</p><p>Despite all the hardships of life, Sakura&#39;s smile was as cheerful as ever.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou see...</p><p>She gave out a lot of loans to people close to her.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWere she to forgive this one, wouldn&#39;t there still be others?</p><p>Nee-san didn&#39;t like that.</p><p>Since I was important to her, she kindly gave me a large loan.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s what I was thinking when she told me with a deadly serious face, &quot;You will definitely pay it back, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>Ah, it&#39;s a big loan that&#39;s too much for me to repay, Nee-san will remember me forever.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo that&#39;s why she keeps lending you money, too, I think.\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-So that&#39;s how it was... And I thought that it was just shameful, bothering her with requests for money all the time...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, but on the other hand, lending her money is even more impressive, actually?</p><p>If you don&#39;t get her to sign something like an IOU, she won&#39;t fully honor it later.\u201D</p><hr><p>I have a feeling you&#39;d need more like a notarized document or a court order... you&#39;re dealing with Tohsaka here.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ve got to keep learning, and, just once, &quot;I&#39;ve made a loan to Nee-san!&quot;</p><p>I so want to say that.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Probably will, at this rate. Keep this conversation a secret from Tohsaka, okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight, she&#39;d definitely get mad if she knew.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Haha,&quot; we share a bit of a laugh.</p><p>I have a feeling I&#39;ve come to understand one of Tohsaka&#39;s more complex sides a bit more now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><hr><p>\u300ASakura, there&#39;s something I want to ask you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300B</p><p>\u201CAh... That&#39;s right, there&#39;s still cleaning to do!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh crap, at this rate, the sun will set before we&#39;re done...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlright, let&#39;s make this extra efficient, Senpai!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Anfang Mittelstand.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Did it work? Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, well done.\u201D</p><p>And thus the Tohsaka household cleaning comes to an end.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood work, everyone!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe three of you were a great help, I&#39;m much obliged.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, it&#39;s nothing. You, too, Shirou, good work today.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. After all, you ended up helping everyone anyway.\u201D</p><hr><p>We leave the now empty Tohsaka residence behind us.</p><p>Who knows when its master will come back. But until then, keeping it sparkling clean is our job.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-2-plushie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-2-plushie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 2 Plushie</h3><hr><p>\u201CHey, Saber... eh, not here?\u201D</p><p>Strange... I followed Saber all the way here from the living room. She should be there.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmmm...?\u201D</p><p>As I hold my chin to think, I think I hear sounds coming from inside...?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015hehehe.\u201D*</p><p>Giggles can be heard from across the screen door.</p><p>\u201CHey, so you are here. I&#39;m coming in Saber, say something if you don&#39;t want me to.\u201D</p><hr><p>Having warned her, I slide the door open. As I thought, she was there all along.</p><p>With her back stretched and expressions several times more gentle than normal, Saber is holding the plushie I bought for her a while back.</p><p>It seems like Saber didn&#39;t notice me entering. She&#39;s still smiling at the plushie.</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>Looks like she still hasn&#39;t noticed me. As I call out to her the second time, an expression of pure shock appears on her face, and she begins to panic.</p><hr><p>For reasons not known to me, Saber hurriedly searches for something around her. She then stuffs the plushie under the sheets beside her, and, taking a deep breath, finally faces towards me.</p><p>By now, she has returned to the regular Saber.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes? Do you need anything, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAhh... Nothing... Umm\u2015\u2015\u2015About that... What were you doing just now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing, nothing in particular.\u201D</p><hr><p>Answering right away.</p><p>No, it really didn&#39;t look like nothing, and on top of that, didn&#39;t she just hide the plushie?</p><p>\u201CBut...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut what, Shirou. Are you saying you saw something?\u201D</p><p>Unable to calm down, her eyes are asking &quot;You didn&#39;t see anything strange just now, did you?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>...Alright then.</p><p>If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m going to tease her, just a little bit.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, didn&#39;t see anything. Like Saber smiling at the plushie, playing with the plushie, or talking to it as if it was a little kid and whatnot.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Wha...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, it&#39;s okay. I won&#39;t tell everyone about Saber sleeping with the plushie, either.\u201D</p><p>Of course, I&#39;ve never seen her doing that. But it seems like it hit the mark.</p><p>Did I push it too much? I&#39;ll go on just a bit farther.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, it&#39;s nothing, there&#39;s nothing strange about people speaking to dolls or plushies. It&#39;s proof of one&#39;s kind nature. I can sympathize with your child-like behavior.</p><p>Even normal adults collect dolls, take care of them and so on, although it can&#39;t really be said to be a high class hobby... W-What...?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015For some unknown reason, wind started to blow from within the room.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s a faint smile on Saber&#39;s face.</p><p>The wind seems to be coming from the direction where Saber is standing.</p><p>\u201C...S-Saber?\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-airmail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBnight-map-airmail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBNight Map Airmail</h3><hr><p>...Speaking of that, she did mention something about sending a letter to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u201CAre you there, Sakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai? Sure, come on in.\u201D</p><p>She answers as if not lifting her head up from something.</p><p>\u201CExcuse me.\u201D</p><p>It looks like she&#39;s in the middle of writing a paper.</p><p>There is a somewhat large piece of paper on the desk.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs I thought... You&#39;re writing that letter you were talking about, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I figured I&#39;d make a report on the current state of affairs for Nee-san. Just hold on a minute, I&#39;ll be done soon.\u201D</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is currently in London.</p><p>She&#39;s not exactly available on a moment&#39;s notice, so an opportunity to send a letter like this must not be wasted.</p><p>...This would have been much easier with email, but Tohsaka stubbornly refuses to do anything with computers.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Say, shouldn&#39;t Tohsaka be coming back before long?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot in a few days, I think. She said that October looks dubious, and that she&#39;ll definitely let us know when she&#39;s about to leave.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. I guess the chances of her coming back before the 11th are pretty low.\u201D</p><hr><p>Things aren&#39;t going well. If only Tohsaka were here, we&#39;d be able to find the missing piece in this puzzle... or if not, at least the clues leading to it.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeh. What, you really want Nee-san to come back this much?\u201D</p><p>So.</p><p>Looking somewhat delighted, Sakura asks.</p><hr><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s not really it.</p><p>We can actually have some peace while she&#39;s gone. I-I don&#39;t really object to that, even though she&#39;s been away a lot this year.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHoho. So it&#39;s okay this year, but you won&#39;t endure it next year. Isn&#39;t that how you actually feel, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Guh.\u201D</p><p>In short, Sakura is getting more difficult to deal with, day by day.</p><p>Even without the older sister around, the younger one is becoming a pretty strong lady. With an environment this unique, experience must be just piling up.</p><p>...And now if Tohsaka comes back cranky... I wonder what&#39;s going to happen.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, if Tohsaka comes back, there&#39;ll be neither rest nor quiet, let&#39;s leave it at that. On a serious note, I want to ask you something.</p><p>Could you just write &quot;We need to talk&quot; in the margin of the letter?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, just that and nothing else? Nee-san might overlook it if you don&#39;t put some love into it, you know?</p><p>Or if it doesn&#39;t sound urgent enough, it&#39;s not impossible for her to just ignore it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Can&#39;t argue with that, she definitely could.</p><p>Alright, since this is relatively minor, just tell her to call when she gets a chance. That we need help with something... No, wait, she&#39;s too busy for that to work. I&#39;m sure she has her own problems to deal with, and I wouldn&#39;t want to be a nuisance...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Yeah, I guess so. And even if she could come, I think there&#39;s a good chance it might just make things even worse. She&#39;s doing whatever she wants in London, and she won&#39;t restrain herself here. Yeah, let&#39;s not do that.\u201D</p><hr><p>That was close.</p><p>You never know what kind of debt you might be getting yourself into when asking Tohsaka for help.</p><p>Being forced into servitude at her residence for a year is not unlikely.</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai? Is that all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015um, the first one should be fine. Just ask her to call. If she doesn&#39;t see it, that&#39;s fine. We don&#39;t need her lousy help, we can do this ourselves.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C&quot;...ourselves.&quot; Right.</p><p>Okay, got that down. Well, I&#39;m sending this off to Nee-san first thing tomorrow!\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s hands shift into high gear, putting the letter in the envelope and using a cute seal on it.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm?\u201D</p><p>I was getting some evil vibes from Sakura&#39;s motion just now... but I guess that&#39;s just me.</p><p>\u201CAlright, please do.\u201D</p><p>\u201COkay.

The club&#39;s team spirit... or rather, Matou&#39;s self-confidence.</p><p>Matou has become a great archery club captain, but as a festival leader, she totally lacks any kind of experience...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m ashamed to admit it... but the only times I remember everyone being noisy together were at Senpai&#39;s house...\u201D</p><p>Sakura looks on dejectedly.</p><p>...She&#39;s never run wild before... er, pot, meet kettle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeahhhh,&quot; the three of us are lost deep in thought.</p><p>The silence is broken up only by the painful ticking of the clock.</p><p>\u201CWell, if you have a good idea in mind, please tell us, Emiya.</p><p>We still have time.\u201D</p><p>And so the morning concludes with a dark atmosphere.</p><p>Overcoming Sakura&#39;s weakness... Hmm...</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-3-iron-and-the-second-button" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-3-iron-and-the-second-button" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 3 Iron and the second button</h3><p>--</p><p>\u201CHuh...?\u201D</p><p>The clothes hanger that usually has my set of school uniform on it is missing the upper half.</p><p>\u201CDry cleaning...? No, I definitely didn&#39;t.\u201D</p><p>I should probably solve this here and now.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm...\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s not here, either\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>But then, it&#39;s not like I have a habit of tossing it aside at the entranceway, either.</p><p>And if it did end up here, Sakura would probably have hung it up for me.</p><p>\u201CRight... I should ask her.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSaku\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Huh? The door&#39;s half open.</p><p>That&#39;s not what I came here for, but, on a sudden impulse, I take a peek inside\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C.....................\u201D</p><p>...My cheeks start burning.</p><p>Holding my jacket as if it was the most precious thing in the world, she&#39;s hugging it to her chest.</p><p>\u201CSakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-Senpai?!\u201D</p><p>The scream of a herbivore that just had its escape route cut off rings out from inside.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I slowly open the door. Sakura, her face crimson red, jumps back on the bed.</p><p>Er, I don&#39;t think you need to run that far...</p><hr><p>\u201CYou look like you&#39;ve just seen a cockroach or something.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I was just a little surprised\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, ahaha.\u201D</p><hr><p>She&#39;s squeezing every bit of laughter that she can out of herself.</p><p>I can sympathize. Had I been in her shoes, I might have run out all the way to the storehouse and locked the door behind me.</p><p>...Well, anyway...</p><p>\u201CAh, about my jacket... Have you, by chance...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CY-Yes. I was repairing the button that fell off.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Right.</p><p>I&#39;ve put the front button that came off into my pocket, thinking that I&#39;d fix it later, but then forgot all about it...</p><hr><p>\u201CWow... you actually noticed that?\u201D</p><p>Unlike on a gakuran with gold buttons, Homurabara&#39;s uniform has them hidden inside, and it&#39;s pretty hard to tell. I&#39;m impressed.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. I caught a glimpse of your shirt peeking out from underneath on Friday.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat much... even I had forgotten about it.\u201D</p><p>Sakura&#39;s still as amazingly perceptive as ever.</p><p>\u201CThanks. I really appreciate it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Senpai, wait.\u201D</p><p>She quickly snatches the jacket out of my hands.</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll put it back in your room after I iron it properly. How about I do the trousers, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWow... really? Would you...?\u201D</p><hr><p>I can do nothing but bow my head.</p><p>\u201CAlright, then I&#39;ll bring the bottom part later.</p><p>But isn&#39;t it too much for you to do laundry as well as the ironing?\u201D</p><hr><p>She just tilts her head in question.</p><p>Seriously? Ironing stuff like dress shirts brings the term &quot;pain in the butt&quot; to a whole new level.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm, really? But there&#39;s still Saber-san&#39;s, as well as Nee-san&#39;s. Yours shouldn&#39;t take too long.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, now that you mention it\u2015\u2015\u2015men&#39;s clothes do take less time.\u201D</p><hr><p>For a number of reasons, I&#39;m excused from the laundry chores. With a female camp this strong, not at all surprising.</p><p>...In fact, just going into the change room requires utmost care.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, Sakura. If it starts to pile up, make sure to ask Saber or Rider for help.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, Rider&#39;s already helping me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen I guess Saber needs to pick up the slack.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShe surely is very meticulous. She might even get into it.\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t help but imagine Saber poring over every wrinkle with the iron in one hand.</p><hr><p>\u201CShould we really let her?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe wants to help out, too... Ah, would you mind if I taught her myself?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease do it as gently as possible.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf I tell her that Rider can do it, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll learn just to not be left behind.\u201D</p><p>Ahaha, the atmosphere lightens up.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll go bring the trousers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight\u2015\u2015\u2015Um, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>Sakura stops me with the jacket still on her lap.</p><p>With a slight blush on her cheeks\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai... you&#39;re already graduating in March, aren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah.\u201D</p><p>\u201CD-Did... did you already decide who you&#39;ll be giving the second button to at the ceremony?\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Turns out our school has the custom, too.</p><p>Seeing how it is still a ways off, I haven&#39;t even thought about it.</p><p>\u201C...I haven&#39;t.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ha, haaa, that&#39;s good.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s not really anyone other than you.\u201D</p><p>If you really want it, that is.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, um, I don&#39;t really deserve it!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t say that. I&#39;m already in your debt, even just now with the uniform and all.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s, um... N-Never mind, it just crossed my mind! Right! I&#39;ll get the iron set up, so the rest is up to you, Senpai!\u201D</p><hr><p>She promptly shoos me out of her room.</p><p>...Looks like I&#39;m not supposed to pry any further.</p><p>I guess I&#39;ll go back to my room and get my pants, then\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBstreets-at-night-battle-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBStreets at night (battle)</h3><h3 id="night\u30FBpeace-and-quiet-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBpeace-and-quiet-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBPeace and quiet (II)</h3><hr><p>We go down the opposite side of the residential district from the Emiya household.</p><p>From the entrance of the neighborhood to the hill that Tohsaka&#39;s house is on, there was nothing out of place.</p><hr><p>\u201CI know it&#39;s out of the blue, but what do you think of the difference between Rin&#39;s and Sakura&#39;s houses, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow that you ask, I haven&#39;t really thought about it.</p><p>Why, all of a sudden? Did you notice something strange?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh? N-No, this has nothing to do with the patrol. It&#39;s just something I have wondered about before, but it is difficult to ask in front of the people involved.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDifficult to ask, eh? Something to do with magic?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Nothing like that, not really.</p><p>You see, Sakura&#39;s house is, in every respect, larger. However, Rin is the supervisor of this land.</p><p>I just don&#39;t think that the lord having a smaller estate than the vassal matches up.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s not one to worry about money. Rather, she&#39;s the type that I would prefer to be more fussy about money.</p><p>But I think this is more the case of a &quot;former king&quot; having a particularly strict evaluation criteria for her colleagues.</p><p>The person that governs a piece of land must have an appropriately furnished estate, is the way a member of royalty would think.</p><p>Moving on.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo I&#39;m wondering... I can see that Rin doesn&#39;t want to take advantage of her status, but this is also a matter of a lord&#39;s duty. Before it gives rise to unnecessary quarreling, shall I advise her to either expand the Tohsaka household or, perhaps, annex the Matou residence instead?\u201D</p><p>An advice like that may well end up with a sisters&#39; quarrel that will leave the whole Fuyuki in ruins.</p><p>The scary thing is, Tohsaka would probably agree with Saber&#39;s point.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease don&#39;t. Besides, this lord rules from the shadows, no?</p><p>It would be bad if she stood out too much, so I think she tries to live modestly.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm... now that you say it, that does seem to be the case.</p><p>Rin&#39;s choice of modest lifestyle must be to hide her position as the head of the Tohsaka family.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYep, that&#39;s right. So don&#39;t you tell her, &quot;Rin, you sure manage to live in poverty,&quot; or anything of the sort, as the damage will be done to me instead.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. Then, as Rin&#39;s friends, let&#39;s pretend not to notice her efforts.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka is blessed to have such an understanding ally.</p><p>Of course, she understands the wrong thing, but it&#39;s all fine as long as the result is the same.</p><hr><p>\u201COn that note, how about we go back? There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything unusual here.\u201D</p><p>After a long detour, the moon marches on.</p><p>Before it gets straight overhead, let&#39;s do what needs to be done.</p><hr><h3 id="night\u30FBreturn-of-the-wise-man-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#night\u30FBreturn-of-the-wise-man-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Night\u30FBReturn of the wise man</h3><h2 id="day-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 4</h2><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-4-the-secret-to-finger-pressure-massage-is-devotion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-4-the-secret-to-finger-pressure-massage-is-devotion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 4 The secret to finger pressure massage is devotion.</h3><hr><p>\u201COo\uFF5E\uFF5Eh.

Fujimura-sensei was feeling tired, so I&#39;m giving her a shoulder massage.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura-chan is such a gentle girl, and so attentive. I really wish I had this younger sister\uFF5E\u201D</p><p>...It must feel quite good, and it shows.</p><p>The stripes on her shirt are loosening up, and at this rate, she&#39;ll be like butter soon.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that right? A bumbling sister like me...\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut, with a selfish little brother like Shirou, I&#39;d never get a shoulder massage.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s mistaking the facts, Fuji-Nee.</p><p>You forgot what you&#39;ve done to me before.</p><p>\u201CBack in the day, you used to get massaged to oblivion, no?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Did I really?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure did. My massage technique was honed on your shoulders.\u201D</p><p>Oddly enough, when I tried the same on Kiritsugu, he didn&#39;t like it. Maybe he didn&#39;t have a stiff constitution.</p><p>So, I ended up having to struggle to the death with Fuji-Nee&#39;s stiff shoulders.</p><hr><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei got a shoulder massage from Senpai, too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow that Shirou got some strength, he could make it feel good and sort out all the stiffness in a snap, too... I am so sad.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Is that right?&quot; Sakura nods.</p><p>...Geez, I didn&#39;t grow up just to be able to massage Fuji-Nee&#39;s shoulders.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo it was... that&#39;s great.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I didn&#39;t like doing it, but having started, I took my job seriously.\u201D</p><p>Once the procedure got going, I didn&#39;t slack off until Fuji-Nee told me she was fine.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t just be lazy and get out by saying I was tired midway through.</p><hr><p>\u201CSee, that&#39;s the way he is. When was the last time you were kind enough for a massage, I wonder?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Don&#39;t remember.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course, it&#39;s not like I could just ask any guy for it, and it&#39;s been so stiff lately.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, really? Ah, here&#39;s a stiff spot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhh, right there. Wheoow, ahhhh.\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee gradually loosens up.</p><p>...Though it&#39;s nothing like that, somehow, the scene itself just looks lewd.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou really are fatigued, Fujimura-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis job can really tire you out. May not look like it, but I&#39;m being a good teacher, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFujimura-sensei is a good teacher all the time.</p><p>And I&#39;m glad to help a teacher like her, too.\u201D</p><p>Sakura keeps massaging with glee.</p><hr><p>\u201CMm, and besides, your technique is great, Sakura-chan.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, not at all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNya, I hereby declare, feelings this good are not fit for a maiden.\u201D</p><p>What&#39;s with the embarrassing lingo?</p><hr><p>\u201CEhehehe.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...F-Fujimura-sensei?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI get it, you massage Shirou all the time, don&#39;t you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015S-Stupid tiger, what are you implying!?</p><p>That Sakura would, for me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, n-no, of course not!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was right, wasn&#39;t I?

Oh, sorry.</p><p>I was putting just a little too much strength into it.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s what she says.

Shall we keep going, Sensei?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, but I think it worked. Foot massages and whatnot don&#39;t hurt, and so they don&#39;t work, you know?\u201D</p><p>Moving her head side to side with a creak, she stands up.</p><hr><p>\u201CMm, thanks, Sakura-chan.
