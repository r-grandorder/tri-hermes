What should I start with?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you get one big plate and four small ones? The salad&#39;s done, so you can serve it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. Wow, we&#39;re having German potato salad this morning?</p><p>You&#39;re elaborate this morning, cooking Western food.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura is surprised, but she scoops out the salad onto the big plate.</p><p>The salad is the only Western food I made.</p><p>...You have to understand, I&#39;m not giving in to Saber.

And it might be sweet, too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Sakura picks up a piece of potato with the cooking chopsticks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... Oh, it really is sweet. That&#39;s not... onion, is it?&quot;</p><p>Licking her lips, Sakura tries to figure out the ingredients.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her gesture surprises me.</p><p>I should be used to seeing Sakura sample my food, but when she&#39;s so close, I can&#39;t take my eyes off her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow, this is really good, Senpai!

What is it, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s the same as always.</p><p>She&#39;s no different from yesterday.</p><p>It should not concern Sakura even if Shinji was a Master or even if her family is a family of magi.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no way Sakura would be involved in the conflict.</p><p>There&#39;s no way, but...</p><p>&quot;Sakura. Let me see your right cheek.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s a bruise on her right cheek, as if she&#39;s been punched.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... it&#39;s not what you think, Senpai.

I told him never to hit his sister again, but he couldn&#39;t keep such a simple promise...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, Senpai. You&#39;ve got it all wrong. I just fell, really. I fell when Nii-san bumped into me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s all that happened, Senpai.</p><p>...Please don&#39;t concern yourself with Nii-san right now.</p><p>He&#39;s been acting weird since last night.

I&#39;ll go with you, Saitama.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll pass. I ate some meat yesterday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll pass as well... Please give it up already, guys. We&#39;re tired of the food there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What!? The B meal at our cafeteria is the best! The croquette tastes just like meat!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that might be enough for you, but I don&#39;t like how the vegetables taste like meat as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What about you, Emiya? The amount of people who go to the cafeteria depends on if you brought your lunch or not. Make some lunch for me sometime, will you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, that&#39;s no fair! Come over here, Emiya-kun. Let&#39;s trade your stuff for our sandwiches.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, you only got that at the convenience store! You&#39;re a girl and you didn&#39;t put effort into cooking!? You don&#39;t deserve our lunches! You have to make omelets if you want some of our good food!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, that&#39;s rude! I can make an omelet. You just pour water on it and heat it up. Isn&#39;t that right, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p>You guys have it all wrong. And I didn&#39;t bring my lunch today. I won&#39;t have time to make lunch, so I&#39;ll be eating at the cafeteria until finals.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Whaaaaaaaat!!?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><hr><p>The people that didn&#39;t bring their lunch all pout in unison.</p><p>My classmates are in harmony only at times like these.</p><hr><p>The guys come back, arguing if fried shrimp that tastes like meat is a good thing or a bad thing.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s almost fifth period. I should sit down and get ready\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...What is this?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I find a strange piece of paper in my desk.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m at a loss for words.</p><p>She must have disguised her handwriting, just in case.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>...It has to be her.</p><p>She&#39;s the only one that would know about &quot;this morning&quot;.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I want to pretend I didn&#39;t see this letter, but the last line really catches my attention.</p><hr><p>&quot;...She must know I can see the words she scribbled out... Or maybe not.&quot;</p><p>...I really don&#39;t want to, but it&#39;s great to have a chance to talk to her.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to do about Sakura, so I&#39;ll consult Tohsaka about it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>With the end of sixth period, school is over.</p><p>It&#39;s time.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what Tohsaka intends to do, but there are students staying in the building.</p><p>The archery club should be practicing until five, so I can take cover there if something happens.</p><p>Tohsaka is a legitimate magus, so she shouldn&#39;t attack me in front of people.</p><hr><p>Miyama City is located in a valley between mountains.</p><p>There are hills all over town, and there are roads that lead up to small mountains.</p><hr><p>And this school is on one of them.</p><p>The back of the school isn&#39;t landscaped at all.</p><p>Instead, it is woodland that stretches across the back of the school.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>In this place, where even the athletic clubs never enter...</p><p>...A furious demon awaits me.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea. I ought to go home.</p><p>But I&#39;ll be killed for sure if I turn my back to her.</p><p>I bet she&#39;ll mercilessly shower me with her magecraft.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, I&#39;m here, Tohsaka. What&#39;s up?&quot;</p><p>I call out to her from the edge of the woods.</p><p>I really can&#39;t go in any further.</p><p>There would be less chance of survival if I did go into the woods.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka\u2015! Do you not hear me!?&quot;</p><p>I yell out to her.</p><p>My voice echoes through the woods.</p><hr><p>&quot;I hear you! Don&#39;t shout</p><hr><p>my name so loudly!!&quot;</p><p>Her voice comes ringing back.</p><p>She yells at me after she rushes in at me.</p><p>Her voice echoes even longer than mine.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow, that&#39;s amazing, Tohsaka. I bet they heard you in the archery range.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh... Crap, you got me carried away again.&quot;</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Tohsaka backs up a step.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh. It&#39;s fine, this is expected. I knew you would show up defenseless.&quot;</p><p>So...</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the deal is, but she seems to be getting angrier as we talk.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What are you so mad about? Was it that embarrassing to scream out like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I-I wouldn&#39;t get mad about something as trivial as that.</p><p>What&#39;s irritating me is your harmfulness that&#39;s taken as harmless.&quot;</p><hr><p>She glares at me.</p><p>I guess I should be nervous about being alone with her, but because of where we are, I don&#39;t panic.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What do you mean by that? Are you saying I&#39;m a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s just imitation. You may be a sheep, but you are so mutated you could kill a wolf.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...???&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m even more confused.</p><p>Actually... isn&#39;t a mutated sheep not a sheep anymore?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh well. We don&#39;t have time to waste on chatter. Let&#39;s get to the point. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t run away, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. I can&#39;t ignore such threats. Those words themselves even felt cursed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Then...</p><p>Tohsaka freezes once again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wait, what do you mean by threats?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s this.&quot;</p><p>I show her the piece of paper that was in my desk.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez, don&#39;t scare me like that. I thought someone other than me lured you out here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re really hasty. It&#39;s true that I was irritated, but I won&#39;t curse a memo. That&#39;s just a normal message\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>...Hey, why are you frowning like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>My expression is only natural.</p><p>Tohsaka honestly thinks that it&#39;s an ordinary memo.</p><p>Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter what she thinks of it, but the image in my head of Tohsaka Rin crumbles to dust.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Uh... Could it be that I unconsciously cursed it with my Gandr...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? No, the letter itself was normal. But this is a threat, no matter how you look at it. Any other student would&#39;ve told the teacher right away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I couldn&#39;t help it. I didn&#39;t have time, and it&#39;s not like I could write you a formal letter. So that&#39;s all I could do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. ...But you didn&#39;t have to change your handwriting. And the last line was really scary.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s your fault as well.</p><p>You ran away this morning, so I thought I had to write something extra to make you come here. I was being considerate when I put some emotion into it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh, fine. I don&#39;t care if you think it&#39;s a threat. You&#39;re here, and that&#39;s what matters.&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks away angrily.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m glad Tohsaka knew that the memo sounded like a threat.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Fine. So, what do you want, Tohsaka? Calling me out to a place like this... do you want to fight me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you want. But don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not attacking you because Archer is healing his wounds. I would&#39;ve taken your Command Spell this morning if he wasn&#39;t wounded.</p><p>...I really wanted to when I saw you walking around this morning, after I&#39;ve told you so many times not to act carelessly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m stunned.</p><p>So, Tohsaka is angry about...</p><p>&quot;...? So you were worried about me, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t know why, but is that the case?</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not true! I wanted to talk to you because I was concerned about what happened this morning.</p><p>You were about to say something, right? I was worried, so I decided to hear you out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m even more surprised.</p><p>I never thought Tohsaka would insist that I consult her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why are you so quiet? ...It&#39;s all right, I won&#39;t force it out of you if you don&#39;t want to talk about it. I&#39;m not angry now, so I&#39;ll go home if you have nothing to say.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015hold on, Tohsaka.</p><p>I do have something I want to ask you. No, I really do need to consult you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then tell me. I can keep any secret, and I&#39;ll help you if I can.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, thanks.</p><p>...Um, this has nothing to do with you, but there&#39;s this girl called Matou Sakura.</p><p>She&#39;s a year below me, and I&#39;ve known her for a long time. Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I&#39;ve known him for a long time as well.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Matou Shinji was a Master...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m sure of it because his grandfather, Matou Zouken, told us. I heard that the Matou family is a family of magi\u2015\u2015\u2015did you know about that, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. The only magus in this town that I didn&#39;t know about is you. But I never thought it was possible. Because Shinji is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s not a magus. He doesn&#39;t have a Magic Circuit, right? That&#39;s what Matou Zouken said.</p><p>...But that&#39;s a condition to be a magus.</p><p>I think the conditions for becoming a Master are different. I&#39;m like Shinji. You shouldn&#39;t assume that only magi can become Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So, what about Shinji? Did you defeat him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Saber defeated his Servant, Rider. His book, his Command Spell, burned up, so he isn&#39;t a Master anymore.</p><p>...But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s given up. That alone is dangerous, but on top of that, Sakura has to live with him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I heard from Zouken that magecraft only gets taught to the successor. Sakura was raised without being taught anything, so she doesn&#39;t know what Shinji is doing.</p><p>As long as she doesn&#39;t find out, she won&#39;t get involved in this war between the Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......You&#39;re right. So why do you think Sakura is in danger?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told you that Shinji is dangerous right now. He might take out his anger on Sakura, and who knows what&#39;ll happen if he does something even worse.</p><p>So, um...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So you want to end it before Shinji involves Sakura? Your idea is good, but it&#39;s not possible. Just look at the Ryuudou Temple. The other Masters are tricky. I think this Holy Grail War will last longer than expected.&quot;</p><p>\u300C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u300D</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>The best outcome would be for Shinji to give up, but that&#39;s not realistic.</p><p>The only option is to separate Sakura from Shinji\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Then there&#39;s only one possible solution. If you don&#39;t want to involve Sakura, you have to put her under your protection.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I thought about that, but I&#39;m a Master too.</p><p>It&#39;s too dangerous to have her at my place, and Shinji will never stand for it. Besides, I doubt she wants to stay at my house.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. You really are dense, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Never mind. Just go ahead and ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji and protecting her from other Masters are one and the same.</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t you choose the option that lets you do something? ...Um, if this Sakura person is someone important to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s words hit me hard.</p><p>It feels like she smacked me upside the head.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. You&#39;re absolutely right. I should ask her before I start worrying about what I think.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Thanks, Tohsaka. I&#39;ll try to convince Sakura once I get home... Hey, why are you quiet all of a sudden?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Nothing. I&#39;m quiet because this is nothing you have to thank me for.</p><p>But I owe you one now. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d tell me that Shinji was a Master.</p><p>I guess I have to show you one of my cards as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What? One of your cards...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have to give you information. The information that Shinji was a Master helps me out, so I&#39;ll give you some information I have as well.</p><p>You know about the people who have gone into comas around town, right?</p><p>That&#39;s a Servant&#39;s doing, and the Master is at the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!? Oh, you were saying something about the Ryuudou Temple earlier. ...Wait, that Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. They&#39;re cunning enemies, so watch out if you&#39;re planning on attacking them. They aren&#39;t taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.</p><p>Since they&#39;re getting stronger by the day, I want to beat them as soon as possible, but the wound Archer suffered hasn&#39;t healed yet.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...A Master is at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Tohsaka is doing her best as a Master, even though her Servant isn&#39;t fully healed yet.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s all.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Goodbye, Emiya-kun. You should go home quickly and comfort your precious underclassman.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka...!&quot;</p><p>I stop Tohsaka, but she ignores me and walks to the archery range.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...What was that?</p><p>Tohsaka was in a bad mood all this time, but something was different at the end there.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s time to leave... I certainly should go home quickly.&quot;</p><p>I hear the five o&#39;clock bell.</p><p>The sun will set soon.</p><p>I need to get home and deal with the Sakura issue.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-06-peace-treaty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06-peace-treaty" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06 Peace treaty?</h2><p>I hurry to my classroom.</p><p>It&#39;s three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-Nee isn&#39;t here yet.</p><p>Shinji&#39;s desk is empty.</p><p>It&#39;d hard to face him after what happened yesterday, but I wanted to settle things.</p><p>But I can&#39;t do anything if he&#39;s absent.</p><p>Going to Shinji&#39;s house will only provoke him, so I have to come up with a way that won&#39;t involve Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s another empty desk.</p><p>That&#39;s Issei&#39;s desk.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s rare. So even Issei can be absent, huh?&quot;</p><p>I set my bag down and prepare for homeroom.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry to keep you all waiting! Isn&#39;t this a new record!?&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee arriving before the bell rings is a rare spectacle indeed.</p><p>Heh.</p><p>I thought she&#39;d slept in since she didn&#39;t come to my house this morning, but she&#39;s even more energetic than usual.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The lunchtime bell rings.</p><p>I sprint out of the classroom, buy some bread and tea, and hurry up the stairs.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I dash to the rooftop, startling students as I go.</p><p>My heart&#39;s beating fast.</p><p>It&#39;s been pounding faster and faster the whole day.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Haa, haa, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>To be honest, I&#39;m nervous.</p><p>I&#39;m glad that I can consult her, but that hardly seems to matter now.</p><hr><p>I must&#39;ve been crazy to make arrangements with Tohsaka Rin.</p><p>She&#39;s the school idol, the perfect honor student, the girl I&#39;ve admired!</p><hr><p>&quot;Man, calm down, you idiot\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I try to catch my breath as I run up the stairs.</p><hr><p>...Anyway, this is a big event.</p><p>Tohsaka is Tohsaka even though she&#39;s a Master, so I can&#39;t be late.</p><p>And I&#39;m asking her a favor.</p><p>So I have to get there before her and act cool.</p><hr><p>But...</p><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re late, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><p>...It seems there&#39;s a line no ordinary person can cross.</p><hr><p>&quot;You want to talk to me about something, right? Let&#39;s sit down.&quot;</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, Tohsaka walks over to the water tower.</p><p>I see.</p><p>Nobody will see us there, and it&#39;ll block the wind.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, tell me what&#39;s on your mind. Who&#39;s this Sakura girl, and what happened yesterday?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015o-okay. It&#39;s a bit long, but do you mind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Try to make it short. Lunchtime isn&#39;t that long.&quot;</p><hr><p>...!</p><p>Having her this close is just making me more nervous.</p><p>But now&#39;s not the time.</p><p>I have to ask her about Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Then I&#39;ll try to make this simple.</p><p>Matou Sakura is my underclassman, and I&#39;ve known her for a long time.</p><p>Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I&#39;ve known him for a long time as well.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!?

Sakura trusts you, so have a little confidence in yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Did I tell you that Sakura comes over to make meals for us?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Y-You did!

Are you showing off, telling me that you would&#39;ve arrived at the same conclusion by yourself?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka smiles.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her smile attacks me by surprise.</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not what I meant. But wouldn&#39;t you have Sakura stay over if she was still depressed tomorrow?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, your face is all red. So you really can&#39;t lie, huh? You&#39;re acting cool, but you&#39;re actually innocent inside.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Who are you to say that!? Is it fun to make fun of people when you&#39;re supposed to be an honor student!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey now, I choose who I make fun of. I only make fun of people if it&#39;s worth doing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on. It&#39;s cold, so come closer and block the wind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!!!!! Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot, it&#39;ll be terrible if we get any closer!! I&#39;ll take you on if you&#39;re picking a fight with me, so get away from me, you devil!!!&quot;</p><p>I arc back and get my face away from Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!</p><p>T-This is bad.</p><p>Having her close was bad enough, but just now was fatal.</p><p>After getting to know Tohsaka, the person I admired became a dangerous associate.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s fine by itself, but that was too much.</p><p>When she gets this close to me, I can&#39;t ignore her beautiful hair, her soft-looking body, her pretty face...</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015My heart&#39;s pounding so hard that it feels like it&#39;s about to explode.</p><p>...I hate to admit it, but she is beautiful.</p><p>Her true nature is different than what I thought, but I still admire her.</p><hr><p>&quot;A-Anyway, thanks for your help. That&#39;s all I have to say.</p><p>I&#39;ll listen to you now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I don&#39;t have anything to talk about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Weren&#39;t you saying something this morning?</p><p>...Well, I wasn&#39;t listening because I was in a panic, but you looked like you were in a bad mood.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that. It&#39;s fine now. It&#39;s true that I had business with you, but I don&#39;t feel like it now. I&#39;m surprised, to be honest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...??? What do you mean, &#39;surprised&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I mean that part of you.</p><p>...Oh well. I&#39;ll tell you one good thing while we&#39;re at it.</p><p>You know about the people who&#39;ve been going into comas around town, right?</p><p>That&#39;s a Servant&#39;s doing, and the Master is at the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you were saying something about the Ryuudou Temple earlier.</p><p>...Wait, that Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. They&#39;re cunning enemies, so watch out if you&#39;re planning on attacking them. They aren&#39;t taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...A Master is at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Tohsaka is doing her best, even though Archer isn&#39;t fully healed yet.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, you owe me one, Emiya-kun.</p><p>I told you something you didn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p>The honor student smiles boldly.</p><p>I feel like a frog in front of a snake.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? I told you about Shinji too. That should make it even.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s been paid for with the advice about Sakura. Or what? You didn&#39;t mean those thanks you gave me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>S-She&#39;s a devil! She&#39;s a real devil! Don&#39;t let her fool you, everyone! The school&#39;s peace is in danger!</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, what should I take? Equivalent exchange is standard for magi.&quot;</p><p>Damn... I think my father said something like that as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmmmmmm.&quot;</p><p>I look down at my hands.</p><p>This is the only thing I have right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it now? You have no information to give me, so tell me Saber&#39;s true iden\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I guess I can&#39;t help it. You haven&#39;t eaten yet, right? I&#39;ll give you half of this.&quot;</p><p>I break my bread in half.</p><p>...Reluctantly, I give her the whole can of tea as a show of sincerity.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015wait, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Here, eat up. The cafeteria&#39;s closed by now. It should fill you up a bit.&quot;</p><p>I hand her the bread.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Does she not like it? She looks astonished, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Thanks. Then I won&#39;t hold myself back.&quot;</p><p>...And, she really eats the bread without holding back.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-07-the-daughter-of-winter-illya-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-07-the-daughter-of-winter-illya-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 07 The daughter of winter-Illya(I)</h2><p>School&#39;s over, and the commotion is dying down.</p><p>The students scatter to go to their clubs or head home.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right.

I just blurted it out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Tell me your name.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell me your name, Onii-chan.

Yeah, I like the name.</p><p>It&#39;s simple, but it sounds pretty.

Do you want to fight me right now...!?&quot;</p><p>I pull her off by force.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Oh.</p><p>Illya looks unhappy.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? Making a face like that won&#39;t do you any good. I don&#39;t know what your intentions are, but I&#39;m a Master. You can&#39;t defeat me that easily\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Groceries in hand, I glare at her.</p><p>...But she only looks back at me in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Um, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah!? What, Shirou!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><hr><p>She isn&#39;t like before.</p><p>...Well, she was laughing back then too, but her smile is different now. Could it really be\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><p>&quot;...Illya. You didn&#39;t come here to fight...?&quot;</p><p>I ask timidly.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Do you want to be killed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Her gaze sends a chill down my spine.</p><p>No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.</p><p>She laughs innocently, but she can also become a ruthless Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. I don&#39;t get it, but I don&#39;t mind you saying so, nor do I mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t kid around. No way! I don&#39;t want to die, and I don&#39;t want to fight you here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right? Masters can&#39;t fight during daytime. You don&#39;t have Saber with you, and I don&#39;t have Berserker with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. Then why did you come here? Did we meet up by chance?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not chance. I snuck out past Sella and specially came to see you. You better feel honored.&quot;</p><p>She puffs up with pride.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I feel dizzy.</p><p>Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.</p><p>I can&#39;t tell which is the real her.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. So you came to see me.</p><p>But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. I came to talk to you. I&#39;ve waited all this time, so I can, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what she means by &quot;all this time&quot;, but it seems Illya just came to talk with me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Or do you not want to talk with me? ...I&#39;ll go home if you don&#39;t want to. I really don&#39;t want to go home, but you&#39;ll hate me if I make you do something you don&#39;t want.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks me straight in the eye.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...As a Master, it&#39;s dangerous to spend any time with Illya. If Saber were here, I bet she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to make herself heard.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...But I can&#39;t leave her alone when she looks like that.</p><p>I know it&#39;s reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t mind talking with you. To be honest, I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right! Then let&#39;s go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Illya starts running.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, come on! I&#39;ll leave you behind if you don&#39;t hurry!&quot;</p><p>She twirls about as she runs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I guess it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>I accept this turn of events and follow after Illya.</p><p>She called me Shirou.</p><p>So I should treat her as a normal girl, and not a Master.</p><hr><p>There is no one in the park.</p><p>Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.</p><p>It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Illya.</p><hr><p>...This must look weird to other people.</p><p>Illya&#39;s a foreigner, so we don&#39;t look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So. What do you want to talk about, Illya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? I have nothing I want to ask you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Well.</p><p>How should I react to this incomprehensible girl?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya. You&#39;re the one who wanted to talk.</p><p>So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn&#39;t have come if you had no business with me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-Oh, really? We can&#39;t talk if we don&#39;t have business?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uhh... that&#39;s not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can still talk. Actually, I guess it&#39;s better to talk without purpose.</p><p>...But, man. I don&#39;t know you really well, so I don&#39;t know what I should talk about. I don&#39;t know what you like, or anything. You don&#39;t want me asking you about something you&#39;d rather not talk about, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You&#39;re right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won&#39;t get mad, whatever I ask you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll try. I&#39;m your Onii-chan, so I&#39;ll try to act mature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;WHA\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a liar! You said you won&#39;t get mad, but you&#39;re mad!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn&#39;t be asking that question when you&#39;ve already attacked me!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, that was different! It&#39;s because you jumped out even though you&#39;re weak! It&#39;s not my fault!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and everything!?&quot;</p><p>Illya quivers up and goes quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh.&quot;</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>I decided that I&#39;d forget about us being Masters, but I guess I didn&#39;t.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......It&#39;s important to me. You&#39;re an idiot, Shirou! If I hadn&#39;t stopped him you&#39;d be dead right now, but you still want to talk big.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks down, trembling.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Man.&quot;</p><p>I guess I have no choice.</p><p>I&#39;m the one who started this whole Master conversation, I&#39;m the older one here, and Illya is a girl.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ahem.

Did anything happen while I was gone, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I saw nothing unusual. How about you, Shirou? Did you find anything noteworthy at your school?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, me neither. Shinji was absent, but school was like always. I don&#39;t think we need to worry about anything happening there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>With Fuji-Nee sitting right there, I can&#39;t just come out and say &quot;there isn&#39;t a Master at my school.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm, I smell something.

You&#39;re the one who beat me up, saying you wanted to know how strong I am, Saber-chan!&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee pounds on the table.</p><hr><p>...It must have been a frightening, humiliating experience, since she&#39;s hiding behind me even as she glowers at Saber.</p><p>And I don&#39;t know when she started calling Saber Saber-chan.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. Did you have a match with Fuji-Nee?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um... I proposed that we move around if we had some free time.

If that is Shirou&#39;s command, I can only obey. I will never fight back.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmmmm?

I was going to let go halfway so you could break your fall, but you were heavier than I thought and I had my hands full with just throwing you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I&#39;m not a kid anymore. Don&#39;t try throwing me with those thin arms of yours. At worst, you would&#39;ve fallen with me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Sorry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re at fault too, Saber. You&#39;ll be sleeping in the room next to mine, so we&#39;re technically not in the same room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh... But I need to protect you, so...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You can protect me well enough from there. First of all, I&#39;ll wear out if you sleep in the same room as me. I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s the best compromise I can offer you. If you want more from me, you&#39;re going to have to fight for it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... This is a difficult matter.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine if you two understand. Well, I guess I&#39;ll go cook dinner.&quot;</p><p>I get up while trying to loosen up my neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Fuji-Nee.</p><p>I&#39;m thinking of having Sakura stay over starting tonight.

I&#39;m fine with that, but what&#39;s going on? You&#39;ve been acting really strange these past few days.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, um, Sakura doesn&#39;t seem to be doing well recently.

If I&#39;m having a friend&#39;s sister over, I have to take care of her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...? Oh, I see now. I just thought you were dense, but that&#39;s part of it too, huh?&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee sighs.</p><p>This is troubling.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura-chan has a lot of trouble ahead of her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, where are you going?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to the dressing room. I have to go get Sakura-chan some change of clothes. You can go to the outbuilding and prepare a room for her. Get her some new sheets, okay?&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee leaves after giving me an order.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. Stay here, Saber. I&#39;m going to go prepare the guest room.&quot;</p><p>I leave after seeing Saber nod.</p><hr><p>I make the bed and check the furniture.</p><p>I decided to have Sakura use a guest room that isn&#39;t normally used.</p><p>This room is more suited to her, and the door can be locked.</p><p>...Sakura&#39;s a girl, so that should be better for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, it&#39;s not like Fuji-Nee made me choose this room.&quot;</p><p>I make the bed.</p><p>This bed has never been used.</p><p>The moment I think that Sakura will sleep in this bed tonight...</p><hr><p>&#39;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I bet you noticed it too.&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...Indecent thoughts fill my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t be stupid! I\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I already know that, without being told.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen Sakura hit puberty, getting more beautiful by the day.</p><p>It was a good thing, but I also persuaded myself not to notice it.</p><p>I&#39;ve always told myself that she&#39;s Shinji&#39;s sister and that she only comes to cook for me because she feels guilty about what Shinji did.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s been a year and a half, hasn&#39;t it? It&#39;s nothing Sakura should care about.&quot;</p><p>The accident that caused me to quit the archery club...</p><p>I injured my shoulder, he complained about the burn, and I took the opportunity to leave the club.</p><p>...And Sakura proposed to help me out until my injury healed.</p><hr><p>She was like a child back then.</p><p>She waited for me in front of my house one day, but it took two hours of awkward silence before she worked up the courage to say she wanted to help me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That shy Sakura is the rising star of the archery club now. Man, how a person can change.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura is cheerful now.</p><p>I first met her four years ago when I went to Shinji&#39;s house after getting to know him.</p><hr><p>She was quiet and had a habit of hiding her face with her hair.</p><p>...Well, she still is, but she was really lifeless back then. She always looked depressed and would just absent-mindedly stand there.</p><p>Considering that, it&#39;s wonderful to see how Sakura is doing now.</p><p>It relieves me to see Sakura, the girl who only used to look downcast, smile.</p><hr><p>&#39;I bet you noticed it too. How sexy her body is, how much you want to touch her.&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t really know.</p><p>She was always just my underclassman.</p><p>But recently, that changed.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know if it happened recently or if I only started to notice it just now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Or...</p><p>Was she so close to me that I didn&#39;t have to notice?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Damn. It&#39;s been peaceful until now. So why...&quot;</p><p>Why is my mind going crazy from just having Sakura stay over?</p><p>I&#39;m being inconsiderate of her.</p><p>I&#39;ll finish cleaning and show her to her room\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Where&#39;s Sakura, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not know. She is not here yet, so I would assume she is still in the bath.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? But it&#39;s been an hour already.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Well, perhaps she takes long baths.</p><p>After all, she has more places to wash\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015! Stop, stop, stop...! Don&#39;t imagine indecent things!&quot;</p><p>I shake my head and sit down at the table.</p><p>I pour myself some tea and drink it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>I shake off the image in my head and relax.</p><p>...Then.</p><p>&quot;Shirou. Does Sakura have bad eyesight?&quot;</p><p>Saber asks me a strange question.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? No, Sakura has good eyesight.</p><p>I think she has 1.5 vision.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. She often runs into walls, so I was worried that she might have bad vision.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I see. Thanks for worrying, but Sakura&#39;s fine. She&#39;s clumsy now because she&#39;s tired. She&#39;s usually more reliable than me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I hope so. ...But even in that case, it is a problem if she is tired enough to mistake the wall for a door. This is only my personal opinion, but I believe it was not caused by fatigue.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s a very natural conclusion.</p><p>Even if you&#39;re tired, you still shouldn&#39;t be running into walls.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Where is Sakura anyway?</p><p>Even if she&#39;s taking a bath, an hour is too long.</p><p>I\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15-let-fuji-nee-do-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15-let-fuji-nee-do-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15 let Fuji-Nee do it.</h2><p>...Yeah.</p><p>Fuji-Nee would make fun of me for a whole year if I did go and happened to walk in on Sakura changing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t do that to Sakura.&quot;</p><p>Yes, I should sit tight and wait.</p><p>She might be already out and drying her hair.</p><hr><p>&quot;You are restless, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? I-I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m eating my mandarin and drinking my tea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So you relax by not eating or drinking and looking often at the clock?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh. Um, I have no appetite because I&#39;m full.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. I do not mind if you say so. But I do not believe it is a good idea to hold yourself back.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber elegantly sips her tea.</p><p>...Man, I&#39;m hopeless!</p><p>It hasn&#39;t even been five minutes yet, but I&#39;m really worried about Sakura!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Man, I don&#39;t care what Fuji-Nee says!</p><p>Saber, I&#39;m going to the bathroom!&quot;</p><p>I make up my mind and stand up.</p><p>At that moment...</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee comes running in.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fuji-Nee...? Why are you in such a rush? Weren&#39;t you preparing for Sakura&#39;s stay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I finished that already. More importantly, can you look after Sakura-chan? I&#39;m going back to my house to get some medicine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!? What&#39;s wrong with Sakura, Fuji-Nee?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s what I want to know. Sakura-chan was on the floor when I went to the dressing room, and she has a fever of almost 38 degrees.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015where&#39;s Sakura, Fuji-Nee...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just carried her to the guest room. I think she just has a cold, so don&#39;t worry too much.</p><p>But we can&#39;t push her. I&#39;m going back to my place to get some stuff, so you just be there for Sakura-chan, okay? That should provide plenty of energy for her all by itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee fires off my instructions and goes back to her house.</p><p>The Fujimura household has perfect preparations for illness and injuries, as it has lots of &quot;those&quot; kind of people.</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the time to stand around in shock.</p><p>I have to go check on Sakura...!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s see. Your temperature is a bit over 37 degrees. Oh, it&#39;s lower than I thought.&quot;</p><p>I put the medical thermometer down and look at Sakura.</p><p>It&#39;s been thirty minutes.</p><p>Her condition wasn&#39;t that bad, just like Fuji-Nee said. She has a slight cold, and she collapsed in the dressing room because she felt dizzy after staying in the bath for too long.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry... I guess I got dizzy since I was so nervous.&quot;</p><p>Sakura hides her face with her futon.</p><hr><p>&quot;You can&#39;t help catching a cold, right? You should be better by tomorrow if you drink some medicine and get a good night&#39;s sleep.</p><p>I&#39;ll leave some water here on the chair, so don&#39;t go out of the building, okay? You&#39;ll cool your body if you go outside.&quot;</p><p>I put another blanket over her, just in case, and turn the lights off.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll come wake you up tomorrow morning, so you can rest easy until then.&quot;</p><p>I pat her on her head, then walk to the door.</p><p>&quot;...Yes. Good night, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura sounds apologetic.</p><p>I bid her goodnight and leave her room.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-16-should-i-go-check-on-her" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-16-should-i-go-check-on-her" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 16 Should I go check on her...?</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I should go check on her.</p><p>If Saber&#39;s right, this isn&#39;t the time to be hung up on embarrassment.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura.&quot;</p><p>I call out to her from the hallway.</p><p>There&#39;s no reply from inside the dressing room.</p><p>No, I don&#39;t even feel a presence in there.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...?

Hey, say something...!&quot;</p><p>My anxiety turns to cold certainty.</p><p>...Something&#39;s wrong.</p><p>I can&#39;t go inside, so I&#39;ll have to get Saber or Fuji-Nee\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? S-Senpai? Why are you so flustered?&quot;</p><p>&quot;S-Sakura...!? ...Oh, it&#39;s nothing. I was wondering if something was wrong, since you were in there for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A while...? Was I in here that long?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Sakura sounds absent-minded.</p><p>She sounds lost in thought, as if she&#39;d just woken up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura. Don&#39;t tell me you were...&quot;</p><p>&quot;......Yes. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep a bit...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You idiot. Don&#39;t scare me like that.&quot;</p><p>I crumple down to the floor.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry.

I&#39;m coming in, Sakura!&quot;</p><p>I rush into the dressing room.</p><p>There, I see Sakura on the floor.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura, Sakura...!&quot;</p><p>I hold Sakura up in my arms.</p><p>Her body is soft and surprisingly hot.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t seem to be conscious, but she&#39;s moaning in pain.</p><p>Her hand grabs her chest, as if wanting to take her shirt off.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa......&quot;</p><p>She gasps.</p><p>...This is way too much for me.</p><p>Her body is soft, and her hair is unraveled.</p><p>Her shirt is the only thing between my arms and her body, and this isn&#39;t the Sakura I know.</p><hr><p>Her shirt sticks to her body and emphasizes her large breasts, and I can&#39;t take my eyes off of them.</p><p>Her breasts move up and down along with her breaths, exposing her white neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It feels like my heart will leap out of my chest.</p><p>My head wouldn&#39;t be this hot even if I drank a love potion.</p><p>I realize that my mouth is watering, and I swallow with great difficulty.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah...

You should get used to the room in a little bit, and I&#39;ll go if you fall asleep before that.</p><p>To be honest, I&#39;m worried that you might push yourself. I&#39;ll stay here for at least thirty minutes, so lay down and relax.&quot;</p><p>I raise my hand and flutter it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay.

She said we shouldn&#39;t fight them because they are troublesome enemies, but it seems the coma incidents in town are their doing. ...I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not, but we have to find out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...You are right. I do feel something intentional in the ley line pointing to the Ryuudou Temple. I am sure that a Master is on that mountain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Saber? You seem like you&#39;re not up for it. You have less spirit than last night.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You are right. That mountain is an ominous place for Servants.</p><p>I would like to avoid careless attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. Should we just patrol the town tonight and put off attacking the Ryuudou Temple until we get more information? It is reckless to go attack them when we don&#39;t know anything about our enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, there is no need for that. A Master that would set up his base in the Ryuudou Temple would not readily reveal his identity. If we are to quickly defeat him, we must face them straight on and power through.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber is determined.</p><p>...She must believe we have a chance. Either way, if the Master at the temple is responsible for all the recent coma victims, we have to do something.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015All right, let&#39;s go to the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>But we&#39;re only going to investigate tonight.</p><p>We&#39;ll retreat once we find out who the Master is and what Servant he has. I&#39;d like to do more, but I can&#39;t support you, so I want to be cautious.&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t allow Saber to get hurt, just like the fight with Berserker.</p><p>If I can&#39;t help her directly, I have to protect her in some other way.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Understood. I shall entrust you with the final judgment. Please decide then if we are to retreat or fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm. I&#39;m glad to hear that, but it&#39;s also scary. I might wuss out even if the enemy is weak.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. That is certainly a possibility, since you have little experience in battle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right. I want to avoid heading into a minefield, so please warn me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Understood. Then I shall do so if you make a wrong choice.</p><p>You will learn little if I merely warn you, so I shall impose a penalty if you make a mistake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hey, what do you mean by &#39;penalty&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Where would the enjoyment be in telling you? I shall keep it a secret, since this is one of the few pleasures I have.&quot;</p><p>...Ugh.</p><p>That joke isn&#39;t very Saber-like. It must be Fuji-Nee&#39;s influence.</p><p>I really do hope it&#39;s just a joke.</p><hr><p>&quot;But putting that aside, Shirou... will Sakura be all right? She seemed unusually distressed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought so too, but I didn&#39;t see anything unusual when I took her temperature. I&#39;ll let her get a good night&#39;s sleep and see how she is tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see.
