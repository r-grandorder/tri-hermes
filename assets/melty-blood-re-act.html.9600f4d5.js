It was not that you never had any reason, you simply did not use it. After being suppressed for so long, it would not suddenly be victorious now.</p><p><strong>Len</strong>: ...........</p><p><strong>Aoko</strong>: Oh, are you mad? Fine. I do have to accept responsibility for borrowing her, so I will keep you company until the end.</p><hr><p><strong>Len vs Aoko</strong></p><p><strong>Len wins</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: Len-san~ Time for your snack~</p><p><strong>Hisui</strong>: Ohh, Nee-san, just leave the cake there.</p><p><strong>Kohaku</strong>: Oh, she&#39;s sleeping now?

Funny things are happening in town, and both Arcueid-san and Akiha-san seem ready to fight....... If I were to meet them, they would probably hunt me...... But Black Cat-san is relying on me, and it would be dangerous to leave Tohno-kun alone...... I&#39;m a little scared but I will have to do my best tonight.</p><hr><h3 id="ciel-encounter-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ciel-encounter-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ciel Encounter</h3><hr><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: That is as far as you go, Yumizuka-san. I will not allow your rampaging to go on any further.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: (......Ciel-senpai---she doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;ll listen to anything I say......)</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: I will at least make this painless, and instantly return you to dust. I will end your nightmare here.</p><hr><p><strong>Satsuki vs Ciel</strong></p><p><strong>Satsuki wins</strong></p><hr><h3 id="white-len-encounter-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#white-len-encounter-16" aria-hidden="true">#</a> White Len Encounter</h3><hr><p><strong>White Len</strong>: Good evening. I really am glad to meet you, Satsuki. You were not invited, but it is proper to greet those of the same kind.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: Thank you very much. This place fits you well. There is nothing here. Like me, you can&#39;t do anything.</p><p><strong>White Len</strong>: Huhu....... I think we can get along. What do you think? If you attend to it, I can give you half. If you go outside, people will just hurt you no matter what, right? So, you should stay here with me.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: Ah, I have to decline. It may be cold and painful over there, but it is also warm. And besides, you may be able to give me half of this place, but you can&#39;t split Tohno-kun in half. I will destroy you, and return the world to normal.</p><p><strong>White Len</strong>: ---Amazing. You&#39;re stronger than you look, Satsuki.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: Of course. I&#39;ve been a glamorous loner for many years.</p><hr><p><strong>Satsuki vs White Len</strong></p><p><strong>Satsuki wins</strong></p><hr><h3 id="aoko-encounter-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aoko-encounter-16" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aoko Encounter</h3><hr><p><strong>Aoko</strong>: Wow, such a high class vampire for one so young. It really is amazing for someone as unpracticed as you to have a Reality Marble. The arrival of fresh up-and-coming stars must be what&#39;s keeping the 27 going, even after so many of them keep getting destroyed.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: !? ........ W-who....... no, what are, you?</p><p><strong>Aoko</strong>: Me? I&#39;m just a Sorceress passing on through. My job is to destroy things. You might say I am an enemy to your kind, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: ---</p><p><strong>Aoko</strong>: Oh, has your self-defense mechanism as a Dead Apostle started to kick in? ...... Hmm, oh well. I&#39;m a little bored, so I&#39;ll keep you company until you cool down.</p><hr><p><strong>Satsuki vs Aoko</strong></p><p><strong>Satsuki wins</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: I see. That was quite the hassle, Satsuki.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: Wasn&#39;t it? I was just doing Black Cat-san a favour, and Ciel-senpai attacked me so seriously, and the most frightening person even appeared. Even though I did it for his sake, Tohno-kun didn&#39;t even notice. It feels like I didn&#39;t get any reward for my hard work.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: Satsuki, your expectations are too high. In the first place, that Shiki doesn&#39;t even know what you do. He is only that dense when it comes to things like this.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: That&#39;s true. Oh, I don&#39;t think I can stand it any longer. ........ Hey, Sion. Do you think we should surprise Shiki if we have a chance?</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: Hoho, it may be a fuss, but we can give him some good medicine. See, this devious plot-- I mean, proposal, is something I would help with.</p><p><strong>Satsuki</strong>: Really!? Alright, then let&#39;s get started! Sion, do you have any ideas? I&#39;m stumped.....</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: ...... I have several hundred in mind, Satsuki. I believe I understand just a little why you were not rewarded.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PhMNhvR.png" alt="End"></p><hr><h1 id="end-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#end-16" aria-hidden="true">#</a> END</h1><h2 id="sion-tatari" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sion-tatari" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sion TATARI</h2><hr><p><strong>Sion TATARI</strong>: .....

You&#39;ve come, to, kill me?</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: I came to seek out the cause of the disturbances, but dealing with a heretic like you falls well within my duties. ---You seem not to have drunk any blood, but it is impossible to resist the urge. Sion Eltnam Atlasia, you have been a vampire for a long time.</p><p><strong>Sion TATARI</strong>: ......! That, that&#39;s, even if you didn&#39;t tell me.......! You are an eyesore!

No--- with you here, even though I tried so hard.....</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: ......I&#39;ll still get in your way.

You made a copy of Len&#39;s unused consciousness?</p><p><strong>White Len</strong>: Yes. Without a form, Tatari can&#39;t be embodied. Len&#39;s form is well-suited. I, the one who takes the form of anxiety, and Len, the one who controls dreams. Isn&#39;t this the most like Tatari of any of my forms?</p><p><strong>Sion TATARI</strong>: ---Ridiculous. Don&#39;t think you&#39;re something if you&#39;re just a fragment using a fragment.</p><p><strong>White Len</strong>: Wha-what!?</p><p><strong>Sion TATARI</strong>: I am Tatari&#39;s successor.

So what&#39;re you going to do now, Tatari? Are you going to disappear off into the darkness? Are you going to die here?
