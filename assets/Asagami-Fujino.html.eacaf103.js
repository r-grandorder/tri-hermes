Also, because once the distortion is activated, you can avoid damage by moving away from its area.</p><p><strong>Clairvoyance (Darkness): [C]</strong></p><p>Some lights can only be seen by eyes that lost their lights.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this is the psychic ability Clairvoyance.

The first ascension is the Reien uniform we all already knew. The second ascension is her as an Ahnenerbe Caf\xE9 waitress. Since this is a crossover, I doubled down on the fanservice and made her into her Mahou Tsukai no Hako version. Although I decided on those two practically immediately, I didn\u2019t know what to do for the third ascension. I thought of doing \u201CAsakami Fujino\u201D, from a situation where the Asakami never downgraded into the Asagami, so first tried to work around a design with a miko image to it, yet nothing seemed to work. Then I switched lanes upon thinking \u201CWait, the Asakamis were more like shamans than mikos\u201D, and settled down with the current design.
