It doesn&#39;t seem that she liked the expression, &quot;get worked up.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m saying that I get energized.</p><p>Your organ playing is great for recharging, listening to it sends a shock through my brain.\u201D</p><p>Unsatisfied, Caren turns back to the organ.</p><p>Apparently, she can&#39;t understand how getting worked up and shocks are related.</p><hr><p>In any case, the performance resumed.</p><p>Life once again is breathed into the inanimate organ.</p><p>Her thin fingers, covered in wounds, touch the keyboard.</p><p>For the fourth time, the jarring melody reverberates in the chapel\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Surprisingly, it felt different than before.</p><p>Perhaps because the performer&#39;s fingers were filled with passion?</p><p>The waves of sound that were only vague and irritating now ring clear and vibrant.</p><p>Perfectly in place.</p><p>While grinding my teeth in irritation, the thick walls of my rationality are eventually dissolved.</p><hr><p>\u300A\u2015\u2015\u2015Is there nothing you find beautiful?\u300B</p><hr><p>That woman said something like that.</p><p>My feelings like that had long since gone away.</p><p>I feel at ease now.</p><p>It&#39;s good to simply see things for what they are.</p><p>Having personal sentiments is a burden in many ways.</p><p>...And yet, why?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Stop screwing around.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>A glimpse of a strange landscape flashes before my eyes.</p><p>I don&#39;t understand it&#39;s significance.</p><p>Just a desolate wasteland. A summit far above the ground where the air is thin.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015why do I recall that now?</p><hr><p>An irrelevant thought that would not fade even if cast away.</p><p>It&#39;s not just the feeling of hatred that remains,</p><p>but this scenery that has burned into my eyes as well.</p><hr><p>...Stop screwing around.</p><p>Why am I remembering this kind of place?</p><p>There shouldn&#39;t be anything.</p><p>There shouldn&#39;t be anything over there, nothing...!</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t let my heart waver.</p><p>It&#39;s too late now, I can&#39;t allow myself to embrace something like sentimental thoughts.</p><p>It&#39;s not like the past will change in the place I recall.</p><p>A mistaken sentiment, a mistaken fantasy, these mustn&#39;t be crafted into something beautiful.</p><p>I affirm things the way they are.</p><p>I mustn&#39;t think that things that aren&#39;t mine belong to me, just because of nostalgia.</p><hr><p>Your pride is in having nothing.</p><p>Your meaning is in being nothing.</p><p>When you fabricate something that doesn&#39;t even exist, you become no different from a meaningless sacrifice.</p><p>...Ah.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s still true\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s true that nothing existed here.</p><p>But hadn&#39;t I wished for there to be meaning in that?\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Her performance was over before I knew it.</p><p>As far as my goal of regaining some vitality goes, I can&#39;t help but say it was a let-down.</p><p>And then, I realized Caren was standing in front of me.</p><p>...Hmm. It seems this girl has gathered some resolve, though maybe she wants something?</p><hr><p>\u201CI thought you would no longer be coming here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSame. I wonder why? I must have not been thinking. Besides, I thought I&#39;d be revitalized, but instead I&#39;ve been exhausted.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You were the one who said to continue. Did you not like my playing?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm? Well, I don&#39;t have a problem with your technique.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how you keep it up with that bandage-covered body of yours. I&#39;m impressed......hey, wait......could it be that you&#39;re actually really good at playing the organ?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI can boast that I&#39;m second to none. Refining my strong points is my hobby.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou seem confident for once......I see, so you were good at it, huh?\u201D</p><p>I&#39;ve done something rude.</p><p>What would she do if I said I&#39;d been appreciating it with the same mindset as watching a school play?</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;m glad you understand.</p><p>Incidentally, I&#39;d like to hear about which part of my performance you didn&#39;t like.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, the part where I get sleepy from listening to it.</p><p>I&#39;m not saying to use electricity, but it&#39;s emotionless to the point that it can&#39;t reach a climax.</p><p>Also, a style that accepts anything and everything is boring. Let me hear an outburst of passion. As in, really get into it so that your almost kicking the keyboard.\u201D</p><p>And it&#39;d be perfect if you add some electric guitar distortions.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Isn&#39;t that a fault of the piece rather than myself?</p><p>Furthermore, the person listening has bad taste as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGeh. What, is this audience member being rude?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTo the point of being beyond words. There is nothing in my vocabulary to express it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015pfft.\u201D</p><p>I turn away and try not to laugh.</p><p>I thought this was a hard woman to understand, but she reacts like this when you poke at something she is proud of?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing, just dealing with something that welled up a bit.</p><p>You&#39;re kind of stubborn, aren&#39;t you? Your music teacher must have had a hard time training you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Please, don&#39;t make assumptions about me by your standards.</p><p>Besides, I should have already related my personal history to you.</p><p>Because I have been isolated, wouldn&#39;t you think that I am self-taught?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm? Surely you at least have a music teacher.</p><p>There are proper rules in your sound. Something like the will of the player that has been passed along through the hands of many people.</p><p>Your organ isn&#39;t something played for yourself, right?</p><p>Your playing is woven for many people, a &quot;universal&quot; music.\u201D</p><hr><p>Only technique can be refined through self-study.</p><p>A genius can&#39;t construct a concept that transcends time.</p><p>If those who shine through their talent are the flowers of the tree,</p><p>then those who shine through their heritage become the trunk and nurture the tree.</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, leaving aside that sort of complicated talk, having someone teach you is the fastest way to improve. You prioritized practicality over appearances.</p><p>That&#39;s what I meant by stubborn.</p><p>I think you&#39;re the type that tries her best when it comes to something she really likes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......I can&#39;t agree with your conjecture.</p><p>However, it is true that, as a special exception, I had an instructor and time set aside for me to learn music. Although I did run into a few problems along the way.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSee. You don&#39;t get discouraged even when being scolded, as though you don&#39;t really take any damage. There&#39;s something in you that other people just can&#39;t change.</p><p>Who&#39;s the one who said that she has no self again?</p><p>Really, all you church folk are so thick-skinned.\u201D</p><hr><p>Wicked laughter.</p><p>...Huh? What could be putting me in such a good mood?</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the entertainment or if it&#39;s because I&#39;m feeling a bit careless, but I&#39;m getting a bit high.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>On the other hand, she became stiff and stood still.</p><p>It seems that something had struck home for her too.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Um. Am I really that thick-skinned?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Enough to rival your predecessor.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>She looks a bit stiff as she searches for words.</p><p>I observe this rare moment of clumsiness.</p><p>Perhaps I&#39;m in an uplifting mood because my senses have relaxed.</p><p>The desires I&#39;ve pretended to not see until now begin to pulse in unison with my heartbeat.</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh...!\u201D</p><p>There is a subtle sound like the tearing of thin vinyl.</p><p>The scent of blood spills out from the bottom of her vestments.</p><hr><p>\u201C? What&#39;s wrong, your period?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......It&#39;s only a wound opening up. I apologize, but, um,\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;ll move back a row. Sorry, that was completely my fault.\u201D</p><p>&quot;There we go&quot; I move to the seat behind me.</p><p>Now that I&#39;m a bit farther away, the scent of blood is fainter.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat must be tough on you. Still wandering the streets at night even with your wounds opening up.</p><p>...Hm, that&#39;s right. I recall you dutifully come searching for me at night on the fourth day.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s right. Until the recreation of the Heaven&#39;s Feel ends, every fourth night I must go out into the streets.</p><p>Of course, that is not the sole reason for my fatigue.</p><p>...Recently, I have started an imitation of a demon exorcism.\u201D</p><p>\u201COoh.\u201D</p><hr><p>I wasn&#39;t actually paying attention.</p><p>To be honest, just because the smell of the blood is fainter now doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m completely in control.</p><hr><p>For instance, my eyes are fixated on the wounds hidden by those white bandages.</p><p>And by those slender arms and shoulders that seem as if they&#39;d break just by being held down.</p><p>Or even by her white belly, wet with blood, that surely is fresh and in season like those sweetfish skewers.</p><hr><p>\u201CUhhh. Is the exorcism going well?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, not in the least.</p><p>I&#39;ve performed many exorcisms before now, but I have to say this kind of case is a first for me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmmm. So that one is a toughie.\u201D</p><p>Red blotches surface on her bandages.</p><p>Luscious. Raw. I&#39;d thought that she was like a doll, but she was plenty fresh and rare.</p><hr><p>\u201CIn terms of strength, it would be among the weak.</p><p>But there is one thing different about it, and that is throwing me off.</p><p>...I mean, this demon is harsh with me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat? Doesn&#39;t it go without saying that demons are harsh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo. As a rule demons are gentle.</p><p>Regardless of the result, they are the Imaginary Element that understands one&#39;s pain and attempts to remove it. Depending on perspective, one can view them as allies to humans.</p><p>No matter what happens, they do not rebuke a human.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I feel like she&#39;s tempting me.</p><p>Her hands are folded in prayer. Fingers intertwined. I am reminded of her body,</p><p>covered in wounds.</p><p>And yet this is something dedicated to god, not intended to be offered to a demon.</p><p>Someone who does nothing but accept things as they are.</p><p>A convenient sacrifice that accepts sin without reason.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, Hah.\u201D</p><p>This is bad. If I don&#39;t switch out of this mind...</p><p>This impulse will end up breaking down my shell.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs something wrong? You don&#39;t look well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m fine, just feeling a little anemic.</p><p>Anyway, about what you were saying. You&#39;ve never seen a case like this before. So in other words, it&#39;s interesting?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNot at all. The only thing unexpected is how irritating it is.</p><p>...Oh well. Honestly, perhaps I have had enough.</p><p>Even though I had intervened of my own accord, it doesn&#39;t seem like I can do much about it. I wonder if it would be fine to withdraw around here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhichever. Do what you want.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...............\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? It&#39;s not like I said you&#39;re fickle or irresponsible.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is true, but...</p><p>...See, you can be harsh.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>&quot;Harsh&quot; she says. This is the first time I&#39;ve been told that.</p><p>I think I&#39;ve been told before that I&#39;m someone who is patient and someone who is impatient... But which one was called which...?</p><hr><p>...I still can&#39;t switch.</p><p>This one is a formidable opponent.</p><p>I wonder whether she is looking at me with those golden eyes.</p><p>This isn&#39;t possible, to think that my cocoon is on the verge of collapse with just four encounters.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy any chance, are you taking this seriously?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh...?\u201D</p><p>I look up at her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...My apologies. I merely wanted to try teasing you a little.</p><p>Do not worry. I will not abandon you halfway through.</p><p>After all, to be your guide is the role I have assigned myself.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yeah. Come to think of it, our relationship was originally just to exchange information. The first time was helpful, but it&#39;s been fairly useless since then so I forgot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is because you talk about unrelated matters. If only you would talk about something important, I could give you my counsel.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right.</p><p>Although\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>There&#39;s nothing left I should ask about.</p><p>The relationship between Emiya Shirou and Caren had already been settled by the third visit.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Sorry, but it&#39;s already just about over.</p><p>Getting back to what you said earlier, actually, by now it should be okay for you to withdraw.</p><p>As for the exorcism... I guess, give up and look for your next catch.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s the end of it.</p><p>Soon, even this relation will come to an end.</p><hr><p>\u201CI understand this is a foolish question. Nevertheless, are you fine with that?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I am. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve gone through all this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that by your own will? For what purpose do you seek to resolve this wish?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIsn&#39;t it obvious? Because I&#39;m Emiya Shirou. At least just this once, I want to try to help someone.\u201D</p><p>I have no doubts.</p><p>My answer from the second visit was what I truly, sincerely believe.</p><hr><p>I take my leave.</p><p>I want to think that even being able to say those words just now made this time meaningful.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait.</p><p>I can&#39;t hang around any longer.</p><p>Without pause I head for the door.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015You are nothingness. As long as there is something unborn, something unknown, you will continue to exist.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many gaps left.</p><p>Might as well fill them in quickly.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But once everything has been born, you have nowhere to go. The closer these days come to ending, the less you shine.</p><p>Nothing will be lost. It&#39;s just that,</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015you lose interest in this world, and return to your original state of nothingness.</p><p>I&#39;ll revert to my original, proper form, that&#39;s all.</p><hr>', 303);
