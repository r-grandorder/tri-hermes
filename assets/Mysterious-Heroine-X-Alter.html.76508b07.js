I can literally see you wobbling your throat with your hand to do it!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way a weird robot like that would exist in the Servantverse!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have a problem with it.<br> We already have Professor Babbagen and Evil Wind 2B.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> This is my room, by the way. It&#39;s got a kotatsu and everything. Hehehe. I&#39;ve also got plenty of sweets to go with our tea.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> (...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Oh please.

Sure, no problem.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Everyone else, please feel free to help yourselves to the sweets, too.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> What would you like, Master?<br> I also have some piping hot green tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A chestnut cake and chestnut dumpling, please.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You have excellent taste, Master.<br> Chestnuts go great with all sorts of sweets.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> This chestnut cake not only has delicious chestnut adzuki beans, its crisp, crunchy shell is a work of art on its own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This chestnut jelly is really soft and scrumptious too!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I see. I now understand everything.<br> Today is a day for evaluating different kinds of sweets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Munch, munch) That&#39;s, um, probably not quite right.<br> At least, I don&#39;t think it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Give me everything you&#39;ve got, please.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Oho...<br> (Clatter)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait!

(Venting exhaust in lieu of sighing)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, um... Now that we&#39;ve all had some lovely tea and a chance to relax, maybe we should get down to business...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I agree.<br> What is this all about?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> This is the XXth Servantverse Servant Assem\u2013</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You have already said as much.<br> What I want to know is, who chose these members?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I can understand why my pilot candidate and Mash might be here...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...but why would you ask me to attend a \u201CServantverse Servant Assembly\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As you all surely know, I am the proud steel guardian of Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I want no part of any world as slapdash and ill-defined as this \u201CServantverse.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You come from a world with a Japanese castle stacked on a pyramid stacked on a European castle. You have a giant steel demoness robot, Elisa Particles... How is that different than the Servantverse?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Blasphemy! Now be quiet and let me speak.<br> Hmph...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I hope whoever invited me here didn&#39;t do so solely because I&#39;m a robot...did they?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> (Hack, cough, cough)</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> (There&#39;s no way I can say I just asked her to come so I&#39;d have some extra camouflage for my cover story now!)</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Uh, beep boop, of course not.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> (Monotone) I invited you here as an...honorary Servantverse Servant.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird. I could have sworn you were a full-fledged member of the Servantverse, Mecha Eli-chan.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I remember the demoness of the demon castle played a huge part in the CEO of Amazones&#39; autobiographical movie.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> There was the scene where you went diving in the liquid hydrogen oceans on a gas giant planet... Your trip to the Bermuda Triangle...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Your trip to that neutron star with the ultramagnetic field that&#39;s impossible to escape... And then there was\u2013</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> What... What are you talking about? I&#39;ve never done anything like that in all my operational history.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I was also told you&#39;re exceedingly knowledgeable when it comes to Western sweets.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You can fight, you can sing, you can bake...<br> You&#39;re the perfect robot come to life.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> They also said you make amazing Halloween-themed pies! I do know chestnuts and pumpkin are a sublime combination in sweets, so I can believe it.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s really just a hobby. Anyway, I still don&#39;t fully understand, but, all right.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If this is basically just a tea party for proper ladies,<br> then I have no objection.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> (Besides, I&#39;ve been invited to oil parties courtesy of Danzo, but I&#39;ve never been to a tea party before.)</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Very well. An opportunity like this doesn&#39;t come around every day.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As the guardian of Csejte with an understanding of Halloween, it&#39;s my duty to allow for elegant, stylish times like\u2013</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Do you have any curry cake?<br> Or maybe cutlet cake?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> (Twitch)</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Anyway, this is essentially a meeting, yes?<br> So what&#39;s our agenda for today&#39;s proceedings?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Mecha Eli-chan&#39;s pretty much running the show now.)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Hmm. I don&#39;t have any of the junky cake X likes...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But since it&#39;s not every day that all of us Servantverse Servants are gathered together like this, we probably should do something special...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I know! We can have a one-on-one-on-one battle to see which of us is the strongest X of all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well someone&#39;s a little too fired up for their own good.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You said it. That is hardly the sort of thing to suit a meeting.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> (Nodding vigorously in assent)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather hear more about the Servantverse.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I completely agree with my pilot candidate.</p><hr><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be much more productive to acquire verifiable intel on any possible Servantverse threats, so we can come up with appropriate means to counter them before they pose a threat?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Especially when it comes to Foreigner-class entities!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I concur! (Venting exhaust)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a threat we need to be overly concerned with...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That aside, I&#39;d love to learn more about the world all you Xs come from!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think you two said you were roommates there, right, X and Alter?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> That is right. It really takes me back.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nobody asked you, you hunk of junk!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That said, it&#39;s true that we were forced to share a dorm room back at Cosmo-Chaldea High School.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Grrr, just thinking about it pisses me off all over again!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t mind sharing a room in theory, but X was the worst possible roommate I could have imagined.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...our teacher, Nameless Red, might have set that up to try and improve X&#39;s behavior, even just a little...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Trust me, it was no picnic for me either, sister!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t just have to share our room. We were even forced to complete an assignment together...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An assignment? You mean, at Cosmo-Chaldea High?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Yup. Killing villains, basically.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it was supposed to be Nameless Red&#39;s mission, but he pawned it off on his students!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I think it was on Planet Totooine.<br> That was a seriously brutal case...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> This was back in the start of season one.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> This was when our ratings were in the gutter, when viewers thought we were just another weird series.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Season? Ratings?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got to tell us more now!</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Sure, no problem.<br> So, Planet Totooine is...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>\u2013 Planet Totooine \u2013</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Gaah! Ugh, blech! I&#39;m gonna be washing sand out of everywhere for days!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> How the hell does a planet RAIN sand!?<br> Everywhere we go, it&#39;s just sand, sand, sand!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What&#39;s next? Maybe a sand squall followed by a sand rainbow!?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> A sand rainbow. What a lovely concept.<br> How very unrealistic, yet sublime.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But, unfortunately, this sandstorm is so cosmically big it&#39;s enveloping everything in Totooine&#39;s orbit.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Dammit... We don&#39;t have time for this.<br> We need to hurry!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Getting Du Stallion II get shot down and having to make an emergency landing on this planet was not part of the plan.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I guess those reports that this area was getting unruly were true.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Maybe we just should&#39;ve waited for Black Bucket to finish repairing the ship!?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> First of all, he&#39;s not a black bucket.<br> He&#39;s my Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Second, we can&#39;t wait that long.<br> Not with...my precious...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...sweet bean buns at stake!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I have to get to the Spacebucks that just opened on Totooine before they sell out of their special commemorative buns!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh? Commemorative buns?<br> What about our mission to dispatch that villain?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> The special Spacebucks version of Totooine&#39;s famous Zero Buns comes first.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What!? You never said anything about some stupid mission like that before!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) This explains why you were so excited about researching our destination...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> If only you worked half as hard to preserve peace in the Servantverse as you did on acquiring sweets...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh!?<br> Ex, get down!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Yikes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Damn, I can&#39;t believe how accurate they are! Looks like we&#39;re up against more enemies than we thought!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That shadow over there... Is that a sand raider?<br> One of Totooine&#39;s mythical desert people?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Now I see... So that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> These sand raider extremists are trying to stop Spacebucks&#39; galactic expansion by any means necessary!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Seriously!? Oh, hell no! I am NOT getting killed over freaking coffee milk!!!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Good thing we can totally take these guys if we can just get in close! Let&#39;s get &#39;em, Ex!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Right. I won&#39;t let them stand in the way of peace...or of my sweet bean buns!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> These two weren&#39;t part of the plan.<br> Guess I&#39;ve got no other choice...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t learn this until much later...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...but the incident on Totooine was just the opening act of a huge conspiracy.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I still find it hard to believe that the legendary bounty hunter, Edgy Fett, was masterminding the whole thing...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Even in my wildest dreams, I never would&#39;ve thought a guy that strong would be hiding out among the sand raiders...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> So we ended up letting him get away, failing the assignment, and having to stay behind for special training, AGAIN!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The legendary bounty hunter...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Edgy Fett...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Short for Edgemiya Fett...</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They say he&#39;ll only work for enormous cash bounties, and that even the League of Villains fears him.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> There are also rumors that say he&#39;s the Alter of a certain hero, and that Edgy Fett is just a codename.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It still burns me that we let him get away.<br> If only Mr. Dual Pistols had been a Saber...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Anyway, our assignment might not have gone at all well...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...but the important thing is that I managed to get my hands on the sweet buns in the end.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I see... At first, I thought this Cosmo-Chaldea High School was a place for raising defenders of justice...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s actually a charity designed to try and give completely hopeless Servants a chance to be useful somehow.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nrghhh...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Y-yes, I might not have had top grades, but so what!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Their methods were never a good fit for my learning style anyway!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Especially when it came to those smug-ass teachers!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> What a terrible tragedy for you.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So with your combined 2.0 GPA and your complete inability to work as a team, you were dispatched to different planets around the universe?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Stupid Principal Lionhead made us go just to piss us off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What sort of planets were you two sent to?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> They were all very dangerous,<br> but the one I&#39;ll never forget...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...is Planet Guntama... I could never forget it after what happened there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Guntama? That name sounds familiar.<br> Isn&#39;t that your home planet, X?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Hehehe. You got it, Mash!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I latched on to X to mooch off her when she went back there during spring break.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Not that I wanted to go back to my home planet or anything. Or for Ex to come with me in the first place.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve muuuch rather hung out at a different planet.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But Guntama was the only place we were allowed to go after all the detentions we&#39;d incurred at school.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Can you believe that!?<br> Just thinking about it still makes me sooo angry!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Ha ha ha ha. At least you still got to go on break.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> I&#39;d say that&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;s not funny!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Because of all that, I had to bring Ex along on a trip back home I never wanted to take to begin with.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>	\u2013 Planet Guntama \u2013  \n</code></pre><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Oogh... What is this strange sensation...?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Is this Planet Guntama undulating?<br> Is it some kind of curse?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I can&#39;t even think straight with all this watery stuff running down my skin. I feel gross.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Pretty sure that&#39;s just sweat.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That&#39;s the thing about Guntama: it&#39;s goddamn hot here!<br> We&#39;re talking Red Ring of Death hot!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> The humidity in this season averages five thousand percent, and that&#39;s on a good day!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> This is exactly why I didn&#39;t want to come home!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to make it, X.<br> It was a good life...while it lasted...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Ex!

This is nothing...<br> It&#39;s just a flesh wound...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;ll take more than just a little battle to the death against the Savage Queen...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...and a brawl with the squid legions of Tentacle General Sanity Gilles to take me down...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget Herc The Superhuman&#39;s baryon ax that Nameless Red deflected, causing it to pierce straight through your side.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Oooh, right.

Plus, we got separated from our team.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Your injuries are very serious too. We need to hurry and find you somewhere safe to recover.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> There&#39;s no telling when more battle Voloids might show up.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What!? There&#39;s no way I&#39;m taking a break in the middle of this final batt\u2013Guh.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> There, you see?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll stand watch and see if I can find anything useful. Black Knight, help me carry X somewhere safe.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Who else would I be talking to, Voloid K6-X4?<br> Don&#39;t space out on me now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh, g-got it!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...There. We got past the enemy&#39;s automated defenses and made it inside their base.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Though I&#39;m afraid X isn&#39;t going to have any opportunities to recover in here.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Huh? What is it, Black Knight?<br> ...There&#39;s still a hostile here!?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...!

What are you...<br> S-stop that... Please, stop.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> M-my name is...Ex...<br> I don&#39;t...go by that... Ngh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ex? Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> I see. Looks like the brainwashing&#39;s stronger than I thought.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> But you still must have noticed how unstable you&#39;ve been since you came to this planet.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> That vision correction device you&#39;re wearing was made here on Esaba. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already figured that out.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> But it was also illegally modified to maintain and reinforce your brainwashing.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Since you got here, an identical frequency emitted from the planet&#39;s automated factory has been canceling out their modifications.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Huh!? Reinforced brainwashing...?<br> How do you know about this?</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> My last client told me to be careful around you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> X Alter? Did you just remember something?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s right... I... I wandered around space...before I came to Cosmo-Chaldea High School...

I&#39;m glad X isn&#39;t awake...to see me like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have time for idle chatter.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> The League of Villains might have Lionhead&#39;s heroes in a tight spot right now...</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> ...but it won&#39;t be long before the busybodies at the Galactic Police catch wind of this and stick their noses in.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Sooner or later, Esaba&#39;s going down. I was just planning my escape route when you showed up.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ve got a proposal for you.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Come with me, and I&#39;ll take you to see the League of Villains&#39; higher-ups.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> N-no...I won&#39;t!<br> I&#39;m a student at...Cosmo-Chaldea High School...!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (Ex&#39;s been acting weird ever since we landed on this planet. Going off on her own, being weirdly belligerent...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (At first I thought she just got up on the wrong side of the bed. But this explains what&#39;s been happening with her...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (...I don&#39;t get it one bit.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Heroine X...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (When did you wake up?)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (Whoa there. Keep it cool, Black Bucket,<br> or you&#39;re gonna set off my ninja arts.)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (I noticed someone was following us, so I was getting ready to fight back the moment they dropped their guard...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (But now, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (I was all set to punch Chief Red&#39;s fast and furious looking relative here in the face if he laid a hand on Ex...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> (...but as much as it sucks, I&#39;m gonna have to wait and see how this plays out, thanks to these injuries.)</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> ...Suit yourself. I&#39;ve done what I need to,<br> so I&#39;m getting out of here.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> I just thought I might be able to cash in on a League of Villains reward. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s enough, bounty hunter.<br> Please leave. Before X wakes up.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> ...Heh. Just don&#39;t go dying on me.<br> Be a waste of a good bounty.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> ...Oh, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Since I lost my shot at an easy payday, I guess I might as well drop a little tidbit here...</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> ...I wouldn&#39;t count on a wound from a Savage Queen&#39;s heavy spear getting better anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Not unless you&#39;ve got a way of undoing an anti-healing curse.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> What...? That can&#39;t be right!</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> This passage leads to the center of the factory. Maybe it&#39;ll have something that can help a Servant heal faster.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong><br> Assuming the defender Voloids don&#39;t get you first, of course.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re quite the busybody yourself, Edgy Fett.</p><p><strong>X:</strong></p><p>(I&#39;ll say!)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s it...!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I can use this device to heal X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Huh? No, wait. This is...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong></p><p>(What? What is it? Now I really wanna know!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s about time you woke up?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Dammit. They did see us coming in...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who dares disturb my factory&#39;s harmony?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Damn, doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll be able to talk our way out of this one!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> But that&#39;s fine with me!<br> If they want to fight, I&#39;ll take them all on!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> X...!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to do this. That guy is probably this factory planet&#39;s manager, and he&#39;s really strong.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Besides...I can&#39;t let your injuries get any worse.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Ex!<br> That&#39;s all the more reason to fight back!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> If I can beat this guy, I&#39;ll have academy credits for daaays! Then I&#39;ll be able to live it up and pig out every night until I graduate!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> (Sigh)... I swear, you never change...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You might not have a lot going for you, X, but if nothing else, you don&#39;t want for bluster.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re talking trash about me!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I see. So you&#39;re planning to turn traitor!<br> Well not on my watch, you aren&#39;t!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you wish to plead for your lives, intruders,<br> you may do so in the depths of hell!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> We weren&#39;t talking to you!<br> Just shut up and give us a moment!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You underestimate me at your own... Hm?<br> Is that...?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Thank you, X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> You once shared a freshly baked red bean bun with me.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Now that I think of it, you&#39;ve always been giving me things, and you never once asked for anything in return.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always wanted to pay you back somehow.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh? I forgot all about that, but...okay?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> H-hey, why so close? This...uh...this isn&#39;t really the time to hug it out, I don&#39;t think...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Got you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Black Knight, would you might dunking her, please?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you say dunk!? W-well, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Stuff Heroine X into the machine)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;re you\u2013Ow!<br> Hey, quit shoving me... Gaaah!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What&#39;s the big idea!? What&#39;s all this freezing cold slimy stuff!? Aah, I&#39;m gonna die, I&#39;m gonna die, I&#39;m gonna die!!!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Ex, you traitor! You too, you overgrown bucket!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AX (Frozen):</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I can tell you&#39;re upset about this.<br> I&#39;m sorry, X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I wish I&#39;d found something that could have healed you, but I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> This is a flash-freezing device.<br> It&#39;s called a Carbon Coffin.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Even if I don&#39;t make it, I&#39;m sure someone from the school will find you, thaw you, and heal you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Even if the whole planet blows up,<br> you should still be fine...I think.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Okay, Black Knight. Send me my battle suit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> On it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you need to take off your glasses?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> These undulations... I knew it! It&#39;s Alternium!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the lost Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. successor.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I might be destined to join the League of Villains one day.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But that day...is not today.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...How dull. To think the Black Knight of the Round Table would be reduced to this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Any pride you had in infiltrating the enemy side is gone. Now you are ruled entirely by fleeting emotion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You are a traitor to our cause.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Not even the notorious League of Villains would take someone who threw everything into such disorder back.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You must be returned to them so that they can remind you of your place and put you back in it!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You can start by becoming one of the parts that makes up the mechanisms of my factory, like a drive shaft, or a heat source, or a distributor.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t even do that...then die!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> (Sniffle)... I see.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So the hero Servants were successful at bringing down Esaba and dealing a critical blow to the League of Villains.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> There are few things worse than a factory that makes evil robots. You did the right thing. The heroic thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Planet Esaba was destroyed in an explosion caused by the gravity fields colliding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And X and Ex were saved by freezing themselves in a Carbon Coffin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew... Talk about a close call!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Yes, it was. Oh, but we still wouldn&#39;t have made it back without Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t for his distress beacon, we would have been forever lost in the vacuum of space like so much debris.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I guess the reason I can&#39;t remember all that must be a side effect of the Coffin&#39;s freezing process...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Beep boop...<br> (I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not how it works...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm... Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Senpai?<br> Is there something strange about what she said?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It almost feels like my own memories don&#39;t quite match what we just heard...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? That must be a very odd sensation.<br> Maybe it&#39;s a kind of d\xE9j\xE0 vu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What makes you say that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, um, I guess it&#39;s just my Shielder Sense...?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> (Staaare)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Ex is looking at me veeery intently.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure everything is okay, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Perhaps all this Servantverse information is memetically corrupting [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} mind...?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You were definitely nodding off a bit there, Master.<br> Get it together, will you?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong><br> Yeah, for real, Mas\u2013<br> I mean, yes, you must do better.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I knew there was something suspicious about her!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Heh heh.<br> ...Shh. Let&#39;s just keep it our little secret.</p><p><strong>--FLASHBACK--:</strong></p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> This place won&#39;t hold much longer.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> But the battle seems to be going well.<br> I guess the principal&#39;s team must have handled it.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Huh? You found another Carbon Coffin?<br> Great job, Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Although... The thing is, that device needs a lot of careful adjustments.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> There wasn&#39;t any time for this with X, but someone&#39;s usually supposed to stay behind and operate it from the outside.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> If it&#39;s not handled properly, it can also lead to issues with memory retention....</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> Huh? You can handle those adjustments no problem?<br> And you can even do it from inside the Coffin?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I see. That would be perfect.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t have much time left...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> ...but I hope fate allows me just a little more.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong><br> May the Alternium be with you...</p>', 468);
