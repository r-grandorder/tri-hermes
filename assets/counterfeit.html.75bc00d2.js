It&#39;s just not possible,<br> but...this is without a doubt \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Wait, no. This is \u201Cme,\u201D and yet it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The skill is not all there, but the passion is.<br> That passion is forcing \u201Cme\u201D to become more like \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Actually, I&#39;m a little bit put off by this passion...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The passion on this canvas... It&#39;s like wearing layers of coats in the summer, with the heat on full blast, and eating hot udon all at the same time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How do I know!? That&#39;s because I&#39;m always a perver...<br> I mean, passionate!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, back on topic.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Curse you! Who would do something so blasphemous!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just sit around like this. At this rate, Romani will lecture me... I mean...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is a problem that could cause the Foundation of Humanity to collapse, thus creating a new Singularity!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay! Activating emergency alarm system!<br> Everyone, assemble!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Trace ...On.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... So this is how you create your twin blades.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was wondering how you get them back so fast every time they shatter.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.<br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yes. However, it&#39;s more accurate to say that I create a copy that&#39;s not better or worse than the original.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> No matter how similar it is to the real thing, it&#39;s never as strong. I guess fiction is too light to support the weight of reality.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Although my projections must be similar to the originals. However, even if I create an identical copy, it&#39;s no more than reflections on the surface of water.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They&#39;re nothing more than counterfeits, different from the originals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Different in what way?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It would take a while to explain everything, so let me skip that for now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> However, that doesn&#39;t mean the counterfeits will always perform worse than the originals, if we&#39;re just talking numbers.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If both of them perform equally well, it&#39;s not the \u201Cobjects\u201D themselves that decide which is better, but the \u201Caudience.\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not really a nice topic for the people who made the originals...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> However, humans are a species that constantly aims for the future. The concept of improvement is necessary to move forward.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Originals made from scratch are valuable, yes,<br> but so are the imitations derived from them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> My projections are just copies, but the imitations in this world are originals that have been developed further.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What starts from one expands out into infinite possibilities and shapes the future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s very deep.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s get back to cleaning the rooms.<br> Master, are you keeping your room clean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I always keep it clean.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Excellent. One&#39;s room is the reflection of their mind.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The fact that you keep your room tidy reflects your personality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sometimes it gets messy.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh, you mean at Halloween and Christmas?<br> Remember, one&#39;s room is the reflection of their mind.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> In other words, you are the type that gets excited whenever there&#39;s an event.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehehe, he&#39;s right on the spot, huh?<br> Senpai.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The emergency alarm...<br> Something is happening, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, is there an emergency?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry I&#39;m late!<br> What was that emergency alarm just now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You just got here?<br> Wait, aren&#39;t you the one who sounded the alarm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d feel better if that was me, but it wasn&#39;t.<br> Normally I&#39;d be tuning Chaldea&#39;s reactor at this hour.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, who could it be?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahem. Testing, testing! Testing, testing! As this is an emergency situation, I have taken over the intercom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Attention all Servants who can stand by and accept our Master&#39;s recklessness with a smile.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Empty your minds and come to my workshop immediately!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, you are to bring your weapons.<br> Oh, Romani is annoying so he can&#39;t come.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You have one minute!<br> Now hop to it!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hey, what happened?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It seems to be something she can&#39;t say for now. Anyway, let&#39;s head over there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, there you are! As expected, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I knew you&#39;d come, too, Mash! Hmm, and it looks like you&#39;ve also brought... Huh, only Emiya?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I thought surely seven nosy Servants would be lured here...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I think once they found out the alarm was from the Da Vinci Workshop, none of them wanted to come anymore.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I on the other hand was already talking to Fujimaru, so I simply tagged along.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whaaaaat? Am I really that unpopular?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course. Maybe you should change that attitude of yours. I heard even Dr. Tesla can understand other people&#39;s feelings more.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ugh. Romani. Why did you come? I told you not to!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you tell someone not to come, of course their curiosity will get the better of them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What did you do this time?<br> I may be a coward, but even I get mad sometimes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You misunderstand. This time it&#39;s not just my problem, but the entirety of Chaldea&#39;s problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This time?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Excuse me. This time, and every time.<br> I am your technical advisor, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sounds like trouble.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We&#39;re in such big trouble I feel like my rationality is gonna be gone like Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, there&#39;s no time. I will get to the point!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have reached the truth of this world.<br> At last, I have identified its lies!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, hello? Medical team? Do you have a spare bed?<br> We have a weirdo here who&#39;s gone insane.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you&#39;re not going to listen then leave!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Doctor, I know how you feel, but let&#39;s hear her out for now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Regardless of his personality, he\u2013 I mean she is the universal genius, Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> There has to be some truth in her words, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I suppose so, but...<br> That&#39;s what makes it worse.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, as expected from the Hero of Wrought Iron.<br> Nice save, Emiya!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Makers will never forget how to respect one another. Maybe Romani should show more respect for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would be an issue, Da Vinci.<br> Now, what do you mean by the world&#39;s lies?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right.<br> First, take a look at this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The infamous Mona Lisa!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha. I won&#39;t deny that. A lot of blood and money has been shed for this painting, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She has a smug look on her face for some reason, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s truly the center of deceit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How could you say that in front of the greatest painting in history? ...Well, I&#39;ll admit I made a ton of money copying and pasting the same painting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s admitting it, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha. Well, anyway.<br> This is indeed the Craft Essence, Mona Lisa.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, this one wasn&#39;t made by my workshop.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...I could tell. It&#39;s very well-done, but it&#39;s a counterfeit. It&#39;s very meticulous, but I can sense anger from it as well.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a step below the one created by Ms. Da Vinci, which costs more than a thousand Mana Prisms, a VERY VALUABLE magical resource.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I sense sarcasm in your words, but that&#39;s right!<br> This is a counterfeit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To think someone would... Copy! My! MONA LISA!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mean copy-and-paste!<br> Each was painted from scratch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s amazing.<br> I can&#39;t tell the difference at all.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You can spot a poorly made counterfeit from the technique.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a well-made counterfeit, you can naturally tell the difference from the aura it gives off.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> All creative works, not just swords, contain the ideals, emotions, and likes and dislikes of the one who made them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If one is desperate... No, if one puts their life on the line to feel the same way the original creator did, then it would be hard to tell the difference.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> This Mona Lisa...is incredible in its intensity and passion. Unfortunately, what it&#39;s lacking in is technique.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a rare counterfeit that seeks to make up for its lack of skill with passion. Usually it&#39;s the other way around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Indeed. By the way, is your class Artist?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s Archer. So, what&#39;s wrong with this counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a passionate follower, right? Isn&#39;t that what all creators want?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Actually... Mona Lisa hasn&#39;t been selling well lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Have they ever?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What? They did at one point?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> THEY DO SELL!<br> They&#39;re the biggest hit from my workshop!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But all of a sudden they stopped selling!<br> I thought it was strange and went to look, and found this!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> At first glance, they look the same and kinda have similar effects, but the price is only a tenth of the original!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you understand what I&#39;m trying to say now, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No one is buying Mona Lisa from Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to hear it...<br> But you&#39;re right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re useless now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The truth is so cruel...<br> But that&#39;s what will happen at this rate!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, right. So basically an underworld broker is selling better Craft Essences for cheaper than Da Vinci&#39;s workshop.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with that? You&#39;re supposed to be in charge of Sheba and the summoning system anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No one likes this workshop anyway,<br> so maybe you can just let the fake\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I will straight-up murder you, Romani.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, right! Sorry!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahem. Oopsies! My real personality came out\u2606<br> Back to what we were saying\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Listen. Whoever&#39;s making this counterfeit is undeniably evil!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (...I don&#39;t know. It feels twisted, but the passion within it is pure...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And so, Fujimaru, I want you to find out who&#39;s making these...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and defeat them, no questions asked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Finding and arresting an underworld broker?<br> That doesn&#39;t sound like Senpai&#39;s job...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, it most certainly is Fujimaru&#39;s job.<br> I mean, whoever is doing it can only be evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They must be the kind of demon that&#39;s filled with enough maliciousness to destroy this world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;re probably the strongest enemy you&#39;ve ever faced, but don&#39;t worry! This time... I&#39;ll be going with you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gwah!? No, no! What are you saying, Leonardo?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea needs you! If you&#39;re defeated, our effectiveness will drop by half!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As the person in charge here, I can&#39;t allow that!<br> You can&#39;t leave over something that doesn&#39;t matter...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm?<br> It doesn&#39;t matter, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014R-Right. Art is at the core of your soul, huh?<br> I&#39;ll get the Rayshift ready.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weak...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Da Vinci for you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Doctor...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Well, I can&#39;t think of a way to stop Leonardo if she&#39;s already this angry...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And to tell the truth, we can&#39;t ignore the question of where these counterfeits are coming from.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh, right. I had a pressure cooker running in my room. The beef for my stew should be done now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey! Emiya!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Tch! I was too late!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Emiya-senpai, you were trying to run, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> No... I wasn&#39;t... Fine, I was.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that I&#39;m busy. I have to tune my weapons, clean my room, chat with the operator girl...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> As you can see, a Servant has many duties.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good point, but I&#39;ve already finished cleaning all the rooms.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> W-Well... You see...<br> These kind of events aren&#39;t really my forte...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master, Emiya-senpai!<br> Let&#39;s go on a journey to find the counterfeits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The more, the merrier! Right now the more sensible Servants around the better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t had this bad a feeling since that space rocket! For Senpai&#39;s sake too! Please!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> So you&#39;re asking not for your own sake, but your Master&#39;s... In that case...Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash is really growing up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash. You&#39;re so dependable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well done, Mash. We can all suffer together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. All I can do right now is keep you safe!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Humph. Very well. I give up.<br> I&#39;ll go with you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> So? Where are we going first?<br> You must have some idea, Ms. Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course. Just leave that to me! Okay, Roman, I&#39;m going to borrow the Rayshift for a bit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. With Fujimaru&#39;s help we can solve this is no time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Off to the Rayshift we go!<br> Wow, my first Rayshift! I&#39;m so nervous!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now, after tracing and observing the Spiritron information on the counterfeits, I&#39;ve concluded they came from these coordinates in this era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm, it&#39;s been so long since I stepped outside of Chaldea. The feeling of dirt, the breeze on my cheeks...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to be alive, isn&#39;t it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Come, come, let&#39;s go find that jerk who&#39;s making all the counterfeits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci&#39;s really excited!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She&#39;s been cooped up in her workshop until now.<br> She&#39;s probably both an indoor and outdoor person.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start by heading for the town.<br> The first thing we need is information.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything wrong with the town. It&#39;s very peaceful and pleasant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s start with something basic.<br> We&#39;ll show the counterfeit to someone passing by.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Excuse me!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Get &#39;em\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That escalated quickly!<br> Let&#39;s finish this and go home!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> What is this sudden attempt at arrest?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Every fight has its reasons.<br> Even if we are in the wrong, shouldn&#39;t you tell us why!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Some truths can only be found through dialogue!<br> Let&#39;s talk about this! That&#39;s how I win!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I already know that talking with you is a trap that we can&#39;t fall into!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> What... Have we done business together once before!?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> So it seems... How sad... Trust is such a fragile thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Quite the contrary!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Master!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hmm... If conversation is impossible, I suppose I&#39;ll act like a politician, and settle things by force.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Because I&#39;d like to get rid of the negative image that<br> \u201Cif anything bad happens, it&#39;s probably Caesar!\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I agree, Caesar.<br> I, P, know exactly how you feel.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I&#39;m opposed to violence, but I will join in the fight.<br> Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s possible to brainwash them mid-battle.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I want to say this loud and clear!<br> We are innocent\u2013!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, making someone laugh before battle is not right!<br> I almost dropped my staff!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How can you honestly claim that you&#39;re innocent?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re one to talk, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not exactly innocent either!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> We swear we&#39;re innocent!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caesar, is that true?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It&#39;s true!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Selling those counterfeits for cheap wouldn&#39;t bring in any money anyway.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> First I&#39;d tell the customer that I&#39;m offering the real Mona Lisas! Then I&#39;d buy up all of the Craft Essences from Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Why? Because as long as I&#39;ve got the real ones with me, the customers would be willing to pay full price...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> without having to worry about them being fakes!<br> To just distribute the counterfeits for free like that\u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I swear to you on my very soul.<br> I would never do something so wasteful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This Caesar is also the real thing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Indeed. He knows that trust is the strongest foundation for a business.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> P, are you trying to do what you think&#39;s best, again?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Even if I did make Mona Lisa counterfeits... I don&#39;t think that would have any good effect on the world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The Mona Lisa is the pinnacle of art.<br> Not many paintings share that same level of fame.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Degrading it to the level of counterfeits is unthinkable even in the world of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...However, if something can be created by sacrificing the original, I guess that would be all right...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t be all right!<br> My heart would sustain heavy damage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But... I guess the two of them aren&#39;t behind the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry...we got ahead of ourselves.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Humph. Don&#39;t be sad, oh girl who is plump and firm in a different way than me.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> After all, we secretly Rayshifted here because we heard about the rumors of the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I thought I could use Paracelsus as a decoy and brought him here... Hahaha, I didn&#39;t expect to get caught before we split up.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It&#39;s embarrassing, but I thought the same thing.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I was going to stand behind Caesar and use Sword P to get rid of both him and the counterfeiter.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I think that mage over there needs to reconsider what \u201Cembarrassing\u201D means... Anyway...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For now, we&#39;re the ones asking questions. I would have you tell us everything you know about the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> We&#39;re sure there&#39;s a group of counterfeiters in this town. My \u201Cmoney sensor\u201D tells me so.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> But there&#39;s one problem. I&#39;m told a Servant is running the counterfeiter&#39;s workshop.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A-A Servant!<br> ...I see. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But who could it be? Michelangelo? Raphael?<br> Or perhaps... Donatello?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s so many...<br> Him? Her? Who?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I can guess what kind of relationships Leonardo da Vinci had in life.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who it is myself.<br> Their workshop is here. Go pay them a visit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, thanks!<br> Off to the counterfeiter&#39;s workshop, everyone!</p><h2 id="section-1-counterfeit-the-innocent-boy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-counterfeit-the-innocent-boy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Counterfeit &quot;The Innocent Boy&quot;</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost there.<br> I&#39;m picking up multiple enemy signals.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Be careful!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yuck. It looks just like my workshop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And it&#39;s not just the Mona Lisa...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re right! The Annunciation, the Vitruvian Man...<br> Even the Last Supper!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They&#39;re better preserved than the ones that exist now in 2018.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm?

Yes, this one&#39;s mine.<br> However, this one&#39;s a counterfeit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This one is the real one, and that one over there is a fake... Master, I can&#39;t tell the difference at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me neither.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right? I doubt even the counterfeiter would be able to tell either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can kind of tell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow, Master...<br> You&#39;ve got the sharpest eye in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci stretch for thousands of pages, and that&#39;s just what exists now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It also uses mirror writing, which means making a counterfeit must&#39;ve required a ton of effort.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I can understand the reason behind the Mona Lisa and the other paintings, but why the manuscripts?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s take them all with us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? All of them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One or two wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but to take all of these back with us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What a pain!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you take them back for me,<br> I&#39;ll trade them for items in my workshop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Get them loaded up!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You guys change your mind fast, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt you when you&#39;re working, but I&#39;m seeing enemies! Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy signals detected!<br> They seem...different than normal enemies!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. In terms of strength, they&#39;re no different than regular enemies.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u2013Let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now I&#39;m seeing a Servant!<br> It&#39;s close!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm?<br> No, what is this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Servant... But it looks a little crude.<br> Like parts of it are patched together.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Crude?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Shadow Servant is literally a fake\u2014a shadow modeled after a Heroic Spirit&#39;s Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is just \u201Csomething very similar.\u201D It&#39;s a well-made Spirit Origin down to the details, but...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Should we call it a counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...That explains it. No wonder something didn&#39;t feel right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> In other words, you&#39;re not exactly a pure Servant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Alexander the Great...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> We are counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We&#39;re Servants, yet we are neither pure Servants nor pure heroes.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Go easy on me, okay\u2661</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So beautiful... His smile is so beautiful!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The spitting image of an enchanting young boy.<br> Any opinions as an artist?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2013I&#39;m in love. I&#39;d like to draw his naked body.<br> No, I want to get naked and draw him!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...I see. Do it in a dimensional rift so you don&#39;t bother anyone.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Okay, Alexander.<br> Tell us who made you and what your goal is.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I won&#39;t hurt you. I may not look it, but I&#39;m a man who understands counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> You&#39;re lying, mister!<br> You&#39;re going to hurt me, I know it!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Once you get the information you&#39;ll kill me in a heartbeat, won&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What kind of barbarian do you think I am?<br> I&#39;ll capture you, but after that, it&#39;s up to you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For one thing, your body is...<br> No, I won&#39;t say it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re well aware.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Yup. No need to bring that up.<br> I don&#39;t worry about that kind of stuff at all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> What&#39;s required from me now is innocence and purity. That&#39;s what will bring her peace.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> On the other hand, that also means all she wanted was my abilities, without any unnecessary elements.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> But I guess that&#39;s fun in its own way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CShe\u201D?<br> Who can that be...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Too bad! That&#39;s a secret!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I mean, right now I am \u201Ca talented little stepbrother who adores the big sister living with him!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh?<br> I&#39;m sorry, what?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Heheh! It&#39;s so romantic, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> To be honest, I didn&#39;t quite get that backstory either, but it&#39;s a very girly wish!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Come on, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 lady]\u2661<br> It&#39;s time for war!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That intensity. Those words. Even if you are a counterfeit, you are the man who&#39;ll someday become the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Very well.<br> Let&#39;s fight him, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hmm... I guess that&#39;s it, then.<br> Hahaha! I figured it would be hard to actually win.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> To get so close and still be so far...<br> That&#39;s what is sad about being a fake, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true. It was a fight between Servants,<br> and you lost. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> \u2014As expected.<br> Real Heroic Spirits are always so amazing, huh?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, how I enjoyed that... A young man, his trained biceps pushed to the limit... Wonderful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci&#39;s being weird...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Look. She may be real, but look at her. It&#39;s fine to worry about where you came from, but stupid to compare it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Whatever. Thanks for the nice speech.<br> In exchange, I&#39;ll tell you what you want to know, I guess.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> But all I can really tell you is your next destination.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> There are counterfeit workshops all over the place.<br> They&#39;re spreading fakes of Da Vinci&#39;s works little by little.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t know what her goal is,<br> not in the slightest!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Why? Because my job&#39;s to be innocent! I haven&#39;t been told anything about what goes on behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out.<br> But it would be rude to tell.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Roger.<br> I see you&#39;re not going to talk no matter what.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> We&#39;re in a hurry...but do you need me to finish you off?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Hmm, nope, I guess.<br> I hate sympathy.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I don&#39;t... Neither does she. I&#39;m a fake, so I&#39;ll just disappear when my expiration date arrives.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sadder than you thought?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, yes!<br> I really don&#39;t know what to feel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this supposed to be serious?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A bit, yeah.<br> A king once said...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u201CDon&#39;t give objects hearts.\u201D<br> Perhaps that was his way of being kind.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, all done!<br> Pretty boys are the best!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like a fairy that&#39;s all exterior and no interior,<br> elegantly flitting about the world!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, how I hope that it can express even half of his beauty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Da Vinci is going to be able to help us with much, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Emiyan is our only help!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Leave it to me!<br> I never have big successes, but I always get the job done.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Anyway...

Are you okay, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just fine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> An outdoors type, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My reindeer experience is helping.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I see...

I&#39;m seeing enemies.<br> Looks like they&#39;re trying to surround you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Ahem!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Let&#39;s break through. We&#39;ll hit the enemies where their number is few. Is everyone ready?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey Roman.<br> Analyze this homunculus for me, would you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You always make me do everything, don&#39;t you...<br> Fine, I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. This one&#39;s different, too.<br> It&#39;s similar to a homunculus, but different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Another counterfeit, huh...<br> All right, let&#39;s get moving.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve confirmed this homunculus is a counterfeit, we know we&#39;re heading in the right direction.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh, there you are!<br> Hey, original Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Does that mean you&#39;re another counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You too, Hektor\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Well, Servants are basically counterfeits to begin with. So it would make me happy if you would just let me go.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s not possible.<br> You&#39;re still spreading the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Are heroes of justice always this stubborn?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> How about it, Master?<br> I think you&#39;re likely to be a bit more flexible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell me what your goal is.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> My goal? My goal, huh... Well, if I really have to say, it&#39;s to pat her head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> My job is to spoil her.<br> The role of Hektor is\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> \u201CA friendly, free-spirited older man who&#39;s back from overseas, who may or may not be related by blood!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Too long!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Wow. Wait, where&#39;s the \u201Coverseas\u201D part coming from?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Stop it. Delving into vague backstories is a good way to get burned.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Basically, she wants someone who cares. Someone gentle and sweet, who does whatever she says.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> First Alexander, now this... Seems their Master must be a bit of a spoiled child.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> A spoiled child, huh? But isn&#39;t that kind of what makes her adorable?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> When a spoiled child is demanding, it means they&#39;re testing your trust. And they&#39;re doing that because they&#39;re scared.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that kind of cute?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. So a dandy-type Heroic Spirit who spoils you, huh... It works!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It does not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That aside, these particular counterfeits are unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Look at these Mona Lisas here that just got finished!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What I hate isn&#39;t the skill, it&#39;s the passion!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Skill-wise, it&#39;s still just an inferior copy, but the passion is real. But she&#39;s not trying to imitate me!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Instead of putting in the passion to imitate me,<br> she&#39;s starting to put it towards surpassing me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh, so you noticed, huh?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Her skills are a little inferior, but when mixed with her passion, they make it seem like the real thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s the type of counterfeits that you can&#39;t just ignore. \u2013I assume you&#39;re ready, Hektor?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Right, right. I figured this was coming. Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I may be a counterfeit, but I&#39;ll give it my all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Tch... Fine, I lost.<br> I guess this is as far as a counterfeit can go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, Hektor.<br> You didn&#39;t lose because you&#39;re a counterfeit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You lost because you&#39;re weak.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Wow, aren&#39;t you harsh!?<br> But well, that makes me feel better.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> All right, next time I challenge you I&#39;ll be stronger.<br> See ya!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Heh. He may joke around, but his spear was sharp and struck hard. Carelessness could have meant our end.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The way he talks is an important part of his defenses.<br> That&#39;s why the great hero Achilles kept his distance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A passionate counterfeit...<br> One that seeks to surpass the original...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s what happens if you do it for a while.<br> Most counterfeiters eventually end up like that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They stop making copies, and even trying to become like the original. They try to surpass them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure who their Master is, but I&#39;m sure her feelings are real.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci, is there anything else you can learn from those counterfeits?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...<br> ...(lick)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She licked it!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From the taste of the paint...<br> We should go to the beach next, maybe?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The beach!?</p><h2 id="section-3-counterfeit-the-humble-yet-powerful-dragon-slayer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-counterfeit-the-humble-yet-powerful-dragon-slayer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Counterfeit &quot;The Humble Yet Powerful Dragon Slayer&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What does the beach have to do with that paint?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I tasted calcium carbonate.<br> Maybe they made some of the paint from shells?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So we&#39;re here at the beach! Now, who&#39;s that fake Servant behind door number three!?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sorry-looking fella right there is\u2014<br> Siegfried?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Wait, Mash! Don&#39;t get close to him! He&#39;s a counterfeit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But that&#39;s Siegfried!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s the humblest, meekest, and most polite Saber in the entire world!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if he&#39;s a counterfeit Heroic Spirit, that shouldn&#39;t change.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I am very sorry that we have to fight...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> NOT!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did you say!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No way...

I&#39;m a counterfeit after all. If the original is humble, I must surpass it with my pride to defeat my opponents.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> For one thing, isn&#39;t it rude to tell someone you&#39;re sorry when you&#39;re not?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He&#39;s right. A very arrogant comment, but he&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He&#39;s a counterfeit trying to surpass the original, but he&#39;s still kind of humble at his core!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s just who Siegfried is!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> \u2014I am the strongest dragon, descending on a beach beneath the crescent moon. I have nothing to apologize for.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Instead, be bold. Be bolder\u2014<br> That&#39;s what she whispers to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She, huh? Hmm, and it&#39;s not like she has something against me, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or actually, I don&#39;t think she does. If she hated me, she&#39;d be a little more clingy, or sticky\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s best to say that she&#39;s dry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A dried-up fresco. It lasts for a century,<br> but will never change.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s why you&#39;re the most famous artist in the world. You&#39;re very perceptive. I commend you for that.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean I can tell you anything. I&#39;m sor...<br> No, you&#39;re my enemy, so I&#39;m not sorry at all.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Kindness towards an enemy can only be shown if you have the strength to spare it, and I do not.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s fight, Fujimaru!

I agree.<br> Quite vexing.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> First of all, the fact that it is impossible to communicate is quite a problem.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that she can&#39;t perceive data from the five senses, it&#39;s that she doesn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that she&#39;s blind or deaf, it&#39;s that she doesn&#39;t try to see or listen.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The trouble is that she possesses top-class abilities.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Well, never mind her.<br> \u2013It looks like they are still alive.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think either of us held back.<br> ...Should we have used our Noble Phantasms?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just that Demi-Servant, Mash!

Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, you two.<br> Can I ask a question?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh, and what would that be?<br> I don&#39;t mind answering if it&#39;s something I know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to tell me about the relationship between you and your Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If my speculation is correct,<br> both of you were assigned a role, yes?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re quite perceptive.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> What was your role again? She was using some kind of slang, like \u201Ctsun\u201D or \u201Csadistic\u201D or something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tsun... Sadistic?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Slang... I think that means...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I shall explain my role once and only once.<br> I am\u2013</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> \u201Ca very sadistic science major upperclassman who gets all lovey-dovey when it matters most.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sadistic\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Who gets all lovey-dovey when it matters most\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Upperclassman... Science major?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s the white coat...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Such a simplistic thought process...is quite plausible...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That makes so much sense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So... What about you, Arash?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh me? I hope you&#39;ll find mine surprising and amusing!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I am the \u201Colder childhood friend who&#39;s an humanities major and lives next door!\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Older childhood friend\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Humanities major\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And lives next door\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> While we&#39;re on the topic, Siegfried was \u201Cthe friendly class celebrity who, by coincidence, sits next to you in class.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Class celebrity!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s enough.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> At any rate, both of you were born as counterfeit Heroic Spirits and assigned specific roles.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Alexander, Hektor, Siegfried,<br> Arjuna, and Arash.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Each of you consoled your Master in your own way, showering her with affection.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why you were summoned?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, whether it&#39;s for money or some other objective, your Master has been pirating my works.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hmm... You&#39;re a bit off the mark.<br> But close enough, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Arash. Isn&#39;t this the time to pretend like you know a little less?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s no big deal. We&#39;ve done what we&#39;re supposed to.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> The moment our Master began to forge counterfeits,<br> she was no doubt aware how it would all turn out.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t quite agree.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Whether Chaldea wants to track down the counterfeits or not, their priority right now should be restoring the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It&#39;s unnecessary to solve an issue that wouldn&#39;t even turn into a Singularity. In that case... You there, that Master! Won&#39;t you make a deal with me?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear that we&#39;re stronger.<br> If you withdraw now, we won&#39;t attack you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s a fair deal myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, it&#39;s you who must decide.<br> We will obey your decision.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I guess this is it. It bothers me that so many counterfeits are being circulated...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But it doesn&#39;t make any sense to put Fujimaru at risk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I agree.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sad that my works will remain obscure...<br> But, I guess it can&#39;t be helped!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I mean, humanity is at stake here. If there are no human beings left to appreciate my art, what&#39;s the point?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Art is only a visual depiction of this world&#39;s phenomena and truths that are already beautiful as they are.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But art is how I make my living. It is the reason for my existence. I was born for art.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, ultimately, as long as no one interferes with my artistic work, I am content.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If anyone loudly condemns my work to be a sham, I can proudly claim otherwise.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can say, \u201CI am the one who created this work!\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Romani, sorry to be so selfish.<br> Prepare to Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay. Well, I&#39;d expect no less of a conclusion from you, Leonardo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait a second!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What...w-why!? I told you I&#39;m fine.<br> I can create new works of art.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want to see Da Vinci&#39;s real works.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...You heard that, Da Vinci.<br> Our Master can be quite reckless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how Senpai is!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Either way, I&#39;m not that weak to a point of asking my enemies for mercy. Arash, Arjuna... Ready your bows.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Hah hah hah! Your Master is quite bold. I wish we could provide you with some of our Master&#39;s sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> \u2013But...a battle is a battle.<br> We won&#39;t hold back.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So you don&#39;t need mercy from us, huh? Such an endearing fool, but\u2013you&#39;ve made a grave mistake.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> My name is Arjuna.<br> With this arrow, you will all scatter like a flower&#39;s petals!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Ah dammit. I lost...<br> I didn&#39;t think I pulled any punches but...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So a counterfeit&#39;s utmost effort wasn&#39;t enough to defeat an original, huh... No...authenticity isn&#39;t the problem here.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> We lost to you.<br> And that is all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I suppose we don&#39;t have to run around the world anymore. She&#39;s at an art museum, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m not about to confess to that!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Arash is right. You should find that out yourself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Leonardo da Vinci. History&#39;s greatest artist, known worldwide for your works.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Right. I don&#39;t want you to meet her.<br> However, if you do happen to run into her...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Witness the truth with your own eyes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ve come this far.<br> All that&#39;s left is to go meet the boss\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Will you come with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see.<br> One more thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Thanks...for what you did earlier.<br> Hah, it&#39;s kind of awkward to directly thank someone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing this...<br> Da Vinci...seems...to be...embarrassed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, do not ruin a nice moment.

Oh, it&#39;s also good for giving her acupuncture.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never let you give me a massage again!<br> Look! Look what you did to me!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s... Hm. I was going to keep my mouth shut, but let me correct you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Listen, Holy Maiden of Vengeance.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Wh-What do you want?<br> Talking like that, you must be a womanizer.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hahaha. All right, now I won&#39;t hold anything back.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You summoned seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits.<br> No, you made them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That was revenge for Orleans, yes?<br> But this time, your wishes are mixed in there.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Why are most of the counterfeit Heroic Spirits handsome men? Why didn&#39;t you rely on your general, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The answer is clear. You just haven&#39;t realized it yourself. Deep inside that consciousness is a desire to be the protagonist!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nonsense! If that&#39;s the case, how do you explain this perverted woman!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> What... Perverted? What a passionate comment... (Blush)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Die of dehydration!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Aaah! Love is painfully hot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Even I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you just wanted \u201Can honest friend who&#39;s the same sex as you\u201D right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u2014!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Annoying.<br> You people are truly annoying.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I am a lone Avenger. The counterfeits are only pawns. If I don&#39;t like them, I will crush them without a second thought.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come at me. I will show you even a counterfeit can surpass the original!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Here she comes. Your orders, please, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Somehow we managed to take down Brynhild, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Jeanne Alter is still a threat!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> We just need one more push.<br> You can do it, Master!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...I failed. Master, sorry I couldn&#39;t be of use to you...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> I could tell from watching your struggle up close.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Your lack of ability is my responsibility.<br> I wasn&#39;t able to summon you into a proper form.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you blame me before you die, like the others?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Well, heh-heh.<br> You still don&#39;t get it, do you, Master?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> \u2013I enjoyed myself.<br> I had so much fun.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> We&#39;re counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We&#39;ve been able to indulge in the vice, masochism, and folly that our true personalities never could.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Thanks to you, Master, I&#39;ve had a ridiculously good time.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> You gave us so much pleasure.<br> Why would we blame you?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> The emotions you gave us, the fictional backstory... they&#39;re no more than a starting point.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> We began there,<br> and fell in love with you along the way.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.<br> Goodbye, Big Sister\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So one left, huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru, how do you think we should solve this commotion?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Think about that.</p><h2 id="final-section-counterfeit-the-avenger-who-turned-her-back-on-original-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-section-counterfeit-the-avenger-who-turned-her-back-on-original-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Section: Counterfeit &quot;The Avenger Who Turned Her Back on Original Works&quot;</h2><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.<br> Goodbye, Big Sister\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> Humph. What a joke.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It sounded to me like she was being honest.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s a joke. I created the seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits as pawns for my amusement.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> They have no respect, affection, or trust.<br> After all, we came into this world as fakes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Sigh. Even with your back against the wall,<br> you haven&#39;t realized your true feelings. Unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Dark Jeanne d&#39;Arc. Let&#39;s set aside counterfeit paintings and sculptures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As far as counterfeit Heroic Spirits go, you&#39;re on the right track. You said your goal was to surpass the original...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but you&#39;ve already created counterfeits that surpass the originals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, the originals are bound by their sense of heroism. Fujimaru, don&#39;t you agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They all looked like they were having a good time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What are you talking about, \u201Ca good time?\u201D<br> Don&#39;t make me laugh. It couldn&#39;t have been fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> None of them complained.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ridiculous. What are you saying?<br> They must have felt bitter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I summoned them by force, but wasn&#39;t satisfied,<br> so I even altered their parameters.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> They may have acted as my subordinates on the surface, but must have despised me on the inside!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Listen, I&#39;m Leonardo da Vinci,<br> creator of many original works.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you think I can&#39;t tell whether something is genuine or fake? They sincerely enjoyed themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well more than the original Servants at that.<br> They had concern for and deeply cared about you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What Fujimaru said is important, too.<br> This is a Master who has been through many scenes of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] said it best. There was nothing false about those counterfeit Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Look, even if you don&#39;t believe me,<br> you can believe Fujimaru, can&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know!<br> I don&#39;t understand any of this!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I mean... There&#39;s nothing lovable about me!<br> I have no charm! I&#39;m a helplessly twisted little girl!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> All I have is power, so much so you want to throw up! But can you blame me!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I have! I&#39;m driven to seek revenge and it&#39;s all that I have!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2013Yes. That&#39;s okay, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whether you&#39;re lovable or charming or worthy of being a Servant...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ve given a lot of thought to those things, but your conclusion is confusing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since long ago, you&#39;ve understood.<br> You&#39;re a girl who burns with vengeance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You should have gone big with that wicked power of yours. You should have become an Anti-Hero.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And then you should&#39;ve been summoned here like that, as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Humph. After all this time, I wouldn&#39;t have the nerve\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I would welcome you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Think about it, you half-wit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Welcome to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you need any processing time?<br> Are you a calculator?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whether you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit or an Anti-Hero, Fujimaru is the perfect five-star Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, what are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s my loss.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You admit defeat?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I will admit my defeat, with one exception.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I admit to an inferiority complex over that Holy Maiden.<br> I admit to a craving to be sought after.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I admit to having smoldering hatred in my heart even now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And I admit that no matter how much success I achieve, how many lives I save\u2014 I&#39;ll always be an Avenger who is never satisfied.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But even so, with all the sins this hopeless Avenger has committed,</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> if you still wish for this strength, this flag of hatred, I will respond to your summon, last Master of the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... You did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s go ho\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s begin our final battle to the death!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-Huh!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What? Demi-Servant, why are you looking at me with wide eyes? We&#39;re going to fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? But...<br> Didn&#39;t you just surrender!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u2013No, I did no such thing. Don&#39;t tell me you thought I would just go off to Chaldea with you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I did. Or at least I don&#39;t think a duel to the death is necessary.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It is. After all, you people defeated my pawns.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> As the one who stands above all counterfeit Heroic Spirits, I will never back down from a fight. I will fight with all my strength. That&#39;s nonnegotiable.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> After all\u2014 I&#39;m an exceptionally wicked Heroic Spirit. You think I&#39;d let someone who defied me get away so easily?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. Just what we need.<br> Somebody with pride in being an evil leader.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Only one thing to do.<br> Give up and fight, Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> But look at the bright side.<br> This will be our last fight with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru.<br> I mean Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you already realize this.<br> She needs this fight more than anyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If we blew it off here, she would have a lifelong grudge against you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I mean... Put it this way. Scary as she is, you would hate for that to happen, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Get ready to fight!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Oui.<br> Yes, that&#39;s it. That impudent expression!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> How many times did I want to make you kneel in Orleans?! How many times did I want to trample you!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> \u2013It&#39;s time to hit the dirt, originals!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!<br> Here come the remaining enemies too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight, ready for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Ahhh, that wasn&#39;t enough, huh?<br> But that&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It was fun, just like that horror movie woman said.<br> I had a lot of fun!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s why this story and I shall end here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Ahhh, this is so vexing!<br> But that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The future me will form a bond with you. The current me will have a hearty laugh and go off into the sunset.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the future me won&#39;t have any memories of being a counterfeit Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> So the current me at least wanted to make one last memory\u2013 So I wouldn&#39;t be lonely.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I guess it&#39;s about time.<br> Good. You&#39;ve embarrassed me enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;d better take full responsibility...<br> Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master. We&#39;ve recovered a fragment of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just as Elisabeth retrieved a Holy Grail fragment back in Orleans...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...it seems Jeanne Alter also obtained a fragment from somewhere.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Her elimination is confirmed.<br> Now there&#39;s no more danger of counterfeit proliferation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good work. You can come back now. Although you could also retrieve the remaining counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Master, you were right. Sometimes there are people who just need to be defeated.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> There are people who can&#39;t admit defeat and move on until it&#39;s too late.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She had to be defeated precisely because she has gained the qualification to be summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. There are people in this world who need to be defeated before they can move forward.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, shall we go home? For a shut-in like me, the turmoil this time was a lot to bear!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think you should get some exercise once in a while, Da Vinci, instead of tinkering with your strange inventions all the time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Huh? I use an exercise bike in my room so I don&#39;t particularly need more exercise than this.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Why, I got a clear understanding of just how athletic you are. To think you were good at close combat...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> As soon as we get back, King Leonidas and I will come up with a training menu to make you fit enough to stand on the front line.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want a total muscle-building menu!<br> If I get muscles, I&#39;ll lose this golden ratio!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. A little training and we&#39;ll send you to the front. I bet you&#39;re looking forward to that day, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to have her on the team.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A bulked-up Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You can forget about that idea!<br> I&#39;m not ready to go anywhere!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unless something dire happens, I&#39;m not going to the front! Keep that in miiiiiiind!</p>', 978);
