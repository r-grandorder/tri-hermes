Um, it was already morning when I noticed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It can&#39;t be helped because you&#39;re injured. I went to wake you up earlier, but you didn&#39;t even show signs of waking up.

You don&#39;t have to make breakfast. Just go back to your room and lie down. You have a high fever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...?

We have to eat breakfast before we go to school.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura still hasn&#39;t grasped the situation.</p><p>All her energy must have been a result of the fever.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re not going to school. You&#39;re resting in your room today. I&#39;ll let the school know. I&#39;m going to see Fuji-Nee in class, so I&#39;ll tell her then.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m not going to school?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. Who else would it be?

This fever will go away if I do...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Such a thing won&#39;t happen, you idiot. You&#39;re being absurd, Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m not being absurd!</p><p>You&#39;re the one being reckless. I&#39;m feeling perfectly fine, and you&#39;re injured! But I&#39;m the only one staying home? That&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... Whoa, Sakura!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;H\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015uh? That&#39;s strange, Senpai.

Look, I&#39;m going to make you stay home today no matter what. I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like it or not, but you&#39;ll end up staying home tomorrow too if you use up extra energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......But, Senpai. I... have to... go to school.&quot;</p><p>Delirious, Sakura punctuates her sentence with ragged breaths.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Ignoring her, I lift her up and head to the guest room.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s already asleep when I get there.</p><p>But she must still be semi-conscious.</p><p>She&#39;s breathing painfully and takes a firm grip on my arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I lay her on the bed.</p><p>&quot;Oh...

I guess I&#39;ll have to ask their housekeeper.&quot;</p><p>...I can&#39;t change her clothes or wipe her down.</p><hr><p>Her breathing has calmed down since she is lying down, so she should get better with some fever medicine.</p><p>Once she can walk again, I can take her to the hospital to go get some medicine.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. I&#39;m going to go get someone, so sleep until then. You&#39;re familiar with Fuji-Nee&#39;s housekeeper, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no reply.</p><p>Her breathing still sounds painful, but it seems she&#39;s asleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew. You&#39;re obstinate in weird ways, Sakura. Why do you want to go to school so bad?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m just talking to myself.</p><p>I know there won&#39;t be a reply because Sakura&#39;s asleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;Bye. I&#39;m going to school.&quot;</p><p>I step away from the bed and head to the door.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>&quot;...I want to go to school with you, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>I hear her answer.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...?&quot;</p><p>I turn around.</p><p>Sakura is still asleep, and her eyes are closed painfully.</p><p>&quot;...Oh, she&#39;s just talking in her sleep.&quot;</p><hr><p>I leave the guest room.</p><p>On my way out...</p><hr><p>&quot;......Because I have to protect Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says this in feverish tones.</p><hr><p>I drop by Fuji-Nee&#39;s place on my way to school to have their housekeeper come by.</p><p>I sometimes forget because Fuji-Nee&#39;s not the type to dress up, but the Fujimura family is one of the richest households around here.</p><hr><p>It has dozens of scary-looking people that call themselves company employees even though it&#39;s not even a company.</p><p>Many of them live in the outbuilding, so they are a large family.</p><p>So there are many housekeepers, and one will be free to spare if I ask.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>I get one of the emergency housekeepers, who took care of my place a few times before Sakura started coming over.</p><p>She&#39;s acquainted with Sakura, so I can trust her to take care of her.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-report-rin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-report-rin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Report Rin</h2><p>It&#39;s lunchtime.</p><p>In accordance with our agreement, I meet up with Tohsaka on the rooftop and tell her what happened last night.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015And the result is...</p><hr><p>&quot;Then what!?</p><p>Matou Zouken is Assassin&#39;s Master, and he tried to kill you and not Saber!?&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka getting really angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s right. What&#39;s with you all of a sudden?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not sudden!</p><p>From what I heard, Zouken tried to kill you after Saber was defeated. That&#39;s strange. The process is wrong no matter how you look at it!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka leans forward and glares at me.</p><p>I back up just a few centimeters because of her attitude, but we&#39;re sitting in our spot behind the water tower.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Are you listening to me, Emiya-kun? Didn&#39;t you think something was strange about what you told me?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka Rin glares at me in dissatisfaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p><p>...As if her attitude wasn&#39;t bad enough, now she&#39;s getting right in my face.</p><p>This space is small, so there&#39;s no room for me to back up.</p><p>I&#39;m like a mouse in a trap. There&#39;s nowhere for me to run.</p><hr><p>&quot;Umm...... What was strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s the priorities. Zouken didn&#39;t try to kill you, even though you two were alone.</p><p>It was fortunate that Assassin was able to beat Saber, but there was also a chance of Assassin&#39;s defeat. Zouken should&#39;ve tried to kill you, Saber&#39;s Master, as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that&#39;s true.</p><p>But maybe Zouken was confident that Assassin could beat Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No way. Even you could tell that Assassin was weaker, right? Then Zouken definitely wouldn&#39;t gamble like that.</p><p>...I bet he had a reason not to kill you.</p><p>Well, I can think of two reasons.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Two...?

Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what Rider is thinking, but Shinji still thinks I&#39;m a Master.</p><p>Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015that must be why he kidnapped Sakura.</p><p>In short, this phone call is to...</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.</p><p>I won&#39;t do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. You want me to fight you without Saber, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow, you&#39;re pretty bright today. Look, we&#39;ll fight at school. I&#39;ll give Sakura back to you if you come alone.</p><p>...Oh, but don&#39;t try to pull any shit with me. Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I&#39;ll know right away if you bring Saber along.</p><p>If that happens\u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t guarantee what&#39;ll happen to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ow...!&quot;</p><p>I hear a sound of him kicking something.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll go right away. Don&#39;t do anything else to Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hah...! Fine, I&#39;ll take that exchange.</p><p>But still, didn&#39;t you take your time coming home?</p><p>You say not to do anything else to Sakura, but even I can&#39;t think of any other things to do to her that I haven&#39;t already tried.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What did you do to Sakura, Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? I got bored with punching her, so I gave her to Rider. It&#39;s just like that night. Rider bit Sakura&#39;s neck and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I smack down the receiver.</p><p>&quot;You did it, Shinji.&quot;</p><p>I can still hear his laugh.</p><p>I set off for school, my nerves blazing with anger.</p><hr><p>I go outside.</p><p>The sky is dark, and the sun&#39;s about to set.</p><p>I bet it&#39;ll rain tonight.</p><p>I have to come home with Sakura before that.</p><hr><p>The school building is deserted.</p><p>Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.</p><p>It&#39;s past five o&#39;clock, and there are no students or teachers at the school now.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s hot steel in my back.</p><p>The Magic Circuit is already made.</p><p>I concentrate so that I can use my only weapon whenever necessary.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It must be Rider&#39;s boundary field.</p><p>The school&#39;s tinted red, and my lungs are damaged every time I breathe.</p><p>I cough up blood.</p><p>But I ignore it and run up the stairs.</p><hr><p>I&#39;m not certain, but I can still guess.</p><p>Considering Shinji, he wouldn&#39;t position himself on unfamiliar territory.</p><p>He has to be in the classroom on the third floor.</p><hr><p>I get up to the third floor.</p><p>The red filter condenses, scraping off my magical energy with each step I take.</p><hr><p>Was he waiting for me?</p><p>Shinji is watching me from the entrance of room 2-C.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hah\u2015\u2015\u2015so honest, Emiya. You came, just like you promised...!&quot;</p><hr><p>My brain boils up.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura must be in the classroom.</p><p>I have to check if she&#39;s all right.</p><p>If Shinji would get in my way, I would mercilessly...</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s your turn, Rider! It&#39;s the Master of the one who defeated you...! Repay him for that insult...!&quot;</p><p>The black Servant stands in my way.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t care.</p><p>I can&#39;t stop, no matter who may be in front of me.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The dagger is swung.</p><p>I read its course with amazing speed and avoid it.</p><p>Having dodged the dagger, I pass by Rider next.</p><p>It must be because of her tall figure and her long hair, but Rider cannot seize me as I rush past.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Got him.</p><p>The distance is about five meters. I close in on Shinji in under two seconds, aim at the Command Spell controlling Rider, and...</p><p>&quot;.........!!!!?&quot;</p><p>My tongue bulges from my mouth.</p><p>Something squeezes my neck from behind.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.

Does Shirou get killed by \u258A\u258A\u258A that many times?</p><hr><p>Yeah, he will.</p><hr><p>The chance of Shirou&#39;s death is highest in this route.</p><p>And it&#39;s in bad taste too.

So I&#39;m not a Master anymore, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Right. I forgot about that. You&#39;re not a Master anymore. You have no reason to be involved in the Holy Grail War, and you&#39;re less likely to be attacked by other Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I only wanted the Holy Grail because Saber wanted it. ...I have no interest in it now that Saber&#39;s gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Then you&#39;re not going to be fighting anymore?&quot;</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no emotion in Tohsaka&#39;s eyes.</p><p>Her words are merely something she must ask as a Master, devoid of personal interest.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>This is not a question, but a warning.</p><p>This is my last chance.</p><p>She&#39;s providing me with a chance to back out, telling me I&#39;ll still make it if I want to withdraw.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I will fight.&quot;</p><p>But my mind is made up.</p><p>I&#39;ll remember her consideration, though.</p><hr><p>&quot;I will fight.

Why are we enemies?</p><p>I&#39;m not a Master anymore. There&#39;s no reason for us to fight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? Even if you&#39;ve lost your Command Spell and your Servant, you&#39;re still Saber&#39;s former Master.</p><p>You were somehow chosen by the Holy Grail, so you have the right to obtain the Holy Grail until the very end. You&#39;re still my rival even though you&#39;re powerless.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Even if I have no intention of obtaining the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That would depend on the situation, right? It&#39;s possible that you end up needing the Holy Grail when you&#39;re in a situation where you can obtain it, and you inevitably use it.</p><p>Unselfish people are affected by other people because they are unselfish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. You&#39;re thinking too much, Tohsaka. Even if I end up needing the Holy Grail, that doesn&#39;t mean I can obtain it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s just a what-if. But the possibility is there.</p><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying we&#39;re enemies, and that&#39;s why magi that aren&#39;t Masters anymore run to the church.</p><p>Even without their Servants, they&#39;re still obstacles to the other Masters. Keep that in mind and watch out. It&#39;s not just Zouken that wants to kill you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...... I appreciate the warning, but...&quot;</p><p>Um, I don&#39;t like having Tohsaka as an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Why the difficult face? We&#39;re already enemies. Is there a problem with that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. This means I can&#39;t ask for your help after all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>She freezes.</p><p>She looks at me as if she&#39;s seen a ghost.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why do you need my help...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Because I can&#39;t do this by myself. Ending the Holy Grail War means defeating the other Masters, but I don&#39;t have the power to do so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I know it looks pitiful, but I don&#39;t care about that. I only have a few options, and I think this is the best thing I can do.</p><p>That&#39;s why I can&#39;t be enemies with you.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I need you as an ally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey. Are you sane, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am. I&#39;m too weak to fight alongside you, so I could end up weighing you down.</p><p>I can&#39;t offer you anything in return, so there&#39;s nothing in it for you if you help me.</p><p>...Yeah, cooperation like this isn&#39;t usually possible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Heh. So you do understand.</p><p>Equivalent exchange is standard for magi, just like you say. I can&#39;t lend something to someone with no money, and I can&#39;t help someone who can&#39;t help me in return. You know that&#39;s for your own good too, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I gave you advice because we had a truce, but it&#39;s a different matter if we&#39;re actually allies. If that were the case, we&#39;d have to share the reward too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. But I&#39;m asking you anyway, even knowing that.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Please help me, Tohsaka.

Even if I team up with someone who&#39;s not a Master, I...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said I can&#39;t help you even if you ask me like that. First of all...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...This is like a real contract.&quot;</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>Tohsaka looks down once, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez, all right! Then here are the terms for our agreement!&quot;</p><p>She glares at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What do you mean by terms?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Terms are terms!</p><p>...Um, this is a legitimate contract.</p><p>So I&#39;ll consider it if you can promise me what I&#39;m going to ask you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...??? Tohsaka. I&#39;ve already told you, I have nothing I can give back to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just listen to me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;......! A-All right, I&#39;ll listen.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. Here&#39;s the first one.

For example, I&#39;d be in trouble if you give me a reckless order.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t be that stupid.

It&#39;s not something I can use readily since it&#39;s one of the worst curses around.</p><p>But I can lock it if you accept it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A curse of coercion... Is it like the Command Spell for a Servant?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, but it&#39;s not almighty.</p><p>Binding you would be the most it can do, and I can&#39;t force you to do anything that has to do with your life. It&#39;ll be effective for the duration of the Holy Grail War. That&#39;s fine, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Yeah, that&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then close your eyes. Don&#39;t move your body or your Magic Circuit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I do as I&#39;m told.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Satz.</p><p>Beklagter, meine W[ouml]rter, werden geglaubt.</p><p>Wei[szlig] ist schwarz.</p><p>Richtige [uuml]bliche Peitsche.</p><p>Die Vergeltung vom Himmel.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Fire lights up in my core.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s verse coils about my nerves, insinuating itself into my body and mind.</p><hr><p>A sound as if a small bottle is shaking.</p><p>Right next to my heart...</p><p>Another heart is created\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The bell rings, indicating the end of lunch.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how deep a trance Tohsaka&#39;s magecraft put me into, but I&#39;ve missed the rest of our break.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s done. Our contract is complete.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Now, let&#39;s meet at the front gate after school.</p><p>You&#39;re going to have club activities at my place, starting today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015club activities at your place?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. We&#39;re cooperating, so I need to teach you how to fight by yourself, right?</p><p>...Well, I know from what I&#39;ve already seen that you&#39;re an amateur, so you&#39;ll be working overtime every day.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t mind, and that&#39;s actually helpful\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>But is that starting today?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I have to figure out your ability and determine our plan from tonight on.</p><p>You&#39;ll be going home late, but since you live alone that&#39;s not a problem, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Well, that&#39;s true, but how do you know that, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! I-I thought so because there wasn&#39;t anyone at your house when I treated your wound before.</p><p>A-Anyway, that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be, so you just have to wait for me at the front gate!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka waves goodbye and runs off.</p><p>It&#39;s Friday today... Classes run to sixth period, so we&#39;ll be going home after three o&#39;clock.</p><hr><p>&quot;...This is bad. I told Sakura I&#39;d be coming home early, but I can&#39;t cancel Tohsaka&#39;s proposal on the very first day.&quot;</p><p>I feel bad for Sakura, but I&#39;ll go with Tohsaka for today.</p><hr><p>...Well, she isn&#39;t a devil.</p><p>So she might let me go home early today if I tell her about Sakura.... Right?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15-photo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15-photo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15 Photo</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I wait for Tohsaka by the front gate.</p><p>The sky is gray, and it looks like it&#39;ll rain any minute now.</p><p>There&#39;s a chill wind, so it&#39;ll be a cold night if it rains.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>Tohsaka is in front of me when I notice.</p><p>She must have ran here, as her shoulders are moving up and down.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nothing. I just thought it might rain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, the weather? I guess it&#39;ll just be a drizzle. We have to go patrol at night, so it&#39;ll be a pain if it rains too much.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Hm.</p><p>It seems Tohsaka has already made plans for us to go on patrol tonight.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind, but I&#39;d like to go by my house and check on Sakura before that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, about that...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ll train you as your cooperator, so prepare yourself. I&#39;ll make you a proper magus.&quot;</p><hr><p>With those confident words, Tohsaka sets off down the hill.</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>I can&#39;t bring up the subject of going home early if she smiles like that.</p><hr><p>We make the long walk up the hill south of the intersection.</p><p>This residential area is filled with Western-style houses.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s house is at the top of this hill, past Sakura&#39;s.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>So this is Tohsaka&#39;s place.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s house is bigger, but this house feels more like a Western mansion.</p><hr><p>...And it somehow feels cold.</p><p>There&#39;s been an air that seems to reject anyone nearing this place ever since we finished climbing up the hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why did you stop? This is my house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, I know. I was just coerced.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. My house is different from yours. It&#39;s just that even someone who&#39;s ignorant of magical energy like you can feel the coldness of this house.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka goes into her home, speaking in bored tones.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, come on. I don&#39;t have any traps set up, so you don&#39;t need to hesitate.&quot;</p><p>She beckons me from the entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;......No. It&#39;s not because of the atmosphere that I&#39;m hesitating.&quot;</p><p>Muttering to myself, I gather my composure and go in.</p><hr><p>...This place certainly does have a cold atmosphere, but that&#39;s nothing.</p><p>She has no idea what a big deal it is for a guy to come over to Tohsaka Rin&#39;s house.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t understand even if I explain it to her. If I&#39;m lucky, she&#39;ll just laugh.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Why are we in your room and not the living room!&quot;</p><hr><p>With an utter lack of concern, she shows me through the living room and into her bedroom.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s because this place has more instruments ready.</p><p>The living room is where you have tea, but we didn&#39;t come here to drink tea, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um. You&#39;re... right, but...&quot;</p><p>Um, I wish she&#39;d think of me as a boy her age.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Just sit down wherever. I&#39;ll be using sage and cards to consecrate you, but tell me now if you don&#39;t like either.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka opens the box by her bed.</p><p>It looks like a treasure chest from an adventure movie.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... Kishua&#39;s agate is useless for this. ...Oh, I&#39;m out of sage. Can you bring some up from downstairs, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Scarlet sage, right? ...Well, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need to go that far to distinguish this man.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I please. You can rest downstairs after that. We have a pact, so you don&#39;t need to protect me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. I doubt he has the nerve to betray you. I shall get ready for tonight.&quot;</p><hr><p>That must be Archer.</p><p>His presence must be thin when in spirit form. I didn&#39;t feel much magical energy from him.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m surprised. I didn&#39;t notice that he was in the room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s how it is if he&#39;s in spirit form.</p><p>Even if he takes form, his magical energy won&#39;t leak outside as long as he&#39;s in this house. It&#39;s elementary for a workshop to shut in the magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. So is it the same for Makiri... no, Matou&#39;s place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. But that place has no need to hide magical energy anymore. If they are hiding magical energy, it&#39;d be the energy leaking out from the magus himself and not from the house.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, either way, it takes nothing to hide magical energy. I&#39;d take Archer with me to school too, but I&#39;m resting him during the day since he&#39;s not up to par.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka rummages through the treasure chest with a difficult expression.</p><p>...It seems she can&#39;t find what she wants. Is she the kind of person that never keeps anything in order?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Really, why doesn&#39;t the wound he received from Saber heal when all other wounds can be healed easily? I&#39;m sure they had some connection... Geez, why am I finding my master&#39;s jewels now? I can never find them when I want them, dammit!&quot;</p><hr><p>She leans forward and keeps fumbling around.</p><p>...That chest looks small, but it seems big enough to be able to fit Tohsaka inside.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Man.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s nothing to prepare for.</p><p>All I can do is pray that she&#39;ll find the thing she wants, or just look around her room aimlessly\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>I see something.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s a photo.</p><p>A bookshelf that&#39;s about waist-high is at the corner of the room.</p><p>On it is a photo that looks to have been forgotten.</p><p>Dust falls off of it when I pick it up, and I can tell it has been left alone for a long time</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s not that she never cleans. Just this picture is undisturbed.&quot;</p><p>Does Tohsaka not like seeing herself as a kid?</p><p>...No, if that were all, she could just put it away. Maybe it&#39;s important to her, but she doesn&#39;t want to touch it...</p><hr><p>&quot;......But...&quot;</p><p>People sure can change.</p><p>Tohsaka looks like she&#39;s five or six years old, and she&#39;s really cute in the picture.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So she had long hair back then, too.... Huh?&quot;</p><p>The girl in the picture looks just like she is now, except younger.</p><p>That&#39;s why I notice the one thing that&#39;s different.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thanks for waiting, I&#39;m all ready now. There&#39;ll be a little pain, but it&#39;s nothing you should be worried about... Huh, what&#39;s going on, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. This, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I show her the picture I found.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s an old photo. I just put that in the corner, but is something wrong with it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh... Well, there&#39;s nothing wrong, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s nothing much, so I hesitate.</p><p>It&#39;s nothing I need to ask about, but it just caught my attention.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I see, you want to say I have a different ribbon on, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s natural. I&#39;m a girl, so I have lots of ribbons. Even if it&#39;s my favorite, do you think I&#39;d keep the same ribbon for over ten years?&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh.</p><p>She&#39;s right now that she mentions it.</p><p>It&#39;s just an ordinary ribbon. Why was I so concerned about it?</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m kidding. That&#39;s what I want to say, but ribbons are special. It&#39;s the last resort for female magi. It&#39;s an appropriate magical item, so there aren&#39;t many substitutes for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Wow. Then is that ribbon some sort of a magical item?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Holding the hair in place means holding the magical energy in place. My family doesn&#39;t have mystic eyes, so we have to at least keep our reserve magical energy from our hair.</p><p>It&#39;s something that controls your body, so it&#39;s best if you make it yourself, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the first ribbon I made. It was my favorite, but I parted with it for various reasons.</p><p>...Well, let&#39;s stop with the idle talk. I&#39;m starting the consecration, so sit down in that chair\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="scene-16-afternoon-return-home-rin-sama-gets-angry" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-16-afternoon-return-home-rin-sama-gets-angry" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 16 Afternoon-Return home Rin-sama gets angry</h2><p>Tohsaka&#39;s analysis ends rather quickly.</p><p>She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.</p><hr><p>And Tohsaka says...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You don&#39;t correspond to anything.

Yeah, I do regret that you&#39;re an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong...

But let&#39;s go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Things don&#39;t normally go away unless you break them, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magecraft.</p><p>It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.</p><p>She told me to make a vase.

For now, I&#39;ll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.</p><p>It&#39;s faster to make an actual switch in your body. Stay over tonight. It&#39;s a drastic measure, so you&#39;ll have to stay in bed all night.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015? You mean here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s with that face? Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not going to be performing surgery on you. You&#39;ll just drink some medicine. Well, you won&#39;t be able to move for a while because it&#39;s so strong.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Um, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like drastic measures...&quot;</p><p>...I look at the clock.</p><p>It&#39;s almost five.</p><p>I didn&#39;t notice since it&#39;s cloudy today, but it&#39;s getting late.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.</p><p>I&#39;m worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today&#39;s an exception.</p><p>...Tohsaka&#39;s cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, why the painful look?</p><p>You don&#39;t mind taking drastic measures, right?

I&#39;ll really be in trouble if I can&#39;t move tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well. I can&#39;t deny that possibility, to be honest. I can&#39;t tell how it&#39;ll turn out, and it&#39;ll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can&#39;t be tampered with. And there&#39;s the possibility of the operation itself failing.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s all up to your luck. How&#39;s your luck recently, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s bad.</p><p>It&#39;s worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. That&#39;s really troublesome.</p><p>I have to go home by tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Your home?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Sakura&#39;s lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won&#39;t be able to rest easy while I&#39;m lying in bed unless I&#39;m sure she&#39;s all right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Crap\u2015\u2015\u2015I forgot about it.&quot;</p><p>...She&#39;s astonished.</p><p>Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...</p><p>&quot;You idiot!

I knew you would come alone if I told you to.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My cool brain boils up once again.</p><p>My head shakes so much that I almost forget about the Servant in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What is that?&quot;</p><p>Why is he doing such a thing?</p><hr><p>Sakura is Shinji&#39;s sister.</p><p>An older brother should protect his younger sister.</p><p>Family members should help each other and laugh together.</p><p>So why doesn&#39;t he understand?</p><p>Something I couldn&#39;t protect.</p><p>Why can&#39;t he understand how Sakura must feel to have her own brother holding a knife to her!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you serious, Shinji\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I&#39;m using the last trump card because I&#39;m serious. Why are you stupid even at a time like this?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Before I know it, I&#39;m running.</p><p>I can&#39;t stop until I get Sakura away from him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But she&#39;s in my way.</p><p>Rider is blocking my way, protecting Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I do not understand. Why did you come here?</p><p>In coming here, you showed you were willing to obey my Master. If you planned to fight, you should not have come alone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...Rider&#39;s right.</p><p>...I have to calm down.</p><p>Since I obeyed Shinji, I have to think only about saving Sakura and not defeating Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath and pull myself together.</p><hr><p>Shinji is enjoying my dismay with Sakura in his arms.</p><p>...Sakura hasn&#39;t raised her head since I arrived.</p><p>She&#39;s not unconscious.</p><p>She&#39;s standing unassisted.</p><p>Her head is down because she doesn&#39;t want to raise it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji. Did you tell her about us?&quot;</p><p>I glare at him, unable to hide my anger.</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. Oh, I see!</p><p>Yeah, don&#39;t worry, Emiya. Since you wouldn&#39;t tell her, I told her everything! I told her we&#39;re both Masters and tried to kill each other!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did you want to hide that from her? Are you stupid? Of course she&#39;ll find out! She knew you were hiding something, but she couldn&#39;t ask you because she&#39;s just your underclassman!&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><hr><p>He presses the blade against Sakura&#39;s cheek.</p><p>Sakura looks away, but grits her teeth so that she won&#39;t raise her face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be reserved and ask. Emiya won&#39;t hide anything now. See, it&#39;s your wish come true!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t reply.</p><p>With her head down...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?</p><p>I told you to ask him. I&#39;m telling you to ask him what he thinks of you and if he hates you after finding out that you&#39;re a dirty woman of Matou!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...Her figure looks like she&#39;s apologizing to me, and I can&#39;t contain myself anymore.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine now, right? I came here, just like I promised. Let Sakura go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I didn&#39;t promise you anything. I gave you a command.</p><p>I just said I wouldn&#39;t do anything to Sakura if you came alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t glare so much, Emiya. I&#39;m not a devil. I&#39;m glad that you want to save my sister. I&#39;ll meet your sincerity if you act accordingly. I can send Sakura home once we&#39;re done.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see\u2015\u2015\u2015is that a promise, Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll let Sakura go if you do as I say.</p><p>This is a promise. I swear.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to get on my knees and beg?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. What&#39;s the fun in making a guy beg? I brought you here to fight. I told you we&#39;re settling our match.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Rider takes a step forward.</p><p>There&#39;s no enmity or intent to kill.</p><p>Rider steps forward to obey her Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;But it&#39;s boring to just fight, right? It&#39;s not fair since I&#39;m not a magus, and it&#39;s obvious that I&#39;ll win in a fight.</p><p>So to be fair, I&#39;ll have her fight you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...Heh.</p><p>Fight Rider empty-handed, huh?</p><p>That&#39;s like telling me to die.</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t take your life. I&#39;ve told Rider to go easy on you.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be a nuisance if you keep running around after today, so I&#39;ll have her break your limbs.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Rider is not holding her dagger.</p><p>It seems she really is going to go easy on me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t your job easy? You just have to stand there and get hit like a dumbass.</p><p>Oh, but don&#39;t go down too soon, okay? If you faint before I&#39;m satisfied, I&#39;ll have Sakura take the rest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Rider comes closer.</p><p>Three more steps.</p><p>Then I&#39;ll be within her reach.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. Don&#39;t resist, but don&#39;t go down easily?</p><p>You&#39;re contradicting yourself. What do you want, Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, that&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it...!?</p><p>I just want to beat the crap out of you...!!&quot;</p><hr><p>Rider springs forward.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I raise both my arms in preparation for her attack.</p><p>At that instant\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>An impact that almost blows the bones away with it pierces my right arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She aimed at my arm that was guarding my face.</p><p>My arm is still attached.</p><p>But it&#39;s numb and I don&#39;t feel anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa......!&quot;</p><p>I lace my senses as fast as possible.</p><p>I can&#39;t do anything bare-handed.</p><p>Unless I strengthen everything that can be strengthened, my limbs will be torn clean off.</p><p>I have to turn my uniform into steel and turn my body into something even stronger, or the next attack will kill me\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>A tremor runs through my left arm.</p><p>The blow like a bushhammer penetrates through my strengthened uniform and tries to break my left arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Both my arms have been rendered useless in a mere second.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015No, they do move, but I don&#39;t feel them.</p><p>I can&#39;t use my deadened arms to block her attacks.</p><p>If she takes another shot at my head now, I&#39;ll be knocked out for sure...!</p><hr><p>Rider is merciless.</p><p>She beats me relentlessly, just as Shinji ordered.</p><p>Her movements remind me of a machine.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, guh......!&quot;</p><p>I protect my face with arms that barely move.</p><p>From the start, I can&#39;t perceive Rider&#39;s attacks to block them accordingly.</p><p>I have to concentrate on guarding my head so that I won&#39;t get knocked unconscious.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh, guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>What is Rider thinking?</p><p>Even though my arms are an easy target, she ignores them.</p><p>She only hits my exposed chest and stomach.</p><p>...They are agonizing blows, but aren&#39;t as strong as the attacks that numbed my arms.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s strange.</p><p>With the strength Rider showed at the Ryuudou Temple, a single blow should be enough to tear me in half.</p><p>...Is she going easy like Shinji said?</p><p>Well, she is going easy on me by not aiming at my face, but even with that in mind, something&#39;s not right.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>In short, her power is way too different.</p><p>A Servant&#39;s power is in direct proportion to the magical energy you can feel from them.</p><hr><p>Rider was a strong Servant back at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>But the Rider before me now is the Rider that was defeated at the park.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what happened, but if that&#39;s the case, I still have a chance to outwit Shinji\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Gu, fu...!&quot;</p><p>I fall forward.</p><p>Seemingly tired of using me like a punching bag, she steps forward and drives her fist into my stomach.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s like a stake gouging into my abdomen.</p><p>...The attack is really effective.</p><p>The bruises from last night are screaming with pain.</p><p>Gastric juice fills my mouth and I almost fall down to my knees.</p><hr><p>&quot;What, is that it, Emiya?

The match is decided, Shinji.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Then.</p><p>I realize that Tohsaka is behind me.</p><hr><p>After being wounded by Archer, Rider is crouching down on the floor.</p><p>Her clothes are wet with blood.

I told you to come alone!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But that was an order, not a promise, right? Then I think it&#39;s illogical to call it unfair.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s sophistry! It&#39;s natural for him to come alone since he said he&#39;ll come alone!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s fine.</p><p>We were together, but Emiya-kun didn&#39;t ask me for help.

That&#39;s simple. I was next to him when you called. You had such a loud voice, Matou-kun. I was able to hear you even though Emiya-kun was trying to hide it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand now? There&#39;s no way I&#39;d just sit there if Sakura&#39;s been kidnapped. You lured Emiya-kun to you at the price of making me your enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh\u2015\u2015\u2015so you&#39;re here for Sakura too?</p><p>...Sakura.

Then why don&#39;t you make your Servant fight?</p><p>Archer only cut her stomach. He hasn&#39;t destroyed the core of her embodiment, her neck or her heart.

This is Rider...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka stands ready while Archer silently watches the enemy that stood up.</p><p>Rider is completely healed.</p><p>The power flowing from her body is just like when she was at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Her figure disappears.</p><p>Rider suddenly disappears from my vision...</p><hr><p>&quot;Get down, Emiya-kun\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><hr><p>The moment I duck, long hair flutters right above me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...!&quot;</p><p>Rider has instantly jumped with Sakura in hand.</p><p>She lands opposite us\u2015\u2015\u2015between Shinji and the rest of us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? ...What are you doing? Who told you to bring Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, there was no such order. As a Servant, I merely protected my Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>Rider lets Sakura down and glances at Shinji.</p><p>...Her eyes are covered with a leather mask, but her expression is frighteningly cold.</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t be stupid. I&#39;m your Master. Why are you wasting time instead of protecting me\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shinji. A Command Spell appears on the body of a Master. I have never accepted anyone who does not bear the holy sign as my Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are a fraud. You have lost the book which granted you false ownership, so I can no longer obey you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Rider turns away from Shinji.</p><p>That motion tells Shinji that she will never look at him again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. So that&#39;s how it was, Rider?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your guess is correct, Archer&#39;s Master.</p><p>You already knew, did you not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I knew it was strange.</p><p>There&#39;s no way one of the Matous would be chosen as a Master. Their bloodline has grown thin, so no magi should be born to them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So it shouldn&#39;t be possible for Shinji, one of the Matou family, to become a Master. But Rider was summoned, and a person from the Matou household was chosen as a Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. I thought Matou Zouken summoned you and entrusted you to Shinji.</p><p>But it&#39;s actually much more simple. Zouken doesn&#39;t need to do anything. Because the most appropriate person in the Matou household to be a Master is\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t looking at Rider.</p><p>She is only looking at...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015The legitimate successor of Matou.</p><p>This generation&#39;s magus of the Matou line.

A Command Spell ordering her to obey Matou Shinji, huh?</p><p>Rider became Shinji&#39;s Servant with that, and you lost your right as a Master at the same time, becoming an ordinary magus. ...So when I first had you show me your arm, you&#39;d already given your Command Spell to Shinji.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t answer and bites her lips.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn, again, Sakura! Give me the right to control her again!&quot;</p><p>Shinji runs to her as if begging her.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, say something! You don&#39;t want to fight, right? You said you didn&#39;t want to be a Master, so that&#39;s why I took over in your place!</p><p>Why are you pretending to be a good girl now...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji raises his arm.</p><p>...But there&#39;s no need for me to stop him.</p><p>&quot;R-Rider\u2015\u2015\u2015are you going to disobey me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are not my Master, Shinji. If you intend to harm Sakura, I will kill you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Rider releases him.</p><p>Shinji backs away, clutching his arm where Rider gripped it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha, haha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You&#39;ll regret that, Rider. No matter what you say, everything will be back to normal when Sakura makes another book.</p><p>Do you know what&#39;ll happen to you once you become my Servant again\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s useless, Shinji. It&#39;s almost impossible to entrust a Servant to a human, and someone that&#39;s not a magus at that. The transfer using the Command Spell made it possible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah. There&#39;s one more Command Spell.</p><p>Sakura won&#39;t disobey me, so...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why this is it. Sakura only has one more Command Spell. If you use it, you&#39;ll have no way to control Rider.</p><p>Rider would be freed. You can&#39;t bind a Servant with a fake right made with a Command Spell. It&#39;ll just burn your book like earlier even if you order Rider.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Then I&#39;m...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. You lost your chance to be a Master.</p><p>No, you were never a Master as you were only controlling her using a fake Command Spell.&quot;</p><hr><p>...A crack runs through.</p><p>With a sound, the existence of Matou Shinji breaks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ha. I see, so it was impossible from the beginning. I have no talent. The old man cast me aside as a failure, and I was pitied.</p><p>...Yeah, it&#39;s only natural. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it...! I knew from the beginning that I&#39;m not suited!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Nii-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, don&#39;t worry about it, Sakura. This was all just a farce. I knew that I have no talent. You&#39;re the family&#39;s heir. There was no need for me to butt in.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Nii-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I know, I know.</p><p>So, Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you continue.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you to beat them</p><hr><p>in my place!

I&#39;m telling you. You&#39;re going to obey me like always, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no reply.</p><p>Sakura clenches her fists, turns her back to Shinji,</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t want to. Let&#39;s stop, Nii-san.&quot;</p><p>and clearly refuses his order.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura. What did you just say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t want to. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn&#39;t kill Senpai, but you broke our promise.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t turn to look at Shinji.</p><p>Shinji looks at it like someone else&#39;s matter and laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I feel a chill, and in that instant...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015All right.

If you&#39;re going to hold a grudge, don&#39;t hold it at me, but hold it against that old man for making your body like that. Well, you were gonna end up like that anyway. It&#39;s better for you to be freed from the pain now\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Shinji runs away.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ha, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Sakura tears at her chest.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Her earring breaks and chemical-like liquid is pouring out of it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no......!&quot;</p><p>She goes into convulsions.</p><p>No, it&#39;s worse.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s shaking so bad that it seems like she&#39;s going to crumble like a building in an earthquake.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura...!&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t get what&#39;s going on.</p><p>In my worry, I run to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fool\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Don&#39;t you understand what&#39;s going on!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>Someone stops me.</p><p>I don&#39;t know when he got here, but Archer is grabbing my shoulder.</p><hr><p>&quot;Get away from here. You will not be able to restore her if you feed her without care.&quot;</p><p>Archer pushes me back and says something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Feed her...? What do you mean\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>The question dies in my throat.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The hallway tints red.</p><p>The air becomes a mist, moistening our skin, and every wall starts to sweat like honey.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ow, guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>...My chest is burning.</p><p>This air.</p><p>This red world is a different world made by magecraft.</p><p>This must be a boundary field that melts everything within its framework, on this premise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, this is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>No, the mist clogs my throat and burns me from the inside when I breathe.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s the boundary field Shinji set up here.</p><p>But it&#39;s much stronger now that Sakura is Rider&#39;s Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I look.</p><p>...On the other side of the hallway is Sakura, clawing at her chest in agony,</p><p>and Rider, who is confronting Archer to protect Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Move aside, Rider. Your master is running wild. She will be addicted to it unless she is stopped before she gets a taste of another&#39;s magical energy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I refuse. My role is to protect my Master. I cannot let you through as long as you are trying to kill Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. So you will stand there and let your master die? Your Master is using up magical energy at a high rate. Do you understand that she will certainly die if you leave her alone?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. She can avoid death if she takes in more magical energy than she loses.</p><p>Fortunately, there are two magi here. Shinji escaped, but they cannot escape now. I shall take your Master before Sakura is consumed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh\u2015\u2015\u2015so your character doesn&#39;t change even with a new Master, huh?</p><p>It seems you value yourself over other people&#39;s lives.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That goes for you too. You are trying to protect your Master by ignoring mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see\u2015\u2015\u2015then there&#39;s no need for either one of us to hold back\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer charges.</p><p>...Without heed for the corrosive boundary field, he rushes at where Sakura still crouches on the ground.</p><p>And he clashes with Rider as she blocks his way.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015\u2015are you okay with this, Tohsaka!? He started fighting with Rider...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Of course they have to fight. We won&#39;t last like this. ...And as a fellow magus, I have to prevent Sakura from becoming a heretic.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Heretic...?</p><p>Are those people who use magecraft against the law of the Association, or people who cannot stop the Magic Circuit and destroy themselves...?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait. What is that? Why Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;s running wild. Rider made this boundary field, but Sakura&#39;s the one maintaining it. I don&#39;t know what Shinji did, but Sakura&#39;s attacking indiscriminately now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I bet Sakura is like us. It&#39;s just painful and she just wants air, so she&#39;s sucking on other people&#39;s air, or magical energy in this case. \u2015\u2015\u2015I can&#39;t leave her be as the supervisor of Fuyuki.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015? You can&#39;t leave her be? What are you going to do to Sakura!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Ask Archer. I only know of one way to stop a magus like that. But Archer might know of some other way.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, we have to do something about Rider before that anyway. From what I can see, Archer is the stronger of the two, but it seems his output is down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Output is down?&quot;</p><hr><p>I look back at the hallway.</p><p>Archer is overwhelming, even in my eyes.</p><p>In terms of pure power, he is stronger. There&#39;s no way that Rider can hold him back.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But.</p><p>It&#39;s strange.</p><hr><p>Rider&#39;s strength is her agility.</p><p>She shouldn&#39;t be good at fights where she has to protect someone.</p><p>Being forced to protect someone should put her at a disadvantage.</p><p>Archer should&#39;ve already defeated her and moved on to Sakura.</p><p>But that&#39;s not the case\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015so could Rider be overwhelming him...?</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s sword swings through empty air.</p><p>Her hair flowing as she moves, Rider arches back and avoids the attack, then steps in and slashes at Archer.</p><hr><p>But Rider isn&#39;t the only one who attacks and defends at the same time.</p><p>Archer repels Rider&#39;s dagger with his other sword and pushes her back.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Advance and retreat.</p><p>They are evenly matched. Archer cannot press forward, Rider cannot force him back, and they consequently clash swords without any progress.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The impatient one is Archer.</p><p>Though his enemy is weaker than him, he cannot repel her, and the boundary field is slowly taking his energy.</p><hr><p>And to add, Tohsaka and I are at our limits.</p><p>Just stopping our breaths is painful, so being in the hallway stabs at our minds.</p><p>At this pace, we&#39;ll fall before Archer defeats Rider.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer clucks his tongue in annoyance.</p><p>There.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I understand your power.</p><p>I am sorry, but you cannot defeat me.&quot;</p><p>Rider stops and makes an announcement in a regretful voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said you cannot beat me. You are not using your Noble Phantasm. I do not know if your Master has forbidden you from doing so or if you are concerned for Sakura&#39;s safety.</p><p>Regardless, if you will not use it, this is it. You cannot defeat me.&quot;</p><hr><p>Planting her feet, her only weapon, Rider confronts Archer.</p><p>...She looks so defenseless that the match could be decided if Archer attacked her now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hah. I&#39;m not worried for your Master. I just think that there is no need.</p><p>And you cannot use your Noble Phantasm either. Matou Shinji was your Master until just now, so you do not have enough magical energy stocked up to use it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Shinji could not give me magical energy. So I cannot use my Noble Phantasm right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. There&#39;s no need to waste my magical energy against an opponent who will not use it. I will slash you with my next attack, proceed and slash that girl, and everything will end.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Let&#39;s say that&#39;s how it will be.</p><p>It will be easier for me to kill you if that is the case.&quot;</p><p>Rider answers calmly.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015What does she intend to do?</p><p>Without even readying her weapon, Rider stands against Archer...</p><p>&quot;...No, Rider...!&quot;</p><p>...but stops when she hears the voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please endure there, Sakura. I will solve everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop\u2015\u2015\u2015please stop, Rider. I didn&#39;t call for you for something like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I cannot follow that order.

Fine, I&#39;ll tell you. It&#39;s no use hiding it from you, and it&#39;s meaningless to do so now.</p><p>So you want to ask about Sakura?&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod.</p><p>Tohsaka takes a deep breath and starts to talk in her normal tone.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It all started quite some time ago. The Matou blood started to run thin, and their children were born with fewer and fewer magecraft-Circuits.</p><p>The family is originally from another country, so I think the land of Japan didn&#39;t suit them.</p><p>Their decline started when they started living here, and the Magic Circuit finally disappeared in this generation when Shinji was born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The history of Matou ended with that.</p><p>They should have taken an apprentice or something if they&#39;d wanted their quest to continue. But the Matous are a distinguished family, and to the last, they refused to take in an outsider.</p><hr><p>&quot;As a result, their successors had less magical energy, and it finally ran out in the end.</p><p>...They finally started looking for an apprentice when that happened, but no magus would come to a fallen family. Hundreds of years of Makiri history should have ended at that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But they weren&#39;t people who could give up then. Shinji&#39;s father adopted a child and taught the child magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>I expect you wouldn&#39;t know because your family is a special case, but a family of magi hands down its secrets to only one child. They don&#39;t teach magecraft to any other children. Zouken said this, right?</p><p>If there is a sibling, one is your successor, while the other is raised normally or put up for adoption.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no need for two successors.</p><p>In a case of siblings... no, &quot;sisters&quot;, what would be done to the one who wasn&#39;t needed?</p><hr><p>Some may raise her and hide from her the fact that they are a family of magi.</p><p>But that&#39;s difficult and inefficient.</p><p>If they trained their Magic Circuit over many generations, it would not be their wish to waste the excellent gene even if she is not chosen as the successor.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I had a sister a year younger than me.</p><p>...The declined Matou family had no hope of someone giving them a child for adoption.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for them to rely on the Tohsaka family, the ones they held a pact with for a long time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know which one of us my dad intended to make his successor. But I remained a Tohsaka, and she was taken to the Matou family.</p><p>That was eleven years ago.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t go see her much after that. It was an agreement made with Matou, and I couldn&#39;t readily go see the successor of the Matous.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then you and Sakura are...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Real sisters. ...Well, we never called each other like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I don&#39;t know how much emotion is contained in those simple words.</p><p>But that makes me understand.</p><p>Why she always asked about Sakura.</p><p>Why she didn&#39;t let Archer use his Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s good. You&#39;re on Sakura&#39;s side.&quot;</p><p>A dim light shines into the gloom of my mind.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen to Sakura, or what she&#39;s going to do from now on.</p><p>But if Tohsaka cares for Sakura, there just might be hope waiting on the ominous path ahead.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I&#39;m not her ally or anything.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But...</p><p>Tohsaka denies me as if reading my thoughts.</p><hr><p>&quot;Not her ally...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. If Sakura can&#39;t be cured, I&#39;ll dispose of her, just like I would with any other Master gone rampant. I can&#39;t sit idly by while a magus indiscriminately attacks people. If Kirei can&#39;t treat Sakura, then I&#39;ll just have to get rid of her myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W\u2015\u2015\u2015What are you saying...!? Sakura&#39;s your sister, isn&#39;t she!? Don&#39;t ever say something like that...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura is a child of the Matous. She stopped being my sister eleven years ago.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph. The outcome won&#39;t change even if Sakura is my family as you say. It wouldn&#39;t change anything. In fact, that would give you even less right to interfere.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka speaks as if it&#39;s a matter of course.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then you&#39;re...&quot;</p><p>No different from Shinji.</p><p>But before I can say the worst thing possible...</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing? The operation is complete, but she is still in critical condition. If you want to make a commotion, go do so outside.&quot;</p><p>...Kotomine Kirei emerges from the back of the church.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph. I can&#39;t tell if you two are on bad terms or in good harmony.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015H-Heh. You&#39;re just mistaken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then sit down. I shall explain the state Matou Sakura is in.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Taking our separate seats, we listen intently to the priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;To put it simply, there is a poison, a worm, in Matou Sakura&#39;s body. The worm is called crest worm. It is like an artificial sanshi, the three corpses. Do you recognize this name?&quot;</p><hr><p>...I shake my head.</p><p>Sanshi\u2015\u2015\u2015a bug said to inhabit a human body that reports the person&#39;s evil deeds to the Judge of Hell.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard of sanshi, but I&#39;ve never heard of a crest worm.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you do not know. Well, it was originally just a harmless parasite.</p><p>It&#39;s a familiar that lives off of its host&#39;s magical energy. It is of the lowest rank of familiars, as it does nothing beyond telling its master whether or not its host still lives.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So it&#39;s like a monitoring device.</p><p>So Zouken&#39;s monitoring Sakura with that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. When was it decided that Matou Zouken is the master of the crest worm?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m in no mood for your long talk. Who else but that old bastard would do something like that to Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see, that is certainly true. Matou Shinji cannot use crest worms. So it can only be that vampire.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right? Just go ahead and tell me the result. Can Sakura be saved or not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You are being hasty, Rin. You seem to understand her condition, but the boy does not. We should explain for his sake, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks away awkwardly.</p><p>Judging by her expression, she doesn&#39;t want me to find out.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, what shall we do, Emiya Shirou? Rin says she just wants to know the result.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......No. Please explain things in order, Kotomine.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I&#39;m sorry for Tohsaka.</p><p>But I can&#39;t yield to her about this. If this has to do with Sakura&#39;s life, I have to know everything about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let me continue.</p><p>The crest worm I explained earlier is undermining Matou Sakura&#39;s nerves.</p><p>It must be the result of eleven years spent growing within her. The crest worm has turned into a nerve, like a Magic Circuit, and it has entangled with her own, swarming all throughout her body.</p><p>It has transformed into her Magic Crest. Under normal circumstances it is suspended, having no effect on Matou Sakura&#39;s body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But once activated, it will violate Matou Sakura&#39;s nerves and will keep moving using her magical energy.</p><p>That&#39;s what happened earlier. The crest worm roamed through her body, absorbing her magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Had she remained in that state for half a day, she would certainly have died.</p><p>The crest worm would suck all of her magical energy as its power, then eat her flesh as nutrition. It means she would have her body consumed after her magical energy was sucked dry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is.</p><p>Even the faintest trace of a foreign substance puts a human body through discomfort, and can even be life-threatening. Having another creature entwining its nerves with your own, moving within you, would easily be enough to kill you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......In that regard, I&#39;m surprised Matou Sakura was conscious until just now.</p><p>I do not know if Matou Sakura has a strong will, or if she is just used to the crest worm&#39;s activation. We will need to ask her if we want this answered.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I hear a sound.</p><p>It&#39;s the sound of my teeth grinding.</p><p>&#39;If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is&#39;?</p><hr><p>I couldn&#39;t possibly know.</p><p>I cover myself in sweat just to insert one Magic Circuit into my body.</p><p>Sakura has it several times worse.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t even guess at her pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. You said if it&#39;s activated, right? Then the crest worm isn&#39;t usually active?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is correct. The poison put on her only awakens the crest worm.</p><p>The crest worm is only an observation device.</p><p>It is only activated as punishment for the host, Matou Sakura, when she breaks a &#39;certain condition&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Just listening to his words makes me go crazy.</p><p>I know it&#39;s not something Kotomine did, but I almost attack him for saying that.</p><hr><p>I suppress my selfish emotion and...</p><p>&quot;What is the condition?&quot;</p><p>I urge him to go on and tell me the heart of the matter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Matou Sakura fell, and Rin tried to save her. But Rider prevented her from doing so.</p><p>Then the condition is obvious. To abandon the battles as a Master. That should be the restriction of the crest worm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She has approved of the battles by entrusting Rider to Shinji. But the crest worm will torment her as she refuses it now. It has calmed down for now, but the crest worm will keep tormenting her.</p><p>It will tell her, &#39;What are you doing?</p><p>If you are truly a Master, then go kill the other Masters.</p><p>If you cannot, I will eat you and kill you&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My mind almost breaks down.</p><p>Just hearing about it makes sparks flash in my vision. More than anything, I want to kill that old man.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s the condition Sakura must follow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It seems so. Nothing else seems likely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Can&#39;t she just not be a Master? If she uses up her Command Spell and cancels the contract with her Servant, she won&#39;t be a Master anymore\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I would not recommend that.</p><p>I told you that the condition of the crest worm&#39;s activation is to abandon her duty as a Master.</p><p>If she cancels her contract with Rider, the crest worm will consume her for sure.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So she can fight and survive, or refuse to fight and be killed by the crest worm. Those are the only options Sakura has, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. The crest worm will torment its host for as long as the Holy Grail War continues.</p><p>If her condition keeps up, her body will not last long, and her mind will be destroyed. She has a Magic Crest all over her body, after all.</p><p>You should understand how absurd that is, Rin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Even though it should be familiar with my body, I still periodically get the urge to cut off my arm.</p><p>I&#39;m like this with one arm, so her function as a human being should be violated if she has it all over her body.</p><p>She&#39;s no magus, but a cluster of Magic Circuit. The human mind should be overwritten by the wave of magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015then Sakura is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;She is in danger if her condition keeps up.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how many more days she can last, but the crest worm will spread further with each successive day. She will die if we cannot remove it before it infects her whole body, but her body will not last that long in any case.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The only thing I did was to purify the poison.</p><p>The surgery to call back her lost magical energy and mind is after this, but the chance of success is very low.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That is all.</p><p>To sum everything up, Matou Sakura cannot be saved. Are you satisfied now, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no way I&#39;m satisfied.</p><p>Sakura can&#39;t be saved?</p><p>That&#39;s ridiculous.</p><p>She was doing so well until yesterday, so why are things like this now...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What about removing it? Can&#39;t you extract the crest worm?</p><p>If you know it&#39;s there, you should be able to take it out, right!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Extraction would be difficult. The crest worm has already integrated itself into her magecraft-Circuits. Even the one who implanted it wouldn&#39;t be able to extract it now.</p><p>...Yes. If you wanted to extract it, you would have to rely on a miracle, or the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The Holy Grail.</p><p>So that&#39;s where it ends up, huh?</p><p>Sakura&#39;s only choice is to keep fighting as a Master,</p><p>and the power of the Holy Grail is the only thing that can save her\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand the situation now, Kirei. Let me thank you.&quot;</p><p>She bows without showing much gratitude and confronts the priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;But isn&#39;t this too sudden? The crest worm wasn&#39;t implanted in her yesterday. So why did she suddenly reach her limit?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why do you ask that now?</p><p>Matou Sakura&#39;s body was tampered with many years ago. The changes were so extensive that even her hair and eye colors no longer reflect her heritage. This did not start recently.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it seems it was never intended to kill her as it&#39;s doing now.</p><p>It seems Matou Zouken did not intend to use Matou Sakura in this war. She is not adjusted to fighting. I would assume she was treated that way because unexpected conditions were met.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Unexpected conditions, huh? ...I don&#39;t know what those are, but that means Sakura suddenly won Zouken&#39;s confidence?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Probably. I would assume some change occurred within her that Zouken did not expect.</p><p>But that is only one factor. There are other reasons for her drastic change.</p><p>She is now constantly using magical energy to maintain her Servant. If she cannot spare any for her crest worm, what will the starving worm do?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Regardless of the conditions, it&#39;ll drain her body to acquire the magical energy it&#39;s not getting\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>But she wouldn&#39;t lose magical energy if she doesn&#39;t use Rider, so\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, she should be able to live as before, for a while.</p><p>But I don&#39;t think the old man will let Matou Sakura do as she wishes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Right. He wouldn&#39;t plant a creature like that in her otherwise.</p><p>The worm will kill her if she doesn&#39;t fight,</p><p>and her body will also be destroyed if she fights and uses up magical energy.</p><p>No, not only that, but Zouken can do anything he wants with Sakura because he&#39;s the one who planted the worm in her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015He can do anything he wants with Sakura...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Zouken is holding Sakura&#39;s life in his hands. So defeating Zouken is the only way to save Sakura.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But Emiya-kun.</p><p>You have to defeat Sakura before you can defeat Zouken. She&#39;s his puppet. I&#39;m sure he would use her as his shield if you corner him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Exactly. Matou Sakura is a convenient tool for Zouken. He will control Matou Sakura as he instigated Matou Shinji.</p><p>In fact, she is superior as a Master. She is urged on by her worm, and she will run even wilder than Matou Shinji, just like Zouken wants.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...But I will be a bit irritated if everything goes his way.</p><p>I will perform the surgery on Matou Sakura. I have purified her poison and anesthetized her. The healing and the extraction of the crest worm will be performed next.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? Hey, Kirei...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is hopeless, but I will do my best. I cannot simply allow Matou Sakura to die. And what sort of priest would I be if all I could do was rely on the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s surprise is natural.</p><p>His words are surprising even to me, and I&#39;ve only known him for a short while.</p><p>...This isn&#39;t a guess, but a conviction.</p><p>Kotomine is seriously trying to save Sakura.</p><p>It might just be because he&#39;s a priest, but this is too much even for that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What&#39;s going on? This is the first time I&#39;ve seen you support someone like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not just a whim. It is simply too wasteful to let her die.</p><p>Well, I suppose it is better for the two of you to have another Master eliminated.&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest&#39;s response is plain.</p><p>Tohsaka glares at the priest...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll leave her to you. I&#39;m going to come back when the surgery should be over.&quot;</p><p>...And leaves the church with those words.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka leaves, and the church regains its silence.</p><p>The priest silently sees Tohsaka off, and I can&#39;t even stand up because I can&#39;t think of anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing? You are of no use to me here. I want no distractions. Go kill some time until the surgery ends.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I won&#39;t bother you. I trust you when it comes to surgeries. You helped that woman before too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah. The scale of this surgery is much greater than before.</p><p>Matou Sakura stopped herself by shooting herself. She is suffering from autointoxication probably because she harmed you. To put it simply, she killed her own mind to stop herself since she was controlled by Zouken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The procedure I&#39;m about to perform is like starting a heart that has stopped. ...Well, the crest worm has kept her body alive. If all I have to do is recover her mind, it should succeed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But your presence here is a liability. If you come barging in when you hear her scream, I will certainly fail. In any case, you bear no responsibility for her sufferings. You and Matou Sakura are strangers now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Strangers?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am telling you not to have any sympathy for her.</p><p>There is nothing you can do. Leave, like Rin has done.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Why? Can&#39;t I pray for her sake here if I can&#39;t do anything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is a crime. You have no right to share her pain.</p><p>Do you not understand? I am telling you the surgery will fail if you are here. You are only a harmful enemy to Sakura right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t finish my sentence.</p><p>His words are heavy, and they are pointing out the crimes I didn&#39;t know I had committed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Matou Sakura feels some kind of guilt towards you. If you are near her, she may refuse to wake up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Guilt towards me...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It is more like repentance than guilt.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015She is a victim of sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine the kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.</p><p>To state the fact, Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who knows men.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not surprised.</p><p>I know this feeling.</p><p>It&#39;s just like when I found out Sakura was a Master.</p><p>I silently accepted the truth when I saw the Command Spell on her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;The girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long the abuse called inheritance of magecraft lasted.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But\u2015\u2015\u2015what do you honestly think you can do now, when you stood by her side, completely oblivious, for all that time?</p><p>That&#39;s what I mean by you not having the right to pray here. But if you still care for Matou Sakura, leave. That&#39;s all you can do for now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I get up.</p><p>\u030A It&#39;s not that he&#39;s talked me into it.</p><p>It&#39;s just that\u2015\u2015\u2015what he&#39;s saying is correct.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t be here if I really care for Sakura.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to care for Sakura when I can&#39;t think at all.</p><hr><p>I turn my back to the priest and head for the door.</p><p>&quot;Oh. I do not think I even need to mention this, but...&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t have the composure to turn around.</p><p>I stop, still facing the exit.</p><hr><p>&quot;That incident you mentioned earlier. A woman was attacked when Matou Shinji still controlled Rider. She was saved thanks to you, but she would have died under normal circumstances.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m pissed.</p><p>Somehow, I understand why he&#39;s bringing this up now.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I need not mention who is at fault here. When Servants attack people, the responsibility lies on the Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you saying Sakura&#39;s at fault?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. I am only talking about the responsibility. I am not talking about good and evil. In reality, that woman is alive because of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But...</p><p>If I made a wrong decision back then, Rider would&#39;ve killed that woman.</p><hr><p>That means\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;Yes, this is about the future.</p><p>If Matou Sakura recovers, it will be the same in the end.</p><p>The same thing is bound to happen again even if she regains her consciousness.</p><p>Which one will you protect then?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015We don&#39;t know when Sakura might do the same thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I have nothing to say to him.</p><p>I quickly make my way to the exit as if to run away from his words.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya Shirou.

I don&#39;t have time for one of your long speeches...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not say that. This is important. I will be troubled if I do not tell you. Rin ran off without listening to me, so I need to tell somebody. Do I not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Is this about Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. She does not have long to live.</p><p>The crest worm continues to corrupt her body as we speak.</p><p>It is easy to extract it, but her body would never withstand the shock. It&#39;s like pulling out four-tenths of her nerves. She would die as a human being before the pain caused her to die of shock.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But leaving her alone will lead to the same result.</p><p>The loss of magical energy is slowly eroding her sanity. Soon she will lose all sense of self.

If you wanted to save her, you should have done so eleven years ago.</p><p>Do you still intend to save her, Emiya Shirou?</p><p>She will die in the next few days no matter what we do. Is there a meaning in saving such a person?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>I can barely stand under the impact of his words.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know anything about that.

I feel the same way too.&quot;</p><p>I glare at the priest.</p><p>...He must understand, because he nods slightly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Then hurry. Rin will surely kill Matou Sakura if she finds her first. Provide that lost child with shelter before that happens.&quot;</p><p>He doesn&#39;t need to tell me.</p><p>Turning my back to him, I follow Tohsaka into the rain.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015My breath is white.</p><p>Under the cold winter rain, my breath seems to freeze and blow back against my face.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no one on the road.</p><p>The street lamps light up the night in vain, and I run without aim.</p><p>...I&#39;m going to find Sakura.</p><p>It&#39;s not just the premonition that something terrible is going to happen if I don&#39;t find her quickly.</p><p>I just want to hold her hand right now and feel her warmth.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Haa, ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I run blindly.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where she went.</p><p>...Sakura no longer has any place to go.</p><p>There&#39;s no place for her at my house nor at the Matou household.

I was raped at the place I was adopted as a kid, and my first time was a long time ago. Not only that, my body has been continuously violated by unknown things.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s nails dig into her elbow.</p><p>...It&#39;s a masochistic action as if punishing the dirty stains on her body.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not the only thing.

She has to condemn herself and punish herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015So, don&#39;t cry.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Sakura once said it.</p><p>That she&#39;s a coward who needs someone to lead her by force.</p><p>I finally understand what she meant.</p><hr><p>Someone I want to protect.</p><p>Someone important to me.</p><p>Someone I never thought I would lose.</p><p>If I don&#39;t want her to cry anymore...</p><p>I have to take her hand and lead her to a place in the sun, so I should now\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. I&#39;ve been deceiving you all this time.</p><p>I never really believed I deserved to be with you.

My body would tremble at the pure thought of it, and it was really frightening. It was scarier than the time I put a knife on my wrist, and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from going to your house. I was scared of deceiving you, scared to stop deceiving you, and everything around me was scary. I couldn&#39;t move at all, and I didn&#39;t know what to do...!&quot;</p><hr><p>But I believe this is for the best.</p><p>Sakura says I should never have learned about this.</p><p>But if that were the case, she would just have kept on crying.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m stupid, right? You would&#39;ve eventually found out. But it&#39;s too late now, and I can never go back to your house. I thought every night that I should get away from you before it happened.</p><p>It&#39;s for your own good, and I knew I would stop crying at night, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t let her cry anymore.</p><p>If Sakura has to blame herself because nobody will blame her...</p><hr><p>&quot;But\u2015\u2015\u2015But I still wanted to hide it from you...!</p><p>I wanted to protect my time with you...!</p><p>That was the only meaningful thing for me, so why...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Even if nobody would forgive her, I would keep forgiving her in her place.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I embrace her cold body.</p><hr><p>...My arms are terribly unreliable.</p><p>I can&#39;t hold her tightly, nor can I pull her close.</p><p>...I can&#39;t save Sakura.</p><p>I want her to be with me, and I can only stay by her side.</p><hr><p>...Awkwardly, I wrap my arms around her.</p><p>Even if this is all I can do right now, my determination is definite and firm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai, I\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t cry.

I can&#39;t leave Matou Sakura alone as a magus of Tohsaka. The Association will be after me if I don&#39;t punish her as the supervisor of Fuyuki. It&#39;ll be too late then.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t care about your circumstances. Sakura hasn&#39;t done anything yet. If you still want to do something to her, you&#39;ll have to silence me first.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. You&#39;re a free magus that doesn&#39;t belong to the Association, so it might be good to discipline you here.</p><p>I&#39;m going to kill Sakura.

So far, he&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve hurt. So if he&#39;s forgiven me, I shouldn&#39;t be punished yet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey now. Do you really understand the state your body is in?</p><p>How can you say that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I can say it. I&#39;m still fine.</p><p>Are you serious, Tohsaka-Senpai? Senpai isn&#39;t a Master anymore. Saber-san&#39;s gone, and he&#39;s just my Senpai now, but you&#39;re saying you&#39;re going to kill him?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not he&#39;s armed. If he&#39;s planning to get in my way, I&#39;ll have to dispose of him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then. If you&#39;re still going to fight Senpai, I&#39;m going to fight you.

If you can say something like that, then fight on and win the war as a Master. Come to think of it, there is one way that you could be saved.</p><p>You would easily be able to disenchant Zouken&#39;s bindings if you obtained the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Tohsaka-Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m letting you go.</p><p>...We&#39;ll have our chance to fight as Masters.

So our alliance only lasted a day, huh? We can&#39;t cooperate as long as you&#39;re protecting Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t forget. We don&#39;t know when Sakura might run wild.</p><p>It&#39;s your own fault if you die when that happens, but since you took her in, you&#39;d better make sure you&#39;re the only victim.&quot;</p><p>She leaves without turning around.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Senpai. Um, I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t look so worried, you idiot. That&#39;s her way of being ironic.

Did your cold get worse again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? U-Um, how is it? Do I feel hot?&quot;</p><p>She must not know herself, as she asks me a strange question.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s not terribly hot, but you&#39;re warmer than me. It feels warm when I touch you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015i-it&#39;s probably a cold...! I think I caught a cold because I was in the rain for so long.&quot;</p><p>...?</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but Sakura lowers her head in embarrassment.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, you&#39;re right. Then you have to hurry and get changed and warm your body up. I&#39;ll cook dinner, so you go check your temperature, and if it&#39;s high, you&#39;re to come back to the living room wearing something warm. I&#39;ll make sure to cook something that&#39;s easy to eat.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... N-No, I don&#39;t need dinner.

I\u2019ll help you feel better right away.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai\u2026 I\u2026 ah\u2026 haa, haa, haa\u2026\u201D<br> Then first I should put her to bed.<br> Sakura is clinging tightly to me.<br> \u2026Her anguished expression makes me bite my lip.<br> I told Sakura that I love her, but I can\u2019t even do anything for her.</p><p>\u201CI want it\u2026 Senpai, I\u2026 don\u2019t have\u2026 enough\u2026\u201D</p><p>Her incoherent mutter mixes pain and bashfulness.</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t\u2026 hold back\u2026 I\u2026 can\u2019t bear it\u2026\u201D</p><p>Our breathing quickens.<br> Sakura\u2019s pained breath, and mine as I listen to it.<br> \u2026I can\u2019t stay calm being close to her.<br> For now, she needs to sleep in a warm bed.</p><p>\u201COkay, Sakura, just\uE011\u201D</p><p>\u201C---!\u201D</p><p>Sakura refuses and tries to run away\u2026 no, she leans back and grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 sorry, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not it, Senpai\u2026 I\u2026 no, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201D</p><p>I thought Sakura didn\u2019t want to be touched, but that\u2019s not it.<br> Sakura is behaving inconsistently.<br> Her arm is gripping my hand and trembling as it tries to draw me toward her, but her upper body is trying to move away.</p><p>\u201CSakura? Hey, Sakura!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t, if I do that\u2026 Senpai will\u2026 hate me\u2026 Ah\u2026 But, it hurts\u2026 and Senpai\u2019s hand is\u2026 so warm\uE012\u201D</p><p>My hand in Sakura\u2019s moves slowly towards her.<br> \u2026I can\u2019t pull free.<br> I can\u2019t let go of this frail, resisting hand.</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 Senpai\u2026 no, I don\u2019t\u2026 have enough\u2026\u201D<br> There\u2019s a captivating quality to Sakura\u2019s voice.<br> Sakura brings my hand close, and\uE012</p><p>As if looking for relief, she bites my finger.</p><p>\u201CHuh---\u201D<br> The surprise steals my strength away.<br> Why is Sakura doing this?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ow.\u201D<br> She bites into me.<br> There\u2019s a slight pain in my fingertip.<br> Sakura\u2019s teeth tear my skin, and pain and blood begin to pour out from the inside.</p><p>My blood streams out.<br> Sakura\u2019s shaking gradually slows.<br> Her cold limbs start to gradually regain their warmth.</p><p>\u201CMm\u2026\u201D</p><p>She gulps.<br> There is a tiny movement in her throat as she swallows the blood.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u201D<br> The tip of her tongue touches the wound.<br> It makes a quiet sound as she drinks the red blood.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Urk\u2026\u201D</p><p>My finger feels so pleasant it\u2019s as if it\u2019s about to melt away.<br> I feel the sensation of Sakura\u2019s lips, and the occasional gentle touch of her tongue.<br> But more than that, with every drop of blood that leaks from the wound, a sweetly pleasant feeling washes over me.</p><p>\u2026I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve felt this same pain somewhere before.<br> But I can\u2019t remember what kind of experience it was.<br> It feels so good it seems like a bother to remember.<br> She\u2019s only sucking my finger, but the comfortable sensation runs past my wrist and up to my elbow.</p><p>\u201CMm\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201D</p><p>It\u2019s as if the veins from my heart to my fingertip have been brought into sharp relief.<br> The blood carrying my magical energy spills into Sakura\u2019s mouth, and\u2026</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026 aah\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u2026I look objectively at the reality of the situation.<br> Sakura is drinking my blood while holding back embarrassment. And her condition is improving.</p><p>Then---what\u2019s the problem in what she\u2019s doing?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Ha\u2026ah\u2026\u201D</p><p>How much blood have I lost?<br> Judging by the weakness from my loss of blood\u2026</p><p>\u2026I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve only lost as much blood as I would from a blood donation.<br> Sakura gives my finger a final lick, and with a sound, lets it fall away from her lips.</p><p>We look at each other wordlessly.<br> Sakura\u2019s condition seems to have returned to normal, but she still looks forlorn.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Sakura?\u201D<br> Finally, I call her name.<br> I hold back the strange pleasure I felt from my finger, and my unease about what just happened.</p><p>\u201CSenpai\u2026 Ah, ah\u2026\u201D<br> With a start, Sakura lets go of my hand and jumps back.<br> She flees to the corner of the futon in a rush, and kneels while looking down in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201CSakura\u2026 no, I don\u2019t mind if you can\u2019t answer.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201D</p><p>Her voice is so quiet it\u2019s like it\u2019s about to disappear.<br> When I turn to face her, Sakura hangs her head as though cowering, her hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201C\u2026You know, right, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was trained as a magus at the Matou household.</p><p>\u2026Grandfather tampered with my body so that he could turn a child of another bloodline into a magus of the Matou family. \u2026The result is this body that goes crazy when I don\u2019t have enough magical energy.\u201D</p><p>\u2026A dark rage towards Matou Zouken wells up within me.<br> But even more than that, Sakura\u2019s passionate, pitiful speech fills my chest with pain.</p><p>\u201CThe worms in my body want power from a magus, so they start to ache. When that happens, I can\u2019t hold back anymore.</p><p>The worms eat up all my magical energy, and then they say that it\u2019s not enough and they want more. \u2026So I\u2026 Senpai\u2019s\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo the reason you drank my blood\u2026\u201D<br> \u201C\u2026\u201D</p><p>She gives a small nod.<br> In this silence, it makes a very definitive answer.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of magical energy in a magus\u2019s blood. So I started wanting to drink your blood, Senpai. If I drank that, it would replenish my magical energy, and it would relieve the weird things happening to my body.\u201D</p><p>\u2026I see.<br> Going back to being Rider\u2019s Master greatly increased Sakura\u2019s consumption of magical energy.<br> \u2026She was able to live normally without difficulty up until now, but now even that takes up magical energy.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s something wrong with me, isn\u2019t there. I-it makes sense that you\u2019d turn away from me, Senpai.</p><p>I\u2019ve been aching ever since we came home together, and I couldn\u2019t think of anything but you, and even though you\u2019re trying to help me I took it from you by force\uE013\u201D<br> \u201C---\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Senpai. I\u2019m strange, aren\u2019t I.\u201D</p><p>Her voice breaks.<br> The wound Sakura gave me throbs with pain right to my heart.</p><p>\u201CEven when you were holding me and worrying about me, I wanted to drink your blood.</p><p>You said you loved me as a girl, but sucking your blood was all I could think about.</p><p>All I could hear was the worms moaning. I wanted to feel better, I just wanted to feel better soon, so I wanted Senpai, Senpai\u2019s blood\uE013I thought maybe I didn\u2019t really love you, I just wanted to love you so I\u2019d be able to drink your blood, so\u2026!\u201D</p><p>\u201C---\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019m sorry. Someone like me who can only think of sucking blood to make herself feel better isn\u2019t worthy of your love\uE012\u201D</p><p>---It\u2019s obvious.<br> I don\u2019t even know why I should have to say it.</p><p>\u201C\uE013There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. You\u2019re beautiful, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh\u2026\u201D</p><p>I embrace her again and whisper.<br> Sakura\u2019s shoulders stiffen as if to resist me, but she goes limp in my arms.<br> Is it because Sakura is shaking and crying\uE012or because I\u2019m saddened that I can\u2019t cry for her?</p><p>\u201C\u2026Don\u2019t be stupid. How could I hate you over a little blood?</p><p>I loved you, Sakura. You\u2019re so beautiful I had to pretend not to notice until now.</p><p>\u2026So don\u2019t blame yourself like this. It\u2019s not your fault your body is the way it is.\u201D</p><p>I stroke her shoulder.</p><p>Sakura leans on my shoulder and sobs quietly.</p><p>\u201CAnd you know what? When you were sucking my blood, I was happy.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Huh? But, Senpai\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s nothing strange about that. Even if I can\u2019t cure you, I was happy that I could make you feel better.</p><p>So don\u2019t worry about it. If you refuse the only thing I can do for you, where does that leave me?\u201D<br> I pat Sakura on the back as if to cheer her up.</p><p>\u201CIf my blood will help, then tell me anytime.</p><p>If it will make you feel better, I\u2019d be happier that way.\u201D<br> \u2026I\u2019m glad that I fell in love with Sakura.<br> Because even if it\u2019s just a little, it\u2019s something I can be proud of.</p><p>\u201C\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Senpai, I\u2026\u201D</p><p>Sakura is apologizing.<br> Each time, I stroke her shoulder and tell her there\u2019s nothing to be sorry for.<br> Sakura is shaking uncontrollably, like a small child.</p><p>\u201CI love you, Senpai. I love you, so I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>But, if you\u2019ll still love me, then\u2026 I have a request.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Okay.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf I suffer again, will you\u2026 help me?</p><p>Even if I drink your blood, you won\u2019t hate me?\u201D</p><p>I stroke her head as I tell her it\u2019s all right.<br> Sakura stops trembling, and smiles through her tears.</p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026I\u2019m glad, Senpai.\u201D \u201C\u2026I\u2019m glad that I fell in love with you, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u2026She gives my cheek a light, but deeply affectionate kiss.<br> Touching the spot where her lips gently touched me, I go red just remembering it.<br> We touched many times up until now, but now it feels embarrassing all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201C\u2026Well, uh.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Senpai\u2026\u201D</p><p>We let go of each other and kneel face-to-face.<br> Everything that\u2019s happened up to this point is flooding into my head all at once, and I can\u2019t move.<br> Sakura seems the same, and our gazes roam restlessly around\uE012</p><p>\u201C\u2026Thank you for helping me so much today.</p><p>I\u2019m going back to my room\u2026 Good night.\u201D</p><p>Sakura stands up in a hurry.<br> I have no reason to stop her, and I\u2019m too embarrassed to anyway.</p><p>\u201CGood night, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026Yes. Good night, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>The shouji slides shut, and Sakura disappears.<br> \u2026Now that I\u2019m alone, I touch my cheek and my finger.<br> The seriousness of Sakura\u2019s situation is inevitable, but when I remember what just happened, I feel really happy.</p><p>\u201C---Time to sleep.\u201D</p><p>\u2026I want to remember it some more, but there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow, and I have to think about what to do about Tohsaka, and there\u2019s Rider, too.<br> \u2026Plus the Grail War isn\u2019t over yet, and I need to take down Matou Zouken who\u2019s the source of all this trouble, so Sakura\uE012</p><p>\u2026See, I really am getting sleepy.<br> My mind and body are both tired, so I need to sleep soundly now and give it my all from tomorrow onwards\uE012</p><p>I\u2019m dreaming.<br> I should be sleeping alone, but there\u2019s someone cuddling up to me.<br> I\u2019m too mentally and physically exhausted to be awake, and Sakura went back to her room.<br> So I could only be sleeping beside Sakura in a dream.</p><p>\u201C---\u201D</p><p>Even in my dreams, Sakura is drinking from me.<br> That\u2019s how stimulating it was when Sakura drank my blood.</p><p>\u2026I want to tell her that I love her.<br> She repeated \u201CSenpai\u201D over and over, desiring me, and I want to respond to her affection.<br> \u201C---\u201D<br> Sakura is drinking from me.<br> Even in my dreams, Sakura is drinking from me.</p><p>\u2026I\u2019m literally entranced.</p><p>It\u2019s not enough.
