Piercing the earth with an enormous pile bunker, everything is swallowed up by the resulting fissures in the ground.</p><p>In the Shinjuku Chapter, by using this Noble Phantasm to its greatest extent, it took another step closer to achieving the destruction of the Protagonist and the planet.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronoun: watashi</li><li>Second Person Pronoun: kimi</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>The dignified appearance of that charismatic evil person is so overwhelming, those with a rebellious spirit will lose their feelings of wanting to defy him in his presence. As a philosopher and a mathematician, Moriarty thinks of chaos as something \u201Cgood\u201D. Even though he was summoned as a Servant, due to the Skill \u201CThe End of the Spider Thread\u201D, he has become a being that one must always be careful around.</p><p>Another person, Max, who is the protagonist in \u201CDer Freisch\xFCtz\u201D, has been completely taken into Moriarty\u2019s existence, and in relation to Moriarty\u2019s personality, the fusion had practically no effect on it.

However, one of the treatises written by him, \u201CThe Dynamics of an Asteroid\u201D, has been buried in the dark without almost ever appearing on the surface, and Isaac Asimov thought of an idea for that and wrote \u201CThe Ultimate Crime\u201D, a short story in the Black Widowers Series.</p><p>Also, it is highly likely that Holmes intentionally circulated misinformation to have Moriarty\u2019s image and appearance differ from the one in the original texts.</p><p>\u201CAlthough personally, I just think that is what they call harassment, IS IT NOT?!\u201D</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A charismatic evil person.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Super-Excessively Armed Multipurpose Coffin \u2013 Reichenbach.</p><p>Moriarty boasts that \u201CBecause he died at that place, it is fitting to drag this coffin along.\u201D Unexpectedly, it is a formidable weapon equipped with multiple heavy weapons such as a missile launcher and a light machine gun.

Fortunately, since Frankenstein has a good sense in itself, Moriarty regains his true character whenever she hits him hard at a time where he behaved recklessly.</p><p><strong>Henry Jekyll</strong></p><p>While alive, Moriarty awakened Mr. Hyde, who is called evil, by setting a trap. He does not even consider that fragment evil. Since he considers it as something like, \u201CBecause, for him to exist individually, that in itself is his achievement.\u201D Because it looks like he will be killed if he puts that into words, he has been refraining from doing so.</p><p>Although Moriarty utters, \u201CI want to get along with him\u201D, this is relatively what he really thinks. Because after all is said and done, the works he sent out at a whim will be playing an active role for the sake of the world.</p><p><strong>Avenger of Shinjuku</strong></p><p>On the occasion of the Shinjuku Phantom Spirit Incident, Baal, who had acted as Archer of Shinjuku, conducted a remodelling of Phantom Spirits as he desired. For that reason, concerning that relatively, a terribly incalculable chimera had been completely finished, Moriarty secretly puts a distance between himself and Avenger of Shinjuku as a matter of fact.</p><p>\u201CDANGEROUS, very scary!\u201D</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>I was certainly not expecting that it would result in this many characters so far, like this suspicious old man who\u2019s being given all sorts of nicknames such as Shincha[1], Shinjuku Ojisan and Around 50. His image that was being depicted at the time was cold-hearted and unjust, and he was designed with a calculating and intellectual image, but I\u2019m taking my hat off to Mr. Writer who broke through that stereotype and obliged to write him as who he\u2019s now fascinatingly! Truly amazing! Design-wise, the Ulysses butterflies are a metaphor for a frail victim and the shedding of a disguise during metamorphosis, the chameleon is a metaphor for camouflage, and the spiderweb in the background is a metaphor for a mastermind manipulating crimes from the center; a metaphorical old man. In addition, he\u2019s also an old man whose True Name being hidden was not functioning very well for him. I can say it at last, but I came up with and depicted the orientation and pose in the drawings of Moriarty\u2019s standing pose so that it turns out to be the opposite to Holmes\u2019.
