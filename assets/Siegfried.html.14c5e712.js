Afterward I bathed in its blood\u2013<br> and gained immortality from it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Although, there is one part which was untouched by its blood. My back.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Well, that I&#39;m aware of, at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why wasn&#39;t it touched?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why did you leave it?</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say I had my reasons.<br> I&#39;m terrible at explaining this.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You see, because I bathed in Fafnir&#39;s blood\u2013<br> I can resonate with &quot;that dragon.&quot;</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> You could say it&#39;s like the relationship between Masters and Servants.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> However, the link is extremely weak. It only allows us to confirm each other&#39;s survival at best.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> During the battle in France, I was certain that Fafnir was destroyed, but...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It seems it&#39;s revived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha...Fafnir has?!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Master, I beg of you.<br> Return to France, and this time slay the dragon.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Won&#39;t you take me with you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll start monitoring...<br> Multiple signatures of lifeforms confirmed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It goes without saying, they&#39;re not human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please look at this, Master!<br> There are wyverns among them!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Did they survive that battle then recover?<br> Or were they reborn?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...In any case, they must be destroyed.<br> Aim for the wyverns first.

Standing atop of all Phantasmals,<br> they never have to worry about magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Living. Just by doing that,<br> it&#39;s possible to generate magical energy!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s the wyverns!<br> They&#39;ve formed a pack and started to attack!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It&#39;s not easy being a &quot;Dragon Slayer.&quot;<br> Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> \u2013Hm.<br> These wyverns were just born.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Born?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> When dragons become as large as Fafnir, they can bear offspring on their own.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Just like these.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Most of them are dead, but even if a few survive\u2013<br> they&#39;ll eventually be surrounded by strong fantasies.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Then new Evil Dragons will be born.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> It&#39;s because of that fear, we humans desperately fought the dragons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t you afraid?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re brave.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I appreciate that, Master.<br> Unfortunately, I was afraid.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I only killed the dragon because I was asked to.<br> I suppose I&#39;m the type who\u2013just can&#39;t refuse a request.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> To all warriors, the title Dragon Slayer was an eternal honor. ...I won&#39;t deny that I was motivated by fame.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> But, it was so scary I regretted it immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You still ended up victorious, right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Yes, but as I said before, even I don&#39;t know how I won.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> When I came to, there was the bloody dragon and my bloodstained self. Its lair was dyed red.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> My skin which should have been badly burned was hardly hurt. ...It was strange, but I knew I had won.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Were you happy?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Of course. The dragon was slain and I thought I could devote my entire life to realizing that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was it fun?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Yes, it was fun.<br> The moment I realized it, I gave an uncharacteristic shout.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> The treasure I gained eventually cast me into misfortune,<br> but... I have no regrets or hesitations.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s not the most enlightened way to put it,<br> but I accepted the circumstances of my life.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I grant someone&#39;s wish.<br> I accept their joy, their sadness, and their rage.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...And that was enough to give my life fulfillment.<br> Except\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> !!!<br> It seems our idle chatter is at an end.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;ve located it\u2013<br> Which means it&#39;s located me, as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve picked up a massive signature incoming...<br> No doubt about it, it&#39;s Fafnir!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now is the time to settle this!<br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...Farewell Fafnir.<br> May you be destroyed, this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is Mash.<br> Fafnir&#39;s destruction confirmed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve confirmed its destruction on my side as well.<br> I&#39;m scanning, but there&#39;s no sign at all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think you managed to finish him off this time.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Now it seems Balmung too has regained its original power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you continue with your story?</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s nothing more to tell.<br> We&#39;ll talk more next time we get the chance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> I&#39;m grateful, let&#39;s return Master.</p><h2 id="in-search-of-das-rheingold" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-search-of-das-rheingold" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Search of Das Rheingold</h2><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Master, Mash Kyrielight.<br> Forgive me, but I have a request.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it Fafnir again\u2013?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> No, that dragon was completely destroyed.<br> Please rest assured.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> But when the dragon revived, so did my lost Noble Phantasm.

Suppose a man finds it. With one glance, the treasure would captivate him completely.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> The captivated man would naturally spend the treasure.<br> Once he did, he would become known as its owner.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Eventually, everything around him\u2013will be drawn into a bloody struggle.<br> The battle will drag on and spread like fire, without end.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> In the end, the nation will be consumed by atrocities and executions, treachery and perfidy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That&#39;s what Rheingold is.<br> I regret having ever summoned it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. We need to prevent that from happening.

Though, I only did it because this guy asked me.<br> Right, my friend?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...If you think of me as a friend, stand aside Hagen.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> I refuse. This treasure is mine.<br> I killed you to obtain it.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> I won&#39;t give it to a wench like Kriemhild.<br> I won&#39;t give it to a coward like you who chose death!</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> This gold!

I should have stood firm,<br> and found a way to break through.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> That tragedy was not one I schemed...<br> Even then, there&#39;s no doubt that I am responsible.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> ...However.<br> I will retrieve the Rheingold.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Not for my own greed,<br> but because it is just.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong><br> \u2013Haha.
