Looking now, it\u2019s a pretty plain design, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a design I could have made if hadn\u2019t drawn Yu Mei-ren before. Because I have this belief that if I\u2019m getting called to be a guest designer I need to stand out to make it worth it\u2026 The \u201CThe Silent Woof\u201D book she\u2019s seen holding was based on a copy of \u201CThe Silent Miaow\u201D I randomly found in my work office\u2026 She hasn\u2019t removed the Book Off sticker from the cover. Seeing Hinako\u2019s reveal was deeply emotional moment for me because it had already been two years since I first designed Yu Mei-ren.
