It is the \u201CDomus Aurea\u201D, the theater personally designed by Nero herself and constructed in Rome while she was alive, recreated by means of Magical Energy.</p><p>It is a Great Magecraft falsely similar to a Reality Marble \u2013 an otherworld that embodies one\u2019s own imagined landscape, created by temporarily overwriting the current World \u2013 where the Magecraft recreates the theater and structures designed by Nero herself during her lifetime with her Magical Energy, creating a battleground that works advantageously for her. Unlike a Reality Marble that overwrites the World, this can be deployed/maintained for a long time because it is constructed on top of the World from scratch.</p><p>While it is being deployed, imprisoned opponents are weakened, and in the case of customizing the structures, Nero is also able to change its shapes and functions. Speaking of it in a way that is easy to understand, she can project the structures while disregarding the construction process, wherein she can then invoke the rules established by herself.</p><p>The sword skill \u201CLaus Saint Claudius (Praise Saint Claudius): The Flower\u2019s Imperium that Extols the Maiden\u201D is only available to Nero while the theater is still deployed.[2]</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person: yo</li><li>Second Person: kiden / kisama / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics)</li><li>Third Person: kidentachi / kisamara / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics)</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A self-proclaimed/cross-dressing young swordswoman, her body dressed in a red ball gown (dress). Nero boasts an overwhelmingly well-balanced fighting strength, led by her preeminent sword skills. She calls herself an almighty genius, introduces herself as Emperor, and almost all things are completely made to be realized by her forcibly. Innocence still remains in that appearance, but she refers to herself with \u201CI\u201D[3] and the like; selfish and egotistical, constantly looking down on others, and having a tendency to rush ahead recklessly, she is fully loaded with factors that a detestable character would be composed of if those traits come about normally.</p><p>However, Nero is an extraordinarily lovely character, having a cheerful openheartedness, a broadness that does not care much about trivial matters, and a simple-mindedness like that of a child\u2019s. She has a passionate nature, and although she is generous with love relationships because of matters during her lifetime among other things, she has a side to her where she would pout if those relationships were extravagant to her.</p><p>Still, Nero does not doubt of herself as a genius, calling herself an artist too, and she possesses a unique sense of beauty. Her unconditional justice is \u201Cto be beautiful.\u201D She likes pretty boys and handsome elders. She likes beautiful girls even more. She loves anything so long as it is beautiful, no matter what it is. A \u201Ctyrant\u201D who, while extolling herself as the supreme art, also extols the lives of every person as beautiful. Above all else, a dazzling girl who is also more self-centered than anyone; it feels as if she symbolizes a life that spectacularly fell.</p><p>There are hardly any Masters who will summon her out of that history. It is because her True Name was, at a time, heinous in the view of a certain religion, and also, the end of her life was even a miserable one.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>What Nero ascertains is not the societal good and evil, but the way human beauty ought to be, which becomes her standard. There is never a time where she will love something that is disconnected from that definition, and even if it is the command of a Master who exchanged a contract with her as a Servant, she will absolutely not obey them if she felt that they are ugly. There is no Mage who wishes to summon a Servant who would decide to evaluate their standards by such \u201Cbeauty\u201D, and in the Holy Grail War of the Moon as well, Servants are summoned not because of a Master, but by going down into the selection grounds for their own intentions.</p><p>Although she is a lonely person, Nero is furthermore proud in that she would never sell herself cheaply, only feeling like contracting with a partner who she deemed to be a genius on the same level as herself. For that reason, if there is a partner who she once approved of as her Master, she would not point out or even criticize their inexperience, and from the bottom of her heart, she would not look down on them as well. It seems one can gain her straightforward favour in the event that they are able to answer her expectations, that they are both rejoicing together, and that the trust in each other are being strengthened.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><ul><li>\u201CSilence!

His real name is Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. Nero is the Fifth Emperor of Imperial Rome. That life of his was coloured with schemes and poison, and in Rome during the 50~60 AD Period, he oppressed all religious influences and the Senate. In the Roman Period, because of his stance towards the Senate, and because of his oppression towards Christians thereafter, it caused him to be called a tyrant. It is being said that the \u201CRevelation of Saint John the Divine\u201D was written out of opposition towards this oppression.</p><p>Although Nero was enthroned as Emperor at 17-years-old, he had demonstrated his talent as a competent judge from before that enthronement. After his enthronement, he boasted tremendous popularity with the citizenry due to his lavish policies, and he had excelled in diplomacy too. He also personally participated in the \u201CNero Fest\u201D \u2013 an athletic meet which has three groups of competitions: music, gymnastics and equestrian \u2013 that followed the example of and was hosted after the Olympics.</p><p>Because of a rebellion that occurred in the year 69[4], Nero was driven out of the Emperor\u2019s throne and escaped from Rome. He understood while en route that he could not get away, and it is said that he committed suicide by means of a dagger while in tears.</p><p>Although he was known for the matter of having a peculiarity to cross-dress, in the \u201CFate\u201D World, Nero is, in fact, a woman.</p><h2 id="role-within-the-game-s-story" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-within-the-game-s-story" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role within the Game\u2019s Story</h2><p>In the Second Chapter \u201CSeptem \u2013 The Eternal Insanity Empire\u201D, Nero appeared not as a Servant, but as the active Roman Emperor. She went to war together with the Protagonist and the others in order to protect Rome, which was being threatened by Romulus and the rest of the successive Roman leaders.</p><p>In the Fifth Chapter \u201CE Pluribus Unum \u2013 The Great North American Mythological War\u201D, Nero reunited with her idol companion Elizabeth B\xE1thory, whose warm friendship was gained by Nero in the Holy Grail War of the Moon, and they were showing their combination style with good coordination.</p><h2 id="role-within-the-story-of-past-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-within-the-story-of-past-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role within the Story of Past Works</h2><p>In \u201CFate/EXTRA\u201D, the Protagonist there, as Nero\u2019s contractor, was branded with the special designation called \u201CPlayer (Master)\u201D[5] by Nero. As the Protagonist grew as a Master and continued to deepen their trust in her, Nero had come to bear a stronger, more straightforward favour towards them, and it became inevitable that she got them to pay close attention to her.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>The Successive Roman Emperors</strong></p><p>\u201CUhuh, each and every one of them are great Roman Emperors!

The fact is, I was giving into the temptation that I will draw Roman-style buildings and the Golden Theater as her background, but there\u2019s also a worry where I wondered if they would be a bit too pompous in contrast with her rarity, and also, I wondered if it was alright to have her be at least the first person to give off the feeling that she came from EXTRA, so since I considered those, I decided on a sea of electrons as her background.
