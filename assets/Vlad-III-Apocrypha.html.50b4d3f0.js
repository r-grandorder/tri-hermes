You see, I was born the second son of my father, Vlad II, and was ruler of Wallachia.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Although I was driven to misfortune, I have no regrets over my life.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> However\u2013since my materialization as a Servant,<br> I have been haunted by a different memory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Could those be of\u2013Dracu...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I apologize.<br> Please continue your story.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. The memories of that dreaded vampire.<br> People I&#39;ve never seen before glare at me, and try to drive a stake through my heart.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...The hearts of men! They are full of absurd naivety and incorrigible stubbornness.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> They affix imaginary personalities, imaginary histories, and imaginary stories to reality.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But they have no idea how much trouble those affected are going through. Therefore, heed my orders.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Travel with me to a different era, and eliminate the imaginary history. \u2013It should be easy.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Even imaginings are based on real tales, and those tales have authors.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> We will bring an end to them. It should be easy for us.<br> \u2013Don&#39;t tell me, you&#39;re going to say no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...W-Well, that&#39;s right.<br> Defamation is a problem that can&#39;t be ignored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Regardless of the outcome, or how we arrived at it...<br> Revealing the truth is the right thing to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think we can?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. At least I think so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once we start tracking Dra...&#39;s footsteps, the place with the highest magical energy response...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...will most likely be the origin of Dra...&#39;s legends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that... Can the commonly known legend of Dra... be erased that easily?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Why are you still talking?<br> I gave you an order. Hurry and make haste.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, sir.<br> All right, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re in London.<br> We&#39;re picking up a strong magical energy response here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Most likely, the biggest difference between the original Vlad and the vampire Vlad is whether he visited London or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Normally, Vlad has no connection with this place whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2013So, this is London. I see.<br> What a dreadful place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Naturally, Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra never actually existed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, it&#39;s possible there were actual women being attacked, and having their blood sucked\u2013 Women who resembled the characters.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Fine.<br> Commence your investigation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But we have no clues at all.<br> Doctor, do you have anything on your end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well... I have picked up several small traces of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it&#39;s hard to say if those are powerful enough to establish the legend of Dracula.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll keep trying!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2013No, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m well aware of your devotion to this task. However, it vexes me that there&#39;s nothing I can do.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that later generations would brand me a tyrant for my reign.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> However\u2013even so, I am sure it wasn&#39;t enough for people to start calling me Dracul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Vlad...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> That was\u2013the cry of a woman!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I picked up a strong magical energy response.<br> Mash, you should go take a look.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I will accompany you.<br> Right\u2013I hope we run into this vampire.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Please...stop...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> \u2013&quot;Kazikli Bey.&quot;</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...I see. This is quite intriguing.<br> Look, Mash and my Master!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Completely unfitting for this era, for this place\u2013<br> On appearance alone, this is indeed &quot;Dracul.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A monster that transforms into a bat,<br> and preys on human flesh\u2013 Truly despicable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Prepare for your death, you heinous bat. In my current rage, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re the Devil himself... I&#39;ll crush you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sound just now...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It looks like he&#39;s calling his allies. Fine. Saves me the trouble of hunting them down. How efficient.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Oh how I wish every war was like this.<br> Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You are absolutely right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s crush them all right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t agree more, Master!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let the devastation commence!<br> Otherwise\u2013show us just how much of a devil you are!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmph. Perish without a trace, you filthy beasts.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> You, girl.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Y-Yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Worry not. This beast shall no longer trouble you.<br> Return to your home, and indulge in peaceful slumber.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Y-Yes, sir.<br> Pardon me\u2013 What is your name, sir?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Vlad III. Remember it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hmm. I believe it&#39;s safe to assume the history has returned to its proper path.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, yes.<br> I think\u2013this will do the trick.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Magnificent!<br> Then let us return.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Sorry for forcing you to accompany me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, not at all.<br> It&#39;s quite all right.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Yes. Tonight you should rest as much as you like.<br> I will be in my spirit form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Even if we correct history,<br> the chance for the legend of Dracula to be erased is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pretty low?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Almost none at all?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, for Vlad\u2013this IS his wish for the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who knows what might actually happen?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But at the very least, people&#39;s perception of Vlad III might change\u2013 That would be a miracle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All we can do now is hope and watch.</p><h2 id="legend-of-dracula-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#legend-of-dracula-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Legend of Dracula II</h2><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hm... London again? We&#39;ve already taken care of that devil... Is there something else?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but we picked up something in in the area.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Perfect, then! Even the defeat of a small foe would be a worthy addition to my legend!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My name remains infamous, but I shall not be known as demonic nor as vampiric.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Very well. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Ah. It seems we&#39;ve found it. It seems our foe is a mere wraith this time, rather than a devil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is not malicious.<br> The Demonic Fog still seems to be lingering in the city.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may normally be \u201Cjust a wraith,\u201D but right now it&#39;s a deadly evil spirit.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Heeelp...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go rescue her!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Oh, I know.

Unforgivable! I shall destroy you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Vanished like the mist.

In the northern part of the city, there is a response very similar to the devil we just saw.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, just like last time, it is a weak response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...This is just speculation, but there is a high possibility that it&#39;s a Demonic Beast that we&#39;re just assuming is a devil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely here because of the residual Demonic Fog still in the area.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Or perhaps it was summoned for some purpose related to magecraft.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...

If it&#39;s hard to say, you may simply call me Vlad III.

Kill them all...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Now what has he summoned this time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This&#39;s a super giant organism reaction... Could it be...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did he manage to summon...a dragon to the 19th century...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to be surprised.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> The seven eras had stood once under fire. If they are undergoing repairs, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising something like this can happen.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Y-yes... I did it! My clan&#39;s ambitions have finally been fulfilled!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Using this dragonkin, I shall bring all of London&#39;s mages under my command!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Now all the Lords of the Clock Tower will be erad\u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The mage...!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!<br> It&#39;s...

Only through luck and coincidence did he succeed in his summoning. Without the ability to control his thrall, there is no point summoning it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Fine.<br> O almighty Phantasmal Beast... Dragonkin!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> My father revered thy name, and deemed thy form perfect for battle!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And as his son, I have been despised by my enemies, by the people, by history itself... Not as a dragon, but as the devil!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And now, I shall grapple with thee...a being Father deemed perfection itself. What irony!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But I am grateful for this evil fortune! It may be twisted, but I will make a most worthy opponent for you!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I, Vlad III, the son of Dracul...shall sink my fangs into your neck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dragonkin...incoming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Indeed! Taste my deadly spear!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Protect the people of the city!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Yes! How like my Master to be conscious of such a thing, even in a situation like this!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> If we were in the right era, you might have made a respectable king.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Impressive, dragonkin. As a creature that possesses part of my name, you truly were a worthy opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s the opposite, my lord.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I suppose we&#39;ve managed to improve my name&#39;s ill repute here.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A mysterious hero who saved London from a dragonkin... Not bad. Not bad at all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (If it&#39;s mysterious, then no one will know it was him...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh no! A crowd is gathering!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move out! Master, Vlad...hurry!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> U-um...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Hm? What is it?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> If it&#39;s all right...may I take a photograph with you?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> A photograph? Hm. I&#39;ll allow it.<br> Master. Let&#39;s take it together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that... C-can we do that...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I&#39;ll allow it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Even that Saint George\u2013Georgios\u2013has made a hobby of it. That surely means it is not something that would give offense to God.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Master. My collar is not crooked, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I-is this okay?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Ha... I have knowledge of the modern world. I know very well that such contraptions don&#39;t steal one&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Pity it will be monochrome, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I think Vlad is missing the point...)</p><hr><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Here we go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-this picture&#39;s not going to be left for future generations, is it...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Do not worry. Even if it were, nobody would know what kind of photo it was anyway.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It is destined to turn to dust someday, much like that dragonkin we just defeated.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I appreciate you accompanying me on my endless journey to fulfill my desires.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> It may be futile. It may all be in vain.<br> It may be a meaningless and ludicrous journey.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> But such a thing is not to be fought. It is not in my nature to be abashed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> And. While I savor all of these endeavors...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong><br> I simply cannot take pride in the fact that I am a vampire. Not ever.</p>', 260);
