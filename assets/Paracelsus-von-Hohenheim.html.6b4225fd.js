He was one of the masterminds behind Project Demonic Fog...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...but now he&#39;s one of our allies. A miracle of the Heroic Spirit summoning system, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I admit I was startled when he said that he wanted to go to &quot;the London of that era.&quot;</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> That&#39;s understandable. I attempted to commit vile crimes against the world and its people.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It&#39;s logical for you to doubt me.<br> However\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I truly do not wish for the human world to be destroyed.<br> Thus, I sympathize with your goals and objectives.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Now I believe that it&#39;s possible to save all of my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...My former self running that Project may have laughed in contempt at such a notion.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> But now... Now that I&#39;ve entered into a contract with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I have faith once again.<br> In people. In the world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...In the existence of allies of justice capable of fighting evil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Allies of justice\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> That is none other than all of you. You defeated me as I reached out to the Project at the edge of despair.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Allow me to say the following with the deepest gratitude.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Thank you.<br> I beg you to show me your power once more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It depends on the situation.<br> Mr. Paracelsus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mentioned unusual changes occurring in London as it corrects itself\u2013that is what you claim?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean by &quot;unusual changes?&quot;<br> The Demonic Fog is gradually dissipating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As the era is corrected, London should return to normal without having to wait for the Demonic Fog to clear up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And yet,<br> you seem to be agitated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why is that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He senses something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He knows something?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> To Master&#39;s query, all I can say is this.<br> Yes and no.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that I sense some kind of connection.<br> But I also know that there&#39;s something in this place.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Namely\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Never mind. Let us speak later.<br> Something remaining in the Demonic Fog approaches.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s right!<br> Multiple magical energy readings detected in the fog!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re likely the automatas!<br> They&#39;re bursting with magical energy, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.<br> Senpai, give us orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Destroy the enemy while maintaining a barrier!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!<br> \u2013Preparing for battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ending combat.<br> All enemies destroyed.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...Very impressive, Master.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Let us be off then.<br> I must show you firsthand what I know.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> There&#39;s an underground space under the southern tip of Regent&#39;s Park...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It&#39;s part of the underground facility for the Mage&#39;s Association Or rather, for Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> You could say it&#39;s one of their quarantine areas.<br> There&#39;s something here that has been sealed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Stuff like...dangerous magical tomes, Mystic Codes, and catalysts?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Magical tomes\u2013<br> This is basically what I&#39;m referring to.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> In particular, there&#39;s one tome that was used to seal a powerful evil that almost manifested itself in this world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> That tome, along with many other magical books,<br> was carefully sealed with powerful spells.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Even the spread of the Demonic Fog could not weaken the seals placed on the tomes.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Just like other dangerous things that were sealed.<br> However...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You believe that these seals have been broken, correct?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your reasoning?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You seem quite certain.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.<br> I&#39;m also bothered by his self-assurance.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The reason is that if I existed in this London and continued to pursue my designs\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> \u2013I would break the seals without fail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh!? Does that mean you&#39;re going to break the seals now!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m not the one who will break the seals.<br> It will be the one still here\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2013To be more precise, the &quot;me&quot; from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This voice\u2013<br> Wait, I&#39;ve detected a new Servant!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Show yourself.<br> Loather and mourner of evil, and yet is evil himself.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> You who would crush all life with the very hands that would hold your dear children...

Thou art I.<br> Thy name is my name\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Paracelsus von Hohenheim!<br> The consort of evil!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> ...Oh dear.<br> What an unfriendly way to address yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There are two Paracelsuses?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Which one is the real one?!</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> How easy it is to confuse you.<br> But I shall speak only the truth.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> We are both real.<br> I am thou... Thou art I.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> The Servant Paracelsus beside you whom you duly summoned and made a contract with.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> And I, born of Servant Paracelsus&#39; magical energy that returned to the fog when you defeated him.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> Both share the name &quot;von Hohenheim.&quot;<br> Both are real.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> Admittedly, my existence is somewhat unstable.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong><br> For the Holy Grail is already gone! Materialization while lacking ways to summon Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...He seems to be right. Observational results show that his magical energy is weak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Demonic Fog...<br> Has given birth to a final Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes, exactly. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in a hurry.<br> In a hurry to destroy this era.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> At this rate, this era will be completely restored.<br> If so, I cannot destroy it with my own hands.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> My existence will likely disappear.<br> However, I can&#39;t let that happen.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I have accepted the destruction of humanity as fate.<br> One cannot stop it.
