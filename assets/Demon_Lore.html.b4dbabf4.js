Feel free to skim this and scroll to the next header if it&#39;s too much.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to turn this into a Japanese lesson, but I want to be clear that I can&#39;t fix everything so I&#39;m going to have to train you on what to actually look out for to &quot;autocorrect&quot; past and future mistranslations from the likes of Fate/Grand Order North America (&quot;Daemon&quot; and &quot;Demon&quot; is stupid for reasons I&#39;ll cover), Melty Blood: Type Lumina&#39;s embarrassing official translation (Kaibutsu/Monster as Demon wtf but Kouma is part Oni which isn&#39;t a Demon in Nasuverse lore exactly), but also a lot of intelligent and well-meaning fan translations.</p><p>Demon lore is often translated poorly for several reasons (Demons not being that popular for one, neither is DDD where it&#39;s relevant, Extra CCC was in Pending Translation hell for years for the sake of integrating it into the game), but it is primarily the confusion with how Nasu changes synonyms to mean different things like how Majutsu and Mahou are Magecraft and Magic, Ma are &quot;Aberrations&quot;, for the lack of an &quot;official&quot; English word to express &quot;Demon but not quite&quot;, I had to pull this term from Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Nasu borrows concepts from D&amp;D anyway so I think it works), and Akuma -- &quot;Demons&quot; are just Demons, none of this &quot;Daemon&quot; nonsense which muddies the lore of the wider Nasuverse as a whole because if the Greek Guardian Spirits &quot;Daemons&quot; ever show up or come up in any form of lore discussion, that &quot;translation&quot; falls apart completely... even if the word roots are essentially the same. It&#39;s just bad, okay? You&#39;ll have to do the research or trust me on this one.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a whole dictionary&#39;s worth of potential translations to translate the demon lore and I&#39;m certain someone is going to disagree with my reasoning, all I can say to that without sounding like I&#39;m tooting my own horn is that I&#39;m the one who&#39;s actually bothering to translate these terms with the intent of translating DDD (where this lore actually comes up in a story in a meaningful way), and that might sound rude but it&#39;s just being assertive, I just hope this style guide reads well for our purposes.

Let\u2019s set this aside for now.</p><p>\u2461 Next, let\u2019s clear up the meaning of \u201Cclustering illusion.\u201D When you search for this term along with the word \u201Cprobability\u201D you can find an example about a jar which is filled with marbles of two colors, white and black. After you fill the jar and mix up the marbles inside, instead of the marbles appearing like a chess board, with the colors equally and evenly mixed together in a checker pattern, you will notice clumps of white marbles and clumps of black marbles here and there in the jar. These clumps, which seem non-random, despite actually being randomly distributed, are the clustering illusion.</p><p>\u2462 From the above explanation you can see that the term marble comes from marble in the glass ball sense, not the marble floor sense of the word.</p><p>\u2463 Even in a situation where you have half black marbles and half white ones and you mix them up, \u201Clogically\u201D you assume that the white and black should be evenly mixed since there are equal amounts, but when you check the result you don\u2019t see an even mix, you see clumps and groups in the pattern. This is precisely where clustering illusion comes in, and the result of a series of random coincidences may seem as though it was purposefully realized by someone, despite it actually being a natural phenomenon. So when probability itself is being interfered with, one might understand that materializing Brunstud Castle might not be so implausible . Therefore, when the world is connected with a marble phantasm or reality marble, probability is interfered with, and a series of phenomena, which could only ever be considered to be random coincidences, is deliberately generated.</p><h3 id="marble-phantasm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#marble-phantasm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Marble Phantasm</h3><p>\u2460 Imagination Materialization.

Emiya Shirou. Have you ever heard of the term &quot;demonic possession&quot;?&quot;</p><p>Shirou (Avenger): &quot;Demonic possession...?&quot;</p><p>I remember hearing about it.<br> It&#39;s one of the spiritual disorders that&#39;s well-known in the west. The Japanese equivalent would be something like being possessed by a Kitsune or Inugami.<br> An inhuman &quot;something&quot; that possesses humans and starts breaking them down from the inside, similar to a curse.</p><p>The symptoms are too broad to be systematized, but these western possessions are usually caused by an outbreak of the very concept of &quot;demons.&quot;<br> For reasons, or criteria that human intelligence cannot grasp, demons tend to possess good-natured humans. Compared to the Japanese concept of possession which is based on the will of &quot;those behind the curse&quot;, Western &quot;curses&quot; are phenomena occurring with no intention at all, like traffic accidents.</p><p>Those who are possessed are usually ordinary, good-natured people.<br> Their minds are afflicted with mental illnesses, disparaging morality and God&#39;s teachings, and they go on to terrorize those around them. Not by direct violence, but by showing them the repulsive creatures humans become just by being stripped of reason.</p><p>However, these are just the early symptoms of demonic possession.<br> The degradation of those have been possessed for a long time isn&#39;t limited to the mental level alone.</p><p>Severe &quot;possessions&quot; even change the victim on the physical level.<br> ... The formless &quot;thing&quot; will attempt to incarnate within the host&#39;s body.<br> The transformation starts with the development of an unimaginable level of body control for a normal human being, and goes on until the body parts are mutated.<br> The mutations depend on the rank of the &quot;thing.&quot; The stronger the demon is, the further away from human the victim transforms.</p><p>...But fortunately, an aberration cannot be incarnated within a human body.<br> A person who is possessed will be forced into an unnatural translation and simply die as a result. The western depicted demons all look rather weird.<br> Two heads, hooves, or limbs arranged into the shape of a hexagram. Definitely not something a human with only one set of arms and legs could imitate.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>&quot;However.<br> It&#39;s said that there are rare cases of humans being able to endure these transformations. Like how magi craving secret arts become vampires, heretics extend their lifespans by utilizing the &#39;things&#39; that devour the blueprints known as their souls.&quot;</p><p>So, this woman is...</p><p>Caren: &quot;...That too is a misunderstanding. While it is irrelevant to the matter at hand, I used to serve as an exorcist&#39;s assistant. I was never possessed, and I do not believe I ever will be. A demon requires a healthy body. It cannot take root in mine.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: \u201C? Well if that\u2019s the case, why did you start bringing up Demonic Possession in the first place? If you said your body was possessed by a demon, I\u2019d understand to some extent but--\u201D</p><p>Caren: &quot;...Porca miseria.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;Uh... did you just say something really mean?&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;I just said, &quot;What an impatient person.&quot; ...We shall get to the real issue right after this. Just listen, please.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;Being possessed will produce many forms of supernatural symptoms. Like knocking sounds that are associated with a poltergeist disturbing its surroundings, or interference with the host&#39;s body. ...You could say it&#39;s a disease that only affects the host. It is a poison that does not spread to others like a virus would.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;No kidding. If you could catch demon like a cold, I doubt there&#39;d be any normal humans left by now.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;That\u2019s probably true. However, just like how humans with high supernatural awareness have the ability to sense aberrations, there are also humans that experience the same spiritual symptoms of possession victims just by being near them.<br> Frankly speaking, I\u2019m talking about myself. Whenever I get close to something that is possessed by a \u201Cdemonic\u201D presence, my body will reproduce the exact same spiritual symptoms that the demon would have caused.</p><p>My master called it Masochistic Spirit Medium Syndrome.&quot;</p><p>No pause or hesitation.<br> Caren has just said something that might send me straight into a major depression if I think about it too hard.</p><p>Avenger: &quot;...What? So, basically, you will turn into a demon if you get near one?&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;...Although that is an idiotic response, let&#39;s just stay it&#39;s correct.<br> To be exact, it is an automatic reproduction of spiritual damage of aberrant origin.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;Let us say you got infected with a cold. Assume that it is still during the early stages before the symptoms show, so your body just feels a little heavy.<br> ...Now if I get near you, the symptoms that will eventually be caused by that disease would appear in me. The number of patients increased to two, so to say.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;...While it seems that it caused you harm, this trait generally isn\u2019t an issue for other people.<br> So please, don\u2019t worry about it from now on.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;...Even if you say so...<br> Well, I wasn&#39;t worried in the first place, but no surprise attacks, alright? I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that getting close to you will cause a lot of pain.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;I suppose that\u2019s true. I am frequently under demonic influence. Yourself aside, Shirou Emiya, the presence of monsters will have an effect. If you find this prospect frightening, you shall do well by staying away from me whenever they are nearby.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t understand it, but this is one bit advice I should probably follow.<br> Alright unless things get serious, let&#39;s try to not get too close.<br> Randomly hurting each other is no good.</p><p>Avenger: \u201CSo back then...\u201D</p><p>Caren: &quot;...Most likely. It was probably the incarnation of the spiritual damage belonging to those monsters.<br> While they rank low, it seems that they have a connection to demons.&quot;</p><p>In other words, if they aren&#39;t near, she won&#39;t go nuts either?<br> ...If so, would those monsters&#39; symptoms be, &quot;creation of the same monster&quot;?</p><p>Caren: &quot;We shall leave my traits aside for now. How about we continue with your questions?&quot;</p><h3 id="caren-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caren-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Caren II</h3><p>However, she was not invited to be a Cistercian Nun.<br> An Agent.<br> She was delivered only as an armament of the Church for assistance in the exorcism of Demons.</p><p>A weapon is intended to be guided by the hands of men.<br> She was permitted to leave the monastery only when her unusual talents were required to make known the Lord\u2019s might.</p><p>The might of the Lord was not meant to be turned towards the sons of man.<br> It should be aimed at those wild ones who fear not the Lord, the aberrations who threaten the Son of Man. Aberrations who possess people in order to give form to their evil.<br> &quot;To cleanse this person and reveal the love of God to the sons of man&quot;, that was the task given to the woman, no, to the agent using the woman.</p><p>The woman was used for exorcising demons.<br> Special priests, allowed to act as &quot;representatives&quot; from the bishops of the diocese.<br> They answer calls for help, visiting the towns of the possessed to exorcise demons.</p><p>It was closer to fighting than praying.</p><p>Her master frequently said to himself that the work was like washing the bottom of Hell&#39;s cauldron.</p><p>Exorcisms vary in severity, and the cases that her master took on were particularly intense ordeals.<br> It doesn&#39;t concern impostors attempting to deceive us by blaming their own self-destruction on the acts of demons, nor does it concern monsters resembling epidemics.<br> Their opponents were only those who had completely &quot;become&quot; demons.</p><p>The tragedy caused by a True Demon isn&#39;t something that can be endured with a human mind. All of the towns visited by the exorcist had deviated from the human world. The damage caused by an aberration is not limited to the possessed, it also spreads to the people around them.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Going beyond the possession victim&#39;s physical abnormalities, their spirits, rather than their bodies, are twisted into a more grotesque form.</p><p>As her master would say, it wasn&#39;t far from a tour of Hell itself.</p><p>In an exorcism, the most fatal vulnerability is none other than human reasoning.</p><p>The body&#39;s survivability is not that important.</p><p>Because a human&#39;s abilities cannot compete with someone who has &#39;turned&#39; into a demon anyway.</p><p>The physical body is protected by a holy relic embodying the miracle of the Lord.<br> However, the spirit \u2014 the soul \u2014 must be defended with one&#39;s own will.<br> What is required in an exorcism is ironclad faith.<br> In that respect too, the woman was well suited for the exorcism of demons.<br> It was fortunate that she didn&#39;t have a wide range of emotions.<br> The exorcism of a True Demon is considered to be something that cannot be endured twice, and yet she continued to go through them indifferently.</p><p>The woman was very useful.<br> She had the life of a nun and the role as an agent of the Church.<br> The workload was nothing short of backbreaking.<br> It probably would have overcome any normal person within a month&#39;s time.</p><p>Caren: &quot;I do not do anything. I have not been granted the rites, nor sacraments to exorcise a demon. I simply accompany my master.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;Huh? You mean you just follow him around? That&#39;s it?&quot;</p><p>What the hell?<br> Is this guy she&#39;s calling &quot;master&quot; a wimp?</p><p>Don&#39;t tell me he was just too scared to go to towns where the possessed were by himself.</p><p>Caren: &quot;I won&#39;t ask what you&#39;re getting angry about, but that is an over-simplification. Those who become exorcists do not fear demons. What they do fear is the shattering of their own mind.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;\uFF65\uFF65\uFF65\uFF65\uFF65\uFF65Huh. That&#39;s impressive and all but if that&#39;s the case, he&#39;d be okay if he just exorcised them all by himself, right? Isn&#39;t it unnecessary for you to get involved? I mean, what about that &quot;Masochistic Spirit Medium Disorder&quot; thing you have? If you get close to a demon, you&#39;d get the same symptoms as the possessed guy, right? And if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019d be a nuisance rather than an assistant. It\u2019s like jumping into a fire while covered in gasoline.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;That is my role. To take spiritual damage.<br> Because that is the quickest way to identify an aberration.<br> Demons are invisible to the human eye, it doesn\u2019t become apparent that someone is possessed until they transform. Or rather, True Demons are clever, so they conceal themselves within the possessed. So as to not attract the attention of enemies until reaching maturity, they try to suppress their spiritual damage as much as they can.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;...Unfortunately the church has no way to exorcise fully-matured demons. The only thing exorcists can do is find the possessed before they can mature and exorcise them.<br> Once they have become a demon, we have no choice but to incinerate them.<br> Only an agent specializing in heretic inquisition would be able to do that.&quot;</p><p>Demons can\u2019t be seen by humans. Only the host knows they are possessed.<br> The first, and most difficult step in an exorcism is finding the demon that conceals its true identity.<br> Even for a skilled exorcist, identifying a demon is like walking on a tightrope at all times.</p><p>This is where she&#39;s useful.<br> She has an idiosyncrasy that responds lustfully to surrounding demons, evil spirits, and the like, and causes the effects of the possession on its own.<br> If you look at it from the Church&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s an extraordinary &quot;heresy.&quot;<br> Although it would normally be a useless physical disorder that would cause her harm just by being alive, there is one specific purpose that shows off its ground-breaking effectiveness.</p><p>In short...</p><p>This girl is a living detector that sheds blood to inform others of demons.</p><p>It makes a tearing noise.<br> It breaks her arms, crushes her legs, and rips her womb from the inside.<br> Even if the form returns, the function does not.<br> The sight from those dull, golden eyes was lost long ago.<br> I doubt her bell-like voice could ever make a sound again.</p><p>\u2026 These are her true colors.</p><p>She is a messenger of God, who saves others by mutilating herself until her death.</p><p>Avenger: \u201C...Just asking, but can you refuse?<br> You can\u2019t right? Surely you&#39;d have refused if you could.\u201D</p><p>Caren: &quot;That is also incorrect.<br> The Church is strict, but not inhumane. One has the right to refuse participation in an exorcism.\u201D</p><p>Avenger: \u201C----So why do you bother helping with the exorcisms?\u201D</p><p>Caren: \u201CBecause there is meaning in it.<br> Besides, neither outside nor inside are any different to me.\u201D</p><p>Going outside to perform exorcisms and being inside the monastery are no different.</p><p>...Ah, so that\u2019s it.</p><p>I had thought before that she was riddled with bandages and reeked of disinfectant, but it\u2019s no wonder.</p><p>An Aberration stings at the very heart of a human.</p><p>No matter where she goes, she can\u2019t avoid getting hurt.</p><p>Avenger: &quot;That\u2019s total bullshit. That\u2019s not a good reason to take part in exorcisms.<br> Don\u2019t you even have one complaint?\u201D</p><p>Caren: \u201CI understand that I have a handicap compared to others, but that\u2019s what I was born with.<br> There is no point feeling bitter about it. If I was born this way, I just have to abide by my fate.\u201D</p><p>Avenger: \u201CWhat? Haven\u2019t you thought about curing it? If it\u2019s something like a disease, at least do something to improve your health.\u201D</p><p>Caren: \u201CThere is no hope for a cure, nor do I wish for one. It is enough just to be able to pity myself over my misfortune.</p><p>\u30FC\u30FC\u30FC\u30FCBesides, although I certainly do become injured, those are not my wounds, but rather those of someone else.

You doing a good job of exorcising that demon?&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;No, I&#39;m not okay at all. I have performed many exorcisms before now, but I have to admit this one is a first for me.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;Hmm... So this is a tough one.&quot;</p><p>Red blotches surface on her bandages.</p><p>Luscious. Raw. I had thought this woman was like a doll, but I&#39;m actually looking at raw, succulent meat.&quot;</p><p>Caren: &quot;In terms of strength, it would be among the weak.</p><p>But there is one thing different about it, and that is throwing me off.</p><p>...I mean, this demon is harsh with me.&quot;</p><p>Avenger: &quot;Huh? Doesn&#39;t it go without saying that demons are harsh?&quot;</p><p>Caren: \u201CNo. On a fundamental level, demons are kind. They are an imaginary element that understand one&#39;s pain and attempts to remove it. Depending on your perspective, they can be seen as allies of humans.
