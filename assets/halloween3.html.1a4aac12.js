It all started two years ago...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Halloween):</strong><br> This is Halloween!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Halloween):</strong><br> Hit it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Halloween):</strong><br> BLAAahhh\u266A</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Brave):</strong><br> I forgot it was Halloween!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Brave):</strong><br> Thank goodness I brought it all together in time!<br> Hit it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Brave):</strong><br> AAAaahhhhHHH\u266A</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those fortunate innocents who had not themselves experienced the horror begged for stories of it. Some adventure-addled fools even wished to witness that hell for themselves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the harrowed survivors would say nothing of their experiences. The vacant, pained expressions they wore spoke louder than any words ever could.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, but the story does not end there.<br> Rejoice, brothers and sisters.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What has happened twice will happen thrice. It is, after all, the trilogy that is the foundation of good storytelling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is to say, the horror everyone thought to have passed for good and all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...returns to rear its ugly head!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s Halloween!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to depend on Uncle Vlad or Tama Cat Maid this year. I&#39;ll show them all what an amazing Halloween I can make all on my own\u266A</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Lady Elisabeth, what do you think of these plans for the parade?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AHalloween Knight:</strong><br> Lady Elisabeth, the candy for the town&#39;s children has arrived.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Not bad. This should make for a fine parade.<br> Make sure the band knows what&#39;s up.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And you, candy guy. There&#39;s plenty of space in the flour storehouse, so keep the candy in there.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a huge waste if the rats got to it before the big day. You know how they are; they&#39;ll nibble anything they can get their grimy little paws on.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> (I didn&#39;t know milady hated rats so much.) Yes, milady. Oh, and I hate to be the one to report this to you, but...</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Your subjects have been complaining and asking about when you are going to get rid of that pyramid.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m the one who should be complaining! I keep on telling Cleopatra to move it, but she just says:</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Give it up. I have never given the order to have one of the pyramids moved.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> \u201CAnd if you&#39;re planning on destroying it, you&#39;ll need to fill this out first. That pyramid is on loan from Lord Ozymandias.\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> \u201CIf you try to demolish it, I will have to bill you for the cost of repairs or reconstruction. Ohohohoho.\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh! If I had that kinda money just lying around, I&#39;d long since have used it to upgrade Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> (She means turning the castle into a concert stage!<br> Talk about a living hell for her subjects!)</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> (Thank goodness for Lady Cleopatra. She prevented such a terrible tragedy in such an impressively circumspect way.)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So the pyramid will have to wait. Besides, that&#39;s WAY too big for me to get my subjects to move it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So until I find a Heroic Spirit with a giant golem,<br> or a giant crane, or a construction company...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...we&#39;re just gonna forget about it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Plus, I haven&#39;t even heard of any Heroic Spirit with golems, but I bet I&#39;ve got connections to at least one Heroic Spirit\u2013no, an academic who can get their hands on a giant crane!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Phew, that was some great administrative action on my part, if I do say so myself. I could&#39;ve done even better if it weren&#39;t for this dumb headache...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Now I just need to send the invitations to Chaldea, and it will be all systems go for this year&#39;s Halloween bash!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aaand...sent!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ahh...I can see my little [\u2642 Puppy&#39;s /\u2640 Deerlet&#39;s] face glowing already!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? An earthquake...?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Is something crashing my party again!?<br> What is it now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai.<br> I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s that time of the year again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Autumn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Back in your hometown, this time of year may well have been known for wonderful weather.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, perhaps one could choose to spend time enjoying the brilliantly colored leaves, or mourning the leaves that had died and begun to fall.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know that Chaldea is locked in permanent winter,<br> so it may not really feel like fall here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But we can&#39;t ignore the reality of our situation forever, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whether we like it or not, it&#39;s still Halloween!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To make matters worse, we&#39;ve detected a tiny Singularity we need to deal with. And you received a third invitation from Castle Csejte...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and it says the same thing it did two years ago.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u201CYou are hereby invited to Castle Csejte to hear me sing\u201D!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, Senpai.<br> You won&#39;t have to suffer alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t go with you in person,<br> but I&#39;ll still join you for the concert!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know we can do this, Senpai!<br> And once this year&#39;s Halloween is over\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Craft Essence decoy!?<br> Who are you!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I had a bad feeling about this,<br> so I turned on the comms gear remotely!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mash, you weren&#39;t able to convince Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have the whole staff on standby just in case!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid Senpai swapped [\u2642 himself /\u2640 herself] out with this...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A Craft Essence decoy! Impressive!<br> Kotarou must have taught [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] how to do that!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Curse you, Evil-wind!<br> Messing with Master is MY job!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Evil-wind... That&#39;s the translation Kotarou insisted upon for his clan&#39;s name...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, we need to hurry and find Senpai!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then I guess we have no choice.<br> Mash, we&#39;re going to Code Red.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We have to find Fujimaru and make [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]<br> repair the Singularity, no matter what it takes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, acting director, if I may...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since Senpai went so far as to master advanced ninja techniques just to get out of this, maybe forcing [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] to do it in the first place is...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, I know that forcing [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] to fix a Singularity is wrong. But think about it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] doesn&#39;t go to the concert.<br> What do you think Elisabeth would do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She would cry. A lot. I understand. If I were in her position, I&#39;m sure I would be terribly sad too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Dragon or not, she&#39;d bawl her little eyes out. And then Castle Csejte would radiate sonic waves that are so much worse than even her singing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Granted, I imagine that&#39;s par for the course for the people of Castle Csejte, but the problem is Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anti-Hero or not, troublemaker or not,<br> Elisabeth has been a big help to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So if Fujimaru saw her crying like that,<br> it would break [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] heart.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But, if [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] DOES go to her concert, it&#39;ll be [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] ears that break, but [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] heart...[\u2642 his /\u2640 her] heart would remain whole.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And what could be more important than that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s a good point!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you agree. Now, let&#39;s get this search under\u2013Hm? This signal...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I made it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, dapper guy!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sassy-shin!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What the hell kind of nickname is that!?<br> Well, whatever.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> At any rate, is it just me, or are there a lot fewer Servants around than usual?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re all in their Spirit Form or headed for the simulator or what, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.

Oh, I did see Robin Hood, though.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I think he said he was going out to make sure he could get enough candy for all the kids or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dammit, just when I needed a good scout!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh, you were looking for a scout?<br> Well, whatever the job, I&#39;m your man!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Or do you doubt that I&#39;m up to the task?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I know you&#39;re good at what you do.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I am, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But, do you like singing?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You bet! I&#39;m real good at it, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well that rules you right out.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I see. So that little dragon girl is putting on a concert, even though her singing is nightmarish.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> So much so that all the big-name Servants decided to shift into Spirit Form to avoid listening to her...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> And even the ones who are still around are, well...</p><p><strong>Anonymous Man:</strong><br> \u201CA Rayshift?

I&#39;m taking days off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai, but I&#39;m told Halloween is the one time of year we are not allowed to take days off.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Are you serious?<br> Who the hell made such a cruel rule?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Elisabeth...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t see me, Mash!

It&#39;s causing it to transform\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Err, that is, it&#39;s actually very rapidly growing to MASSIVE proportions! It&#39;s progressing even faster than it did in 2018!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t 2018 when that pyramid smashed into the top of the castle?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If the situation is even worse than that,<br> what can we possibly do about it!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I understand your concern,<br> but we&#39;ve already received a distress signal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re still not sure who sent it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But the smart money is on something having happened to Elly again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Brave):</strong><br> [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth (Brave):</strong><br> [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s...go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Looks like fun. I think I&#39;ll tag along!<br> What do you say, Mrs\u2013uh, Ms. Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> How &#39;bout letting me in on this Rayshift action!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, mysterious Assassin of Shinjuku.<br> I&#39;ll feel better knowing you&#39;re there helping Master out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But whatever happens, please try and roll with it. Explaining would be too complicated and a huge pain. It&#39;s best if you just go and see for yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good luck, Assassin of Shinjuku!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Throwing [\u2642 himself /\u2640 herself] right into the dragon&#39;s lair when everyone else refuses, huh... No wonder [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] such a model Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You said it. [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] got nerves of steel...stainless steel, even.

Don&#39;t worry, Master.<br> I have faith in you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> When you get back, I&#39;ll make sure you have a big Halloween feast waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> So...you planning to Rayshift with us, or what?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Oh, no. I couldn&#39;t possibly. If I did, there&#39;d be no one to prepare Chaldea&#39;s meals, and then the sacred sword and oni would be at each other&#39;s throats.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Man, you&#39;ve got an answer for everything, huh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once all the dust settles on this year&#39;s madness,<br> I think we should have another Halloween party.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You, me, Fou, and Elisabeth can celebrate your exploits and the fact that Castle Csejte is at peace again, just the four of us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You bet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the Senpai I know!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I will do everything I can to support you from here!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right. Are we all on the same page now?<br> Then let&#39;s get this Rayshift started!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Eh, forget the formalities this time!<br> Just go on and enjoy this third Halloween!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> One Rayshift later...<br> Huh, so this is what Halloween looks like!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> This place is really hoppin&#39;!<br> What do you say we stop by the bar for a drink, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci, are you sure the Rayshift coordinates were correct?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They sure weren&#39;t. I could have sworn I set them to the graveyard first, just like the last two years.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> So ordinarily, that dragon girl would be waiting for us, huh? ...Hm? What&#39;s all the commotion?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean all those voices out on the street?<br> Halloween is always a little noisy.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> No, not those.<br> Look. Is someone being chased?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, no! Even MORE of them!<br> HALP!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gyah!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Eep!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Gomenasorry!<br> I&#39;mma princess, and I&#39;m being chased!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Is that so. I take it those knights there are the ones doing the chasing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did you do?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> W-well...<br> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you could step back a little...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai is right.

You mean [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> There you are!<br> In the name of our new ruler, you&#39;re under arrest!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Go on [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet], help me out here!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Y-yes, I beg of you, too!<br> Please, help us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sassy-shin!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You got it.<br> Let&#39;s have some fun with these guys!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I have my reasons for keeping my True Name under wraps, but my fists and feet can still serve my Master faithfully!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see if you European knights have what it takes to keep up with me!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Be warned, ruffian! We Halloween Knights swear loyalty to our great mechanical queen, Mecha Eli-chan!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> You shall find no tricks and even fewer treats in our swords!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt, but remember, these guys used to work for me, so make sure you don&#39;t kill them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Guh...<br> Fall back! Fall back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All hostiles either defeated or in retreat.<br> Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Now then, princess, may I suggest you give Master a little space?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or perhaps a lot of space!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, whoops!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ahaha, sorry.<br> I was just so scared.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!<br> What am I gonna do!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Someone stole Castle Csejte from me...AGAIN!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not again!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, again!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So this is the Master from Chaldea... Hmm.<br> Not bad. Not bad at all.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Of course, [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] still nowhere close to what I consider to be an ideal Master.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My standards are super high, after all.<br> At least, I think they are.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So what, you mean you prefer 2D to RL? You know you&#39;re asking for the impossible, don&#39;t you, El-El?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m very much a realist, thank you! I just know my perfect someone actually exists somewhere!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> So, who are you, anyway?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Given who was chasing after you, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve got quite a story of your own.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...The new ruler here is after me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> New ruler...?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I&#39;m still lost.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is rather confusing. I take it those knights we just saw are no longer loyal to you, Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No! They all got brainwashed by some weird kind of mind control ray or something!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Aaa! Just the thought of brainwashing squicks me out.

My apologies, Your Majesty. To make amends,<br> I shall return to my position as a lowly mechanic.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No need for that. You and your knights could never be a match for Servants. Of course you lost to them.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> This was my mistake, sending you out on a mission so far beyond your current parameters.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Especially since you and the other human knights are weaker than usual thanks to my brainwashing waves.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I made sure to weaken you just enough that you wouldn&#39;t be able to defy me, after all. Slowing them down was the best I could have hoped for.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Never mind.<br> Call the girls.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I must say, though...this parade bill is outrageous, Elisabeth. I don&#39;t know what you were thinking.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Not only did you buy far too much candy, but you didn&#39;t even consider how long it could be stored before it spoiled.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> A weeklong celebration is just excessive. Entertainment should be austere, and properly tailored to the crowd.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That&#39;s the best way to make Castle Csejte strong, sturdy, and beautiful. Why can&#39;t you see that!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You called for us?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Good, you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That lazy Osakabehime and the famously incompetent former ruler of this castle, Elisabeth, have decided to run away together.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I underestimated her mobile carrying capacity.

I will sentence her to compulsory labor.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If she wishes to go around claiming to be a princess, she needs to learn the harsh realities of noble life.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> I have important news, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Osakabehime appears to be returning to Castle Csejte, along with some mysterious, ragtag party.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> They must mean to attack us and retake Himeji Castle by force.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Those fools...

It sounds even more absurd when spoken aloud. Just because it is Halloween does not mean ANYthing goes, you know!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Well, I suppose I&#39;m responsible for at least a third of this mess, so I&#39;ll go ahead and guard the pyramid part.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What about you, Lady Mecha Eli-chan?<br> What will you be doing?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Since I can fly, I will ambush them, of course.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Besides, I still need to ascertain what this Master of Chaldea person is capable of.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] poses a threat to Csejte,<br> I will not let [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] escape alive.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Kehehe!

I mean, okay, I might&#39;ve chotto embellished Mecha Eli-chan&#39;s character...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But she pretty much attacked the second she saw me!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Then once she stopped, all she said was...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> \u201C...compulsory labor.\u201D</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Can you believe it!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t have time to try and hash it out with her!<br> So I just kinda...jazzed up my retelling a bit!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, pump your brakes, Batty.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can explain why Mecha Eli-chan showed up!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So just sit back and let my words wash over you like sweet music!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see that happening.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What are we going to do, Eli the great and perfect idol, beloved in all the land!? Our precious castles have been combined and unified!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> On top of that, there&#39;s a pyramid in between them, so it&#39;s also like a Csejte and Himeji pyramid sandwich!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Heh, worry not, Batty, girl who fell from the sky along with Himeji Castle!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have a nice hot cup of tea like civilized people while I assess our situation.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see...

Though it seems that it is a riddle that only I didn&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You speak the truth. And now you must pay for your criminally cute, gorgeous body with your life!!!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ahh...if only I weren&#39;t so terribly cute!<br> Why did I have to be born with such a burden!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ow, seriously, that hurts!

It was totally out of the blue!<br> No reason whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have any idea either, right, Batty?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> N-no, I don&#39;t think so.<br> ...Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can see those shifty eyes.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Besides, the important thing is that you get my castle back!

So please get our castles back for us, Master!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...Ah well, I guess the Singularity repairing part lines up at least.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Indeed.

Are we sure she didn&#39;t just paint her skin silver or something like that?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No, she was definitely a robot.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yeah, she was a really real robot, for REAL!<br> Her body was made out of iron and everything!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Mecha Eli-chan is nothing but a walking pile of gears hell-bent on murder!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s a matter of opinion, Elisabeth.<br> Or are you simply resorting to name-calling now?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aah!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...For the record, I&#39;m not making a mechanical empire, and I do not laugh like a melodrama villain...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...and most importantly, I have never once thought of you as \u201Ccute.\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S the part you&#39;re taking issue with!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I am...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Magus Aegis Elisabeth Channel.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> But you may call me \u201CMecha Eli-chan\u201D for short.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mecha cool!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Wahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh wow, you&#39;re right!

Wait a second. In that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t your nickname be \u201CMAGI Eli\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I guess you&#39;re right.<br> That version of me ISN&#39;T the brightest bulb in the box...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...You stupid lizard!<br> I chose that nickname on purpose!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> The word \u201CMAGI\u201D doesn&#39;t jive with my whole aesthetic here. It&#39;s also inaccurate, and would lead to misunderstandings.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I chose to emphasize \u201Cmecha,\u201D as it&#39;s jargon that is commonly known and easily understood.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Plus, it serves to highlight the beauty of my polished steel body.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s true.<br> It IS very polished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s like the same Elisabeth we know, only chrome!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Now then.

I don&#39;t know why, but that was an amazingly compelling command!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, all right!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m still scared, but I&#39;ll do my best for you, Master\u2661</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So much for diplomacy.<br> Very well then.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What diplomacy!?<br> You were outright trying to exploit us!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle is as good as mine now.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m not about to have its former owners swindling me out of my property. I&#39;ll take you both out myself!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t even scratched her!<br> At this rate...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Owowowow!<br> Hothothot!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oof!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Do you truly wish to take back Himeji Castle, Osakabehime?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Of course I do!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s my sanctuary.<br> The one place where I can be myself!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Then will you try and take it back with their help? Because I can assure you, we are prepared for anything you might attempt.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If you truly long for your castle, now is the time to show the strength of your conviction.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, I should let you know that I had all the gates welded shut, since I can just fly.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So again, if you truly want to take Himeji Castle back...you and the Master of Chaldea&#39;s entourage will need to scale the walls.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Well, farewell, everyone. I hope you have a wonderful day, complete with lots of fulfilling labor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What an elegant curtsy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha, I guess you didn&#39;t see her firing missiles from her skirt?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I did... Even over the monitor,<br> it was a shocking sight on multiple levels.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So she flies using vernier thrusters...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hmph, what good is flying if it relies on fuel?<br> I&#39;ve totally got her beat in that department!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Granted, it did take everything I had just to glide out of the castle while carrying Batty, but I can still totally ascend on my own strength!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Yaaawn)... I-I feel like I&#39;ve just done a whole lifetime&#39;s worth of work.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Pretty sure she was just feeling us out in that fight.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Boy, Batty, you haven&#39;t got much in the way of stamina, huh? You won&#39;t last a second in a Holy Grail War like that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...So what? I don&#39;t care about Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You don&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nope. All I want is to relax and take it easy all day.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I get all the excitement I need twice a year from the summer and winter matsuri.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Is that so? You Japanese princesses sure have a lot of time on your hands, huh. That sucks.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Of course, as ruler of the castle and idol, the idea of having that much time to lounge around does have its appeal! Too bad I&#39;m so busy each and every day!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> FORMER ruler of the castle. And I bet you&#39;re still just an underground idol at best.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, nothing \u201Cformer\u201D about me! Mecha Eli-chan hasn&#39;t beat me yet, after all! And every idol&#39;s career has to start somewhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are they fighting because they&#39;re so close?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Listen to that fight. They must be such good friends.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-I wouldn&#39;t really say that.<br> We are both of very different social standings, after all...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> We&#39;ve just made a temporary alliance because our goals are similar is all.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Really? &#39;Cause I kind of admire that crafty, scheming side of yours.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wh-wh-whatever do you mean!?<br> I&#39;m neither crafty NOR scheming!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A true princess always carries herself with primness, propriety, and piquancy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe that last one is more often used to describe soup than princesses.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> All right then...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> If that robot...dragon...girl...thing was telling the truth, the first thing we&#39;ve gotta do is scale Castle Csejte from the outside.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> The only problem with that is...well...<br> See for yourselves.</p><h2 id="section-3-free-climbing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-free-climbing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Free Climbing</h2><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> I have a report to make.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Have they begun to scale the walls?</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty. They have secured a route and are on their way as we speak. What would you have us do?</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Shall we go after them? I regret to inform you that we would not last long in our armor...</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Then again, I suppose we could change into lighter armor first... But in lighter armor, they would have even less trouble tearing through us...</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Hmm... Oh, I know!<br> We could lob pots of oil at them!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> That would make them slip right down the walls, since Castle Csejte is so flat!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No need for that. It would be a waste of good oil.<br> Carmilla can deal with them.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Oh, and you there. Throw the knight who just made the \u201Cflat\u201D remark in the dungeon.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> His choice of words irritates me.<br> Make sure no one repeats that mistake.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> H-huh!?<br> Wh-what did I say!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHalloween Knight:</strong><br> You know what you said. Queen Mecha Eli-chan is the guardian of Castle Csejte. She IS Castle Csejte.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AHalloween Knight:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed you were able to say that to her face.<br> It&#39;s sort of impressive in its own odd way.</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> B-but, I was praising her!<br> It was supposed to be a complimeeent!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)<br> Now I&#39;m in a rotten mood.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Why must humans be such useless,<br> troublesome, half-witted creatures...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Is it all Elisabeth&#39;s fault?<br> It is, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> She would go after her subjects, or other nobles... She was leading her country to ruin every time she indulged in one of her escapades.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Setting ethical concerns aside, the fact that she consistently failed to act with the best interests of her people foremost in her mind speaks volumes about her intellect, or lack thereof.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As I suspected, this nation needs to be reformed from the ground up, with myself serving as its foundation.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I may have been born from Elisabeth,<br> but I am an entirely new Elisabeth. As such...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I must protect this nation,<br> as the true guardian of Castle Csejte...!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> La la la, sha-la la la laaa\u266A</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You there!</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Y-yes!?<br> What is it, Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Were you singing something just now?</p><p><strong>Halloween Knight:</strong><br> Y-yes, my queen. Our former ruler used to hum it to herself all the time.

All this view needs is a stiff drink.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What do you say, Master? Care to join me for one?<br> A little liquor never hurt anyone, right?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, no one has to know. Come on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, someone will find out.<br> And the answer is no, Assassin of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What she said! No idol worth her salt would risk her reputation over underage drinking and smoking!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t asking you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaah, no fair!<br> Now I&#39;m getting a real bad case of FOMO!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is why I usually stick to being a shut-in!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> And, we&#39;re here!<br> I wonder what we&#39;ll run into next.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Heh heh!

This&#39;ll be the first step in our journey to take back Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t get too far ahead of me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yeah yeah, I know.<br> Okay, let&#39;s fly!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Damn, she&#39;s fast!<br> Wait up!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ahahaha! This is so much fun,<br> don&#39;t you think, Master\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your heart rate is increasing rapidly!<br> A-are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, is the suspension bridge effect making me look cute right now?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wheee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I can see your excitement rising with your heart rate as we speak!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Um, chotto a minute! How come you haven&#39;t commented about my boobs pressing up against you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Does it excite you? Embarrass you?<br> Make you wanna make out? Which is it!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Damn, I should&#39;ve known.<br> All the stairways to the higher floors are blocked off.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s see. That little dragon girl...I mean that mechanical dragon girl has people under her command, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I guess that technically makes them princesses too?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s the part I don&#39;t get. Why would they just start working for her all of a sudden...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you know something, Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmph, I guess being the ruler of Hakuro Castle still isn&#39;t good enough for them to include me...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm. I suppose you may technically be a ruler,<br> but aren&#39;t you forgetting something important?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Carmilla!?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> For one thing, this is Castle Csejte.<br> We never asked you to drop your castle onto ours.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> S-so what!<br> I&#39;m still going to take back my tower!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please give her back her Himeji Castle.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Well, I suppose you do have an obligation to repair the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> More importantly, it&#39;s clear we won&#39;t accomplish anything like this. Very well, let us do battle.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Do you have something to say to me, my younger self?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Why&#39;re you obeying Mecha Eli-chan?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Because I fought her, and I lost.<br> She is absurdly strong.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...That, and I suppose our interests are aligned somewhat. I&#39;m rather busy indulging my hobbies.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Allowing her to rule over Csejte simply seems sensible.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> So that&#39;s exactly what I decided to do.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait, so you&#39;re saying the mechanical me is better than us\u2013uh, I mean, regular me, even though I grew up here?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> The mechanical you is impartial, ethical, and ruthless. She never lets personal feelings interfere, no matter who she may be dealing with.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> She is more than qualified to stand above all. Plus, she doesn&#39;t suffer from chronic headaches like you do.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> And since she is me, I barely feel as though I am obeying her at all.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Which is something I cannot say for the real you.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ve been taking my job seriously lately too, you know!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You know, that \u201Clately\u201D part makes it sound like you&#39;re feeling a little guilty, El-El.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...You are absentminded, and unstable.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> A few more years and you would have made a fine vampire, just as the legends said.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> But instead you ended up becoming a dragon, of all things. Thanks to the blood you got from that real monster, you&#39;ve become something far removed from the innocent myths told about you.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Back when I was you,<br> I was not as headstrong as you are.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Then again, perhaps I was never quite the same as you to begin with.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Well, no matter. At any rate, if you wish to ascend beyond this point, you will need to defeat me first.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Be warned, my torture instruments are honed and ready. How much blood are you prepared to shed?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I like using torture instruments as much as anyone, but I&#39;m not a fan of having them used on me.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to stand in my way as a woman of Castle Csejte rather than a vampire, then I&#39;ll skewer you right in the heart!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Really, El-El? You&#39;re okay with torture?<br> Even on people you like?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I, uh...don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything I can do about that. Torture is just part of who I am...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Like, a dragon who doesn&#39;t breathe fire is just an overgrown lizard, right? Who needs that kind of nonsense!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So I torture people I like AND people I hate!<br> That&#39;s just my style and it&#39;s never going to change!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. So you act like everything&#39;s fun and games, but you&#39;re actually quite earnest at heart, huh, El-El.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But never mind that! For my part, I&#39;m not really into the whole bloodshed thing!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I hate painful stuff!<br> I can&#39;t even sit through a horror movie!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So, Master, keep me safe kudaplease!<br> I&#39;m counting on you\u2661</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Are you quite done?<br> Then let&#39;s begin, you two problem children!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Try and do something for yourselves for once instead of always depending on the Master of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That does it...! I&#39;m sick and tired of looking at your stupid metal dress!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you are.<br> It must be like looking in a mirror for you.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> But...you&#39;re still so naive it makes me sick!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> El-El!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Now! Go for it!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I knew you&#39;d wakarunderstand!<br> Now then, you&#39;re wide open\u2606</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> We did it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aw yeah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You two make a better team than I thought.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s not like that...<br> I just got a little caught up in the moment is all...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Khh...!<br> Don&#39;t think you&#39;ve gotten away with this, you little brats!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Kehehe, what a sorry sight you make, my comrade!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Oh, if it isn&#39;t Nite-Brite.<br> I see you&#39;ve elected to poke your head inside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Nite-Brite?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Indeed, my name is Nite-Brite!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> I am an Agarthan girl whose True Name I cannot divulge because of reasons!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> And so, just for this event, I grant you special permission to call me Nite-Brite.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> It has a truly adorable ring to it, don&#39;t you think? Nite-Brite, Nite-Brite!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What the hell&#39;s up with this brat\u2013uh, I mean child\u2013I mean, evil little girl.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Hm, and who might you be?<br> ...Oho, it seems you and I hail from the same nation.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I bet we do. There&#39;s just something about you that makes my punching fist all itchy!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Kehehehe, I could say the same of you. Though in my case, it is not something so uncouth as my fist.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> It is my beloved instruments of torture!<br> Kehehe, I cannot wait to broil those abs of yours.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Carmilla, let us regroup! If you lot think you can climb all the way up to us, you are more than welcome to try!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Thank you, Nite-Brite. I will gladly accept your help. Goodbye then, princess.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what it is you&#39;re up to,<br> but do your worst, pitiful though it will be.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...At any rate, I implore you to be careful as well,<br> Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, I know.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...I guess I&#39;m something of a busybody as well.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You still don&#39;t trust me, do you, Master.<br> Hmph!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have run into a string of less-than-trustworthy Servants this year, so...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Not to mention you haven&#39;t actually given us any reason why we SHOULD trust you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, at least we have a common goal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, it now seems safe to assume that Mecha Eli-chan is the source of the Singularity here.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Right?

I was never even told ahead of time that we WOULD be teaming up...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> I admit it was a spur-of-the-moment decision,<br> but I really thought it would work...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Jerk!

I sorta...don&#39;t really know why it even ended up here myself, so...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Figures. Just &#39;cause you&#39;re the castle&#39;s lord doesn&#39;t mean you would have a Noble Phantasm that could move it. I bet only emperor Heroic Spirits can do that kinda thing.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh well, we can figure out how to float it off later. Who knows, maybe we&#39;ll even find another Holy Grail fragment lying around somewhere!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Uh, it&#39;s not like Holy Grail fragments are just scattered around, lying about...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually, the year before last&#39;s Halloween debacle all began when Elisabeth found a Holy Grail fragment in France, so...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Welp, guess I stand corrected.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A Holy Grail, huh...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Anyway, this tower place should be a lot easier to climb than the others.

Her foolishness also knows no bounds, drinking the blood of her people and fellow nobles in a misguided attempt to stay young.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So it is up to me to keep Csejte safe...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As such, I have no choice but to put all rebellious wrongdoers, dissidents, and other similar cretins to work.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> It may be a bit dystopian, but it&#39;s a necessary sacrifice to be made for the sake of my people.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Aha, so those are your true colors! A machine rebellion! First everyone gets a cell phone, then their OSs start rising up against us!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I knew that was your diabolical scheme!<br> You want to take over the sekai!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Say what you will.

Civilization inevitably declines if everyone pursues nothing but hedonistic pleasures.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Fiefs raise children.<br> Lords raise land.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You think you deserve to be handed everything on a silver platter, just because you&#39;re a princess?

I can tell! I never know what to do about my catchphrase!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But it&#39;s always the more general expressions that end up being the coolest. Maybe I just don&#39;t have enough spirit?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re a mecha and all, you should have a lot more mecha-themed expressions on hand.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Something like \u201CPrepare to be elite-deleted\u2606\u201D or<br> \u201CFirst you&#39;re welcome, now you&#39;re well-done\u2606\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I mean come on, you&#39;re Mecha Eli-chan.<br> You should have that techno stuff down pat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not a lotta lyrics in techno, Elly...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You have the worst sensibilities imaginable.

Uh...well...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Okay, El-El, I&#39;ll let you see it too.<br> Let&#39;s all go together then.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> &#39;Kay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What the actual hell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What the actual hell...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Tadai&#39;m home... finally!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh my sanctuary, how I&#39;ve missed you! Computer: check! Books: check! All collectibles present and accounted for!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes, yes, yes! Everything&#39;s perfect!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Now I get why you were so secretive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master... This room is giving me a strong sense of d\xE9j\xE0 vu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This must be exactly the sort of room Blackbeard and others like him have!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, looks like we&#39;ve got an early noughties otaku room on our hands. She and Blackbeard would probably get along famously.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;ve seen all the...stuff he&#39;s done with his room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So this is what she wanted to come back to...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s like me and my workshop.<br> I just don&#39;t feel like myself when I&#39;m not there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sanctuary&#39;s actually not a bad way to put it, even if it&#39;s pretty far from most people&#39;s idea of one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...it&#39;s not that she was plotting something, so much as she just wanted to hurry up and get back here?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Looks that way. But of course, this raises its own questions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mostly about how the hell the top floor of Himeji Castle&#39;s tower ended up looking like this.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Let&#39;s boot it up... Okay, so far so good.<br> Wow, I got a ton of messages while I was away.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed you can stand to be in this room.<br> It&#39;s so messy in here.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Not to mention it&#39;s kind of small...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s the best part!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I bet you keep your room pretty sparse,<br> don&#39;t you, Master?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Kinda minimalist, only holding onto the bare essentials. That sorta thing.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s the kind of room where you like to relax and make out with Servants, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why, yes, Master.<br> I&#39;m curious about that as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Trust me, it&#39;s not all fun and games.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> R-really? Oh, right. I guess that makes sense, with Servants like Kiyo-yo around.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now, doko did I put that...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s gotta be around here somewhere,<br> since Mecha Eli-chan didn&#39;t have it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...Osakabehime?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This reading...<br> It can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ah HA! Found it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A Holy Grail!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You have a Holy Grail, Osakabehime!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Sure do! You probably all figured that out already, so I may as well tell you.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This Holy Grail is all mine.<br> Though I just happened to acquire it by sheer luck.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a lot that doesn&#39;t add up about that, but I guess the most important question is: what did you wish for?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, this is me we&#39;re talking about,<br> so I wished that I could hole up inside it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hole up...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean, like a shut-in?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, I do recall you having a reputation as a shut-in among the Eastern Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I do? Why?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Tamamo and Kiyohime weren&#39;t exactly shy about sharing that, so pretty much all of Chaldea&#39;s Servants know.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> SO MEAN!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t understand. If you wanted to hole up in a Holy Grail, why did you end up here in Csejte?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, that?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s because Csejte is the best place in the world to hole up in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is?<br> I would have thought the exact opposite myself...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s only because El-El&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...But what if she wasn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well, since this year&#39;s Halloween preparations are all done, I imagine Halloween would begin without a hitch...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and the Singularity would quickly go away, since it would no longer be able to maintain itself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Right you are! I knew you&#39;d figure it out, Mash!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now, what would the people of Csejte be doing during Halloween?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well... Naturally, they&#39;d be enjoying it. It&#39;s a special celebration that makes for a nice break from their usual busy routines, after all.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now, this last question is for Master!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What would happen if Halloween never ended?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A never-ending Halloween...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!<br> The celebration would just keep going.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Then there&#39;d be no more jobs! No more deadlines! Nothing! I could shut myself in forever and ever!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-huh!? Hang on, let me make sure I&#39;ve got this straight...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You used an actual Holy Grail just so you could shut yourself in your room and never have to work...forever!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Batty... Seriously...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. All I wanted was to have my little safe space forever and ever!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> All these books and electronics might look pitiful to you, but to me, they&#39;re everything.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m nothing like you, Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You hated being confined.<br> Every fiber of your being rejected being ignored.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure your living self must have been despondent when she died.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But me...<br> I found confinement comforting.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not like they confined me against my will.<br> I chose to be locked up.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what it looked like from the outside.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m a castle apparition, remember?<br> I literally can&#39;t survive if I&#39;m not inside a castle.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how I am.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But now that I&#39;m a Servant, they say I have to go out into the outside world...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s terrifying. No matter how hard I tried, I could never shake my fear of it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You&#39;ve never had to worry about that sort of thing,<br> El-El. You&#39;re always bright and cheerful.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Tamamo talks a good game,<br> but she&#39;s just fooling herself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But you genuinely love to fight, El-El.<br> You&#39;re my exact opposite in so many ways.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, I do enjoy a good fight.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But everyone&#39;s got things they&#39;re good at and things they&#39;re not, right? Hell, that&#39;s where the whole strategic aspect of Holy Grail Wars comes into play.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Anyway, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a little bit scared of what I&#39;m about to do, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This rumbling...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m picking up a signal coming from underneath Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Ser\u2013No, it&#39;s too big to be a Servant!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Battyyy...!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now, true guardian that sleeps beneath Csejte...with the power of this Holy Grail, I command you to rise!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, take a look outside!</p><h2 id="section-6-mecha-eli-chan-strikes-back" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-mecha-eli-chan-strikes-back" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Mecha Eli-chan Strikes Back</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Speechless)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Stupefied)</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Yo, Master, what the hell&#39;s going on!?<br> What&#39;s a giant mechanical little girl doing outside?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh, right, she&#39;s not really little anymore, is she?<br> So, just plain old giant mechanical dragon girl then?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Ugh, what the shit, man? Who comes up with this stuff?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about Mecha Eli-chan!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Still knocked out cold. Can&#39;t say I was paying attention to her after whatever this is started up, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think...we might have had the wrong idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe Mecha Eli-chan was here to repair the Singularity, and Osakabehime was actually its source!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re wrong there.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If we hadn&#39;t stopped her, Mecha Eli-chan would&#39;ve gone all tween novel dystopia on Csejte, and nobody wants that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True, for a supposed guardian, her power trip didn&#39;t really paint her in the best light...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, does this mean that giant Mecha Eli-chan outside is Csejte&#39;s true guardian then?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s the real one.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The one we beat is more like...the prototype.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, a prototype, huh...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That would mean somebody designed all this.<br> The question is, who?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, some middle-aged guy with a pretty epic mustache taught me how to do it. Even lent me a book!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> \u201CModifying the Guardian of Csejte for Dummies\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> COFFIN AAARCHEEERRR!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Curse you, mustache-twirler!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I ordered all the parts from Amazones.com and modified her as best as I could, but I guess I messed up somewhere...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...since I couldn&#39;t control either the guardian or the prototype. But...that problem will soon be solved.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Batty, please, stop this.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t...I&#39;ll have no choice but to turn the business end of my mic on you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You think I don&#39;t know that?<br> I&#39;ve been ready for that since the beginning.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But with the Holy Grail&#39;s power, I can also summon a next-generation unit! Come on up, Mk. II!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up another Servant reading from under Csejte!

I&#39;ve got a production unit ready to go!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> You called, princess?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is the Mecha Eli-chan I was able to successfully control: Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a tiny giant Mecha Eli-chan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True, she is a much smaller version of the enormous Mecha Eli-chan outside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...basically, she&#39;s taken the long way to come back to the same size she was before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mk. II!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! Your brainwaves are showing that you are in a state of extreme excitement!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it the Mk. II?<br> It is, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Honestly, the fact that I kind of get what all the fuss is about makes me wonder if the knowledge we get when we&#39;re summoned is entirely a good thing!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Do you have an order for me, princess?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I&#39;m a busy mecha. Since you have the Holy Grail, I&#39;d like to get this over with as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Yes. I want you to provide me with perpetual security so I can laze around here forever. EIEN NI. So give all these people the boot so I can get to it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh, also...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to say anything else, princess.<br> We are of the same mind after all.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Batty!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Sorry El-El, but this is happening.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Man, I figured she was up to something...but I really didn&#39;t figure her for the one behind EVERYthing.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Get back, Master!<br> I&#39;ll kick her ass and snap her out of this.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk.

II:</strong><br> If you haven&#39;t figured out how much stronger I am, then I&#39;ll just beat you into a red smear on the ground until it&#39;s painfully clear.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I&#39;m not like the prototype.<br> I don&#39;t care about dumb stuff like being a perfect ruler.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk.

II:</strong><br> Oh well, I suppose it would be more trouble to compensate you than it would to comply. Would you all mind terribly if we took this outside?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> While we are different versions, I share in Mk. I&#39;s humiliation. I will see to it that I succeed where she failed so embarrassingly.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sh-she&#39;s too strong...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What was with that backup!? That&#39;s cheating!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Khh...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Losers always whine about cheating and things being unfair. It is music to my audio receptors.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> But, all things in moderation. At any rate, now that you realize you&#39;re outmatched, I suggest you hightail it back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Except you, Elisabeth B\xE1thory.<br> I have special plans for you.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Special plans...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> U-um, please don&#39;t hurt her too much.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait.<br> Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m in danger of losing my chastity!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Batty, does this mean you&#39;ve been after my perfect idol body all this time!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What!? Chigau!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Elisabeth. Whenever you talk, I can actually feel the universe around us groan. I can&#39;t stand it.

I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have any ideas on that myself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if we can win this one...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Huh. Even you&#39;re feeling like giving up on this one, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our Master has never been one to back down no matter what sort of enemy we face, but this time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re up against a giant mecha,<br> made out of a superalloy, who&#39;s also Elisabeth...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If only she wasn&#39;t Elly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If only we had an Elly of our own...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S the part you&#39;re worried about!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Um, excuse me.<br> Can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Why did you save me?<br> I thought we were enemies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Things got a little...complicated while you were out, or off, or rebooting, or whatever...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In fact, let me make sure of something.<br> Are you, in fact, a terminal for the guardian of Csejte?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Yes, I am.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m made of parts that Osakabehime ordered online, and the vestiges of Elisabeth&#39;s Heroic Spirit here in Csejte.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I established my Servant Spirit Origin through what are commonly known as \u201CElisa Particles.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Awesome, another made-up particle!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Elisa Particles, eh...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I guess the fact that Csejte&#39;s seen a lot of weird stuff these past two years thanks to the Holy Grail is what caused all this?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I believe so.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Thanks to Elisabeth fusing, splitting, and changing her Spirit Origin into a Caster and Saber...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...her magical energy started to leak, and resulted in the creation of the guardian&#39;s prototype...or so I believe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m able to analyze you more thoroughly,<br> I AM picking up a few Heroic Spirit traces...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A bit of...Element Eli-chan, if you will!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In other words, this Singularity occurred by virtue of it being Halloween, along with Osakabehime&#39;s scheming.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Add in the endless live concerts that have been going on the past two years as well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and I guess a whole bunch of crazy crap is going down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Da Vinci, I think your IQ just went down several...uh, dozen points!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s &#39;cause it&#39;s Halloween!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Boy, this is really something! These hilarious events are sure to...er, NOT go down in history!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s nothing hilarious about them. We need to rescue Elisabeth and fix this Singularity immediately!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know. I get it, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re dealing with a giant Eli-chan here...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I understand your despair.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If I were in your position, I would put myself into sleep mode and set it using 100-year increments.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> However! Don&#39;t you have an obligation to fight?<br> Don&#39;t you have things you want to protect!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mecha Eli-chan!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Huh!?<br> Why&#39;re YOU scolding US!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you to shape up already! You&#39;re the Master and Servant who managed to defeat me, aren&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Listen up.<br> Those girls are hopeless.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> It was YOUR kindness and naivete that spoiled Elisabeth like that, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> And you also have a responsibility to protect this land after it almost self-destructed twice.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You can&#39;t just throw up your hands and say \u201CWell, this one&#39;s just too tough\u2606\u201D now that you&#39;ve come this far!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Y-yeah. That was probably a little on the mean side, but you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, the fact remains that we don&#39;t really have any way of fighting back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And as Chaldea&#39;s acting director, I can&#39;t allow you to proceed with a mission that&#39;s guaranteed to fail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(She&#39;s right. I&#39;m partly to blame for this.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...(I&#39;m the one who maxed out her Brave form...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So, all you&#39;re lacking is a strategy to fight back.<br> In that case, I have a suggestion.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Fujimaru.<br> You rescued me purely out of kindness.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As such, I will return the favor in the same way.<br> Ahem...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Fujimaru! I hereby accept you as a Steel Demoness Mecha Eli-chan pilot candidate!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? This is an incredible honor a peon like you doesn&#39;t deserve? Yes, I know. But you can freak out about your good fortune on your own time.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If you are prepared to continue fighting,<br> then I will follow your commands as your Servant.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Together, we will take on Castle Csejte, Halloween, that degenerate Osakabehime, and that Mk. II unit...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...and see to it that they are completely reformed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s good to have you on our side, Mecha Eli-chan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Thanks for snapping me out of it, Mecha Eli-chan.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s more like it. As I thought, mechas and hot-blooded protagonists truly do make a great team.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Now, our next move should be to plan our operation.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t mind a short wait, a delivery should be arriving in a moment...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Delivery...?</p><h2 id="section-7-amazones-com" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-amazones-com" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Amazones.com</h2><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> DELIVERY!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m sorry.<br> May I ask who it is?</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Ahem. Apologies.<br> I am the CEO of Amazones.com.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> I distribute all manner of goods throughout the Servant Universe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No. There will be no crossovers right now.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> Your feelings on this matter are natural.<br> BUT it IS Halloween, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Heroine X isn&#39;t here right now...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> I have no recollection of any deliveries scheduled for her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I suppose Mecha Eli-chan&#39;s very existence is proof enough that we&#39;re no longer bound to what passes for normal or sensible in our world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, may I ask what your purpose here is?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> What do you mean?<br> Did you not order this delivery?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I did, actually.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hey, we&#39;re actually pretty busy.<br> Mind pissing off?</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> ...Are you a man?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hey, I know I&#39;m a pretty boy, but unfortunately,<br> I&#39;m also as rugged and hedonistic as they come.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Though I guess you could also call me charming, handsome, and sensual if you wanted! Did I mention I can sing and dance, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s also terribly modest.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hey, if no one else is going to sing my praises,<br> then I had better do it myself!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> So. You are a man. That means...</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where&#39;d that come from!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> I will not abide the presence of men!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> I will reduce your market share (read: your body) to approximately 5.88%!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> What the hell kind of threat is that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I feel I should point out that I&#39;m also a man...</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> ...From a business standpoint,<br> you are too much of a pain to deal with.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!

As the CEO of Amazones.com, I make it my motto to provide outstanding customer service.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> My apologies. I only came here to make a delivery,<br> but ended up getting a little...overexcited.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> (Master, why don&#39;t we let Mash handle this.<br> I think I&#39;d only end up making things worse.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ya think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A delivery...?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> Yes. I came to deliver the weapons, ammo,<br> and other miscellaneous parts you ordered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sounds more like an arms dealer than an online store...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> You could say the same of any e-commerce site.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ahh, at last, it&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You certainly took your time.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> My apologies for the delay, but Amazones.com prides itself on sourcing our products in-house.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> Most importantly, my costs are effectively zero thanks to my Amazons literally doing all the heavy lifting.</p><p><strong>Amazones Employees:</strong><br> Raaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m fairly certain that violates labor laws in nearly every country on the planet...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, who else is here?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Me!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> And me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nite-Brite! Carmilla!<br> What are you two doing here?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Why, we took advantage of the confusion to flee before we got caught up in that missile&#39;s splash damage.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Kehehehe, I daresay our daring escape made quite a splash itself!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Of course, it seems our current state of affairs was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So you were both keeping watch to prevent Csejte from becoming dystopia-fied...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Oh no, it was the other way around.<br> We were both fully on board with that.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Unfortunately, making and executing meticulous plans turns out not to be my strong suit.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Indeed. With Carmilla&#39;s chaotic yang to my orderly yin, there was simply nothing to be done.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you ask me, neither of you have a leg to stand on!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> At any rate, we will help you take Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle back from Osakabehime. I believe doing so would be in all of our interests, no?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> What do you say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course we&#39;ll accept your help.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Excellent!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Personally, that princess is so full of herself it&#39;s really ticking me off!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> It makes me wish for nothing more than to see her groveling for her life!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Indeed. She is free to hole up in her room if she wishes, but she has no right to involve all of Csejte.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...At the very least, she could have avoided literally piling atop my castle&#39;s current architectural woes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is pretty serious...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> (I should point out how she has no right to speak for Csejte, but I suppose there are more important things to worry about at the moment.)</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> (She should at least be helpful when it comes to defeating Mk. II. I suppose I&#39;ll just have to activate grin and bear it mode.)</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...I could have sworn I felt some considerable malice directed at me just now.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> But, no matter. We need to install this new part before Mecha Eli-chan can fight again.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Come, let&#39;s get on with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What part was she missing before?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> A heart circuit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That should&#39;ve been the first thing installed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why she nearly made Csejte into a dystopia...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t she have that installed to begin with!?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Don&#39;t blame us! WE weren&#39;t the ones who were making design choices, you know!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> She never had much consideration for others from the start.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> She only managed to avoid becoming a complete monster thanks to her directive to keep Csejte safe.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I have a heart. It is simply turned to its lowest setting for empathy and compassion.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Besides, you of all people are in no position to lecture me, Carmilla. I&#39;m already perfect in every way.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Is that so.<br> Shall we throw this circuit away then?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t say that. A heart circuit would greatly reduce my chances of going berserk, and would likely help to stabilize my erratic Spirit Origin values too.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Most importantly, it should help me to forge a greater Servant bond with my new pilot candidate.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Though of course, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] is still only a cadet at this point...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pilot candidate?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who with the what now?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You, of course!<br> Who else could I possibly be talking about!?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;m going to install the circuit.<br> Um...where does this go again?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s check the manual...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t that get burned up?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Do you know where this heart circuit goes?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Here, pilot cadet, you install it in me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> O...kaaay. Where&#39;s it go?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> There&#39;s a slot in my chest.<br> Just push it in there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh... &#39;Kay...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Purged functionality restored.<br> ...I feel as though I&#39;m thinking clearly again.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> This new clarity has also brought a pain signal along with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did I do it too hard?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was I too rough?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No, nothing like that.<br> I simply feel my conscience weighing on me now.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid that this will not significantly affect my fundamental nature...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...but this new circuit HAS succeeded at restoring my incomplete Spirit Origin to its proper form, complete with a class change into the bargain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, she&#39;s right.<br> She just went from a Berserker to an Alter Ego!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I guess that makes her Mecha Eli-chan 2.0!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Make sure you get my name right.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I am still Magus Aegis Elisabeth Channel,<br> aka Mecha Eli-chan for short.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That is who I am.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As such, I will be sure to defeat my Mk. II counterpart and the one controlling her, Osakabehime.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> After which, I shall take back Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle and restore peace to my lands.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> We are the only ones who can stop the guardian of Csejte&#39;s rampage.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I hope I can count on your support, as well as a show of loyalty to indicate you understand your lower standing in our relationship.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> So, that&#39;s one heart circuit, and one order of miscellaneous mecha-grade weapons and ammunition. Sign here, please.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Will a blood seal suffice?</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Absolutely.<br> We at Amazones.com pride ourselves on our flexibility.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Now, I have a question for you.<br> Is that giant Mecha Eli-chan...?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Blah blah, blah blah blah blah!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Yadda yadda yadda, yadda yadda yadda.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> I see.<br> ...Now I want one for myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You do!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AAmazones CEO:</strong><br> Yes.

I admit I was excited for a moment, but this plan is terrible.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> There are too many of me. We\u2013they\u2013would end up making this nation perfect.

Nothing will stop me from becoming the ultimate, permanent hiko!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Halloween is MINE, along with everyone else!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s all about me singing, people dancing, and everyone eating candy!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So just give it up right now, Batty!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Nobody gets to ruin Halloween with their own selfish desires as long as I&#39;m around!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Hm. To hear you say something like that under circumstances like this... Perhaps you have grown as a ruler after all. If only a bit.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Besides, if you stay inside too long you&#39;ll end up...<br> Uh, what was that animal unique to Japan called again?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The one with huge eyes and a giant belly?<br> Oh, a tanuki! You&#39;ll end up looking like a tanuki!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Damn straight I will! That wonderful NEET lifestyle makes me nice and plump!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And don&#39;t bother with the snarky jabs.<br> Nothing you can say will change my mind!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care one bit if I gain a little weight!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Why in the world not!? I&#39;d be DEVASTATED if I put on so much as an extra pound!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Any good idol would think the same! How can you be my complete opposite in EVERY way like this!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You took the words right out of my mouth!<br> You hate being confined; I hate going out.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You want to be a symbol for your nation;<br> I want to be something more than that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You want to be an idol adored by millions;<br> I want to be a princess for my chosen few!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If we&#39;d both been after the same thing,<br> we might have ended up as rivals...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...but we&#39;re not. We want completely different things out of life. There shouldn&#39;t be any conflict between us.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...None of that matters now!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I WILL make my dreams come true, so this time,<br> I&#39;m going all out!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II! Activate your...secret...weapon...uh, thingy. Yeah. That one.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Oh, are you finally done talking?<br> I thought I was going to start rusting.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> All we have to do now is kill every single one of them.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> The princess&#39;s prime directive is sloth.<br> I accept this as a valid form of governance.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Accordingly, I shall crush everything in a fair and balanced manner and impose the rule of sloth on all.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> None shall be allowed out. None shall be allowed to work. Csejte will become a nation of NEETs.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Work won&#39;t even be an option. All the people will need is sloth, submission, and permanent compulsory welfare.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> They shall be reduced to nothing more than meatbags whose only actions are to consume food and oxygen.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nani the hell!? That isn&#39;t what I wanted at all!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, Mk. II, are you going rogue or something?<br> Trying to start a robot apocalypse!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Hehe. Is that what you think, princess?<br> That I&#39;ve gone rogue?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Aaahhh! Rogue AI! Rooogue AI! This is why I hate technology! Doooushite!? How!? When!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaah! Why did she go all Soranet on us like this!?<br> I didn&#39;t do anything wrong!!!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Really? Are you suuure you didn&#39;t do anything?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No, she didn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This happens to me ALL THE TIME! I can&#39;t even begin to count all the karaoke machines that practically explode the second I touch them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I...think that&#39;s an entirely different kind of problem.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Did I go rogue because I am an Elisabeth,<br> or am I an Elisabeth because I went rogue?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Meh. Questions for later.<br> All of you are going to die now.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I think now&#39;s as good a time as any for that secret weapon.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> CLICK!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Ghh...!<br> What the...!?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Fuyaaa!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Wh-what is this!?<br> I-it&#39;s sapping me of my streeength.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> I-it feels like...it&#39;s absorbing our magical energy...!?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Why you...!<br> What did you do!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-what the!?<br> Bwaaah!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> It&#39;s affecting you too!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> The princess&#39;s plan was softer than she is.<br> I improved upon it.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> This is the reactor that provided Giant Mecha Eli-chan with energy. I&#39;ve modified it into an Anti-Servant weapon.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> By inverting its functionality, I have created an ultimate weapon that absorbs magical energy from Spirit Origins and converts it into Elisa Particles.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I call it... Hmm, let&#39;s see...<br> How about \u201COmni-Eli-izer\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Every Servant is gonna be Eli-chan!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The most terrifying weapon of all...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Th-the name may be ridiculous,<br> but it&#39;s working scary fast!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Aaah! I don&#39;t wanna diiie!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yamete kudastooop!!!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Dammit, I can&#39;t move...!<br> Get out of here, Master! At least save yourself!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> An explosion...!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Great minds like us really do think alike, Mk. II. That&#39;s how I knew what you were going to do, and devised a genius plan to stop it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess even an idiot can&#39;t understand stupidity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, you mean you had the same idea she did...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Well I can see YOUR energy hasn&#39;t been drained if you&#39;ve got enough left for that kind of snark!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> But witty repartee can wait till later.<br> Pilot candidate, get behind me!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;ll divide my energy among the other Servants. It will damage them a bit, but at least they will be able to move.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> H-huh? That&#39;s definitely better...but it still hurts like hell if I let my guard down!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Hnghhh... Empress Fortituuude!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Th-this is...remarkably painful...!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> CEO Spiriiit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hang on. Why is Mecha Eli-chan the only one who can move freely here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh crap! Don&#39;t tell me your energy source is actually...!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> You guessed it. Nuclear fusion.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Kidding!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I simply have a function that nullifies the reactor&#39;s absorption.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Just like Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II over there.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> You said we think alike, Mk. I?<br> Then you should be able to understand my logic.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter whether people are lazy or industrious. At the end of the day, they&#39;re essentially the same.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> In which case, wouldn&#39;t it be more efficient to make it so they consume less energy, even only slightly?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If you did that, no one would be able to enjoy Halloween.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t being human all about enjoying laziness and an indolent existence?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No. I may not be able to empathize with them,<br> but I do understand them.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Human energy sources are far more complex than ours.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> It&#39;s the way all manner of elements mix and interact with their emotions that provide humans with energy.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> They work every day, feel sad, sometimes even exhausted...but then they go to festivals. These let them forget their pain.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Laziness doesn&#39;t GIVE them energy.<br> It just saps them of the will to do anything else.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I see. Then there is nothing further to discuss.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> After all, a lazy existence is sufficient to ensure Csejte&#39;s permanence.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Very well then. As a guardian statue of Csejte, I find you guilty of treason.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I shall defeat you in battle in order to protect my homeland.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Agreed. The time for talk is over.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As a fellow guardian statue of Csejte,<br> it saddens me to see you having gone so rogue.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So, I, in turn, find you guilty of sloth! The Csejte you are trying to create is not the one I wish for!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I&#39;ll need your help.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As a guardian statue of Csejte, I can&#39;t stand back and let Mk. II&#39;s mistake continue unabated any longer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Damn, she&#39;s tough!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Dammit, this reactor crap has me moving in freakin&#39; slow motion!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hell, I couldn&#39;t even move at all if it weren&#39;t for the mechanical dragon girl&#39;s magical energy!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> [\u2642 Puppyyy /\u2640 Deerleeet]!<br> All the head&#39;s starting to go to my bloood!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can only distract myself by humming for so long!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...MUST you screech so obnoxiously, Original?<br> You&#39;re damaging my perfect finish.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it. How can you be so destructively off-key when our voices are fundamentally identical?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> No doubt the whole reason we ended up looking like demonic monsters rather than beautiful angels is because of that destructive voice of yours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My voice isn&#39;t destructive! And if somehow it was, that&#39;d be cause I&#39;m doing it on purpose!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...I can see you and that look of crushing, overwhelming despair on your face. Is there something you wish to say, Master of Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eli-chan! Please sing for me!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Surely there are less horrible ways to end your own life?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You want me to sing? Even though I&#39;m in such horrible condition after this cruel and unnecessary torment?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...No, idols can&#39;t make excuses! It must be REALLY important to you that I sing for you, right!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So if you want to hear me sing,<br> I&#39;ll gladly put on a show for you, Master!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even care if I&#39;m hanging upside down!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Her lungs are building up tremendous power...! But how!? They should have practically withered by now!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> N-no, wait. Please, stop!<br> Your singing...in a tiny, enclosed space like this, it will...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hah! You can&#39;t stop showbiz!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> For my opening number, I&#39;ll of course be singing my famous debut song...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Halloween arrangement of B\xE1thory Erzs\xE9bet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Love is Dracul...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This song is...normal.<br> No, if anything, it&#39;s actually genuinely beautiful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it...!<br> It&#39;s a Halloween miracle!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s going on...!?<br> All of my outputs and stats are dropping sharply!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s having a negative effect on Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II...? What about you, Mecha Eli-chan!? Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m fine. I can&#39;t quite believe it myself, but it isn&#39;t hurting me at all.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Much as I hate to admit it, it&#39;s actually having a healing effect on my mind.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wh-why is it only hurting Mk. II...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> The primary difference between me and her is...<br> No... It can&#39;t be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...The heart circuit?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. That would seem to be the only logical explanation. I&#39;d think having a heart would open the door to a lot of suffering in its own right, though.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Th-then...this means we&#39;ve won!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Again with the open hands...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...This is true pop music. It&#39;s a little on the psychedelic side, but still, I think I rather like it.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Being a mecha, it&#39;s difficult to put into words exactly WHAT I like about it...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> But I can say for sure that something like this could be played at full blast at a street festival. What a lovely day this turned out to be.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...You&#39;ve lost your mind, Mk. I. Or perhaps this...\u201Csong\u201D is actually a kind of mental attack.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> We are both guardian statues. How could you possibly enjoy such a nightmarish performance?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...True, you and I are much more similar than not.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Though we were both born from the Anti-Hero Elisabeth, neither of us could ever become her, as both of us gave up on singing.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> But where I continued to carry out her desire to be this land&#39;s ruler, you discarded even that.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That was an act of pure ego, done only to allow you to remain as Csejte&#39;s guardian, rather than go on protecting its people as their ruler.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So it is no wonder an egomaniac like you hears a song like this as something horrid.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Singing is a festive act, but sloth wallows in silence.<br> They could not be further apart.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s having such a deleterious effect on you because you&#39;re trying to impose laziness on the world.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Man, I don&#39;t know what you guys were so worried about! I am really digging this song!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> What does that matter? That I see no value in song does not affect my own worth?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Regardless, this is still dreadfully unpleasant.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Stop your singing right now, Elisabeth,<br> or I will crush your larynx with my bare hands!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Can&#39;t stop, won&#39;t stop!<br> Not even God can stop me once I start singing!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Especially not when I&#39;m singing for Master!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...<br> Now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> For some reason, Elisabeth actually sings well whenever she&#39;s singing for someone else. How very odd...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Wait. What&#39;s going on?<br> The reactor&#39;s output is decreasing...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> And now I&#39;m starting to malfunction too...?<br> That&#39;s impossible\u2013</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Oh, hey!<br> I&#39;m all better!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> All right!<br> Now THIS is what I&#39;m talkin&#39; about!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-I thought I was gonna shindie...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...It seems I will have to put a sincere effort into crushing you, you repulsive lizard.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Fine then. I will have the main unit support me.<br> If it&#39;s a fight you want, it&#39;s a fight you&#39;ll get.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That&#39;s more like it.<br> Now we&#39;re finally on even footing!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> This is much better for a final showdown! Come on then, Mk. II. I&#39;ll show you just how obsolete you really are!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh my gosh, it&#39;s a final showdown between me, myself, and I! My fans are gonna eat this up!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can do this, Fujimaru!<br> I&#39;ll keep singing as hard as I can to cheer you on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Now, pilot candidate!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s heart circuit time!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Wh-what!?<br> Stop it! Don&#39;t do this! Aaaaaahhh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Show me your chest!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Wh-what did you say!?<br> What are you thinking!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I mean, I understand the gist. I&#39;ve seen the entry in my database. But...you know...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you supposed to buy me dinner first...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Ugh, you really are an Elisabeth, aren&#39;t you!?<br> Just do it already, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m putting it in!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Wh...what is this...!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> This...can&#39;t be right.<br> It&#39;s too late for me to have a heart...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t stand it. I was supposed to usher in an era of laziness in Csejte!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to accept the truth, Mk. II.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Our rightful role is to be guardians, not rulers.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Right now, Csejte is beset by chaos and disarray.<br> It needs our help if it&#39;s going to be rebuilt.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...It seems I&#39;ve been beaten by the prototype.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a prototype. I&#39;m a complete,<br> perfect, one-of-a-kind original.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Magus Aegis Elisabeth Channel.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Mecha Eli-chan for short.<br> And if you don&#39;t like it, TOUGH!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hooray! ...Now, could you maybe GET ME DOWN from here, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Carmillaaa.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Me?<br> ...If I must.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> There.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wah!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Admit it, Bad-Ending-Version-of-Me!<br> You totally just tried to murder me!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sassy-shiiin!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You got it.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hup.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Thanks, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Oh sure, don&#39;t bother thanking me.<br> I&#39;m just the one who actually DID it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And as for you two!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Oh well, it&#39;s all water under the bridge now!<br> What&#39;s another couple of mes at this point anyway?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Besides, now we can upgrade my Elisabeth Trio to a full-blown Elisabeth Quintet!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be epic!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> (Yaaawn)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Carmilla really is good at setting her personal feelings aside!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I guess...this means I lost, huh...?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You sure did, Batty.<br> So just give it up already, okay?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes, I know.<br> I wakarunderstand.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m gonna go sulk in the corner for a little bit. You guys do your thing. Just let me know when you&#39;re done...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Uh, okay...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> So, what are you two going to do now?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> We&#39;re the guardians of Csejte.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Even if we have been given Spirit Origins as Servants, our role will never change.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That said, if we&#39;re being honest, the energy requirements for keeping us both active at once are simply too great.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> If we both remain here, we could end up becoming a Singularity ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So if we&#39;re going to keep Csejte safe, I&#39;m afraid one of us will have to go back to being a statue.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> In that case, since I lost, I should be the one to go back to sleep. You can handle things from here, prototype.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No, as a prototype, I should be the one to return to statuedom. I&#39;m a loser too, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ve got a better idea...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why not come to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Hmm. You mean, you want us both to come to Chaldea? That&#39;s an intriguing proposition.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m still just a pilot cadet, you know?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That&#39;s a good point. I&#39;m ashamed I forgot about that, after I went and granted you that prestigious status.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Only one of us can accompany you.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> As I said, we&#39;re the guardians of Castle Csejte. One of us will stay behind to protect it, while the other will go off to provide foreign aid.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> We cannot abandon our duties, no matter what.<br> We take pride in being guardians, after all.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Agreed. For that matter, until this Singularity is completely repaired...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...we will need some insurance to prevent giant Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II from going rogue herself.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> That goes for the mass-produced models Osakabehime made as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, I can only bring one of you back...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.<br> We share data on our network.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Once we share our memories with each other,<br> it won&#39;t matter which of us goes to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Our specs are all the same, and our appearance and personalities aren&#39;t too different either.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Whichever of us you choose, we&#39;ll respect your wishes and the other&#39;s freedom to go with you.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> So go ahead and pick whichever of us you like.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Either way, we&#39;ll both share the joy of being chosen.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Agreed. I was planning to go back to sleep anyway,<br> so I am certainly not about to complain.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Now what is it?<br> What&#39;s this alarm for!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Oops.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Tell me she did NOT just say \u201Coops.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Ah, right. Well, okay I&#39;ll just be straight with you.<br> The reactor&#39;s about to explode.</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> What!?</p><h2 id="section-15-final-explosion-coaster" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-final-explosion-coaster" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Final Explosion Coaster</h2><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> There we go, it&#39;s finally time for the explosion I promised. Sorry it took so long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh...I&#39;m sorry? When you say explosion,<br> do you mean...kaboom?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Every evil underground lair goes out with an explosion. Everyone knows that.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I designed this one to explode pretty spectacularly in case I ever lost.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> The logical end of sloth is decay and death.<br> To be clearer...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> The reactor has been filled to capacity with all the Elisa Particles gathered from Elisabeth and all of you.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Unless giant Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II goes on a rampage and uses that energy up, it will overload the reactor until it goes critical and explodes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why did you not add some sort of pressure release valve or something along those lines!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Rampages are a mecha&#39;s bread and butter.<br> Doing something to impede that would be...unethical.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re not even sorry about this!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> The explosion will be on par with a hydrogen bomb. It&#39;s more than enough to completely reduce Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle to its component atoms.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> \u201CServes you right,\u201D as they say.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> What do you think you&#39;re doing!?<br> I thought you were Csejte&#39;s guardian!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> That&#39;s fair. Until just a moment ago, I believed that my defeat would also mean the end of Castle Csejte.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> After all, I am a Steel Demoness and a Steel Demon Castle. In essence, I AM Castle Csejte.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> So it&#39;s only logical that I would arrive at the conclusion that my defeat meant the end of Csejte.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Classic Elisabeth thinking...!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry, everyone.<br> I&#39;m embarrassed from the bottom of my heart circuit.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I suppose that no matter how smart she may be, there is no escaping that Elisabeth will always be Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And just what do you mean by that!?<br> Even I&#39;d never blow myself up on purpose!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> (Riiight... This one&#39;s constantly getting into trouble though, I gotta wonder if it&#39;s not on purpose...)</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Dammit! We&#39;ll just have to book it the hell outta here! C&#39;mon, Master!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> We need to get to the elevator which takes us up to Himeji Castle again, and then climb back down from there to Csejte Castle&#39;s entrance, toot sweet...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Yeah, we are WAY short on time, so you&#39;re just getting&#39; a piggyback ride. Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Osakabehime?<br> Shouldn&#39;t you be escaping as well?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No...<br> I&#39;mma stay here.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I should take responsibility for all the trouble I caused.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll use my Noble Phantasm to contain the blast as much as I can.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can&#39;t be serious!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Mk. II, would you show them the way out of here?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...Very well. I shall enter this into the record as a show of good faith on your part.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Just forget it!<br> Come on, we need to go!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> He&#39;s right, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!<br> You guys get out of here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Elly!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll take care of this, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!<br> The rest of you, get out of here!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Why are you still here?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Uh, &#39;cause I wanna be?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m about to use my Noble Phantasm to try and stop the reactor from exploding... Well, as much as I can, anyway.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Even if I succeed, staying here will get you killed.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But if you fail, my Castle Csejte&#39;s going to be destroyed, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s... I&#39;m...<br> I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m kind of the one who got this ball rolling in the first place.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t made such a mess of things every Halloween, the guardian statue never would&#39;ve woken up.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Even the fact that Himeji Castle ended up coming here just because you used the Holy Grail to wish that you could stay shut-in forever isn&#39;t something you INTENDED.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I guess not.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a...thing for princesses like me to blame everyone else for our mistakes.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So how come you didn&#39;t do that here and just run away?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You better believe I thought about it.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But I guess even I feel like sticking around and seeing things through...err, sometimes.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And even I want to make amends for all the trouble I caused...also sometimes! Especially when...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Especially for the very first IRL friend I ever made!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Friend?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ouch! I don&#39;t think any of the NPs I took to the face in this event hurt quite that bad!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Aha! So you mean we&#39;re actually friends!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Err... You didn&#39;t realize?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well...I didn&#39;t think that you could have more than just one friend...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> See, I have a friend, and she&#39;s an idol like me.<br> But she&#39;s also my fiercest rival...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So having TWO friends... That is...<br> It&#39;s like a dream come true!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re the first...well, only friend I&#39;ve ever made.<br> I mean, unless you count my online pals...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually kind of a big deal on social media.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Oh, right! I&#39;d better get moving.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, here comes my Noble Phantasm.<br> Great Hachitendou of Hakuro Castle...!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Ugh, I can&#39;t see what I&#39;m aiming at!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait a sec! You&#39;ve been a nerdy girl with glasses this whole time!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is just who I am!<br> Excuse me for being all dark and gloomy!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the cool intellectual look! Even if a look is all it is in your case!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, make up your damn mind! Either compliment me or insult me, but don&#39;t do both at the same time!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Grrr, come ooonnn!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use...<br> I can&#39;t hold it back!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wh-what do we do!?<br> Should I use my Noble Phantasm too?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Are you nuts!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Your Noble Phantasm would only cause the Elisa Particles to...to...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Your Noble Phantasm is offensive, so it&#39;s made up of negative Elisa Particles, but the energy built up here is made up of positive Elisa Particles!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Posi-what now?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If those differently-charged particles collide, it will create an explosion on par with the big bang!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> HOW IS THAT A GOOD THING!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Okay, stay with me here. I thought that at first.<br> But after a bit more thinking it over...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...these particles are really just another type of magical energy, and your Noble Phantasm is really just a terribly screechy voice!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ahem! It is called my Supersonic Dragon Breath, thank you very much!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The energy from your Noble Phantasm carries the opposite charge to the energy in the reactor...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...so theoretically, your NP should be able to nullify its EP!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> NP? EP? I&#39;m not sure what those stand for, but basically...my NP is super powerful?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...It could literally save the world!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s not TOTALLY impossible that they might interact badly and cause a universe-ending explosion...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...but since things are already kinda head in that direction, it won&#39;t hurt to try!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Are you sure this will save Castle Csejte!?<br> That sounds like a whole lot of uncertainties!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, El-El! If worse comes to worst, I&#39;ll use all my magical energy to protect you! A-after all...You&#39;re my friend!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Okay, Batty. I&#39;ll sing my heart out,<br> knowing you&#39;ve got my back!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All right reactor, get ready to hear the best song of your tragically short life! This song is even better than the thunderclouds on J\xE1nos Hill!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This is my number one hit song in the whole Servant world: Love is Dracu\u2013uh, I mean, B\xE1thory Erzs\xE9bet!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> SKKKRRREEEEEE\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Khh... Huh?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Y-yes, it&#39;s working!<br> I can&#39;t hear her singing at all!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The positive EP and negative EP are cancelling each other out!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If we&#39;re lucky, and they both keep depleting like this...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> KIIIIIIII\u266A<br> (Singing her heart out)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Th-this could work!<br> I think we might just be okay!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> EEEEEEeeeeee\u266A\u266A<br> (Key change)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes! We&#39;re almost there...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> (Gasp)! I haven&#39;t sung that hard in forever!<br> How was it!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> WHY ARE YOU STOPPPING!?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Uh oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I just picked up an explosion!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Did they fail?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No, they didn&#39;t.<br> It looks like Castle Csejte is still intact.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> I was able to confirm that, just before the explosion, the Elisa Particle density had been substantially reduced.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> ...It would appear that the pair of them succeeded, even if in their own clumsy, inelegant sort of way.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Thank goodness...<br> It&#39;s such a relief to see my pyramid remains intact!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> What about the two of them?<br> Did they make it?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> No, probably not.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:</strong><br> Agreed. That seems highly unlikely.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Such a noble sacrifice those two made. I must be certain to erect a statue in their honor. Bronze should do, I think.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> We&#39;re still very much alive!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No body, no death! Duh! I grant you that it DID look pretty rough back there, but as you can see, we&#39;re still alive and kicking!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Thank you, Himeji Castle!<br> Thank you, my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All I know is that everything blew up just as I finished my song!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Is Castle Csejte okay!? It is!? Thank goodness. Finally, my amazing singing saved the whole entire world!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Time to brag about this on ALL the social network things! \u201CNBD, just saved the world with the power of song #humblebrag\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ooh, I already got some responses.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> \u201Clolol, sure you did\u201D \u201C&#39;&gt;just out destroying the world&#39; #FTFY\u201D \u201CThanks, I needed that laugh!\u201D \u201CHow&#39;s the weather in #dreamland?\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Well that&#39;s weird.<br> Nobody believes me!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Of course they don&#39;t. We were here to see it and are still having trouble believing it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now then...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ulp.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I, um...<br> I&#39;m not quite sure what to say, except...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Here&#39;s the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Don&#39;t itashimention it. I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble. Well, uh... I&#39;m just gonna go over here and...disappear forever...and try to make up for all the things...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, if you still feel bad...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wanna try getting over the shut-in thing?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Thanks, but I think that would be far too brazen of me...</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> So what, you&#39;re simply going to disappear along with the repaired Singularity?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I thought that would be for the best...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Well it wouldn&#39;t. If you truly regret what you&#39;ve done, disappearing will fix nothing.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> If there&#39;s a chance for you to make amends, then take it. Not all of us are lucky enough to get such an opportunity.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But...I&#39;m not a Servant anymore.<br> I&#39;m just the same old castle monster I used to be.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A poor, beautiful, bespectacled maiden who got her fox look stolen from her by a certain Tamamo...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The world would just be better off if I disappeared like any other monster should...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> (Sigh)<br> Let&#39;s just let her be, Master.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> If she wants to go back to being a shut-in and disappear forever, no sense in us trying to stop her.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> You really are a selfish boor, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> She&#39;s a princess, remember? Surely she should take responsibility and kill herself, no?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Err...no. Not a good look for me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I just thought I&#39;d get caught up in the Singularity when it disappears.</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> So even when it comes to your dramatic exit,<br> you&#39;re lazy? What kind of princess ARE you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Osakabe.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Wh-what now?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I may not be a princess anymore, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can just call me by\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be honest with me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> O-okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want more fun out of life?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well...sure I do.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But it can&#39;t be shikatanai&#39;d.<br> I&#39;m still the ruler of Himeji Castle, you know.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Plus, I know I&#39;ve caused a lot of trouble for everyone. And more importantly, I wouldn&#39;t really do anything differently.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m not one of those plucky princesses with hidden reserves of courage to call upon when I gotta.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m just going to lock myself in my room and wait to disappear, like any homely, glasses-wearing beauty would.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That seems the easiest and most sensible thing to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll miss you if you do that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...S-so what? Is hearing that s-supposed to make me happy or something? It totally doesn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Nite-Brite:</strong><br> Oh you&#39;re being all tsun now? We have MORE than enough of those, and it is TOTALLY played out!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hardly. It&#39;s a rather recent term, in fact. I will grant you that the whole hot and cold sort of attitude has been around since forever, though.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey, no one asked for a color commentary! Urushut it!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not like we were actually friends or anything, right? All I did was use you for my own selfish purposes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I used you too. Even Steven.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Y-you can&#39;t fool me!<br> I bet you say that to everyone, don&#39;t you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, pretty much.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wait, so now you&#39;re just admitting it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t know about that. It&#39;s a lot harder to pull one over on Master than you think.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Where do you get all that confidence from?<br> Is...that what it&#39;s like to trust someone implicitly...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Still...everyone, huh?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So whether it&#39;s a great hero, like Heracles, or someone like me...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re really not shy about admitting you need our help, are you?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...So that must mean...you really DO need my help!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Even though I&#39;m a beautiful, isolated shut-in who&#39;s lived her whole life online and doesn&#39;t know a thing about the outside world.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong><br> This \u201Cbeautiful\u201D bit is really the important thing to you, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s just who I am.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...All right then, I won&#39;t refuse your summon.<br> If you want me to go with you, I&#39;ll go with you.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Is that okay with you, El-El?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hm? Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Would you rather I said it was only okay if it was your Alter or something?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So you just assumed I&#39;d go from the start!? Can&#39;t you at least TRY to understand my anxiety? You&#39;re my only IRL friend, you know!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Of course I understand it. In fact, I bet I understand it even better than you do.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m so glad we got to be friends.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to let you shut yourself away anymore. I&#39;m going to make you step outside your comfort zone even if I have to drag you there myself!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess that wraps up this year&#39;s Halloween then.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Pilot candidate Fujimaru, strange though the circumstances were, the bond we formed is genuine.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan Mk.

If you bought any of that, you grossly underestimate how far I&#39;d go to stay a shut-in forever!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, your room has been completely redecorated!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this really my room!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t Servant powers amazing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How is that relevant here!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, just look.<br> Now that Amazones.com is operating again...</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Delivery!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> That&#39;s one Emiya pizza, one Boudica soup,<br> and one video game dug up from Chaldea&#39;s library.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> It&#39;s a civilization restoration strategy game you can play essentially forever.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yay, thanks! Aaand, there! Signed!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> You&#39;re all set.</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> Thank you for ordering from Amazones.com!<br> We&#39;ll always be here for you!</p><p><strong>Amazones CEO:</strong><br> ...Of course, I mean both \u201Cyou\u201D in the specific sense and \u201Cyou\u201D in the general consumer sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, you&#39;re not planning on going back to being a shut-in again, are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a fellow Servant,<br> I cannot allow you to do that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, didn&#39;t you agree to give up being a shut-in and start fighting for [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] as a Servant?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And I meant it when I said it!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But it&#39;s not like there&#39;s any immediate danger now, right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Plus, you&#39;ve got TONS of other Servants.<br> You don&#39;t need me right now!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So I don&#39;t see any harm in letting me stay here and keep being lazy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When she heard your name, Musashi got this look on her face...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Ah, yes. It seemed she knew who you were. As soon as she learned your whereabouts, she began cracking her knuckles something fierce.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Do you have any jobs for me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I imagine we can come up with something.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hi Batty! I came to see how you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, it&#39;s mecha-me!<br> Great timing!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> What do you want, Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I&#39;d prefer we not talk unless it is absolutely necessary. I&#39;d be positively mortified if my friends found out we were associating.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s mean!<br> Would it kill you to be a little nicer to me!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I AM technically the savior of Csejte, after all!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I will deal with that matter later...MUCH later.<br> Now what do you want?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, you know how my concert at Castle Csejte ended up being canceled, what with everything that happened?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And it feels like it&#39;d be weird to go back there and sing at this point...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So I decided to change venues and put on the concert right here in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I would just as soon pretend you don&#39;t exist, but I suppose where singing is concerned, I&#39;m willing to let you have your way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see.<br> A concert, huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, actually, if it gives us a chance to hear that beautiful singing voice again, maybe it&#39;d be kind of nice.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Her next performance will be just as horrific as usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Back then, she was singing for Master.<br> This time, she will be singing for herself.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> And whenever she sings for herself...<br> Well, we have all heard how that sounds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I was also thinking we could all go out on stage at once!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Think about it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be awesome, having all four of us there at the same time!?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> ...<br> ...I like that.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I believe I will make my grand entrance by flying in, thrusters blazing.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;ve always thought your concerts could use a little more electronic pizzazz.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Let me take care of it. I&#39;ll set up a light show so bright the audience will be seeing stars for a week. And if the lights don&#39;t get them, my Mecha Eli-chan Punch will.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> In fact, what do you think of having Mk. II take a leave of absence so we can perform a Double Mecha Eli-chan Punch?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh...oh, no...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I dared to hope we could avoid this... More fool me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I know, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just when I thought we might conclude this year&#39;s Halloween without a major disaster...</p><h2 id="bonus-the-evil-is-gone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bonus-the-evil-is-gone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Bonus: The Evil is Gone!</h2><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hmm, I wonder what&#39;s for lunch today\u266A<br> Always be plotting, always be scheming\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good day, Professor!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Well hello there, Master!<br> You seem to be in rather a good mood.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Would you care to tell this sprightly and certainly not at all old man what has you in such high spirits?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, Archer of Shinjuku.<br> Please, have a seat.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Wonderful! I&#39;m always happy to talk turkey!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> I see, I see. And does this \u201Cturkey\u201D include leaking technology to places it shouldn&#39;t be leaked?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...I say, what&#39;s Babbage doing behind me?<br> I am beginning to feel rather cornered here.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> I will come right to the point, shall I?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...Osakabehime told us everything.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Of course, we were very thorough in our questioning.<br> We even presented her with mug shots.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> And out of a lineup that included Caesar, Paracelsus, and Shakespeare...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...she had not the least bit of trouble picking you from the bunch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Archer of Shinjuku!<br> You were the true culprit behind this Halloween event!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> You&#39;ll never take me aliiive!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Hahahahaha, my humblest apologies!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Babbage&#39;s Locomotive Form was just such a pleasure to ride...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...I could hardly contain myself, and felt I had to share this wondrous technology with the world!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> And in my defense, let me say that my actions will one day pay for themselves many times ov\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> I appreciate the fact that without you leaking information about this technology, I would not exist. However, that does not change that what you did was evil.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> And as Mecha Eli-chan, guardian of justice, I am sworn to punish evil wherever I find it. My fist is literally iron, after all.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Mecha Eli-chan Punch!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> ...Um, pardon me...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve ever heard of the Three Laws of Robotics...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Ah yes, Isaac Asimov. That reprehensible author who first wrote about the rights and obligations of AI.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> But of course, the point of that book was about how to get AROUND those three laws.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong><br> Furthermore, you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit, not a human, so I have no obligation to protect you whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong><br> Heh, hehe...<br> You&#39;ve got me...there...
