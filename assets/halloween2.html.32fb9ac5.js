It&#39;s the middle of the night! Why can&#39;t you be quiet?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Why, if it isn&#39;t two ugly little girls!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oooh... You little shrimp aren&#39;t very fashionable at all. What a sin it is to be like you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And I am disgusted. Disgusted!<br> You cling to the glories of the past...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re so focused on something that you fail to see the bigger picture!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yet I will accept that my glory must have blinded you.<br> So sorry!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, uh, no. But thank you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Humph! Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. It&#39;s not like I was trying to be considerate or anything when I said that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now get back to your dank little caves, you scrawny lizards!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Because, as you&#39;re quite well aware, staying out late is very bad for the skin!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Tch... She gives off such a powerful aura just by standing there...! Her idol coefficient is really high like always!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Jeez! I understand why I would shake in the presence of a powerful enemy, but for now, just concentrate!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> I-I know that!<br> Now get ready, witch!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You make me laugh! I&#39;ve never gotten myself ready for anything! Because\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Because my heart is free as a feather!<br> I have no worries about anything!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh... this self-confidence and boastful attitude...<br> She reminds me of someone...!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> She&#39;s like a woman I see every single morning... when I&#39;m checking myself in the mirror...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And, obviously, the word \u201Cwitch\u201D is inappropriate for me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u201CWitch\u201D in this region refers not to an embodiment of beauty such as me, but rather to that Halloween girl next to you, right?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> This is just a stage outfit based on the concept of a witch! I&#39;m the mistress of this castle!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha!<br> Hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You may not look that great, but you&#39;ve got a real sense of humor! It&#39;s tasteless, low-class, and ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha. If you&#39;re telling me that the job of a castle mistress entails wearing a ridiculous outfit like that, even I can&#39;t help but laugh.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Actually, I&#39;m tired from laughing so much.<br> I&#39;m going to bed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m the owner of this castle now. Naturally, I am also assuming direct control of these lands as well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Being a ruler is much too difficult for tryhard lizards like the two of you! Now be good little commoners and quietly take your leave!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha! But I don&#39;t know if freeloading nobles like you can handle the life of a commoner!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> What did you say!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t scream at me.<br> It&#39;s like listening to surround sound.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Shut up!<br> You took my Castle Csejte without asking!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;re not even from the right culture anyway!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> You don&#39;t match Castle Csejte at all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...? Are you so excited that you haven&#39;t even bothered to look outside?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha. It&#39;s too late.<br> Behold the snake that foretells the end!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Something weird&#39;s sticking out!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re back! Good evening!<br> You do know I&#39;m actually really busy?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> What is that!?<br> Why is my castle a pyramid!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Actually, why is the pyramid upside down!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> The castle&#39;s all smooshed! All you did was stack it on top! Talk about cutting corners!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha, you&#39;ve got me there, little lizards!<br> But I&#39;ll tell you one thing:</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This is remodeling!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Farewell to that nasty, disgusting prison castle!<br> What this era wants is simplicity!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The golden ratio is the basis of beauty in this world! That&#39;s right! Just like me! Exactly like me!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> No, it looks really out of place. I mean, this is Europe... Besides, how is that \u201Cremodeling\u201D!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Avant-garde!<br> Hakone! Art park! Museum!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Anyway, this castle is under my control!<br> But I understand beauty. I&#39;m not a monster.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you insist on holding a concert, out of respect for the former owners, I will offer you a place.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes... I know exactly where!<br> How about that stable?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That&#39;s rock n&#39; roll style right there! You can jam in the same kind of place that holy man was born in!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha! It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. No need to thank me with words! Just bow down before me in gratitude!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Hell no!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Humph. So negotiations failed, huh?<br> ...How disappointing.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I guess I have no choice then.<br> Behold my power!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Is what I&#39;d like to say, but fighting directly isn&#39;t elegant. It&#39;s bad for my skin, too.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll leave that to my stand-in.<br> Fierce, ugly knight of steel, come forth!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Tristan the Tragic has arrived.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> As has Lancelot the Sorrowful.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> No way...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now then, I have to get back to my book.<br> Finish them by the time I&#39;m done, you losers!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Of course, if you fail, you&#39;re banished. I have no use for men whose only redeeming quality is their beauty.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How sad... You&#39;re underestimating our power, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I agree with Tristan. We&#39;ll have this finished before you can read the next sentence.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Now then. It&#39;s time for you to go.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> H-Hey, time out!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> We&#39;re here to fight with that nasty woman over there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> A truly good mistress has talented retainers.<br> Heh... I&#39;m so perfect.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;ll give you one last bit of advice.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Remember this face, for it is my consolation to you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> After all, they say seeing beautiful things makes you more beautiful, right?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Why, you...!<br> Let&#39;s do this, me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Wah!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Funyah!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Now go. We weren&#39;t told to take your lives.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> You cannot beat us, let alone our mistress.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> You need to grow at least 10 years older, cute little girls.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Waah! We lost to a couple of literal homewreckers!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> W-We&#39;ll get you for this!<br> You COUGAR LOVER!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be back! Real soon!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Hahaha. I look forward to it.<br> Now let&#39;s go, Lord Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Homewreckers...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> (He&#39;s genuinely shocked that she called him that!)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> (Panting)<br> W-We made it out okay, somehow, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> What do we do, me!?<br> We can&#39;t hold our concert at this rate...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but we can&#39;t handle this on our own.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> ...Uncle Vlad is away on business...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> And Tamamo Cat said, \u201CWoof! I&#39;m leaving on a journey for paws unknown!\u201D and quit her job.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> By the way, do you think she was lying about why she quit? Were we tricked?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter.<br> No, I mean, it does matter, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Waah! If only my [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet] were here!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> No sense in complaining about what we can&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh! I&#39;m so pathetic, relying on others and whatnot!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Humph. S-So what, me!?<br> Do you have any good ideas?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> N-No, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Then stop complaining!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Wh-What!? You don&#39;t have any ideas either, do you?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;re stupid, so just shut up!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Argh!<br> You&#39;re me, so you&#39;re stupid too!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Caster, which makes me one rank higher than you in intelligence!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> There is no such stat!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> ...And you know what? I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea for Caster me to be one rank lower in MP either!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong><br> Gah!

What&#39;s going on?<br> This is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Elisabeth, who are these people?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The queen&#39;s lackeys!<br> Be careful! They&#39;re all pretty strong!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong><br> We are knights in the queen&#39;s service.<br> We fight to purge Halloween.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong><br> Those who speak of or desire to bring back Halloween shall be exiled or sentenced to hard labor, without exception!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s terrible...!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong><br> And we also received a complaint that this girl over here... is, um... not wearing appropriate attire in public...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true!

That witch needs to brace herself!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Crimson Hero Elisabeth&#39;s Adventure has begun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So why were you in the tavern with that sign?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, that? All I did was say this to the owner lady:</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> \u201CNow then! I&#39;m looking for some strong, radiant companions! Ones who will put me in the spotlight and worship me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> \u201CI&#39;ll be on vocals. I&#39;ve never been in a band before.

How about going to a salon and cleaning up your dull look first!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s too soon for the common fools to celebrate Halloween!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Holding such a lighthearted festival when the world is in such an unstable state? Pure idiocy!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Endure with patience, and keep love within your heart! Follow in my footsteps!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong><br> ...But everyone was looking forward to Halloween...<br> My children, too...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Blasphemy!

She sees through our very way of life...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> No, Lord Tristan. I really just care about the safety of the town.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...I hear there&#39;s a girl with a broken heart at one of the taverns.

You mean that cute girl from Ash Tree Tavern on 3rd?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ohoho. Maybe you would like to wait in prison instead of your own rooms?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Excuse us.

Uh... It&#39;s the green... You know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Robin Hood!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> D-Dammit! I accidentally released my No Face May King!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Fujimaru... You&#39;re reckless.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? Huh? Wait, what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master risked it all to bring the hidden Servant out...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t really get it, but this is all thanks to my song, right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad I was able to help [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If it&#39;s going to weigh on your conscience later, then don&#39;t bother doing it at all...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I get it! That trap that got me a moment ago!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That was your doing, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What a pain. You have surprisingly good intuition.<br> Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> The outskirts of town have been dangerous lately.<br> Pests and werebeasts have been lurking about.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Probably because it&#39;s almost Halloween.<br> The monsters are getting all excited, too.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> As a guy who roosts around these parts, I can&#39;t sleep at night without setting up some traps. I get all anxious.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Are you sure that&#39;s the werebeasts&#39; fault? Is it not just that you need traps around to feel at ease?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> The latter, of course. A free safe haven doesn&#39;t feel right. Safety is maintained through hard work and money.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty cautious.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yep, I&#39;m a cautious guy.<br> Only the humble survive in the forest.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m naturally a coward. I&#39;m scared to see my enemy&#39;s face straight on.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Is that why you take them down from the shadows?<br> You&#39;re actually an Assassin, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Werebeasts...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, beasts typically don&#39;t go near human territory. They&#39;re careful, after all.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But they&#39;ve gotten so close.<br> We&#39;re in a perilous situation here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It does seem that it is unusually dangerous here.<br> I bet that pyramid is the main culprit.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Mash! Nicely done!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That pyramid is the cause of everything!<br> I&#39;m sure something can be done if we travel there!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> To be honest, the werebeasts started showing up way before the pyramid\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, looks like someone else got caught in the trap.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to take on the pyramid, I don&#39;t mind lending a hand. That queen&#39;s brazen attitude is just too much for me.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I was just thinking that she could use a little punishment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much!<br> Elisabeth, we got ourselves a scout!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Scout? You mean someone who looks for potential idols!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...But I don&#39;t feel like joining an agency yet...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What should I do...?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Considering you&#39;re a ruler, I really think you should stop daydreaming like that, you know?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Sh-Shut up. Anyway, let&#39;s take out those werebeasts!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet], Mash, Robin... Follow me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can&#39;t have dirty werebeasts attacking my town!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Robin, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, nothing. Just thinking about how the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree, so to speak...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That dragon girl has no other plan but to rush in.<br> We&#39;ll just have to support her, won&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There you are! Hahaha. Something really did get caught!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You look stupid hanging upside down like that!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Elisabeth! You should think about what happened to you a few minutes ago!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I decided to stay positive, and keep anything that happened in the past locked away in my heart!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well how about you examine some of those things tucked away in your heart, huh?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yeah, I couldn&#39;t forget them even if I wanted to!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Anyway, Green! You&#39;re joining us once we take them out!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure. Once we get rid of all of them, there&#39;s no reason for me to stay in this forest anyway.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> This is totally going to be a pain, but I guess I have to.<br> I&#39;ll join you on your Death Tour!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a \u201CDeath Tour\u201D!<br> It&#39;s a curing, shiny concert tour!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Alright, the scout will now scout for us!<br> You&#39;re going to keep your promise, right?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Fine. So what do we do? Barge into the pyramid now?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No, I want one more person, I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A four-person party is pretty standard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-Is it? I thought it was six...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Anyway, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet], I want a mage!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A mage!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Huh. You&#39;re going to go scout a mage, huh...<br> Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I do know someone, but... um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it because they have gone insane, or that they build miniature gardens, or that they&#39;re fighting between AC and DC, or that they summon a flying saucer...?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Well, those would be problems, yeah...<br> It&#39;s just, she&#39;s a lot like someone we know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A lot like who?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (Points silently)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> (Gasp!)<br> I just had a feeling of impending disaster!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But he who runs in the face of the enemy does not deserve the mantle of \u201Cpharaoh.\u201D</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No matter what disaster it may be, I shall humbly fight it off!</p><h2 id="section-4-phaaaraaaohhh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-phaaaraaaohhh" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: &quot;PHAAARAAAOHHH&quot;</h2><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Hey, are we there yet?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure, just wait a little longer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Robin, Robin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Who is this mage you&#39;re talking about, and how is she like Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They&#39;re practically one and the same.<br> She&#39;s just a bit more intelligent.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She&#39;s a bright one, but she&#39;s narrow-minded. Arrogant. Bossy. Fairly serious, but with a low boiling point.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She jumps to conclusions and goes out of control, leading to disastrous consequences. It&#39;s all very painful to watch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? That&#39;s not like me at all.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> It&#39;s just like you.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She&#39;s a pharaoh, and a queen, as well as a self-proclaimed god of the sky and the underworld.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s too much description?<br> Only idols of little talent have that many traits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Noblewoman, vampire, serial killer, bat wings, dragon horns, idol, dragon girl. Isn&#39;t that too much too?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait, how come all my traits sound negative!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, hold it. I&#39;m detecting a powerful response...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Who&#39;s intruding in my territory this late without an appointment? Begone, impudent ones!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-So sudden!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Waaaaah!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Calm down! It&#39;s an illusion.<br> An illusion!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey there, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> May King, you must be mad to bring them here.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We made a pact to protect one another&#39;s territory.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Firstly, stop calling me that. It&#39;s embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> And secondly, what&#39;s your deal?

So it looks like our opinions align.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right. That&#39;s good.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> TELL ME YOUR NAME!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When these two start talking, I get the feeling it will never end, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Introduce yourselves!

Yes, name.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> My name is Nitocris.<br> I am a pharaoh from a distant land.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> The god of the underworld, and the incarnation of the sky god Horus.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> And now, I study magecraft while I frolic with my phantoms in a deep cave.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My name is Elisabeth B\xE1thory.<br> As you can see, I&#39;m an idol.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My specialty is idol pop, I suppose.

Anything else?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I see. Now we understand each other well.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

She&#39;s a typical spoiled Western noble girl!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> She&#39;s the type of woman I hate the most in this world! She needs to suffer more!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s my line! I hate that \u201COh, look at me, I&#39;m a queen\u201D attitude! It makes me want to throw up! Especially since you&#39;re an old hag!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Master, is she talking about Carmilla?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Probably...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It&#39;s very sad, isn&#39;t it...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re denying each other, so yeah...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> She&#39;s lived a complicated life, too, huh?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can&#39;t take this anymore! It&#39;s time to duel!<br> I&#39;ll smash your face in with my holy sword!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Fine! I&#39;ll teach you and your 80s style who&#39;s really the boss!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That armor is just old!

What a dummy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> The only thing retro we need around here is Egypt!<br> You moron!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>RAAARRGGH!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong></p><p>HISSSSSS!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on.<br> Fou&#39;s cries are easier to follow!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What are you doing? Let&#39;s go, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]! Crimson Hero Elisabeth is going to take down the evil mage!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Follow meeeeee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hey! Please don&#39;t take Master away!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Argh! Damn it! We&#39;ve got no choice but to follow them!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> First, let&#39;s have you fight my pretty, pretty phantoms!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Bring it on! Come on, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I got it, so let go of my hand!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> We&#39;re through! Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> My throat&#39;s all warmed up now!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Tch, I can hear those evil sound waves all the way here.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It&#39;s like the wails of the dead from the underworld! Honestly, it&#39;s a genre I like!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Idol pop... I guess I can&#39;t take it lightly!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What do you mean by wails of the dead!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The motto of idol pop is \u201CCute, Cuter, Cutest,\u201D you know!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not done yet!<br> ...Sphinx! Come on out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Heheh. It costs a lot to rent, but this sphinx is the true guardian of my cavern.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Pharaoh Ozymandias may not look it, but he runs a very honest business...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> \u201COh, you want to borrow my army of holy beasts?<br> Then the rental fee is three scarabs a week.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> \u201CIf you want a Marika Sphinx, add in 10 chains. Also, make sure its stomach is full when you bring it back.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> He gave me those very reasonable terms!<br> Now, get them!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Tch! Even I can tell... That thing is really powerful!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet].<br> I will win. You know why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not a clue...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Heheh, so even my little [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet] doesn&#39;t know?<br> Then I&#39;ll tell you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Because you&#39;re strong?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Close. But might doesn&#39;t always make right.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s because I&#39;m a hero. In other words, the good guy always wins!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Now do you get it, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s strange. My pharaoh-vision shows your original alignment as Chaotic-Evil...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Sh-Sh-Shut up! Bring it, you hag!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...That was surprisingly easy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s strange! There&#39;s no way my guardian sphinx is this weak!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s not in its natural habitat?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That&#39;s it! How foolish! I should&#39;ve brought a heater!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It seemed tired.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (GASP!) It must have been tired from its long journey from Egypt...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> And it probably couldn&#39;t adapt to the environment either! How foolish of me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Now we finally meet!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> So you made it through all my challenges, and now here you are at last.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I shall praise you for that!<br> But this is the end of the line!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Why? Because I&#39;m splendidly strong! I&#39;ve been cooped up in my room perfecting my magecraft!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Unbelievable. She&#39;s bragging about being a shut-in!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait, are you okay?<br> I really hate dark and cramped places.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Me too! But this is the underworld right now! If I want to enhance my dark pharaoh power, this is the only place!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> To be honest, the Western underworld is just too damaging.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> The Egyptian underworld is vast, comfortable, and dry... Why do you people view death as a negative thing?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Rather, why do you have to punish souls who have already lost their bodies? Does your god actually hate humans?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Listen to you. You&#39;re pretty cynical. You look pretty sporty, but you&#39;re actually just another bookworm.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Book...worm? No, I study curses, see...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I wrote messages as a pharaoh, but most of what I wrote were spells and curses...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So you&#39;re a bass player!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The person that works hard to set the tone of the band from behind the scenes and carve an oppressive sound into the audience!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But the sound is usually hidden under the melody of the guitar. The guitar plays the melody, the bass lays down the rhythm...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s so sad! The bassist is lonely,<br> but their job is the most rock n&#39; roll of them all!<br> That&#39;s what I think!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You must&#39;ve endured a lot, despite your demeanor!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really know what you mean by bassist, but I appreciate your noticing that!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> And I can see you struggle a lot, too! Just look at how hard the people around you struggle!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, of course!<br> Wait... Was that a compliment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right!? Zebra stripes says some good things, despite being our enemy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s Nitocris for you... She&#39;s just a little off...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. She has the insight to understand a situation in a single moment, but her conclusions always seem to miss the mark...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I accept it. That woman is a tough foe! That&#39;s why I won&#39;t use any tricks. I&#39;ll fight her head-on!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Haha, bring it on.<br> If it weren&#39;t for this situation, I&#39;m sure we&#39;d\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure we could&#39;ve been friends...!<br> But that future will never happen.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It&#39;s sad to say it, but you&#39;re right.<br> Now let&#39;s fight...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you sure you guys aren&#39;t actually getting along...?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> 100% SURE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Heh... Not bad... I&#39;ve run out of my hardworking phantoms...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;re not so bad yourself. Those were some amazing moves... Also, those phantoms are cute.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Especially the ones with the sheets on their heads.<br> The ones that go in circles.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I feel like they could give me some useful ideas for my concert!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> So you noticed my Medjeds... I guess you&#39;re not just a harmful beast after all.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Your songs really were wonderful...<br> The phantoms were all applauding...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> And so was I... It felt so good that I was inspired spiritually.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that the pyramid has been in the back of my mind. As pharaoh, I figured I needed to \u201Csay hello\u201D...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t think it was right to take them on alone, so I stayed here in my little abode.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Very well, Crimson Hero Elisabeth.<br> I will help you with your concert.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Thank you. I have a feeling we will become good friends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Panting) We&#39;ve finally caught up... Huh?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> A-A handshake?<br> Not a fight?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Master?<br> What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew they&#39;d be friends.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...But if two troublemakers become friends, that just means an exponential increase in problems for us...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s get going!<br> Our goal is to reach Pyramid Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Our next stop takes us through the Glacier Zone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Glaciers!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Now that I think about it, yes, it&#39;s weird to have something like that on the way to a castle...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s a staple for these type of adventures.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hm? I&#39;m seeing one, two, three, four... five Servant responses...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s one too many of you!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Humph. There&#39;s an un-candy lack of candy around here... And no, that wasn&#39;t meant to be a joke.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on, Fujimaru?<br> You didn&#39;t lie to me, did you!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I thought Halloween was supposed to be this wonderful festival where you can eat all the candy you want!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Idiot!

Our queen&#39;s face is twisted in sorrow...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...but even then it is still radiantly beautiful...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> With her involved, they will even break through the Lava Zone, not to mention the Glacier Zone...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> What shall we do, my queen?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It seems an idiot can exceed one&#39;s expectations.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> This is difficult... Humph...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> The worried look on Your Majesty&#39;s face is beautiful too\u2014</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m trying to think, and there you are getting in the way. Go jump out a window.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Oh... I can fly...!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> He really jumped...!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> He&#39;s using sound waves to fly...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course he can fly! Haven&#39;t you heard of the Tristan thrush? Anyway, Sir Lances-A-Lot-Of-Married-Women...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty...<br> I mean, what!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m deploying those girls to the Lava Zone.<br> Hold them back no matter the cost.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Wh-What...? But those girls are far too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> They might get out of control.<br> No, I mean they will! I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hahahaha! It&#39;ll be fine!

You&#39;re all a bunch of imbeciles!<br> Don&#39;t you know who I am!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m the leader of the oni, as well as a skilled thief notorious in the capital!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I am Ibaraki-Douji, a thief so great that I was able to build the great Ibuki Shuten Palace on Mt.

There are records of you stealing treasures from the nobility...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hahahaha, that&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> \u201CPrincess Kaguya\u201D is such a joke!

I see, I see. Then you&#39;re quick to understand. That&#39;s not a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But Mash. You look as cold as me. Aren&#39;t you uncomfortable? Do you not have a belly warmer?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m fine...<br> But it&#39;s true that the temperature is low in this area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, as long as you&#39;re in your Chaldea uniform, you should be fine. It&#39;s resistant to both the cold and the heat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about you, Elisabeth?

Then let&#39;s go for a little run!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Waaah, it&#39;s cold!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> My lovely phantoms normally cool me down, but in this weather, they&#39;re kind of annoying!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah... Even I&#39;m cold. And I&#39;m one of the more properly dressed ones.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Ibaraki!<br> Why did you come here!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> (Talking with mouth full of something)<br> Oh, no special reason.

Back in the day, a single piece of konpeitou was enough to make me swing between joy and sorrow...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I wish Mother were here, because then I could give her some... But anyway, mmm, I&#39;m very curious about those pound cake things too...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve developed quite the sweet tooth...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No wonder Shuten treats you like a child...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> This is not my intention!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Humans are the ones who offer me sweets to save their lives!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Meat is a better choice than sweets when you get hungry. Then again, after becoming a Servant, I am never hungry!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll let them live in exchange for this unsubstantial offering of sweets, but just this once. Welp, I feel like I&#39;m going to melt!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see.

I&#39;m getting sugar withdrawal symptoms...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I need something to munch on! Something sugary! Something tough!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But if you don&#39;t have anything like that, one of those Evil Bones you always have stocked up will do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh hell no! Anything but an Evil Bone!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Then candy! Marshmallows would be fine, too!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Come to think of it, running around in the cold is making me crave something with calories in it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What about Mash!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mmm, she looks soft but not sweet!<br> Rejected!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any more!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. That&#39;s because we used a lot on Caster Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What...did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>So... no more sweets? All gone?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But I still haven&#39;t had my favorite\u2013this thing you call \u201Cchocolate\u201D!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the way the cookie crumbles...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Grrr, grrr, hahahaha!<br> ...I&#39;m going home...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m going back to the mountain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Please, wait, Ibaraki! I&#39;ll give you sweets when we get back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our meeting up here must be fate.<br> Please, won&#39;t you help us?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Bwahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Nonsense.

Just a measly piece of chocolate won&#39;t work on me at all! It won&#39;t work...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> She&#39;s gritting her teeth through a torrent of tears...<br> Her lament is making me choke up...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Yaaa! What&#39;s wrong, good man in green!? Aren&#39;t you going to attack me more!? Come on, come on!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Like the time at Rashomon!<br> Just like at Rashomon!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, I wish I could give you more, but...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Uh-oh, something&#39;s coming.<br> This is no time to be throwing chocolate around.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Hahahahaha, this infuriates me even more! Scum!<br> Get out of here. I&#39;ll rip you from limb to limb!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Moving to battle formation!<br> Whenever you&#39;re ready, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Green man! Green good tidings, green pilgrim, green hermit, green geezer!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> As you can see, the pests are gone! So come on!<br> Pretend it&#39;s Setsubun and throw me some sweets!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right, all right. I suppose you deserve it. But call me a geezer again and you can kiss chocolate goodbye.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mmm. Understood. I&#39;m clever in that area.<br> But... Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We got rid of those enemies as quickly as the chocolates melting in my mouth.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Even this delicious chocolate isn&#39;t enough to keep me here. This place isn&#39;t worthy anymore! You heard me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Farewell! Farewell!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh really? I was going to say... If you can defeat the queen living in that pyramid, you&#39;ll have all the sweets you can eat. Too bad.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I knew that pyramid was trouble.<br> When do we leave?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ibaraki...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. She&#39;s an unexpected addition to our party, but Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s strength is the real deal. Besides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides what, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s a good thing she&#39;s showing an interest in human culture.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if her underlying aggression towards humans can&#39;t be changed, having a favorite food in common with us is a positive thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, certainly. I think that leads to mutual understanding.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. So, Fujimaru, I know it&#39;ll be tough, but please look after her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure, I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s perfectly tame now.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So where do we go from here?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Next is... the Lava Zone!<br> ...But why is there lava...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> L-Let&#39;s just go.

Your consideration is all I need.<br> I&#39;ve got this hood to protect me, so I&#39;ll make it through.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> When you&#39;re on an adventurous journey, countermeasures against heat are a must.

It&#39;ll take more than this kind of heat to injure an oni&#39;s skin!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine here. Use the space to protect your weak bodies instead.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Argh, this... Move over a little, Nitocris!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> No way!

Why would she put enemies here!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This is the only path that leads to the pyramid!<br> Why is there lava here anyway!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Do they use this path themselves to get to town!?<br> Are they stupid?

Pistachio!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a kaleidoscope of sweets!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, kids love macarons...<br> No wonder they hit the spot for Ibaraki-Douji...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AChild:</strong><br> Halloween&#39;s so fun!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMother:</strong><br> Yes it is, very fun.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AFather:</strong><br> Look, it&#39;s a pumpkin monster!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s finally starting to feel like Halloween.<br> Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is how it should be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> To properly hold and run a festival is also the job of a pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I hope that child begins to understand that soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Halloween sure is fun.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, people need to take breaks at times.

Eyes back on me!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ahem. Anyway, you&#39;ve done well to make your way here, heroes! I shall praise you for your spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So beautiful...!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Heh. I&#39;m tired of hearing that, but thank you!<br> It&#39;s good to be honest!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Indeed. A beauty so great you would lose your words. That is I!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If you understand, then bow to the ground until you bang your head! I&#39;ll also allow you to take photos of me, this time only!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Bow before Her Majesty. You&#39;re not going to listen to me anyway, but...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t just tell them without even meaning it, you dumb dodo! You do nothing but fail!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s your own incompetence that has allowed them to come this far! As punishment, do a handstand over there!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But don&#39;t stop playing the harp!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> So sad... So backbreaking. But if Her Majesty commands it, I must obey.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can actually do it!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Also...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It seems that the current situation is punishment enough for Sir Anonymous here. Very well, I will let him off the hook.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I think it&#39;s only fair that he gets punished too. Specifically, he has to take off his helmet or show us his face.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Umm... Mash...?<br> You&#39;re acting kinda scary...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry... When I look at that indecisive black knight, my heart becomes as jagged as a Saint Quartz...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So you get irritated. That was a nice way to put it.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I completely understand how you feel, but have your fight elsewhere.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a drag, but first I have my duty as a ruler.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Elisabeth B\xE1thory, the fact that you&#39;ve made it here means you finally understand, yes?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I got too excited over the Halloween concert and neglected my duties as ruler.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I was too immature to rule over the common pigs.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, it is pure stupidity for those who stand on top to seek something other than being at the top!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> To be served you need a reason to be served.<br> Or you need fervor!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That reason may be that you&#39;re as beautiful as the heavens. It could be that you wield power, even though you&#39;re hideous.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, that stings... I&#39;m as beautiful as the heavens, but I chose the life of an idol...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m the beautiful one.<br> You&#39;re the powerful one.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You said it yourself just a second ago. You&#39;re the muscle-based idol, Lowland Gorilla B\xE1thory.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t say that! Only the B\xE1thory part is right!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, you&#39;re right, but who cares about the small things! We&#39;re having an important discussion right now!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s my line! I&#39;ve never had so much trouble talking to someone before!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Just who are you?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You act like some sort of model, but what Heroic Spirit are you?!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious? A queen who rules with beauty!<br> Whose name is synonymous with beauty!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If you asked a hundred people who that queen is, they would all tell you my name!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, my name!<br> My beautiful name is...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;d be Cleopatra.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Obviously, Cleopatra.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Seriously?! You mean that Paris Fashion Week girl is Queen Cleopatra...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Ohohohoho. Even a girl with the bare minimum of nobility like you knows my name.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Then I shall ask again.<br> Can you compete against my beauty?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...This is bad. When it comes to whose Heroic Spirit is more beautiful, she has the upper hand...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No matter how you look at it, my style is more modern, but I can&#39;t beat her brand reputation...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Modern?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Style?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What, are you saying my bikini armor is old-school!?<br> It&#39;s totally modern! Right!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes, I think that outfit is good. It would make perfect sense in Ancient Egypt.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I know, right? Finally somebody from Egypt gets me!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> To me you both look the sa\u2014No, never mind.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But, well, in terms of looking dignified, the queen over there is on a different level. Her self-confidence has no limits.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what to say. My standards of beauty are different from humans&#39; to begin with.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That being said... Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Master! Master! She has an ulterior motive, and a malicious one at that.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Like she&#39;ll bite you or tear you up if you get close.<br> Well, I guess for a demon, that&#39;s pretty beautiful!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Hmm... You&#39;re not human, huh?<br> Then it makes sense you can&#39;t understand me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> And also...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> You...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Quiet, Cleopatra. I simply ended up on this side by chance this time.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I am just a normal Caster, a mage. You just need to live up to your beliefs without wavering.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> So, Elisabeth, let me ask you again.<br> Do you intend to compete with my beauty?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Ha...hahahaha! Ohohoho! No way, that would be impossible! That&#39;s not even a contest!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> If you&#39;re a woman, then you know there&#39;s nothing more terrifying than being judged based on your beauty!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I am the world-renowned Cleopatra!<br> That contest would only make you lose face...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? I can compete.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...What was that?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that if we&#39;re just talking how our bodies look, my physical age might put me at a very slight disadvantage...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> In any event, diversification is in right now. There are more standards of beauty now than there were in the past. Espeeeeecially...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes! What about cuteness?<br> I sing, dance, and smile for my pig fans!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s something only an idol like me can do! And something a queen, who is served on every day, cannot!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> In other words, you&#39;re not someone that rules over others...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Your Majesty, I challenge you to a duel!<br> As an idol!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, and of course I&#39;ll take up the reins of government. An idol can rule just fine.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> How dare you... How dare you...<br> You have no idea how mad your proposal makes me...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Beauty is born from intelligence.<br> Thus, ruling is carried out through beauty...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Ruling over the masses merely because you&#39;re \u201Ccute\u201D...<br> As a queen, I won&#39;t allow such happy-go-lucky attitudes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I kind of get why Cleopatra is mad...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> (No, Elisabeth is just that selfish. After all, she&#39;s an Anti-Hero...someone who&#39;s been making mistakes her whole life.)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m an idol, and the mistress of Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Servants get summoned as Lancers, Casters, and so on, right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Just like Uncle Vlad accepted me for who I am and didn&#39;t forgive me\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m greedy, prideful, and selfish.<br> That&#39;s why both versions of me are important!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I won&#39;t give up on either one!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> So you&#39;re not going to give up...on either of you?<br> This is why regional rulers are so annoying...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Very well, we&#39;ll see just how long you can keep that attitude. I&#39;ll test you!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...At the end of the day, you&#39;re just spouting nonsense! Drown in the beauty of Cleopatra...and die!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...Splendid. This is different than before.<br> A complete defeat...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Ha... Excellent. Truly excellent.<br> A splended defeat is quite exhilarating.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong><br> (I&#39;m not sure about that...<br> I feel like we fought for nothing...!)</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t believe it. I didn&#39;t think I would lose...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The match is over! You&#39;re going to give me back Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> And do something about this pyramid!<br> Actually, don&#39;t bring this kind of stuff in here!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s... kind of difficult...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Well, I&#39;m not the one who brought this pyramid here.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Then who dropped this annoying thing on my castle?!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> IT WAS ME!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Who are you!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Th-That voice...!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be?! It couldn&#39;t, could it!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> If you want to know who I am, I shall answer.<br> I am Ozymandias, the king who rules the sun!!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Cleopatra!<br> They&#39;ve completely crushed you!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> H-How embarrassing! As someone who holds the name of pharaoh, I have fallen hard...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I cannot bear any additional embarrassment.<br> Please sever my head!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want you making a bloody mess here!<br> We&#39;re going to decorate for Halloween!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Yes. Just as that thin girl over there says.<br> We need to decorate this castle now.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Your blood would ruin the festival. Your punishment will be to sit there and take your shame!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ozymandias... In other words, Ramesses II! To think someone so important would show up in this weird Singularity...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s like an adult showing up to a kid&#39;s event, you know!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Adults have fun, too. Grown-ups enjoy this kind of levity!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> But that&#39;s why you should not worry.<br> I will not fight.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Cleopatra was ruling over this pyramid, and was defeated by you.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I would have never thought Your Majesty... If you had given me word... I wouldn&#39;t have joined their side...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Heh. Don&#39;t say that, Nitocris.<br> I told Cleopatra to keep her mouth shut.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m not displeased at all!<br> My apologies for slipping my tongue!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Umm, I&#39;m not really following what you guys are saying. Why are people from Egypt here?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> HOW DISRESPECTFUL!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whyaun!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help it! I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m being disrespectful!<br> I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You guys really have no connection to this place whatsoever, so why are you here?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Umph, No Face King of the Forest.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Very well. It&#39;s no fun just seeing you all rack your brains.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Then I shall ask you. Does anyone know the final moments of this woman, Cleopatra?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They say she committed suicide after her husband Antonius, general of the Roman army...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...lost to Augustus in the naval battle of Actium and later died.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The Ptolemaic Kingdom quickly collapsed and the country disappeared.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Leaving her as the last pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> And thus, she has avoided wishing for anything, and refused to be summoned as a Servant until now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> She has a personal desire.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> And it&#39;s something that won&#39;t come true unless she participates in a Holy Grail War as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> But it&#39;s not a wish as a pharaoh. It&#39;s a selfish desire you could find anywhere on the streets.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> She feels so responsible for the destruction of her country that she has locked it away in her heart.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Thinking that someone that has done what she did should not be allowed to have a wish!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something to be suffering over for a thousand or so years, so I gave her an opportunity.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> To rule this upside-down pyramid as queen...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Until Halloween ends.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> And had she done that, I would have granted her wish with the Holy Grail I was given.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Holy Grail...!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> And then you lost. You have no objections.<br> Right, Cleopatra?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Correct.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I realized that it&#39;s wrong for someone like me to hope for something.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I see, and so you&#39;re going to suppress that wish and turn your back on it for the rest of eternity, then!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> That is the least I can do to atone for destroying my country.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!!<br> That&#39;s your answer!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Ridiculous! Anubis would be holding his belly laughing, I imagine! Did you hear that, thin girl?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I told you to call me Elisabeth! Or if you want to be more friendly, Elly is also good!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Huh. I see. In that case, Elly, or whatever, if you have something to say, you should say it now!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I appreciate that ridiculous arrogance of yours!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you just say Elly!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll say it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Umm... You know, Cleopatra...<br> You&#39;re an...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> IDIOT!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you? That I would be both an idol and a ruler!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can be a pha... pharaoh? and have a personal desire at the same time!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Take part in a bunch of Holy Grail Wars, and do your best to get it granted!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Why can&#39;t you do the things that I can do?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can do it right? I bet you could do it while you dance gracefully even.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to say this, but...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I got all excited about being an idol, I forgot about Halloween, so you might have ruled a bit... better, maybe.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You can have your own personal desires!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Are you sure...<br> I don&#39;t know if I can\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine! You think so too, right [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Humanity&#39;s final Master, Fujimaru!<br> You look like you want to say something.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine! Finish her off!<br> Don&#39;t hold back and tell her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can be selfish.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Selfish...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right.<br> I&#39;ve wanted to be, this entire time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You do you, Cleopatra.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Be...myself...<br> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to be this whole time, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> At some point, all I could think about was being a pharaoh...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Sun King, Ozymandias.<br> Incarnation of Horus, Queen Nitocris.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Please forgive me. From this day forth, I will accept myself for who I am, and not just be a pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I forgive you. Become the strength needed for those that follow you. Act like the name you have carved into history.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I too grant forgiveness. Have the name of Cleopatra shine brightly, arrogantly, and proudly!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> My name is Cleopatra VII.<br> A former pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> From this day forward, I will answer the summons as a Heroic Spirit and protect human history.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> When that happens, I will use this beautiful face, this voice, this body to be an Assassin class Servant.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> In other words... My glory is wasted on you.<br> Give it up and resign yourself to it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d welcome you any time!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Th-That was a good answer, Fujimaru! You&#39;ve been wonderful this far. Now you just need to rest!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All right. Everything&#39;s good now!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Mhh. So is everything done here? (Crunch, crunch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibaraki-Douji... Slow down when you eat.<br> There will be plenty of candy once Halloween begins.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m not eating. I&#39;m not eating any candy.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...So what was that selfish wish, anyway?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Th-That...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard of your wish.<br> Would you tell us, if you don&#39;t mind?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Yes, if that&#39;s what you want, Your Majesty.<br> My wish... Well, I have several, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to see the man I loved one more time. I don&#39;t really want to get back together with him, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I still remember...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> The day he whispered sweet nothings into my ear while holding me in his slender but strong arms...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> His chiseled features, his cheek bones ever so tempting... And he was so sincere...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Yes... I&#39;d like to see my Caesar again...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What happened?<br> Has the last boss made their appearance?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone, emergency huddle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This is bad. She&#39;s talking about THAT Caesar, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Caesar, one of the three least trustworthy Servants in Chaldea, and almost always the mastermind behind everything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...By the way, this is what Chaldea&#39;s Caesar looks like.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Gahgh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They both passed out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. It looks like King Ozymandias is holding his stomach and trying to hold back his laughter...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s quite a shock to see Caesar for the first time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Should we tell her the truth?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think we should...<br> We would be destroying her dream...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...But we should tell her someday.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> How sad... People change...<br> They say aging isn&#39;t ugly, but...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> ...This goes beyond aging...<br> Please forget this song...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> This is definitely a severe case of stress eating...<br> Oh, how sad...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> I have only seen this level of stress in Agravain...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> You look like you&#39;re having fun over there!<br> Let me join in too!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> And why are the great pharaohs collapsed on the floor like they had a sudden stomach ache or something!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-Hold on a second!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s wrong?<br> Did you call me? Want me to answer?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-Wait. Hold on!<br> Don&#39;t just Rayshift without my permi\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor?<br> Doctor...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-He really did Rayshift...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This is bad!<br> That means...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> VENI!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...!<br> This voice...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh... He really did come...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> VIDI!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> My Caesar...!?<br> To think I can meet you again at last!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I-I need a mirror.<br> Does anyone have a mirror!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> Is my makeup running? We were just fighting after all!<br> Is it okay? Is it okay!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now all I have to do is show myself!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> My Cae\u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> IT IS I!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahaha. It&#39;s been a while, Cleopatra. Hmm? I guess this is the first time meeting each other as Servants.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ... (THUD)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah, I thought so...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I guess she couldn&#39;t accept reality and escaped it by fainting...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Humans are frail beings.
