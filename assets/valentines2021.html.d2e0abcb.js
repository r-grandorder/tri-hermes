What sort of masterful writing could cause a man as great as myself to make such a careless mistake?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s nothing, really. Just a book with the simple title of \u201CFionn mac Cumhaill: Knight of Gold.\u201D</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I have to say, I never knew reading could be so much fun!</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Not at all, good sir. If anyone should beg pardon here, it is I. I am in the same boat as you, Sir Fionn.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> These days, I spend much more time broadening my mind than I do practicing my sword.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> I, too, never thought I would ever be so engaged with books...</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> ...but these neat rows of letters written out on paper are far more engaging than I ever thought possible.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> It has been quite enjoyable,<br> going back to basics like this.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I know exactly what you mean. I don&#39;t even need to consult my thum...er, Finegas, to understand where you are coming from.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> We knights are no more than men who have only tales of bravery and valor to our names, after all.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> My beloved wife would be worried sick if she saw me so absorbed in a book, of all things.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> In fact, she would almost certainly suspect me of using it to cover up adultery, or some other distasteful business!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Not that I would ever do anything of the sort, of course. I trust things are similar in your order as well, Gawain?</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> That they are. At least for me.</p><p><strong>Gawain:</strong><br> Say, could I trouble you to lend me that book once you are finished with it, Sir Fionn?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> By all means. I would be happy to let you read it.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Now, what&#39;s that you&#39;re reading there? ...I see.<br> So it&#39;s called \u201CSir Gawain and the Green Knight\u201D...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That explains it...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Reading a book)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aah! Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai! Wh-when did you get here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry I didn&#39;t notice you sooner!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is far from the first book I&#39;ve ever read,<br> but I was still so caught up in it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;re you reading, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Iliad, Homer&#39;s Greek epic.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What were you reading?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, this is the Iliad, Homer&#39;s Greek epic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s about the Trojan War.<br> The one Achilles and Hektor fought in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A lot of the Heroic Spirits here love that book.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The way it&#39;s written really makes you feel as if you&#39;re right there watching the Greeks and Trojans waging this war on behalf of the Greek gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a tragic story, so full of death...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but it also has such beautiful depictions of strength and valor on both sides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. Once I started reading it,<br> I just couldn&#39;t put it down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t a guy named Heinrich Schliemann excavate the ruins of Troy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, he did!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Iliad was thought to be entirely fictional for a long time, but thanks to Heinrich Schliemann, an archaeologist from the late nineteenth century, many people now believe this story reflects real historic events.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a true Mystic, weaving history and mythology together like few other historical works.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Sure seems like a lot of people have caught the reading bug.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it looks like they have!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t often see Servants reading,<br> but now we seem to have books everywhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And there&#39;s a very simple explanation for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Namely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...we have a library now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is it. The underground library.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m told it&#39;s a massive new library that just showed up here one day, separate from the one we already have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It might seem like it takes up a lot of room, but they say it&#39;s actually using magecraft to bend the space around it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a result, it fits entirely in the storage area, and doesn&#39;t get in the way of the Magical Reactor or other support systems at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First I&#39;ve heard of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-really? That&#39;s odd. It&#39;s not like Da Vinci to leave you out of the loop...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, maybe there&#39;s a bug in the email server!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That might be it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure to check on it later.<br> It could just be a loose cable or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Da Vinci&#39;s definitely not the type to forget to tell us something important.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, she&#39;s not.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Back in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...all of our databases were digitized, and we didn&#39;t have much in the way of paper books.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe that&#39;s why I got so caught up in these actual books...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t sweat it! Besides, this is your time off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You really do like paper books, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, I do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They were very rare back at Chaldea, so...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I understand that there&#39;s no meaningful difference between reading a tablet or a book in terms of the information you get.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And yet, it&#39;s strange. When I read a paper book...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can&#39;t put it down?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here we are. This is the underground library&#39;s reception desk!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> ...Welcome.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> My underground library is home to books old and new, from far and wide.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> It has history books, biographies, mythology, legends, tragedies, comedies, classics, new releases, fairy tales...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> ...period pieces, Westerns, lowbrow humor, political drama, occidental, oriental, Middle Ages, contemporary...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> Ancient records, recent best sellers, fiction, nonfiction... As well as maps and field guides.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> Oh, and of course...we also have tales of revenge,<br> and stories of romance.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> If there&#39;s any book you can&#39;t find on our shelves,<br> please come straight to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We really do have a librarian...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> Good day, Master of Chaldea.<br> I suppose this is our first time meeting, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> It&#39;s nice to meet you too, Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> By your leave, I am the librarian of this underground library, and a Caster.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ALibrarian:</strong><br> My True Name is Murasaki Shikibu.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I have been enthralled with letters, words,<br> and human emotion since I was a child...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I hope you will be patient with me, as there is still much I do not know about the modern world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Welcome to Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m .</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Murasaki Shikibu was born in Japan during the Heian period, just like Raikou and Kintoki.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think...she was an author, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! She&#39;s best known for The Tale of Genji,<br> the very first novel in recorded history!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It takes place during the Heian period, focusing specifically on noble society and the exploits of its titular character Hikaru Genji.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Murasaki Shikibu was also a famous tanka poet. Some of her poems are included in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, which is still used in karuta to this day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s the tanka poet who wrote The Tale of Genji!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a Heroic Spirit, she manifested as a Caster,<br> and I believe she specializes in Eastern magecraft.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The results speak for themselves. She used her own magical energy to make this underground library from scratch...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...converted all the books saved as files in our database into physical objects...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and now lends them out to the Servants and staff for free.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Magecraft...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You think I created this library with magecraft...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. Didn&#39;t you...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Uh, yes. I suppose...I must have.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I consider this a type of onmyoudou myself...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A type of phenomenon where something miraculous is spun beyond mortal ken and bound with the mind.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> If such beautiful things as that are what you call magecraft...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...then I am sure what you said must be true, Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...To be perfectly honest...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I was never very good at onmyoudou back in the Heian period.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It is only now, as a Servant, that I find myself in command of so many skills I could never have managed before.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I still have much to learn as a Caster, but I hope I can be of use to all of you nonetheless.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Glad to have you with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank you, Master. It is a pleasure to be here.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Now, having said that...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m so terribly sorry!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve made a terrible mistake!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I really wanted to do things right this time,<br> and make a fabulous Heroic Spirit debut...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But then, it just happened...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> One of the books from a collection I made using my magical energy got away from me!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Got away? So, you mean...a book&#39;s gone berserk?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. It was just this morning,<br> when I was organizing the archive...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There we go.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Phew. I think that&#39;s enough stocking up for today.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I feel bad, putting so many of these books away. People poured their hearts and souls into writing these words.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I only hope they find their way to someone who truly appreciates them one day...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Hm? Now what&#39;s this book?<br> That&#39;s strange. I don&#39;t think I recognize it...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Why is it floating!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Eek!!!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> H-hey, what are you doing?<br> Is that...!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I put that in my bag specifically so...!<br> S-stop! Don&#39;t absorb it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Give that back to me this instant!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh no. Is it...gone!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...This is all my fault.<br> I should never have been so careless.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Now one of the books I&#39;d long kept in my library&#39;s archive has taken on a cursed life of its own.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> When it is not feeding on all the information and magical energy it can find in its vicinity...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...it runs around endlessly in an instinctual act of self-preservation.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to calling it the Cursed Book.<br> (Sniff)...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou, fou.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Back when I used to serve the Empress, Lady Shoushi, the other ladies-in-waiting used to pick on me for being too highbrow...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I was so saddened by that experience that I refused to leave my chambers for a time...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t until I began feigning the vapidity of an airhead that I only just started to fit in at work...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But I really wanted to get it right this time!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I was so determined to make a perfect debut as the Heroic Spirit of Books, and that you would all be glad I was here...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...(Sniff) But now, I&#39;ve gone and ruined it all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, everything will work out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It sounds like we just need to get that book back, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master! If this book is dangerous, we can&#39;t just let it run around doing whatever it wants!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Y-you mean, you&#39;re not going to chastise me,<br> Lady Mash? [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course not. Besides, everyone loves the new library.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nah, it&#39;s fine. Everyone makes mistakes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, we know from experience that all bets are off when it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s season!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, we&#39;re in the legendary Wandering Sea right now. Anything could happen here!</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Hm? Oh, good, it seems that was the right switch.<br> Can you hear me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Semiramis?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Yes, it is I.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Da Vinci was feeling ill, so I had little choice but to take over communications for her.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Now, uh, regarding the reason I am calling...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> You see, um, we seem to have an,<br> ah...emergency on our hands...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> I noticed a strange book drawing near to my magical energy reserves I had set aside specifically for this year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> ...and it gobbled up every last drop. There is nothing left for this year&#39;s chocolate production at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you say a strange book!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She did, Senpai! That must be the Cursed Book...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All of it!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m so sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t seem to be one of the Demonic Books we usually face. Did it come from that library, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, it did! Oh no, this is terrible...!<br> This is just what I was afraid of!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It&#39;s going around attacking people...!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Hm? What was that? This control panel is so strange,<br> it&#39;s hard to make heads or tails of it...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Hmm. It looks like a number of magical energy signals are headed your way. You&#39;ll need to handle them on your own.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo, fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This is all my fault. I am so, so sorry.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I have to put an end to this before anyone else gets hurt! Please, let me handle it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way! We&#39;ll fight with you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No way! It&#39;s too dangerous to fight on your own!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A-all right!<br> ...Then let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The hostile entities have been eliminated!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe the Cursed Book is transforming into a monster...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There it is again...!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. It won&#39;t attack anyone ever again.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure of it!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Cursed Book has been recovered...<br> Does that mean this case is now closed?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid not. Just a moment...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...There, I&#39;ve completed my analysis.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This is not the original Cursed Book. It&#39;s a separate book that was given some of the stolen chocolate resources.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, the Cursed Book can use the magical energy it absorbed to make copies itself. Then, if we don&#39;t do something...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes. It won&#39;t stop until every book in the library has been similarly cursed.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But, if we can recover the original Cursed Book, we should be able to neutralize all of the copies with a single recovery ritual!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou, fou!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> For the moment, I&#39;ve sealed off all the books in this library, so now it will only be able to curse books that have already been checked out.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> In that case, it should not be too difficult to find this Cursed Book.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> So, be quick about it, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, I know. It&#39;s all up to me again.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> One \u201Cyeah\u201D is quite enough, thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By the way, what was the deal with those Choco Dragon Tooth Warriors...?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> They were the same as the ones from last year, no?<br> Then the Cursed Book must have made them as well.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Yes, it did. I am so sorry.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> ...Murasaki Shikibu, was it?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> If indeed you are of noble upbringing,<br> then do not be so quick to bow your head.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Y-yes, you&#39;re right.<br> I&#39;m so sorr\u2013I mean, thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, I can&#39;t thank you enough for all your help.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Having had a chance to participate in a battle as a Servant myself now, I understand how woefully inexperienced I am.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I feel bad that Lord Seimei wasted so much of his time trying to teach such a poor student as me...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But inexperienced as I may be, I will do whatever I must to clean up this mess I have made!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help too, Murasaki.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank you. Truly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I will never forget this debt I owe you,<br> [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! Kyaaau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess that means we&#39;re going on a book hunt then, Senpai! Look, even Fou is excited about it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So I see!

It doesn&#39;t have much magical energy, so I&#39;m guessing\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes. It seems this was not the original Cursed Book. Fortunately, we can at least be certain that it was one with which the original shared its magical energy.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I apologize once again for all the trouble I&#39;ve caused you, kind chefs.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hahaha, if you think this is trouble, you obviously haven&#39;t been in many cafeterias!

My comrade in pens! Would you be so kind as to grab me a book from that mountain over there?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Are you just incapable of addressing someone without foisting friendship or whatnot upon them?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You know, on second thought, I don&#39;t have to do a damn thing for you. Get it yourself if you want it that badly.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That mountain of books is eerily well-balanced.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If I pull any one of them out, it&#39;ll cause a book-a-lanche that would certainly bury me alive and then come after you.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> What a shame that is to hear! Though I must say, if you had to die, wouldn&#39;t being buried by books be the best way to go?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be an idiot. I could never rest in peace if I went out like that.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;m already killing myself to get these drafts done. If I have to die, I want it to be by something other than books for once.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. I suppose that is one way in which you and I differ. You always put your life above all else\u2013even your stories!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmph. Guess it just goes to show that, unlike you, I&#39;m not so happy-go-lucky as to want to filter everything that happens to me through the lens of comedy.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Anyway, what&#39;s that book you just finished reading there?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.<br> I plan on delving into The Tales of Ise next.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Oh? I didn&#39;t realize Far Eastern literature was your thing now, Lord Shakespeare. Hahaha, it&#39;s mine too, would you believe?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> As you can see, I&#39;ve most recently read the Kokinshu, the Gosenshu, and the Shuishu!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say, Lord Caesar! What strange coincidences are these! Your choices do strike me as oddly lopsided, but never mind that!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I should have known a man of your grace would appreciate the finer pleasures of poetry.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Grace? Your ulterior motives couldn&#39;t be plainer if you had them tattooed to your foreheads, you boobs.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You just heard those are the widowed librarian&#39;s favorites and you&#39;re looking for a way to get into her ruffly skirt.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Other people&#39;s wives!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Are something special!</p><p><strong>Dictator &amp; Playwright:</strong><br> (Secret handshake)</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) Sorry about that, guys. I can&#39;t always stop them from horsing around like that in here.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Horsing around?</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be absurd. I am Lu Bu, obviously.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> What is Lu Bu doing reading books, you ask?<br> Good question. All I can say is that...I am Lu Bu. Yup.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> So if I read a book, that means Lu Bu reads it too.<br> Do you understand my logic?</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who&#39;s mistaken, Red Hare.<br> I believe Lord Andersen was addressing Master, not us.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Good grief. So much for my idea to move to a real study instead of the simulator just so I could bring in real books.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> It&#39;s so damn noisy in here I can&#39;t get anything done.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> At this rate, I&#39;d&#39;ve been better off holing up in a hotel and working on a Little Mermaid sequel or something.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Eh, why bother. Anyone with half a brain could see the twist that she&#39;s actually half sea serpent coming a kilometer away.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It sure is lively in here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s very lively! Usually the study is kind of...quiet, but today it&#39;s like...well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Seems like things escalated quickly here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, yes, it does!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Usually, it&#39;s just Andersen and Shakespeare in here, along with the occasional visit from Caesar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it&#39;s very lively in here today.<br> It&#39;s almost like...uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Neigh.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> What were you going to say, young lady?<br> That it&#39;s like a stable in here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, it&#39;s not that. I was going to say it&#39;s like...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...a writers&#39; lounge...?</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Oh, okay. Sorry about that. I ought to know better since I&#39;m Lu Bu. Say, just out of curiosity,<br> how do you feel about horses?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Horses? Well, uh...I think they have very gentle eyes.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Neigh hah!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Fooou!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Oh, sorry again. I was just so happy to hear that I couldn&#39;t help myself. Not that I have any connection to horses, of course, seeing as I&#39;m Lu Bu and all!</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong><br> Easy, Red Hare. Why don&#39;t you take a break and go have some of the feed I brought along? See, it&#39;s right over there.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Neigh-heeeigh!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...There are so many different Heroic Spirits here!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I had no idea there were any that resembled horses like that.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> If I&#39;d stayed in the library, I might have gone my entire manifestation without ever learning a thing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And then there are all the different ways they interact with one another... What a moving sight.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And above all...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s such a thrill to see Heroic Spirits of the authors I admire go about their daily lives!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This is one of the luckiest days of my life!<br> Well, of my manifestation, that is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite the fangirl aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A-am I?<br> Perhaps I am...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s one way to look at the bright side!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I was so happy that I forgot myself...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I was like this back when I was alive during the Heian period, too. I was always in awe of people who had proven their intelligence and talent through their beautiful poetry.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> In fact, I would often introduce myself by saying, \u201CMurasaki Shikibu, aka Fujiwara-no-Kaoruko! My mental age is 19 years old, and my type of man is anyone like Lord Ariwara-no-Narihira!\u201D</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> N-Not that Ariwara-no-Narihira and I lived in the same time period, of course... He was a great source of inspiration for me, however.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Please, tell me more!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I would love to hear all about the day-to-day life of the Far East&#39;s most esteemed female author!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> And I must say, it is fascinating to hear you speak in person! The very lilt of your voice is enough to stir my pen!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Oh yes. There truly is something special about women of nobility.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Your demeanor is exceptionally pleasant as well.<br> You practically radiate poetic sentiment.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Forgive me for being so brazen, but I have also heard rumors of your palace romances.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> If you would be so kind, I would like nothing more than to interview you about the ups and downs of romance in Far Eastern noble society.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Oh? Does that mean your interest in her is purely professional, Lord Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahaha, not that it matters to me one way or the other, of course. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahaha! I believe you had best hold your tongue, friend, lest your dear wife make an unannounced appearance!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t put a stop to this, they&#39;re going to go on leering forever. Go on. Speak up.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You cursing them out would go a long way toward keeping these fools in line.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> O-oh no, I couldn&#39;t possibly! I&#39;m...I&#39;m just so honored to have such illustrious company take an interest in me.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Well, um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s presumptuous of me, but if you should ever be inclined to write a new story...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I was kind of hoping you might be willing to donate it to my library?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What, now that you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit, you fancy yourself an editor? Not that I don&#39;t understand how you feel!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> This is a chance you won&#39;t ever find elsewhere!<br> Not even in heaven or hell!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Believe me, whenever Shakespeare writes something new, I make sure to read it before anyone\u2013</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Never mind. I shouldn&#39;t have said that. There&#39;s something about you that makes me relax my guard. Maybe because you remind me of someone?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I...think that&#39;s enough of this. Yes.<br> No more. This conversation is over.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Now, what are you lot doing here, anyway?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Surely you didn&#39;t come here just to see which of these idiots can embarrass themselves the worst.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What is it? Go on, spit it out.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> A Cursed Book, huh. I guess I could see that happening with Eastern curses.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind sussing it out for you, but I barely even know any magecraft, let alone curses.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Likewise! Hahaha, after all,<br> we are students of the pen, not the wand!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not even a Caster!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> There you have it. So if you want to turn the place upside down to look for this book, feel free.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I still haven&#39;t cleaned up here since the move,<br> so it&#39;s not like you could mess it up more.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay! In that case, I&#39;ll just go ahead...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh...! There ARE Cursed Books in this study!<br> More than one, in fact!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m seeing their signals on my end, too! They&#39;re rapidly boosting their magical energy in response to your detection curse!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look out, Senpai!<br> They&#39;re about to take on physical form!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get to work!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, authors, help us out here!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...I swear. How many times have I told you I don&#39;t do hard labor?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Now, Andersen don&#39;t be like that. I believe Master here is ordering us to help for our own sakes. Especially since we haven&#39;t partaken in the farming of Embers as of late!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> In other words, a little exercise would do us good, eh?<br> True, I suppose I have let myself go juuust a bit.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Besides, now that I think about it, this is an excellent opportunity to show off in front of a most exquisite lady! Two birds, one glorious stone!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry about a thing, beautiful librarian.<br> Just stand back and witness our prowess!!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong><br> Now&#39;s your chance, beautiful black-garbed lady!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> Update: Red Hare heard the commotion and came back to help in the interval! Meanwhile, the author Heroic Spirits were entirely wiped out!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank you, kind horse with the gallant,<br> entirely unhorselike voice!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Cursed Books, return to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve recovered more of the Cursed Books! But...I&#39;m afraid they don&#39;t have much magical energy either.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Still, while they may not be the original Cursed Book, I can&#39;t let them run around doing whatever they please.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank goodness I was able to recover them.<br> Thank you all so much for your help.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmm. Books checked out from the underground library, huh...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You said it&#39;s possible this original Cursed Book could be mixed in among books like that, right?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I did.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Well, I remember seeing that girl carrying an armful of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which girl?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You know, that one with the glasses who&#39;s into manga and doujin and stuff.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh!

Mmmm, yes, I have seen this technique&#39;s true nature.\u201D</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It still gives me chills to think about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A scary monk, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mmmm, something about the way he speaks sounds familiar...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> He warned it was not a technique to be used lightly,<br> b-but I&#39;m afraid I went and activated it in spite of myself...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I often end up doing that whenever I relax my guard... It&#39;s almost like a curse...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-are you sure it isn&#39;t?<br> Because it really does sound like one...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Please forgive me, Lord Andersen!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmph. I got commented on all the time,<br> it&#39;s nothing new to me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> How many critical and faux-critical reviews do you think we writers have suffered by now? Not to mention all that painful amateur analysis!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If I had a dime for every slanderous accusation that&#39;s been thrown my way, I could have retired after my first book!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be an idiot, Shikibu.<br> You&#39;re an author; you know what it&#39;s like.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> We writers are expected to have a monologue or two ready to go at all times.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAndersen (Commentator):</strong><br> \u201C...Not to mention, this commentary must be from the great Eastern genius writer, Murasaki Shikibu.\u201D</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAndersen (Commentator):</strong><br> \u201CWhat greater honor could there be than that? Any man,<br> no, writer worth his salt should be so lucky.\u201D</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAndersen (Commentator):</strong><br> Thus, Andersen, still smiling, secretly decided to brag about this to Shakespeare later.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Lord Andersen...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ander...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I think...I just saw the ultimate tsundere in action...)</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hm? Now don&#39;t you start too, Fujimaru.<br> I told you not to worry about it.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> Indeed, Mr. Andersen, with his sky blue hair and matching eyes, spoke not a hint of falsehood.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh no, there it goes again...!<br> I&#39;m so sorry!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...So you really don&#39;t have any control over it, do you. Since I was the one commented on, I obviously have no idea what it said...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...but as a fellow author, I doubt you could have had it say anything that was wrong. Stop apologizing so much.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Now come on. We&#39;re going to find Osakabehime and take care of these Cursed Books!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> \u201CLife in Chaldea isn&#39;t quite like life anywhere else. Here, adventure could knock on your door at any time at all.\u201D</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> Thus, resigned to his fate, Mr. Andersen decided he may as well stick around until the Cursed Books were disposed of once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There it goes again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...the library&#39;s reception desk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess this means we&#39;re back where we started...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Osakabehime&#39;s been coming to the library a lot lately, so since she wasn&#39;t in her room, I figured we&#39;d find her here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Look, there&#39;s a note left on your desk.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take a look. Hmm.<br> Whoever wrote it has lovely handwriting.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> \u201CHi, Librarian. You weren&#39;t here when I showed up, so being the kind princess that I am, I&#39;ll put these books back on the shelves myself.\u201D</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What kind, beautiful lettering. I can almost see her personality leaping off the page.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just realized I forgot to tell you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In addition to running the library, Murasaki Shikibu also holds calligraphy and creative writing classes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, and proper letter-writing too...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I see. That does sound like it would be right up her alley.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I just wanted to be of whatever help I could to anyone who wished they had beautiful handwriting...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...or who wanted to better express their innermost feelings.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It&#39;s not much, but I do hope it&#39;s something.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go look for Osakabehime. She said she was going to put some books back on their shelves, right?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Just a moment, please. It would seem...that her note wasn&#39;t the only one left here!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> \u201CThen I will too.\u201D \u201CMe too.\u201D \u201CMe three.\u201D<br> \u201CSame.\u201D \u201CAs shall I.\u201D \u201CLikewise.\u201D</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Ugh, great! Just our luck that they all had to run off inside the library!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go after them!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll close the hall to the library, just in case!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe we should seal off the entrance, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai! I&#39;ll make sure to close off the hall to the library.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If anyone else shows up there, I&#39;ll send a message letting them know to wait until you get there.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> That should work. All right, come on.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hm hm hmm\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What a nice princess I am, putting books back where I got them\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...I guess that would technically be against the rules in most libraries...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...but it looks like they don&#39;t even keep track of who&#39;s checked out what in this one.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be daijoubu since I let the librarian know what I was doing. Hm hm hmm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There she is!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Good, we found her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh... It&#39;s her!<br> The girl in glasses who frequents my library...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Osakabehime, wait! Don&#39;t return that boook!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Master! A-a-a-and Murasaki-paisen!?<br> I mean, Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh oh gosh...!<br> N-n-n-now what am I gonna do!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Murasaki and I both love books, and we&#39;re both Japanese Servants who are big into literature! There can&#39;t be room for both of us in the lineup!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is exactly why I&#39;ve been trying to avoid running into her and Ma-chan at the same time!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re THAT similar...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not sure what to say...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh come on! We&#39;re both into books, we&#39;re both gloomy...<br> We&#39;re practically identical twins! Right, Ma-chan!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> U-um, Osakabehime!? Putting aside how similar we might be, could you let me see those books you checked out!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Also, have you noticed any books you don&#39;t recognize, by any chance!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh? You want to see my books?<br> Well sure, that&#39;s fine with...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wait. Y-y-you mean, here? In front of Ma-chan!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Kyaa!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> How is my book floating on its own...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is a Cursed Book Signal if ever I saw one!<br> It&#39;s very strong, too!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So given what happened in the study, I&#39;m guessing these things turn into enemies and try to attack us?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! But once we defeat it,<br> it will turn back into the book it used to\u2013</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> N-n-n-no, please! Anything but that!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let Ma-chan see what I was reading!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Cursed Book has transformed into an Eastern-style hydra! Be careful, it has a lot of magical energy, too!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> S-stay back! Please!<br> Yamete kudastooop!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry about this, Osakabehime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best not to look at the title!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nooo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-huh!? It looks like...Osakabehime has sided with the Cursed Book serpent...!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> She really was serious about not wanting Master here to see what the book was... The author in me sympathizes.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;m not here to judge. Let&#39;s take down this serpent and I guess try not to hurt Osakabehime much!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> It&#39;s over. Eh, you keep writing about certain things long enough, you&#39;re bound to go a little crazy from time to time.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fooou.<br> (Special Translation: You call this a LITTLE crazy?)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Osakabehime! I&#39;ll do my best to keep the Cursed Book&#39;s title out of sight while I recover it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve confirmed that you&#39;ve recovered the Cursed Book.<br> It does have a lot of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s still less than a quarter of the energy that was stolen. Which means this isn&#39;t the original, either...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Sniff)...<br> (Sniff)...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaah! This is a nightmare! Not only did I make a complete baka of myself, I didn&#39;t even put up a good fight...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> As if being too similar to her wasn&#39;t bad enough... I&#39;m not even a good writer. All I&#39;ve ever made is doujin...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never written any historic novels, let alone any masterpieces or classics... (Sniff)...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Why would Ma-chan want to keep a pale imitation like me around when [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] could have the real thing with Murasaki-senpai...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Sob)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. Really.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Sob)<br> Ma-chan...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobody could ever replace you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not an imitation of her at all.</p><hr><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> Fujimaru spoke from the heart, without a hint of dishonesty.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Is that...Murasaki-senpai&#39;s strange, sort of automatic commentary track technique? The one that only says things that are true...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I call it Taizan Commentary Fest. Osakabehime, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady]<br> Fujimaru is right. You and I are nothing alike.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> We may both like to put pen to paper to express our thoughts and feelings...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...but in my mind, that only makes us comrades, regardless of our different time periods.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaah! Paisen! Ma-chan!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gomenasorry! I should never have acted up like that! But I&#39;m really, really glad Ma-chan never saw that book&#39;s title!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] had, I think my poor little princess kokoro would have brokoro into a million pieces... (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There, there. You have nothing to apologize for.<br> This was all my fault to begin with.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Sniff) Paisen...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad everything worked out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You two really are good friends, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hey. In case you&#39;ve forgotten, we&#39;re a long way from happily ever after here. We still haven&#39;t found the original Cursed Book, and we don&#39;t even know where to look.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So come on, let&#39;s get moving. We can start by checking all the books those other Servants came here to return!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s so nice of you to help us like this, Andersen!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Believe me, if there was someone else you could ask, I&#39;d be gone in a heartbeat. But, in for a penny, in for a pound, as my colleague might say.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...All right, how long are you gonna keep cuddling each other!? Let&#39;s go already!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here,<br> but I&#39;ll come along too!</p><h2 id="section-5-the-sorrows-of-young-valkyrie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-the-sorrows-of-young-valkyrie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: The Sorrows of Young Valkyrie</h2><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> ...This should be the place.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Hmm, it&#39;d be kind of a waste to return it now.<br> Maybe I&#39;ll hang onto it a little longer.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> There is no need for that.<br> Remember, we are the Valkyries.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> As long as one of us has read a book to completion,<br> it will forever persist in our shared memory.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Yeah, I know, but there&#39;s just something about paper books.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> It&#39;s exciting to turn a new page,<br> even when you know what happens next.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> True... That is a good point.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I disagree. One can easily attain similar feelings even with electronic and Spiritronic information.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Besides...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Sentiment is for humans.<br> As are emotions.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> As Valkyries, we have no need for either.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Aww man.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Very well then, let&#39;s return these books.<br> We can inform the librarian of their ret\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There! I found three Heroic Spirits who seem to have come here to return some books!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A yuri story about three robot sisters... That could totally be moe...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s those three sisters. I remember them.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> The Norse Valkyries, huh.<br> All right, let&#39;s see if they can be reasoned with.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heeey! Valkyries!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t return those books just yet!</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Master.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Huh? Why&#39;re you here, Master?</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Estimation: Master has found something suspect about our actions...</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> ...and wishes to check the books we are about to return accordingly.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Wait, really!?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Uhh, h-hey there, Master!<br> We&#39;re not up to anything weird here, I promise!</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing suspicious about us coming to the library a lot lately. It&#39;s not like we&#39;ve all been checking out every single romance novel we can fi\u2013</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Hildr.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Gyah!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. I borrowed Aesop&#39;s Fables, and cannot yet say for certain that it has no tales of romance.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Really? I got Little Women, and there was definitely some love plots in that.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> What about you, Thr\xFAd?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I borrowed, uh...Wuthering Heights.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Oho, fascinating. That&#39;s a tale of real passion.<br> A very grown-up choice.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If it&#39;s passion you&#39;re looking for, you should try The Tale of Genji next. In fact, I could read it aloud for you right now if you like.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> L-Lord Andersen...!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (N-no way! That&#39;s downright sadistic! Does this mean four-eyes here was actually a heartless shota type all along!?)</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> The Tale of Genji?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> No need.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I have already read it.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Oh yeah, you didn&#39;t waste any time checking that one out. I remember it was one of the very first stories to be added to our shared memories.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> It was a very...enigmatic story. It depicted mind games, affection, and other human things in great detail...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Yet despite that, it was also strangely entrancing.<br> What about it?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Hmm, you don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Yes, I do say.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> You do?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I do.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> (Gasp) Wait! That does not mean I... It&#39;s not as though I have any interest in human thinking myself...</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ACommentary:</strong><br> The two younger Valkyries, delighted to learn of their eldest sister&#39;s obsession, could not contain their glee.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> M-more commentary!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe this really is a curse...</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> What? Why is my copy of Wuthering Heights floating in midair!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I&#39;m getting another Cursed Book Signal! It appears to have the same amount of magical energy as the last one!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Damn, another red herring. But we can&#39;t just leave it here. We&#39;ll have to deal with it now.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yosh! This is my chance to prove I can be useful!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll start recovering this book right now! I&#39;m sorry about this, Valkyries! I&#39;ll explain later, I promise!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Situation understood. Emergency in the library.<br> Preparing to counteract threat now.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! We&#39;ve got this!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Very well. I, too, will assist you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Cursed Book has transformed into a giant ice beast!<br> Please be careful, everyone!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Very well then... Let us begin!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> ...Confirmed: The battle has concluded.<br> Well done, everyone.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Great work, team!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Murasaki! The Cursed Book has taken physical form again!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Right! Not to worry, I have this under control.<br> Cursed Book, return to me!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...It would seem the emergency has been resolved.<br> Now then, if you will excuse us.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s completely resolved yet, Thr\xFAd.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Andersen said this wasn&#39;t the right one, so doesn&#39;t that mean the original threat is still out there?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Then, the three of us will take a different route to search the library. We will report back if we detect any similar magical energy readings.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> How does that sound, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It sounds great. Thanks!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;d be a huge help.</p><hr><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Thr\xFAd...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Did you just smile?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Of course not. Come, you two. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> ...Hmph. Well, see you later, Master!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Splitting your forces, huh. Not a bad idea. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll be able to recover any cursed books...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...but I doubt those three will have any trouble neutralizing them if they turn into monsters again.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> All that aside...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> If all three Valkyries are capable of materializing at the same time, why don&#39;t they do so more often?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I think I can answer that one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s because having all three of them materialize at once uses an excessive amount of magical energy, thanks to their unique Spirit Origin Ascension pattern.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s what Da Vinci said.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...I see.

If that had been a book about man&#39;s prowess in the boudoir, we&#39;d have a fight to the death on our hands, you know!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Lucky for you that it was just a biography of Captain Kidd!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what you dipshits think. Besides, I was just brushing up on my German with that dictionary.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong><br> Indeed, I too was pursuing a course of study, albeit one more focused on modern culture.

Great work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only place you haven&#39;t visited yet is the archive that&#39;s usually kept off-limits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everywhere else has been thoroughly checked.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Guess this means those three were the last Servants to return here with checked-out books.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a good number of Cursed Books now,<br> but we still haven&#39;t found the original.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one that made off with all the magical energy resources that were meant for Valentine&#39;s chocolate, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We&#39;ve recovered a good amount of it by now, but we still don&#39;t have as much as last year.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hmph. All things considered, it doesn&#39;t sound like there was that much magical energy involved.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Come to cases, I could just spin a sob story for one of the really rich ancient kings and get them to cover the difference.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess that would work, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...Okay, yeah. That would be sort of an anticlimax,<br> especially given all we&#39;ve done...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Problems like these should be overcome by a protagonist who&#39;s aware of their failings and is motivated to face them.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Murasaki?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes! Absolutely!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> If we can&#39;t find the original Cursed Book in the library, I&#39;m prepared to go back and search the rest of the base.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, if that&#39;s what you want,<br> I can reopen the hall at any time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but let me try scanning the entire library first, just to make sure the Cursed Book isn&#39;t hiding in there.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Good idea. It&#39;d be a real pain if this scoundrel were to flee the moment the shutters were opened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No problem!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just make sure you don&#39;t push yourself too hard, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I won&#39;t, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It will take about thirty minutes for the scan to finish, so this should be a good opportunity for you to rest.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh, then why don&#39;t we go to my room behind the reception desk? It should be perfect for a break.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> A-as in, your private room? Oh wow, I&#39;ve been to this library lots of times, but I&#39;ve never seen inside there!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is kind of doki-doki, isn&#39;t it, Ma-chan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...guess?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> As long as I get to sit down and rest my poor aching feet, I couldn&#39;t care less where it is. Now come on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There is something cool about having your home attached to your workplace.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes! Exactly!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It&#39;s right this way. Please, follow me.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Oh man, oh man, oh man! So this is what Murasaki-senpai&#39;s room looks like!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Wait. Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It looks just like a hotel room.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Specifically, a fancy luxury suite!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This looks like...the rooms we had in Luluhawa...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Exactly! Considering how much time we spent there I know that room like the back of my hand!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?<br> I don&#39;t wakarunderstand!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> D-d-do you not like it? Oh no, maybe I should have gone with tatami mats after all...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This room seemed so nice when I found it in Chaldea&#39;s database...so I thought I&#39;d try to recreate it myself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> R-recreate it!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wow, I never knew onmyoudou could be so handy!<br> It must be so nice being you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid my techniques are my take on Lord Seimei&#39;s teachings, so it isn&#39;t very representative of true onmyoudou...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...but I hope it will suffice to let you all rest for now.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have many fond memories of my bed in Luluhawa...but at least it&#39;s all top-notch stuff.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Ahh...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go make some tea!<br> You&#39;re all good with hot tea, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good to me.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d actually prefer cold...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know how to use chilling magecraft... Is it okay if I take a peek in your refrigerator, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, by all means. I think I still have some cold barley tea in there.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is everything okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look like something&#39;s bothering you.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> O-oh, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You see...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s something I wish to recover more than anything else.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Back when I first encountered the original Cursed Book in the archive...I had a letter taken from me.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A very precious letter\u2013full of beautiful expressions of love...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I kept it close, but even so,<br> it was taken from me so easily...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I know I don&#39;t have any right to be concerned about this.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The only thing I should be focusing on now is bringing this situation under control.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can be concerned about more than one thing at a time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If this letter means that much to you, we&#39;ll just have to get it back.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank you, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Your words have lifted a tremendous weight from my shoulders.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, faaau.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Thank you too, Lord Fou.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Shikibu. I don&#39;t have enough energy to bother sitting up right now, so I&#39;m just going to lay down while we talk. But let me ask you this:</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Why would this book want to eat a letter?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> These Cursed Book monsters haven&#39;t had any problem defending themselves, but I&#39;ve never seen one go out of their way to attack anyone.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> There&#39;s got to be some connection here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve got your letter.<br> The Cursed Book.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> And...magical energy resources meant for producing chocolate.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I...I am a Heroic Spirit whose focus has always been putting feelings into words.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Especially feelings of one person caring deeply for another.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So all the books I have created are sensitive to feelings as well...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m not entirely sure, but I think that must be what caused this mess.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That is why...I believe the Cursed Book eats feelings.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m awake! Now we&#39;re getting somewhere!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Master. What&#39;s the main thing you know about the Cursed Books?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They feed on nearby information.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They feed on nearby magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Right. They consume both nearby information,<br> and nearby magical energy.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> But they don&#39;t do so indiscriminately.<br> There&#39;s a condition that needs to be met first.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> To borrow Shikibu&#39;s words...the Cursed Books focus on information laden with emotion as well as magical energy.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> The former explains why one ate her letter,<br> and the latter explains...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Valentine&#39;s chocolate resources!</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Of course, that doesn&#39;t help us track down where the original Cursed Book is now, but at least it all makes sense.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> These Cursed Books may be a pain in the ass, but they&#39;re not going around eating anything and everything.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So we don&#39;t have to worry about one eating, say, a Magical Reactor, or a Holy Grail, or even a Heroic Spirit&#39;s Spirit Core.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hell, compared to the other shit we&#39;ve been through,<br> this is hardly a blip on the radar.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> So no one is really going to mind that you&#39;re worried about your precious letter or whatever.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, you look like you&#39;re feeling a little better now.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I am!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Andersen.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Don&#39;t thank me. I was just laying it all out.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Still... Of all the things it could have been, it had to be feelings, huh. What&#39;s the deal with that?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> What, are you one of those types who bares your soul in letters, but can&#39;t actually bring yourself to give them to the person they&#39;re meant for?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Ah well, it doesn&#39;t matter either way.<br> Besides, it&#39;s a fitting story for Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Pardon the intrusion. I see...<br> This explains a great many things.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Despite the fact that these books consume magical energy, we have yet to hear of them attacking Servants.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Nor have they flocked towards the Magical Reactor,<br> or tried to break into storage area for Holy Grails.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Haha, did you say Holy Grails?<br> Do you...know where they&#39;re being kept?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Go away.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;m back! Who&#39;s ready for some tea?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have some. Heh, just as I thought.<br> You have good taste in tea leaves.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Ah, yes, that reminds me: I have a message for you.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> That Mash girl is hard at work on her scan,<br> and says she will be done shortly. That is all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for telling us, Semiramis!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> It was nothing. Truly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would you mind, um...keeping an eye on Amakusa for me?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> You need not even ask. Of course.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, tea, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Here you go!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Hm.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Ahh, this is so nice and warm.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...You are all so kind. So very warmhearted.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...My place in the world:</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Why should it bring me grief?<br> Mountain cherry...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Blossom in my sight,<br> Were it ever so...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ooh, ooh, I know that one!<br> You wrote it yourself!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s one of the tanka poems included in the Goshui Wakashu, from Japan&#39;s Heian period. To elaborate, it means\u2013</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> \u201CWhy should I feel bad about the world I live in? If I could just look at it the same way I do flowers...\u201D</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> There are multiple interpretations, as with any renowned poem. Some consider it a reflection on the fragility of one&#39;s own life...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> ...but in this case, I think yours has the right idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a lovely poem.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Not at all. If it seemed that way to you...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...that is only because it reflects what lies in your own hearts.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Ugh, you fools are far too emotional. Haven&#39;t I been telling you not to wring your hands over every little misstep?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> As for you, Osakabehime, how&#39;s a writer supposed to get any writing done if they keep bawling their eyes out with every line they write?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Or do you just plan to go your whole life and manifestation without ever finishing a single book?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.

So this queen book roamed the base creating offspring of a sort, and now they&#39;re all coming back to the nest. Well that&#39;s easy to grasp.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, like a homing instinct?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> A homing instinct, huh.<br> That&#39;s definitely a possibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> At any rate...this is also our best chance to take these things down for good.

Well too bad.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Chaldean Heroic Spirit now, so you&#39;d better get used to others getting in your business, whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s not like this is a Holy Grail War where lives are on the line. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a Servant leaning on their Master.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I won&#39;t resist your efforts to help me any longer.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I would be glad to have you all accompany me to the very end...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up a large magical energy signal...! This is definitely the biggest Cursed Book we&#39;ve seen to date!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone, please be careful!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What an enormous Japanese-style bound book... It&#39;s as though it were the king of all books, or a dragon in book form.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wow, it&#39;s dekahuge! Super dekahuge!<br> I-I mean Mecha Eli-chan is bigger...!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...but it&#39;s still really, really dekahuge!<br> Are you sure we can fight it at human scale!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Great! So now we&#39;re up against a Great Cursed Book that feeds on human feelings! Can WE really bring it down? We don&#39;t exactly have any heavy hitters here!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. I&#39;m certain this is the original Cursed Book!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Only one thing left to do now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, everyone! Let&#39;s get it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou! Kyaaau!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Very well then! Let&#39;s bring this last Cursed Book to heel right now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Now&#39;s your chance! Take it down!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Okay!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Bound as I am...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...these mourning robes are dyed but a shallow shade of gray...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Yet there are depths where the tears have made pools on my sleeves....</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Releasing Noble Phantasm,<br> Tale of Genji, Aoi, Evil Spirit.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Cursed Book...the last, and first, of your kind...<br> Return to me now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Cursed Book has been recovered!<br> Checking its magical energy now, and...Oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is great! All of the chocolate resources have been restored!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Indeed, I can confirm as much myself.<br> Everything the Cursed Book took has been returned.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Despite that woman&#39;s wailings about making a mess,<br> I see no reason to be dissatisfied with these results.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Well, well. That&#39;s quite merciful for an empress so notorious for being harsh. I&#39;d even call it sweet. Whoa.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> ...If you so much as mention the word \u201Cchocolate,\u201D little scribe, I will have your head off where you stand.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong><br> Who, me? Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;d never be so foolish as to say that the stronger and scarier a woman is, the more susceptible she is to sweets.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Phew, I&#39;m exhausted. You must be too, Murasaki-senpai!<br> Congratulations on a job well done!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And to you. I can&#39;t tell you all how grateful I am for your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you get your precious letter back?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Oh, yes. I did indeed.<br> The letter is firmly back in my possession.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Thank you, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After that...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Valentine&#39;s Day preparations, as well as the customary chocolate gift-giving went smoothly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And it was not long before the newly built underground library reopened its doors.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> It would seem all is well now.<br> That silly Da Vinci even said...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> \u201CGo ahead and make as many magical energy-replenishing chocolates as you like, just like last year! No point in leaving any spare resources behind!\u201D</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Well, I suppose even they could use a break now and then.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad things turned out okay. Really.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> There doesn&#39;t seem to have been any real damage, so I&#39;d say this was mild as far as Valentine&#39;s Day happenings go.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Do not get smart with me.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> By the way, Assassin, you wouldn&#39;t happen to know where the Holy Grails\u2013</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...The Holy Grails\u2013</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> Do not make me repeat myself.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong><br> If you are so eager to have something, then try looking for it yourself, like what&#39;s-her-name did with the letter.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahaha, you&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...There you are.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You must have been dreadfully worried when I lost that precious letter...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what I would have done if I hadn&#39;t had so much help finding it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I am so deeply sorry for the trouble I caused you.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Please, don&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I was there the whole time, seeing how hard you searched for it...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Then, please...allow me to return the letter you left in my care.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I kept it in my bag after making my final corrections.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> At last...I can finally return it to you.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;d never written a letter before...but you showed me everything I needed to know.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You taught me how to put my thoughts and feelings into words.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If it hadn&#39;t been for you...I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have ever finished it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So, thank you. Believe me, what happened afterwards was no trouble at all.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That&#39;s very kind of you... But no. I will not forget how my carelessness led to this mishap.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And I promise I will take the utmost care never to let anything like it happen again.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So I hope I will continue to see you here at the library, as well as in my writing class.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course! I&#39;d love to join you again.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Valentine&#39;s Day is coming up soon.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m told we celebrate it by giving form and voice to the feelings we harbor every day.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It needn&#39;t necessarily take the form of chocolate. Whatever feelings you may have, you may write down in a letter...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...be they gratitude, or affection, or anything else you may find yourself thinking of between missions...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I hope that letter successfully makes its way to its intended recipient.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And after that...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> While it is not clear whether she may have done so during the sweet revelry of Valentine&#39;s Day...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...or at some other, later point...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A young girl may just have found the courage to give a letter of her own to a certain someone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> G-good morning, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh... I have something for you...</p>', 1230);
