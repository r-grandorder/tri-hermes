By curse, do you mean you can pick out Sakura&#39;s presence?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is more like a resonance. ......Well, I do not care. But if we are to fight Matou Sakura, I will retreat.</p><p>Putting you aside, I cannot harm Black Sakura. I have no chance of winning even if I fight her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Well, I have no chance of winning either. But...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. What do you mean by &#39;Black&#39;? Sakura&#39;s Sakura. She&#39;s just possessed by the shadow, and she&#39;ll quickly....&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;ll quickly be back to normal?</p><p>I explained that to you before. The only way to return her to normal is to separate her from the shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There are two ways to do so.</p><p>Eliminate the main body of the shadow, or wait until Matou Sakura materializes it.</p><p>You have no way to defeat the shadow right now. All you can do is protect Sakura&#39;s mind until the shadow is born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t know how to protect her mind.</p><p>...The Command Spell covering Sakura&#39;s body...</p><p>If that&#39;s what Kotomine means by Black Sakura, then isn&#39;t Sakura slowly turning into the shadow?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. When you talk about materializing the shadow, do you mean Sakura turning into it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I&#39;m sure there is some sympathy, but the main body of the shadow is in the Holy Grail.</p><p>What is transforming Matou Sakura is inside the Holy Grail, but that is still her shadow.</p><p>It cannot exist without her. The main body does not have form, so it exists in the material world by being her shadow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s inside the Holy Grail will not come into this world unless there is an incomplete Holy Grail called Matou Sakura.</p><p>But once it is born, it will be a separate entity. Once it is separated from her, the curse tainting her should stop.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. You say born, but is that thing inside Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. If it were, the matter would be easily solved. We would simply need to extract it from her body.</p><p>The main body of the shadow is within the Holy Grail. Matou Sakura is merely a host that gives it energy and form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But Sakura&#39;s the Holy Grail, right? What does that mean?</p><p>Are there many Holy Grails?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I explained to you in the beginning. This land has a Holy Grail, and they summon the Holy Grail into the Holy Grail the people prepared.</p><p>The main Holy Grail\u2015\u2015\u2015the magecraft circle and the brain that governs the rules of the ritual called the Holy Grail War. That is the Holy Grail on this land that Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Makiri prepared.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The Holy Grail in this land\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>All the laws... Summoning the Servants, making the Masters fight, and calling down the Holy Grail.</p><p>If the Holy Grail War is man-induced, then it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s also a man-induced cause.</p><hr><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015if I find that large-scale magecraft circle and destroy it, I may be able to purge the shadow invading Sakura&#39;s body\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you know where that is, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have a guess. Ask Rin if you would like to know the entrance.</p><p>The Tohsaka family are the supervisors of this land.</p><p>The Einzbern cooperated with them two hundred years ago to secure a land for the ritual. Rin, the successor, should know where the place is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But\u2015\u2015\u2015that is all after we save Illyasviel. If Zouken obtains Illyasviel, she and Matou Sakura will be disposed of as the Holy Grail.</p><p>Matou Zouken has no intention of using the main Holy Grail. For him, the two women are enough.</p><p>Your idea of destroying the main Holy Grail is meaningless.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t be stupid! I&#39;m not thinking about such a thing!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? I think it is the most realistic solution for you. It&#39;s strange that you wouldn&#39;t go through with it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shut up. So why didn&#39;t you tell me about it?</p><p>If you&#39;d told me at the beginning, I would....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You would have destroyed the magecraft circle? Nothing would go so smoothly. My goal is the completion of the magecraft circle, after all. I cannot let you destroy it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you that we will be enemies after we rescue Illyasviel. My goal is different from yours.</p><p>I am interested in what comes from Matou Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015no, what is trying to become her. Unlike Zouken, I have no wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t bullshit me. You&#39;re the same as Zouken. You&#39;re using Sakura to create something and make it yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Make it mine...? Of course not. I have no interest in it after it is born. In any case, no human will be able to control it.</p><p>What will appear is a phenomenon called hell. If Matou Sakura becomes that, I will die just like everybody else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>What is that?</p><p>Then his goal&#39;s just...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Are you insane?</p><p>You want to turn Sakura into such a thing, knowing that you&#39;re going to be killed...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. My role is to bless whatever is born.</p><p>That will not change, no matter what it is or what situation it is in.</p><p>There is a life and a will to be born. I cannot oppose that.</p><p>Emiya. If there is a pure wish in this world, it must be the desire to be born.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But what&#39;s in Sakura is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is not evil.</p><p>Humans can earn happiness just by existing.</p><p>As they grow, they will learn of new happiness, of more advanced and complex pleasures.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But humans are not happy at the moment of birth.</p><p>An embryo does not have the knowledge to know what happiness is.</p><p>Humans start from zero, learn what is fun, and learn what is right.</p><p>The beginning is at zero.</p><p>There is no good or evil. There is only the fact that it is allowed to exist in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good or evil. The person&#39;s knowledge will decide that.</p><p>If there is any responsibility, it lies with the environment and the &#39;self&#39; that raised you.</p><p>There is no crime in receiving birth.</p><p>That is why I will bless even the birth of a devil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015This is the way I have lived.</p><p>This way of living is mine.</p><p>Even if what Matou Sakura gives birth to is hell, it is hard to change my nature.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t understand.</p><p>I know he&#39;s serious.</p><p>He knows he&#39;ll die, but he&#39;s still going bless the evil that will be born through Sakura.</p><p>...I&#39;ll never be able to approve of this man.</p><p>But it&#39;s true that he&#39;s trying to save Illya and release Sakura from Zouken&#39;s control.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Thoughts that are in conflict.</p><p>Lives that cannot coexist.</p><p>But we have the same goal right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I can trust you, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said we will be cooperating. I will trust you with my back.&quot;</p><hr><p>A reply without hesitation.</p><p>...That&#39;s all that&#39;s there right now.</p><p>I have an ally that&#39;s better than anyone.</p><p>I&#39;ll just think about rescuing Illya and getting out of this forest safely\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-07-succeed-from-deep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-07-succeed-from-deep" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 07 Succeed from deep</h2><p>Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The space is filled with black fire.</p><p>The luxurious rooms are burned away by meaningless gasping.</p><hr><p>Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The blazing fire is like a heat haze.</p><p>The formerly shapeless shadow breaks through every wall and floor in concert with the host&#39;s pain.</p><hr><p>Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015uh, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015ahh, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>The black heat haze dances in tune to the melody.</p><p>Each time the figure at its center curls up, claws at her throat, and gasps in agony, the old castle&#39;s beauty is disfigured further.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But this is nothing to grieve over.</p><p>This desolate winter castle has been forgotten by everyone.</p><p>Nobody has lived here or seen it, so it makes no difference even if it&#39;s destroyed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah...... Ua... ah... aaahh, ah......&quot;</p><hr><p>The hall has turned into the shadow&#39;s kingdom.</p><p>Writhing in agony, the woman in the middle is both its king and its slave.</p><p>It has already been a day since she arrived at this castle with Illyasviel.</p><hr><p>Matou Sakura&#39;s transfiguration is reaching its final stage.</p><hr><p>As she&#39;s one with the shadow, having a physical form is torture.</p><p>Her mind is being engulfed by pain and the impulse to destroy.</p><p>...If that were all, she would be able to bear it.</p><p>She&#39;s used to physical pain.</p><hr><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015the pain of having her existence denied is something she has never experienced.</p><p>The shadow should not exist.</p><p>This world has no blessings to offer it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh......

I am tired of hearing those words. The match is over. I am the only Servant you need. Have her take in the remaining two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. But she does not try to kill the Servants she has absorbed. I do not know if it is her shallow wit or cowardice. Saber and Berserker are still trapped within her. She should kill them, but she keeps them alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Interesting. So Saber is not the only one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It is probably to keep me in check, but how thoughtless of her. The more Servants she controls, the more magical energy she must draw from the Holy Grail. It is a supply of magical energy the Holy Grail receives from the Great Holy Grail, but magical energy is not the only thing that flows into her.</p><p>She is accelerating her transfiguration by letting the Servants live. Her sanity will be lost and she will turn into an ideal tool even if I do nothing.&quot;</p><hr><p>The old magus laughs, watching the girl&#39;s suffering.</p><p>There&#39;s affection in his eyes.</p><p>He loves her.</p><p>What he originally considered a mere experiment grew beyond his expectation to grant him his dearest wish, immortality.</p><hr><p>It would be strange not to love her.</p><p>To the old magus, Matou Sakura looks like a beautiful bride.</p><p>No matter how much she fights, she will be his in the end.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter even if she obtains power, controls many Servants, and retains her sanity.</p><p>Their hierarchy was set eleven years ago.</p><p>The old magus can kill Matou Sakura merely by closing his eyes and opening them again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...But the white skull is different.</p><p>He&#39;s the symbol of ill omen, the wind that brings death, so he&#39;s sensitive to those of his kind.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015The magus makes light of the matter, but\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Will everything turn out well?</p><p>The situation will not change, even if the girl loses her sanity.</p><p>She reacts to people with hostility.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she&#39;s already acting the way she will once her mind is lost.</p><p>Matou Zouken is conceited.</p><p>Even if she goes mad, she will not obey his command.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Magus. There is a way to control her, yes? Her defensive instincts are excessive. Your voice will not reach her if she loses her sanity and can no longer tell ally from enemy.</p><p>If that happens, you cannot approach merely by hiding your hostility.</p><p>She is the kind that will eliminate her enemies by foreseeing the &#39;result&#39; called her death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I see, that is promising.

She&#39;s begging me for help now! Good, good! It feels like we&#39;re eleven years in the past!</p><p>The pressure of being denied by the world itself must surely be painful, Sakura!</p><p>But endure it. Your body can endure it. Remember all the days of pain and solitude over the last eleven years!</p><p>For what did you bear the thousands of tortures!? What did you give your body to the tens of thousands of worms for!? That&#39;s right; pain of that degree is nothing to you! That&#39;s how I raised you! That&#39;s how I trained you!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>It seems the old magus can hear the girl&#39;s voice.</p><p>Assassin can only hear groans, but she must literally be begging for her life, begging for help.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I will help you! You are my masterpiece! I shall see it through! But I can only save your body. Your mind did not follow me through the eleven years of training.</p><p>You escaped the pain by accepting it, so you should not be able to bear that resentment. But you can rest assured, as I will guarantee the strength of your flesh! You can bear it! Your flesh shall put on Avenger!&quot;</p><hr><p>The old magus continues to laugh.</p><p>Assassin looks at him emotionlessly and steps back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Where are you going, Assassin?</p><p>There is a slight possibility of danger. I need you here to protect me from her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I do not mind, but why are you concerned about the black Holy Grail and not the white? Why are you letting the legitimate Holy Grail we obtained roam freely?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that. Illyasviel is cooperative. She exists only to open the gate, as is her duty. She does not mind what we do as long as her goal is achieved.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not be so doubtful. The Holy Grail you desire is that girl. Keeping your name in history and becoming the original. Your wish to be eternal through record will be granted by Einzbern.</p><p>But I need her to keep her original form. Homunculi are outside my expertise. You can let her be until they prepare her formal dress.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........So you will not force them, you say?</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015do we have such liberty?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course we do. We have no more enemies.</p><p>It was unexpected that Emiya&#39;s boy and Tohsaka&#39;s girl were alive, but they aren&#39;t important. Nobody is foolish enough to fight after being shown that much difference in power.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We cannot take it back if we rush things out of needless worry and allow Illyasviel to die.</p><p>It is her role to open heaven&#39;s gate. We shall show compassion and let her carry out her duty\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Assassin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Stop. It seems there is someone that foolish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm?&quot;</p><hr><p>At that instant, the white skull disappears.</p><p>Assassin sensed the intruders and hurried out of the castle without hesitation.</p><p>The enemies are already running outside.</p><p>They have slipped through the unwary magus&#39;s guard and are about to exit the castle gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. So you are determined to die, boy?&quot;</p><p>But he hasn&#39;t been careless.</p><p>Illyasviel cannot run away.</p><p>Einzbern&#39;s longstanding desire is in her core.</p><p>The white girl will help him even if he doesn&#39;t force her.</p><p>It&#39;s foolish to run away with such a girl.</p><p>Even if they escape the forest with her, she will come to the land of the Holy Grail, the land of the origin.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah. I have left her alone, but it cannot be helped now.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It is your turn, Sakura. You cannot be saved without Illyasviel. If you would like to be freed from that pain, go trample upon them without mercy.&quot;</p><p>With a loud laugh, the presence of the old magus recedes.</p><hr><p>...A shadow is cowering in the hall.</p><p>The shadow that shrouds the entire hall has become a black swamp, from which two dark figures emerge.</p><hr><p>&quot;.....................&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl no longer feels agony.</p><p>It&#39;s not that she&#39;s accustomed to the poison now.</p><p>It&#39;s merely that...</p><p>&quot;............I see. You came, Senpai......&quot;</p><hr><p>...Pleasure has surpassed her dark pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So that priest&#39;s with him. How stupid of him.

Do you have experience in mountain climbing, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............Don&#39;t tell me...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean free climbing, of course. It is vertical, but there is no overhang and there are enough holds. We can maintain a secure footing. It will be easy to climb this wall without tools.

One might say you were Matou Zouken&#39;s natural enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t answer, but checks on his wounded body.</p><p>The bleeding has stopped.</p><p>He&#39;s out of weapons, but he suffered no fatal wounds, and his strength should return once he rests for a few minutes.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what are you going to do, Assassin? Your Master is gone. My holy words should have an effect on you now that your source of magical energy is gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I would assume so. My body will soon disappear. Without a Master, I am no different from the wandering spirits in this forest. My body will degrade to that of a lowly spirit within a day, and I shall disappear from this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Correct. I can harm Servants without Masters.</p><p>So, what will you do? Will you avenge your Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not so foolish as that. He suffered defeat because of his own arrogance. It is not my fault.</p><p>But still, something does not make sense, and that I must ask of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You must mean how your Zabaniya failed.</p><p>I believe you obtained your arm from Shaytaan, but it will have no effect on me as long as it bears the name of the fallen angel.</p><p>That arm punishes humans, so it cannot curse one of its own kind. As my heart is not human, it is strong against such a curse.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I thought so. Your heart was the same as that girl&#39;s.</p><p>You must already be tainted.&quot;</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>He merely smiles ironically.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But how did you know? You could not act as you did unless you knew my arm would have no effect on you.</p><p>Your intention was to have me use my Noble Phantasm, correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I already knew about your arm, Assassin.</p><p>A cursed arm that creates an image of the target&#39;s heart and swaps it with the real heart.</p><p>That&#39;s how you killed my Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Then you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I watched it until he died.</p><p>It&#39;s natural that I knew about your arm. Your blunder was made the instant you killed Lancer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Damn, that was indeed a blunder.&quot;</p><p>Assassin tut-tuts in self-deprecation.</p><p>His hostility disappears at the same time.</p><p>He must be satisfied with the answer, as he quickly retreats.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So he went to look for another Master.</p><p>I&#39;d assume his next Master would be Matou Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s not a problem for the priest.</p><p>It&#39;s fine as long as Matou Zouken doesn&#39;t kill Matou Sakura.</p><hr><p>Zouken&#39;s wish is immortality.</p><p>He can achieve his wish by having Sakura&#39;s body turn into the Holy Grail.</p><p>The curse in the Holy Grail will not hatch if the old man is alive.</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless if Sakura becomes his tool.</p><p>She needs to remain a Master.</p><p>Because...</p><hr><p>&#39;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You will never find it.</p><p>You were defective from birth\u2015\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He gets dizzy.</p><p>It must be because of the fatigue and loss of blood.</p><p>The priest leans against the wall and closes his eyes.</p><hr><p>It all happened ten years ago.</p><hr><p>&#39;Defective from birth\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>The man did everything he could after accepting the fact.</p><p>He couldn&#39;t understand morals, but had common sense. So his teenage years were spent trying to overcome his defect.</p><p>But it never happened.</p><p>The man&#39;s purgatories and sufferings were entirely useless.</p><p>And his final attempt was a woman.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a simple story.</p><p>Every human wishes to love one of the opposite sex, have a family, and die peacefully.</p><p>Even if one may detest the peace, one can only dream about it.</p><p>This man is no exception.</p><p>He wished for such a thing, even though he felt no fascination in it.</p><p>He loved a woman, trying to earn ordinary happiness.</p><hr><p>The man chose a woman with no future.</p><p>She was terminally ill, only expected to live for a few years.</p><p>Did he choose her because of that, or was that his only choice?</p><p>He still doesn&#39;t know.</p><hr><p>Their life together lasted for about two years.</p><p>The man tried to love the woman.</p><p>The woman tried to love the man, did love him, and even had his child.</p><p>But the result didn&#39;t change.</p><p>It was because the man derived his happiness from the woman&#39;s suffering and his child&#39;s despair.</p><p>The more he tried to love, the more their suffering saved him.</p><hr><p>The contradiction didn&#39;t make the man suffer. He doesn&#39;t even know if he suffered.</p><p>But the more the woman tried to cure him, the more he wanted to see her grieve.</p><hr><p>The woman was a saint. She was sickly, but she was still a saint for him.</p><p>It need not be said how faithful she was or how deeply she understood his anger.</p><p>That&#39;s why the man was in despair.</p><p>No human will ever understand him and try to heal him to her degree. And this woman still could not fill the void within him.</p><hr><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015there was no need to live and question right and wrong.</p><p>He was born defective.</p><p>His birth was some kind of mistake.</p><p>He concluded that if his existence was a mistake, it was best to disappear. And he went to bid goodbye to the woman before he died.</p><p>He made her his wife as an experiment, so it&#39;s his natural duty to go tell her of his end.</p><hr><p>The woman loved Kotomine.</p><p>Kotomine tried to love the woman.</p><p>That&#39;s all there is to this story.</p><hr><p>The end came relatively quickly.</p><p>&quot;I could not love you.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s all the man said in the room made of stone.</p><p>The dying woman smiled. She was unable to stand up, because her body was now composed of just skin and bone.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No. I love you.&quot;</p><p>With a smile, she took her own life.</p><hr><p>There was no way to stop her, and stopping her was meaningless.</p><p>The woman had a fatal disease. She would eventually die. He knew that when he chose her.</p><hr><p>The woman, covered in blood, looked up at the man and smiled.</p><p>&quot;See. You&#39;re crying.&quot;</p><p>He wasn&#39;t crying, of course.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the woman saw it that way.</p><p>The woman used her death to prove to him that he could love, and that he deserved to live.</p><p>The man silently left the room and broke away from the teachings of God.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>He certainly felt sad.</p><p>But not because she died.</p><p>The man, at that time, thought...</p><p>&#39;How terrible. If she was going to die, I wanted to kill her myself.&#39;</p><hr><p>He grieved over losing the chance to enjoy her death.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It happened long ago.</p><p>He can&#39;t remember her voice or her face.</p><p>But sometimes he thinks,</p><p>&#39;I wanted to kill her.&#39;</p><p>Is that for his pleasure, or\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Is it grief over wanting to kill the one he loved with his own hands?</p><hr><p>He cuts off his thought process whenever the answer flickers in his head.</p><p>It&#39;s something that should be hidden forever.</p><p>The woman&#39;s death was meaningless.</p><p>Her devotion couldn&#39;t change him.</p><p>But the man didn&#39;t want to consider her death to be worthless.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So he stopped searching for answers.</p><hr><p>...It all happened long ago.</p><p>The memory of the man who feeds on others&#39; misfortunes.</p><p>The man later meets his nemesis.</p><p>Emiya Kiritsugu.</p><p>A magus that cast away what the man might have wanted\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He opens his eyes.</p><p>It seems he fell asleep.</p><p>He checks his condition, starts to walk to catch up to Emiya Shirou, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No, you can&#39;t go anywhere.</p><p>Because you die here.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is interrupted by a girl.</p><hr><p>She has completely changed.</p><p>Her black outfit is her shadow.</p><p>She&#39;s covering her body with her own dark magical energy.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The amount and the presence of her magical energy is beyond human capabilities.</p><p>She&#39;s at the same level as pure heroic spirits, the Counter Guardians.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You are completely tainted, Matou Sakura.</p><p>You cannot change to that degree unless your mind is attuned to the curse.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So you&#39;ve accepted the fact that you&#39;re a human-eating monster.&quot;</p><p>Even though the priest wished for it, he still criticizes the girl.</p><p>As if to blame her for being intoxicated with her power.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hah. But is it wrong to be drunk with your power?</p><p>It can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>Everyone picked on me too much. I think I would&#39;ve endured it longer if everyone was nicer to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. Endure what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Myself, priest-san.</p><p>I finally understand now. I hate this world.</p><p>The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t allow such things now.</p><p>...I know I&#39;m just taking my anger out on others. I know it&#39;s wrong, but I still think this way.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>I wonder what kind of face the people who haven&#39;t helped me will make when they realize I exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl smiles, as if it&#39;s a sacred pleasure.</p><p>The priest doesn&#39;t change his expression.</p><p>He keeps staring at the girl as if regarding something foul.</p><hr><p>&quot;You have changed, Matou Sakura. I see, your darkness was one of the qualities to adapt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve changed. I&#39;m not the old Matou Sakura. That weak girl doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p><p>...Yes. Everyone tormented me until now. So I&#39;m just getting back at them. The me who sat there and endured is gone.&quot;</p><hr><p>She laughs.</p><p>Double personality.</p><p>The original Matou Sakura disappeared, and the other personality surfaced.</p><p>That&#39;s the only logical reason for her change.</p><p>But...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What are you talking about? You don&#39;t need to hide it, Matou Sakura.&quot;</p><p>The priest quickly denies it.</p><hr><p>&quot;W\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said there&#39;s no need to hide it.</p><p>You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don&#39;t need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself.&quot;</p><p>Her face stiffens.</p><p>He&#39;s absolutely right.</p><p>The girl grits her teeth and glares back at the priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying!? You&#39;re the one who made me like this...!&quot;</p><p>The girl&#39;s shadow reacts to her hateful voice.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A blazing infringement.</p><p>The shadow covers the ground in an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;I won&#39;t deny it. I kept you alive so that you would remain its Master. You measured up to my expectations, and you are about to give birth to Avenger.</p><p>You have easily accomplished what I could not.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy at all...! You don&#39;t know how painful it was, how much pain I&#39;m going through right now...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, and there&#39;s no need to know. I&#39;m not so mad as to listen to a girl&#39;s complaint.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! ............I see.</p><p>You&#39;re right. I don&#39;t want you to know.</p><p>I won&#39;t let you feel compassion. I&#39;m in a position where I can make anyone realize whatever I want.&quot;</p><p>She smiles cruelly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest retreats without any hesitation.</p><p>He quickly backs away, like when he captured Matou Zouken.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The priest retreats with one jump.</p><p>She may have vast magical energy, but she&#39;s still inexperienced.</p><p>She has no experience with battle, and she&#39;s unskilled as a magus. It&#39;s easy for him to retreat.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015How foolish. Do you think you can get away from me?&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>The priest falls to the ground at that instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015gah......!&quot;</p><p>He rolls down.</p><p>He falls to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hm, guh......!&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t stop.</p><p>He can&#39;t stop coughing up blood. Every time he tries to breathe, it wells up in his throat.</p><hr><p>&quot;How does it feel to have someone grab hold of your heart? Your life&#39;s under my control, no matter where you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You died ten years ago. Emiya Kiritsugu shot your heart and you died. But you stayed alive because of one reason.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re that... hmm, who was it? It&#39;s the Servant I ate before, but I guess his name doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>That gold person was showered with the contents of the Holy Grail, which connected him to it. But it couldn&#39;t taint that man, so it flowed into you, his Master. Right?</p><p>And you were resurrected.</p><p>Avenger. Your life was saved because Angra Manyu supplied you with magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Then this is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. You&#39;re connected to Angra Manyu. But I&#39;m Angra Manyu.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015So I squashed it. I destroyed the fake heart that kept you alive.</p><p>I can squash your organs too if you want.</p><p>I can pull out your insides, no matter where you are.&quot;</p><hr><p>She raises her hand.</p><p>How can she say &#39;if you want&#39;?</p><p>The girl has no intention of keeping him alive.</p><p>No matter how much he may beg for his life, she&#39;ll laugh as she kills him.</p><p>He&#39;ll give her back his fake life.</p><p>Because it&#39;s hers.</p><p>Even if it&#39;s just a speck next to her total magical energy, there&#39;s no reason for her to let the priest keep it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Goodbye. I appreciate the fact that you saved me.&quot;</p><p>She grasps her slender fingers together as if to twist apart an invisible doll.</p><p>A crushing sound.</p><p>The priest&#39;s body is squeezed like a rag.</p><p>One more twist.</p><p>The priest will die in the next second.</p><p>But right before that...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Ah, uh, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>The girl doubles over in pain.</p><p>...She coughs up blood.</p><p>She scratches the ground, as if begging for help.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015it hurts, no... don&#39;t... come in\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The shadow expands.</p><p>...What happened? The shadow on her body expands, then slowly shrinks back to the original size.</p><hr><p>&quot;......No way...... Berserker lost...?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no other explanation.</p><p>Berserker was defeated.</p><p>He died, dissolved into pure magical energy, and was consumed by her, the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her mind distorts.</p><p>The personality called Matou Sakura is pushed even further into a corner now.</p><p>...She can&#39;t move any farther, but the great soul pushes her against the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah.&quot;</p><p>...She&#39;ll disappear.</p><p>She&#39;ll disappear.</p><p>Matou Sakura will disappear.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Before that...&quot;</p><p>She thinks of killing the priest, looks up, and is annoyed by her failure to follow through.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Fine.

It&#39;s not a blade, but this might do.&quot;</p><p>I find the crystal from that day.</p><p>...The pendant I found beside me after I was killed by Lancer.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how much magical energy was originally in this, but now there&#39;s not even enough for one strengthening magecraft left in it.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right. Now, I can clearly think about who this pendant belongs to, and who could have saved me that night.</p><p>After all, she was the only other person at school at that time. I don&#39;t know why she saved me, but she wouldn&#39;t need a reason to save a life.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My consciousness starts to fade away.</p><p>I&#39;ll think about it later.</p><p>I&#39;ll fall unconscious if I think about happy things and relax.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I check my condition.</p><p>I released the seal on my left arm.</p><p>I put the Shroud back on it, but it&#39;s only there to ease my mind.</p><p>According to Kotomine, the switch would be tripped if I used Archer&#39;s arm.</p><p>He said there&#39;d nothing I could do after that.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I can still move my body.</p><p>The problem is my mind, but I can stay conscious as long as I stay awake.</p><p>As for projection... I can probably project three more times using Archer&#39;s arm.</p><hr><p>I know I can manage it once.</p><p>I&#39;m scared about the second time.</p><p>The third will be fatal. I think my body will self-destruct, even if my mind&#39;s still alive.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>I close my eyes and strain my ears.</p><p>...I hear creaking sounds along with my heartbeat.</p><hr><p>...The thing invading my body from Archer&#39;s arm.</p><p>It gets harder to suppress his Reality Marble the more I use his Blade Works. Eventually, an infinite number of blades will be created inside my body instead of outside.</p><p>...I don&#39;t even want to imagine what&#39;ll happen.</p><p>A thousand blades will pierce my body from within, killing me instantly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t kid me. I won&#39;t kill myself.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m in a hopeless condition.</p><p>I accept the whole situation.</p><p>But I reject the facts as they stand.</p><p>I won&#39;t die, and I won&#39;t self-destruct.</p><p>Not waking up after I fall asleep is just a product of my frightened imagination.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll be saved.</p><p>I&#39;ll be saved once I do everything I need to.</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless otherwise.</p><p>I said I&#39;ll protect Sakura no matter what.</p><p>So I can&#39;t just die selfishly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right. I have to contact Tohsaka first.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t have time.</p><p>I&#39;ll go to her house.</p><p>I&#39;m worried about whether Kotomine&#39;s all right, but he&#39;s not my ally anymore now that we&#39;ve saved Illya.</p><p>I can&#39;t ask for his help again, but the promise to...</p><hr><p>It&#39;s past nine o&#39;clock.</p><p>I thought I came back right away, but it&#39;s been two hours already.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Sorry to keep you waiting, Illya. I&#39;m going to Tohsaka&#39;s house, so let&#39;s go together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin&#39;s house? I don&#39;t mind, but why?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... why? We have to meet up with Tohsaka. And I&#39;m worried about how she&#39;s doing.</p><p>Kotomine said she&#39;d heal by tonight, but I can&#39;t really trust him. If she&#39;s not doing well, I&#39;ll need to look after her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. That&#39;s fine, but Shirou...&quot;</p><p>Illya points to the wall.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re worrying about me. As you can see, I&#39;m all right.</p><p>But if you were that worried about me, I wish you&#39;d have come by my house before heading off to the forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka...!? When did you get here...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I was here about an hour ago. I heard from Illya what happened at the forest.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s in a bad mood... No, she&#39;s angry.</p><p>It seems she doesn&#39;t like the fact that I went to the forest without her.</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t help it. I thought I had to act as quickly as possible, and Illya was in serious danger.</p><p>...Right, Illya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Yeah. I wasn&#39;t locked up anywhere, but I could&#39;ve been taken to the Great Holy Grail and had my heart taken out at any time.</p><p>Zouken wanted to open the gate as soon as he took control of Sakura. I would be dead right now if Shirou and Kotomine had come a bit later.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015See. I wouldn&#39;t have made it if I&#39;d waited for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? So it all depended on Sakura, right? Tell me the truth, Illya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you can tell?</p><p>Yeah, there was a bit more time. Sakura&#39;s strong, so she won&#39;t easily break. I think there was about one more day to spare until she lost herself and fell under Zouken&#39;s control.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I thought so. You shouldn&#39;t pamper Shirou too much. A little strictness is just right for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll be grateful if you see to that.&quot;</p><hr><p>The two criticize me.</p><p>But if the time limit was a day, I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve made it if I&#39;d waited for Tohsaka.</p><p>I was faced with an important choice in the forest, but in exchange, I&#39;m able to regain the time the three of us can spend together.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>...I concentrate hard, since I&#39;m starting to relax.</p><p>It seems the tension faded away during the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Hm......? Hold on, Illya.</p><p>You said Sakura might last one more day. Then the remaining time we have is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Half a day at most. ...No, no matter how hard Sakura tries, Avenger is about to be born. Once that happens, she will change completely. Nobody can save Sakura, and nobody will be saved.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Avenger...?&quot;&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka and I frown at the strange word.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Avenger.</p><p>It&#39;s the eighth class in the Holy Grail War. It&#39;s a &#39;violation&#39; that the Einzberns summoned by breaking the rules.</p><p>That&#39;s what tainted the contents of the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>It&#39;s the main body that assimilated with Sakura, projecting the shadow because it couldn&#39;t go into the outside world.</p><p>It&#39;s something that should not exist, consuming human lives to take form.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s Avenger\u2015\u2015\u2015an anti-hero that the Einzbern Master summoned in the third ritual.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You know about it, Illya...!? You know what that shadow is, and what Sakura&#39;s possessed by...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I got the information out of Sakura, so I understand what&#39;s going on.</p><p>What we have to do. What, exactly, you&#39;ve made into your enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya closes her eyes once.</p><p>...Is that resignation?</p><p>Illya sighs and then stares at us.</p><hr><p>&quot;What I&#39;m about to talk about is the heart of the matter, and it&#39;s nothing that concerns you two. You shouldn&#39;t be burdened with this.</p><p>Shirou, Rin. As you two are the last Masters in the Holy Grail War, I shall tell you the truth.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at Illya in surprise.</p><p>I do likewise.</p><p>Illya shows calmness and emptiness as if she&#39;s someone else.</p><hr><p>&quot;Everything started two hundred years ago.</p><p>No, the journey of those who seek the Holy Grail began long before that. But two hundred years ago, the ritual was begun in this land.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll start from there.</p><p>The Holy Grail grants any wish. Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka cooperated to conduct a ritual to summon the Holy Grail.</p><p>That&#39;s how the Holy Grail War came to be. A murderous battle between seven summoned Servants to determine the ownership of the Holy Grail.</p><p>Magi who are chosen as Masters become the hosts of the Servants and kill each other until only one magus remains.</p><p>That&#39;s the ostensible reason for the Holy Grail War that you two know of.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t look surprised, Rin. So you had some idea of it, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Somewhat. I knew all along that I was being used, but I didn&#39;t mind it too much.</p><p>I&#39;m reaping the benefits by using somebody else&#39;s system. We&#39;re both using each other.</p><p>I&#39;m not stupid enough to get angry over something so trivial.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then I don&#39;t have to explain that the order is reversed? How about you, Shirou? Did you already know that the process of making the Servants fight is unnecessary?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Well, I did know.</p><hr><p>Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail.</p><p>The heroic spirits are summoned to determine whether the summoner deserves the Holy Grail.</p><p>Once summoned, they make a contract with a Master to stay in this world and obtain the Holy Grail. Then they go out to defeat the other Masters and Servants.</p><hr><p>...In and of itself, that&#39;s not a problem.</p><p>But once I found out the defeated heroic spirits are absorbed into the Holy Grail, something felt off.</p><p>Heroic spirits\u2015\u2015\u2015Servants are only a factor in determining which Master is suited for the Holy Grail.</p><p>So why are they taken into the Holy Grail after their purpose has been served?</p><hr><p>&quot;...So does that mean heroic spirits are needed for the Holy Grail War, and Masters are just a tool to summon them?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. In the ritual of the war, Masters are mere receptors to summon the Servants. Once they&#39;ve done that, they can die at any time.</p><p>The heroic spirits are the only ones needed to complete the Holy Grail.</p><p>Heroic spirits are pure souls separate from the time axis. Though they are outside of this world&#39;s logic, they can still influence it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the power they needed.</p><p>They tried to exit into the outer world using that power.</p><p>That&#39;s the real purpose of the Holy Grail in this land.</p><p>The Holy Grail Wars were waged to create a phenomenon, a miracle, that is still out of human reach.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s the great ritual to attain immortality that&#39;s said to have been lost by the Einzberns.</p><p>Not a heroic spirit or a holy spirit, but a soul of a mere human that&#39;s fated to disappear from this world. Bringing it about is an act of God.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015The name of the miracle is &#39;Heavens Feel&#39;.</p><p>It&#39;s the golden cup that&#39;s the third of the five existing True Magics.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;S\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015True Magics!? You mean &#39;those&#39; True Magics...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The air tenses up.</p><p>Illya says that the Holy Grail is a ritual to perform a True magecraft.</p><hr><p>True magecraft.</p><p>A divine mystery that cannot be reached with magecraft. An impossible phenomenon that cannot be achieved by modern people.</p><p>It&#39;s the ultimate goal of every magus, and those who achieve it are called &quot;sorcerers&quot; with envy and awe.</p><hr><p>There are five True Magics acknowledged by the magecraft Association.</p><p>As I&#39;m not even in the Association, I have no way to know, but I&#39;ve heard that there are five True Magics and that there are about four sorcerers.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Wait...! So the Third True magecraft is the materialization of the soul!? But Servants are materialized souls too...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. The system does use a part of the Third True magecraft, but the heroic spirits are summoned.</p><p>Servants aren&#39;t alive as part of this world or time. It&#39;s too imperfect to be the Third True magecraft. And heroic spirits can take form in this world without the help of True magecraft as long as they have a host.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heavens Feel is not a spell that duplicates a soul perceived in the past.</p><p>It&#39;s actually a spell to make an existence of a higher dimension that can take a spirit form and still influence the physical world.</p><p>It takes a soul and elevates it to the next level of life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Next step\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s certainly serious, but...</p><p>Even though the details are different, all True Magics are a way to reach the origin! What does it have to do with the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. First of all, there&#39;s only one administrated land in Japan that can activate a True magecraft.</p><p>I know the ley line in Fuyuki is first-class, but there&#39;s not enough distortion to connect to the origin.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. It&#39;s not distorted enough to reach the origin. That&#39;s why you make a hole. If the path is obstructed, you have to destroy the wall yourself, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Holy Grail War is the process of destroying the wall.</p><p>The process accumulates enough magical energy to grant any wish. But that&#39;s just a secondary matter for the Einzbern family. And it was also an advertisement to call for the Masters, the sacrifices.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Einzberns only needed a giant magecraft circle that could store great amounts of magical energy without attracting the notice of the magecraft Association.</p><p>The head of the Tohsaka family at that time cooperated with them.</p><p>This country doesn&#39;t receive much attention from the Association, and there aren&#39;t many first-class lands that rank next to Aozaki&#39;s land.</p><p>Fuyuki City was almost the perfect test site, meeting all the requirements.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You should be able to figure out the rest.</p><p>There are two kinds of Holy Grails that govern the Holy Grail War.</p><p>The Holy Grail in this land and the Holy Grail Einzbern prepares.</p><p>The former is a magecraft circle that uses the land administrated by Tohsaka.</p><p>This is called the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>The key that the Einzbern family prepares for each ritual is called the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Great Holy Grail administers the system of the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail collects the souls of the defeated heroic spirits and acts as the reactor core to activate the Great Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And once the Holy Grail collects enough souls to activate the Great Holy Grail, it uses the heroic spirits&#39; souls to open a hole.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail fixes the small hole created when the heroic spirits return to their original place after their roles are fulfilled. This opens up the passage to the origin that humans cannot reach.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course, this is just the first step. Your wish isn&#39;t granted even if the hole is opened. The path to the origin is too far.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But\u2015\u2015\u2015the one who obtains the Holy Grail gains access to unlimited magical energy.</p><p>The other side has large quantities of unused magical energy unlike anything seen on this side. For an ordinary magus, it&#39;s nothing short of a miracle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So the Great Holy Grail is the magecraft circle which serves as the foundation, and the Holy Grail is the key to activate it.</p><p>The Holy Grail Wars must occur on a sixty-year cycle to accumulate enough magical energy to summon the heroic spirits.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no way you can carry out such a summoning with one person&#39;s magical energy.</p><p>The Great Holy Grail draws magical energy from the land slowly so as not to deplete it, and once it&#39;s full\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, it summons the heroic spirits as Servants.</p><p>But you need an incentive to summon the heroic spirits. They won&#39;t heed your call unless you give them what they want.</p><p>That&#39;s why the Holy Grail was prepared to reward them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that&#39;s a deception from the start.</p><p>The Einzberns just wanted the souls of the heroic spirits.</p><p>They didn&#39;t care about their rank. They just wanted strong souls.</p><p>To hide that fact, they created the Holy Grail War as a cover. They deceived the Servants and Masters and made them kill each other.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I guess that started from the second ritual.</p><p>The first was conducted in a foolishly honest manner and failed right away because the three families fought for its exclusive right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So the rule was made starting with the second ritual.</p><p>\u0320 Outsiders were called and made to fight for the Holy Grail.</p><p>Masters from outside the families were just an inconvenience after the Servants had been summoned, so it more efficient to have them killed in battle.</p><p>It was convenient for the three families because they could legitimately kill their collaborators.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Unbelievable. So the rule for Masters to kill each other exists because they couldn&#39;t decide who gets the ownership by talking and had to resort to violence?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup. But choosing the last magus standing proved to be an even better method than expected.</p><p>It&#39;s just like you. There were Servants and Masters that found out they were tricked, but it seems they didn&#39;t care. It&#39;s because you obtain the Holy Grail if you win.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s convinced.</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>...In short, the Holy Grail War is not a battle to obtain the Holy Grail, but a ritual to escape to the outside world.</p><hr><p>Attempts to reach the outside world.</p><p>According to hermeticism, there&#39;s a power that governs dimensional theory outside of this world.</p><p>It&#39;s called the &#39;swirl of the origin&#39;, and it&#39;s a coordinate that&#39;s considered to be the beginning of all things.</p><p>It&#39;s the start and the end of all creation. It&#39;s the seat of God, recording everything and able to create anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>But I really don&#39;t care about that.</p><p>My father would&#39;ve understood what a big deal it is, but it doesn&#39;t concern me.</p><p>What&#39;s possessing Sakura is much more important to me than how it all started.</p><hr><p>&quot;Illya. I don&#39;t care about the real purpose of the war. It has nothing to do with us, just like you said.</p><p>More importantly, tell us about the thing you mentioned earlier.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It has nothing to do with us!? We&#39;re talking about True magecraft here! And the Third True magecraft at that! It&#39;s the taboo out of all taboos that&#39;s been kept a secret even within the association!</p><p>If you&#39;re a magus, you can&#39;t ignore something like this\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can. ...Man, why do you have the wrong idea, Tohsaka?</p><p>This isn&#39;t the time to be talking about something that can&#39;t succeed anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;C-Can&#39;t succeed? What are you basing that on?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. I don&#39;t know why, but the Holy Grail War has never had a victor. That means there&#39;s something wrong with the ritual.</p><p>...First of all, how will you explain what&#39;s happening to Sakura? If the Holy Grail&#39;s a path to reach True magecraft, does that mean Sakura&#39;s like that because of True magecraft?&quot;</p><p>Maybe I convinced her, because she shuts her mouth.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, Illya. Why did the Holy Grail War turn out like this?</p><p>Kotomine said there&#39;s something in the Holy Grail.</p><p>So is this that Avenger thing? And he&#39;s not in the Holy Grail, Sakura or Illya, but in the magecraft circle you called the Great Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Kotomine would know, wouldn&#39;t he?</p><p>He&#39;s a magus tainted by Avenger, just like Sakura. He already knows what&#39;s inside the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh...? Kotomine and Sakura are the same...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. This concerns you two.</p><p>This is about what Zouken&#39;s trying to obtain, what&#39;s changing Sakura, what&#39;s hiding in the Holy Grail, and what&#39;s tainting the souls of the heroic spirits.</p><p>Its class name is Avenger.</p><p>The heroic spirit that&#39;s about to take a living form through the power of the Holy Grail, a successful example of the Third True magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...What? What was all that about True Magics not having to do with this? It does concern them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Avenger&#39;s materialization isn&#39;t True magecraft carried out by the Holy Grail. From the start, it is a heroic spirit with that specific attribute.</p><p>It can take form within the Holy Grail because it&#39;s Avenger.</p><p>The Holy Grail merely summoned an avenger that can use the Third True magecraft, so it doesn&#39;t mean that the Great Holy Grail used the Third True magecraft.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? So in short, it&#39;s a monster that can materialize?</p><p>It&#39;s someone who can embody the Third True magecraft even if the Great Holy Grail doesn&#39;t?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It all started during the third ritual.</p><p>The first one was a failure. Einzbern was defeated quickly in the second war, and in desperation, they summoned a spirit that specialized in killing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They used an old scripture, a foreign folklore they obtained, as catalyst to summon the worst evil possible.</p><p>They summoned what they shouldn&#39;t have summoned to kill all the other Masters, to activate the Great Holy Grail, and to keep all the achievement to themselves.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The spirit&#39;s name is Angra Manyu.</p><p>A murderous anti-hero that embodies every curse in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Angra... Manyu?&quot;</p><p>...Hold on.</p><p>Angra Manyu is the name of the ancient Persian devil.</p><p>It&#39;s the embodiment of evil, the greatest devil in Zoroastrianism. It fights a nine-thousand-year battle againts Ahura Mazda, protector of human goodness.</p><p>Zoroastrianism is a story mainly about the battle between these two gods. It&#39;s the first religion to come up with the doctrine of duality, the angels and the devil.</p><hr><p>But the story contains no hero named Angra Manyu.</p><p>First of all, how can someone crowned with the name of the king of devils become a heroic spirit?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not possible, Illya. The Holy Grail can only call on heroic spirits, and you don&#39;t need the Holy Grail if you can reproduce phenomena on the divine spirit level.</p><p>No, first of all, there can&#39;t be a heroic spirit with the name Angra Manyu. Even if there was, it would be a nameless evil spirit that left no mark on history. Even if it were summoned, its soul wouldn&#39;t be compatible with the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Illya. What did the Einzberns&#39; Master summon?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I said Angra Manyu, Rin.</p><p>...He was certainly nameless, and not a devil. But a hero with the name Angra Manyu did exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, the story takes place a long time ago. Insanely long ago, in a very small world.</p><p>It was a hero that lived in a small, nameless village that practiced Zoroastrianism.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how distorted their doctrine was.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what led them to that idea.</p><p>But they lived cleanly and righteously in accordance with their precepts.</p><p>People are supposed to value goodness, protect the light, and live virtuous lives.</p><p>For these people, segregated from the rest of the world, this supplication was absolute. It was probably the only source of human pride that they knew.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>The people in the village earnestly wished for everyone to live in peace.</p><p>So everyone could be free from malice and live pure, upright lives.</p><p>They renounced such human concerns as hunger, conflict, love, and hate. They were proud to be worthy of God&#39;s blessing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But it was impossible.</p><p>People can&#39;t be freed from malice just through clean, righteous living.</p><p>From the moment we are born, there is evil in us. You must take certain measures if you want to separate evil from yourself.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015those measures were taken.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;They came up with a way to save not just their small village, but the whole world.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to make everyone do good.</p><p>But you can prove everyone&#39;s goodness.</p><p>...You just need one person.</p><p>If one person embodies all the evils of the world, the rest of the people cannot be evil, no matter what.</p><p>They seriously believed in such a simple, child-like theory.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And one young man was chosen as a sacrifice.</p><p>They captured him, carved every cursed word onto his body, forced every sin imaginable upon him, and held him responsible for all evils in the world.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>A small world. But an ultimate evil was born in this one complete world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The people cursed, scorned, feared, yet adored this man.</p><p>They believed they were pure and righteous, since all the world&#39;s evil was within him.</p><p>They seriously believed it&#39;d save everyone in the world and created a devil.</p><p>To demonstrate human goodness, they continuously tortured one man until he went insane. No, they would not allow him to die until he succumbed to old age.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The name of the devil that corrupts men.</p><p>He was given the name Angra Manyu, and was irrationally hated by everyone in the world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if he really did turn into a devil during the process.</p><p>But everyone in his village believed him to be so, and they treated him accordingly. They hated and feared him, but he was the proof of their goodness. They revered him as the sign of their salvation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He was the object of everyone&#39;s hate, but he saved people.</p><p>His existence pardoned everyone of their evil deeds.</p><p>Though his method was unusual, he still saved people.</p><p>He became a hero for the villagers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And a hero was born.</p><p>Hated by people, losing his self... Someone who transformed into exactly what they wanted. A helpless sacrifice that came to represent all the world&#39;s evil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s the anti-hero Angra Manyu.</p><p>An ordinary person without any special talent that was determined to be all evils of the world.</p><p>The king of devils that approves of all six billion evils in Zoroastrianism. He&#39;s a curse made by a concept of ancient people.&quot;</p><hr><p>Illya finishes her story with no sign of bitterness or contempt.</p><p>...Anti-hero.</p><p>Kotomine introduced me to the term when the war started.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>...But.</p><p>If Illya&#39;s story is true, the guy who turned into Angra Manyu is still burdened with all the sins.</p><p>It&#39;s because that&#39;s his reason of existence.</p><hr><p>A heroic spirit who&#39;s had six billion sins pushed onto him.</p><p>...If a guy like that is summoned, all that&#39;ll happen is a big massacre.</p><p>It&#39;d only be natural for him to hate people, and first of all, everyone around him established him to be evil.</p><hr><p>...Angra Manyu.</p><p>So the man is using Sakura to take revenge on the people... no, to carry out the role people pushed onto him?</p><hr><p>&quot;So I understand the story of Avenger... Angra Manyu.</p><p>But why is he in the Holy Grail? He&#39;s just an ordinary person, right? Even if he&#39;s given a devil&#39;s name and treated like one, he&#39;s still just a human.</p><p>That wouldn&#39;t turn him into a monster capable of eating the entire town.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Angra Manyu is human. He was just an ordinary man, but was forced to become a heroic spirit. So there wasn&#39;t any problem, originally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The Einzbern family summoned Angra Manyu in the third war.</p><p>But the summoned heroic spirit was weak.</p><p>The anti-hero was defeated in the early stage of the war, and the Holy Grail took him in. The Master of Einzbern grieved how this ordinary human could be a devil that destroys the human world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. The heroic spirit was merely human.</p><p>A human that cursed the world.</p><p>A human who everyone wanted to represent their evil.</p><p>...So he had no power. He was merely constructed by the people around him.</p><p>But everything reversed the instant he was taken in by the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The Holy Grail grants wishes.</p><p>When defeated, Servants are reduced to raw magical energy and are taken in by the Holy Grail to await their release. They lose their individual personalities and stay in the Holy Grail as an omnipotent power.</p><p>But Angra Manyu was different. He was a heroic spirit that others wished for. He was intended to be evil, regardless of his personality.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No way. Could he...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The Holy Grail grants every wish.</p><p>He was a mere human, but wasn&#39;t treated as one. So he was an embodiment of people&#39;s wishes.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015the instant Angra Manyu was taken in by the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail accepted a wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;An existence that should not be.</p><p>The heroic spirit constructed from people&#39;s selfish wishes was finally given flesh within the wish-granting Holy Grail.</p><p>...Five hundred years under the Makiri and a thousand under the Einzbern are nothing.</p><p>After all, he&#39;s an ideal human that has been wished for since the age of gods, over two thousand years ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s what that shadow is. It finally obtained form as a heroic spirit.</p><p>Angra Manyu used Servants&#39; colorless magical energy to embody all evils of the world.</p><p>Wanting only to be evil.</p><p>It slowly matured with an ability to curse all six billion people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Then what? The contents of the Holy Grail have already been tainted by him? The wish the Holy Grail grants is already determined, and the fourth war took place only to store up the magical energy needed to give him form?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I don&#39;t know how much Kiritsugu knew about Angra Manyu.</p><p>But believing the shadow leaking from it to be dangerous, he destroyed the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And his course of action was right.</p><p>No matter what the previous Angra Manyu was, the Angra Manyu that formed inside the Holy Grail is real. It will become the greatest evil in the world, a devil that will kill every human being alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But thanks to Kiritsugu&#39;s resolve, Angra Manyu was left unborn within the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>Kotomine and Sakura received parts of it.</p><p>Zouken must&#39;ve known that a Servant was about to be born in the Holy Grail.</p><p>That&#39;s why he implanted a piece of it in Sakura, creating a link between her and that Servant.</p><p>He made Sakura a Master so that she can control the Servant once it emerges.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No matter what Avenger is, it&#39;s still a Servant. No Servant, no matter how strong, can disobey his Master.</p><p>That&#39;s Zouken&#39;s plan. He wants to use Sakura to obtain Angra Manyu.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on.</p><p>Does that mean Sakura has a contract with this Servant, Avenger?</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you serious? Even if Sakura controls Angra Manyu that way, she can&#39;t resist the taint of the magical energy.</p><p>She&#39;s already changed that much when Angra Manyu is still inside the Holy Grail, so her personality will disappear completely once it comes out. Then being a Master won&#39;t matter.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s fine. Zouken isn&#39;t worried about Sakura&#39;s personality. What matters to him is her body and its connection to Angra Manyu.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s planning to take over her empty body after her personality disappears.</p><p>...I don&#39;t think you know, but Zouken can take over anyone&#39;s body as long as the worm bearing his soul exists. That&#39;s how he stayed alive until now.</p><p>From the start, Sakura was just a body to eventually possess.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then what?</p><p>The thing possessing Sakura.</p><p>If what&#39;s changing her is a contract with a Servant\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Zouken kidnapped me, probably because he didn&#39;t want to let Sakura open the gate.</p><p>He wanted me to take the role of the Holy Grail, allowing him to take over Sakura&#39;s body once she became Angra Manyu&#39;s Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess he plans to take over Angra Manyu in time, since a soul given flesh is a living example of the Third True magecraft. It&#39;s like speaking ill of a perfect God because you&#39;re a human with desires.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......The definition of God&#39;s creation... It&#39;s something that&#39;s made from people&#39;s wishes, but not affected by people&#39;s intentions.</p><p>Well, I bet any god will turn into a devil if it reflects Zouken&#39;s personality. That must be why Kotomine considered him his enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I get it. That&#39;s enough, right, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice brings me back to the present.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not &#39;huh&#39;. We know our enemy, and we know Zouken&#39;s intention. Then we don&#39;t even need to talk about the rest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...We don&#39;t even need to talk about the rest, huh?</p><p>She&#39;s right.</p><p>What&#39;s in the Holy Grail.</p><p>The disaster from ten years ago will be repeated if he comes out.</p><hr><p>...No, that&#39;s an understatement.</p><p>He&#39;ll kill countless people if we let him be.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s creation will take many lives.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that.</p><p>Then I have to stop it.</p><p>I have to make whatever sacrifices I can to keep Sakura from being burdened with more deaths.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Stop Angra Manyu.</p><p>I have to end the war before he emerges from the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess you understand now. We have to fight and win.</p><p>And there are only two ways to do this.</p><p>Kill Sakura, Angra Manyu&#39;s Master, before he comes out. Or destroy the Great Holy Grail before he comes out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The former&#39;s the more certain method.</p><p>Sakura and Zouken will surely get in our way if we try to destroy the Great Holy Grail. We won&#39;t be able to do it without defeating them.</p><p>So it&#39;s easiest to defeat Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Fight Sakura and separate her from Angra Manyu. That&#39;s the easiest way, and the plan&#39;s easy to understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. You have no problem with going after her?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s the only thing we can manage right now. If Angra Manyu is what Illya says it is, it&#39;s not something humans can match. We lose the instant it comes out.</p><p>Then we have to take the quickest and surest route.</p><p>More importantly, Tohsaka. I don&#39;t mind fighting, but do you know where Sakura is?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not a problem. If Illya&#39;s right, there&#39;s only one place the Great Holy Grail can be. Right, Illya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes, you&#39;re right, Rin.</p><p>Angra Manyu is about to be born, so Zouken is at the Great Holy Grail.</p><p>The degraded ley line. The origin that was chosen by the three families two hundred years ago. Angra Manyu is being conceived in the large cavern underneath the Ryuudou Temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Under the Ryuudou Temple...&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s where Sakura is.</p><p>That&#39;s where we&#39;ll be heading, the place where the Holy Grail War will end.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath and allow my tense mind to relax slightly.</p><p>The cold pendant in my hand settles my thoughts.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Fighting Sakura.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t lying.</p><p>It&#39;s just that our methods are different.</p><p>Tohsaka must intend to finish the war by killing Sakura.</p><p>But I&#39;ll end the war by saving Sakura&#39;s life\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;.....!?&quot;</p><p>My body trembles.</p><p>The house is beset by pressure, making the air feel like water.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The instant we realize the pressure&#39;s coming from the shadow, we run out into the yard.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-17-separation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-17-separation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 17 Separation</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015We go out into the yard.</p><p>The whole world is covered by the shadow.</p><p>My entire body is numb with fear.</p><hr><p>...The black shadow is standing in front of us.</p><p>It can crush this house if it wants to.</p><p>The difference in our power is obvious.</p><p>It has transfigured to an existence that&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.</p><hr><p>&quot;...............&quot;</p><p>...The black shadow does nothing.</p><p>It&#39;s not Sakura, but a shadow shaped like her.</p><p>The real Sakura is under the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The thing in front of us is a virtual image.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hmph. So you&#39;re sending the shadow instead of showing up yourself? You&#39;ve gotten arrogant during the short time you&#39;ve been away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Does she not hear Tohsaka&#39;s provocation, or does she not hear anything at all?</p><p>Wavering in the moonlight, her shadow looks lonely.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Her eyes look at me.</p><p>&#39;Senpai&#39;.</p><p>Weak, as if she&#39;ll reply like always if I just reach out.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t.</p><p>What I must do is determined.</p><p>I can&#39;t say anything to her, as doing so would weaken my resolve.</p><hr><p>She looks away.</p><p>After hanging her head for a moment,</p><p>&quot;Did you hear the whole story from Illyasviel, Nee-san?&quot;</p><p>She confronts Tohsaka with a cold voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I heard about what&#39;s possessing you and the abilities of what&#39;s about to be born from the Holy Grail.</p><p>So, Sakura. Let me ask. Do you have any intention of cutting ties with Angra Manyu?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s voice is the same.</p><p>Completely cold, showing no concern for Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. I said the weak me disappeared, didn&#39;t I? I was able to obtain this power, so I don&#39;t intend to let it go. I couldn&#39;t even if I wanted to.</p><p>...This is how Matou Sakura has to live from now on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then one more thing.</p><p>How complete is the Servant you&#39;re boasting about? Illya said it&#39;s coming out soon, but what do you have to say as the mother? Is it already born?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Of course not. When that happens, this town will be consumed in a second.</p><p>I can&#39;t allow that yet. Senpai&#39;s still here.</p><p>So I won&#39;t let him out as long as I still exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so there&#39;s no reason for us to hurry, huh? So you&#39;re going to keep Angra Manyu inside as long as Shirou&#39;s with me?</p><p>That&#39;s good, Shirou. Sakura seems well enough.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t be ridiculous. You should know how much longer I&#39;m going to last.</p><p>Please run away with Senpai. I won&#39;t last long. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll disappear. I might only be able to hold out for one night.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So I&#39;m warning you before that.</p><p>...Nee-san. Please take Senpai and run far away. Then I can be at peace and take his life with mine.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura says she&#39;s going to kill him using her life.</p><p>Tohsaka trembles a bit.</p><p>Is that because she believes her, or...</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. You don&#39;t know when you&#39;re going to disappear, huh?</p><p>You&#39;re wrong. You just don&#39;t know when you&#39;ll run out of patience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Nee-san.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to kill Angra Manyu, but you can kill yourself without hesitation if I run away with Shirou?</p><p>You&#39;ll kill the Servant within the Holy Grail along with you, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Y-Yes. So please run away.</p><p>I-I don&#39;t want you to see me change. It&#39;s fine as long as Senpai gets away.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015please don&#39;t come after me anymore, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>She&#39;s desperately begging us.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s shadow can kill us right now, but it asks for salvation by letting us go.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I can&#39;t answer her wish.</p><p>I can&#39;t leave Sakura and run away, nor can I let her kill herself along with Angra Manyu.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll go there. We&#39;ll go and kill you for sure.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka breaks away from her sister.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did you expect? As Tohsaka&#39;s magus, I can&#39;t ignore you. And I can&#39;t believe you even if you say you&#39;ll kill yourself.</p><p>Don&#39;t you get it, Sakura? You&#39;re not making any sense. You want to kill, but you&#39;re telling me to run.</p><p>Geez, you&#39;re trying to act like a good girl because you&#39;re in front of Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, you can make a good face. That&#39;s what you should&#39;ve done from the start.</p><p>So, is that all? Then get lost. You don&#39;t have to hurry since we&#39;ll go see you right away.</p><p>Look, Sakura. I&#39;ll kill you with my own hands.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka declares with voice that even contains kindness.</p><p>...The shadow wavers.</p><p>After freezing on the spot like a statue...</p><p>&quot;Yes\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll be waiting for you, Nee-san.&quot;</p><p>...It smiles violently and disappears.</p><hr><p>The shadow covering the house recedes.</p><p>Tohsaka and I are the only ones remaining in the yard.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I get dizzy.</p><p>I thought I was concentrating, but it seems I was agitated after seeing Sakura&#39;s image.</p><p>...It seems Sakura&#39;s not the only one that&#39;s running out of time.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou.</p><p>You heard what Sakura said. But what&#39;re you going to do?</p><p>If you want to run, I won&#39;t stop you. But if you do, that&#39;ll be after you project the gem sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to confirm with me. I won&#39;t run away, and I&#39;ll somehow project the gem sword.</p><p>We&#39;re cooperating, right? Then I&#39;ll follow up by doing things you can&#39;t do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s good, but do you understand, Shirou?</p><p>Coming with me means killing Sakura. The same goes for the gem sword. You&#39;re going to prepare a weapon that I will use to kill her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. The gem sword thing is contradictory. But Sakura&#39;s out of our control, and projecting the sword is a promise we made. If projecting the sword means we can match Sakura&#39;s shadow, then it&#39;s something we definitely need to do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. So...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m taking the opposite measure. I&#39;m going to end this war by saving Sakura. I&#39;ve decided to be Sakura&#39;s ally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Even if letting Sakura live means killing everyone else?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t know that yet. There should be a way to save Sakura and not let there be any more victims.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know about that. Sakura&#39;s already killed many people. Is it justice for you to save such a person, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Her inquiry is decisive.</p><p>A sin I can&#39;t talk myself out of.</p><p>She puts it into words, and I finally...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll protect her even if she&#39;s not human. I&#39;m going to protect her from everything, including the part of her that wants to kill me.</p><p>That&#39;s all I want to do. That&#39;s what it means to be someone&#39;s ally, right?&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m able to tell her what I think.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Geez. You really can just come out and say it.&quot;</p><p>I nod back, feeling no shame.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. Well, I knew there was no point in arguing with you, but I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d go this far. You beat me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Where are you going, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I have to go prepare for the battle.</p><p>Sakura gave us that warning because she really doesn&#39;t have time to spare. So I have to get ready quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s true, but we were talking\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re done talking now. In short, you&#39;re going to save Sakura as long as you&#39;re still alive, right?</p><p>...Hmph. Fine, do as you want. I&#39;m not going to say anything now. Go struggle to your heart&#39;s content.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...?&quot;</p><p>Where did her nervousness go? Tohsaka looks angry now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t get me wrong. This is in exchange for making the gem sword.</p><p>I&#39;ll leave you in charge of Sakura as long as you&#39;re trying. I won&#39;t do anything until you can&#39;t move anymore.</p><p>...That&#39;s good, right? You might be able to save Sakura, if you try hard enough.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka leaves with that.</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>The uneasiness in my chest goes away.</p><p>We&#39;re thinking oppositely.</p><p>But Tohsaka still wants to save Sakura.</p><hr><p>Then I can entrust her with Sakura.</p><p>We both like her.</p><p>Then Tohsaka should be able to save Sakura.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-18-record-of-the-great-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-18-record-of-the-great-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 18 Record of the Great Holy Grail</h2><p>It&#39;s ten o&#39;clock.</p><p>Tohsaka said we&#39;ll prepare for battle and go to the Ryuudou Temple before the date changes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I&#39;m going to have you project the gem sword, but how do you feel? Can you project it while suppressing Archer&#39;s arm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Illya hasn&#39;t told her how I took the Shroud off.</p><p>&quot;Well\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015um, yeah...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good to hear. Then the rest is up to Shirou and Illya.</p><p>The Azoth Sword, which is as close as we&#39;re going to get to the gem sword, Shirou&#39;s projection, and Illya&#39;s support. We may not be able to replicate it, but if all goes well, we should at least be able to reproduce half of its original ability.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka hands me a dagger.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>The dagger is a ritualistic equipment.</p><p>It might be something she favors, as it looks well-used.</p><p>Not only that. Even an amateur like me can feel how much magical energy is stored in this thing.</p><hr><p>...Well, this is nothing compared to the shadow, but it&#39;s still a hundred times more than my magical energy capacity.</p><hr><p>&quot;...This is amazing. You had something like this up your sleeve?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it&#39;s amazing. I used all the jewels I had, which contained ten years worth of magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka sulks, like she didn&#39;t want to use them.</p><p>...She seems generous, but maybe she&#39;s really stingy when it comes to money.</p><p>Well, with that aside...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, but is that really okay, Tohsaka? You don&#39;t have any left for yourself if you&#39;ve used everything you have, right? I know you&#39;re still not fully recovered, so can you still fight?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I can manage to move around. But I haven&#39;t healed to the point where I can use magecraft again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015then...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry. It&#39;s fine as long as you can project the gem sword. The sword has absurd powers said to have even stopped the &#39;falling moon&#39;.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t get what she means, but Tohsaka has great confidence.</p><p>...Well, if she&#39;s so sure of herself, I won&#39;t worry either.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s start, Shirou. It&#39;ll take a long time to project that sword, even for you. We have to get started or the date&#39;ll change.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. Then let&#39;s go back to your room. If we&#39;re not someplace where you can relax, our chances are lower.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka heads back to the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, hold on. I&#39;ll do the projection in the shed.</p><p>And I want to be alone with Illya while I do it, so can you wait in your room?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? I have to be there in case something happens, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no need. It&#39;s a bother if you&#39;re here.</p><p>Shirou gets distracted easily, so we might fail if you fall and get his attention when it counts the most.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, that&#39;s rude, Illya.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka complains with a sour look.</p><p>She&#39;s not arguing back, maybe because she can&#39;t deny the possibility that she&#39;ll screw up at a crucial moment.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. Then I&#39;ll wait outside the shed. Is that all right, Illya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I guess it can&#39;t be helped. That&#39;s the biggest compromise we can make.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. Don&#39;t come in until I tell you to if you want us to reproduce the gem sword. I&#39;ll call for you if something&#39;s about to happen, so please stay outside until then no matter what.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re being persistent. I said I understand. I won&#39;t come in even if I hear Shirou scream.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t really matter, but I wish she&#39;d picked a better example.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s go, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Illya goes into the shed.</p><p>I decide to ask Tohsaka something before I follow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Can I have this sword?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? You&#39;re going to be projecting using that. The Azoth Sword will go away once the gem sword&#39;s projected.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. You can have the gem sword, so can I have this in return?</p><p>See, this might break if I fail. I can&#39;t concentrate, thinking how you might get angry if I break this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. Fine. You can have the Azoth Sword if that&#39;ll help you relax.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks. Then I&#39;m going to go do my best.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I shut the door.</p><p>I can&#39;t let Tohsaka see this.</p><p>I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t stop me now, but she&#39;ll definitely feel responsible.</p><p>If I&#39;m to smooth this out, I have to tell her I used it after everything is over and get retroactive approval.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Are you ready, Shirou? You&#39;ve released Archer&#39;s arm already, so I don&#39;t need to explain the steps, right?&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Illya tells me to sit down, and I do so.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Illya. I can only project what I&#39;ve seen or what Archer made. I have no information on the gem sword. I can&#39;t project it even if we have a blueprint and a dagger that&#39;s just like it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ll first have you come inside my memory. I haven&#39;t seen it either, but the record of the gem sword is in me.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s great master was there when the Great Holy Grail was made.</p><p>I&#39;m sure the sword was there at that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Whoa, Illya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just close your eyes. I&#39;ll keep your body here and send your mind somewhere else. We did this before. I&#39;ll send your vision into my memory, so analyze the gem sword there.</p><p>...I&#39;ll release your left arm once you&#39;re inside. You&#39;ll be hit by the pressure of two hundred years and the invasion from your arm at the same time. Brace yourself and try to finish the projection as fast as you can.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Illya&#39;s voice is trembling.</p><p>...Her arms are as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll take you to the gem sword, so you just need to hold your breath.

Aren&#39;t you going to get mad like always and call him a wimp?</p><hr><p>This end is peaceful in a way.</p><p>It&#39;s like Saber-chan&#39;s end in &quot;Heavens Feel&quot;.</p><hr><p>Oh. ...Well, Shirou did win against Saber in a one-on-one fight, so I guess he&#39;s satisfied.</p><hr><p>Yup.</p><p>But we&#39;ll carry out this dojo like always.</p><p>So, why did we reach this end, pupil number one!?</p><hr><p>It&#39;s simple! I think it&#39;s because you fought Saber one-on-one! Osu!</p><hr><p>That&#39;s right! I tell you every time to prepare a trump card when going into the final battle, so why don&#39;t you do your best!?</p><hr><p>Master, then what&#39;s the trump card this time?</p><hr><p>An ally!</p><hr><p>Anally? That sounds really funny, master!</p><hr><p>Stop with the jokes!</p><hr><p>To be frank, you need a partner!</p><p>Even in this situation, there should be one Servant who might cooperate with you!</p><hr><p>Convince her somehow before you go into your final battle!</p><hr><p>Okay... But master, she quickly runs away.</p><hr><p>Recall the conversation you had with her before. There&#39;s only one answer. She&#39;ll become your ally if you give her the answer she wants.</p><hr><p>Well, this dojo is over.</p><hr><p>The long battle is about to reach the grand finale!</p><p>Please check out the grand finale of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; with your own eyes!</p><hr><p>Bye!

I understand how much you care for Sakura.</p><p>You&#39;re stopping me now because Sakura will suffer if you let me go, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........Yes. Are you still going to kill Sakura in spite of that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not going to kill her. I&#39;m going to save her.</p><p>Rider. I&#39;m going to protect Sakura until the very end. I&#39;m going to choose Sakura no matter what.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So\u2015\u2015\u2015please lend me your power. Tohsaka and I can&#39;t do this alone.

What do you expect of me, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>What I expect from Rider?</p><p>There&#39;s only one thing.</p><p>Rider&#39;s the only one out of all the Servants that can oppose Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm, Sakura&#39;s strongest card.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I have some questions before that. Can you still use your Noble Phantasm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Sakura still supplies me with magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right, next question. Are Servants still spirits even if they take physical form? So you can&#39;t hurt them with normal weapons?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let&#39;s see. A normal Servant will be able to nullify them, but those consumed by Sakura are another matter.</p><p>Having received bodies from Sakura, they cannot return to spiritual form.</p><p>Strong magical weapons should be able to penetrate through their shadows.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see, then it&#39;s decided. There&#39;s a chance of victory, and the roles are clear.</p><p>Rider. I want you to beat Saber one-on-one. To be specific\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I whisper in her ear.</p><p>...I know nobody&#39;s listening, but I&#39;m just making sure.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. I can definitely penetrate her guard with that.</p><p>It is a pure contest of power. Nothing is left to chance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right? ...Well, if there is a problem...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is your skill and my trust in you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod.</p><p>Rider puts a finger to her mouth, thinking...</p><p>&quot;Fair enough. I shall trust you and accept you as my temporary master.&quot;</p><p>...And agrees with a smile that takes me by surprise.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-28-goodbye-thank-you" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-28-goodbye-thank-you" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 28 Goodbye, thank you</h2><p>The clock strikes midnight.</p><p>It&#39;s twelve o&#39;clock, the promised time.</p><hr><p>I wrap the Azoth sword with cloth and tuck it under my arm.</p><p>This is my only weapon.
