It is better to say that her personality is light than cheerful. She is, admitted by everyon and herself, a Gal-type Servant who uses modern language, enthusiastic. Sometimes a variety of katakana and beyond understanding remarks pops out of her mouth, but the root is a freedom god realist. She is quite mean and wicked tongue, that some can even say &quot;What an evil soul&quot;, &quot;lustful soul, how evil&quot; etc. However she acts completely opposite when it comes to Master and Servant relationship.</p><p>She is Divine Spirit class, pretty much a God. She is a personality of Japanese mythology&#39;s Amaterasu, when she came out of Izumo once she saw humans worship her, got interested and incarnated as a human girl. Then she forgot everything, grown up beautifully, fell in love with the Emperor, but got her identity revealed by an Onmyouji and had to run away, eventually she was subdued.</p><p>If her spiritual rank is increased to the max, she would become an existence of scale that humans cannot fully comprehend. Her true name was quickly revealed, but she is not interested in the Holy Grail War. She also has different viewpoint regarding the world and is a cheat character who is distinctively different from other Heroic Spirits.</p><p>However, since she lowered her spiritual rank to mimic human and became a Heroic Spirit that way, she cannot demonstrate her original power. However, in the case she is recreated as an evil spirit, an Aramitama, the number of tails will increase and at 9 she will transform into a great metamorphosis who can easily defeat 100 heroes. However, her true nature is a dreamy girl who yearned for humans, but chased by her love ones, forced to separate from who she loved, betrayed by humans, driven to fear, cornered and subjugated.</p><p>(TL Note: The Aramitama part is new. In original Extra it only mentioned evil spirit. Aramitama is the violent soul of a god, in this case Amaterasu Aramitama is enshrined in the Ise Grand Shrine together with her good soul - the Nigimitama.)</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Despite experiencing bad humans first hand, she still wish to \u201Cdevote to a human\u201D.
