That seems pretty vague.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha! Look at you, pointing things out and questioning them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Allow me to rephrase. We&#39;ve detected a hostile signal we believe manifested from a residual Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Basically we found an army of Shadow Servants and want you to get rid of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a rather...large army.<br> So far we count about two thousand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Two thousand!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a lot!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;d think that.<br> But the number is a little bit deceptive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They are weak. Exceptionally weak.<br> Even I could defeat one of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;d need a rocket launcher fortified by magecraft to do it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway...these weak Servants are piling up like someone&#39;s getting rid of them wholesale.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And that&#39;s putting a bit of strain on Sheba, since it observes the density of Spirit Origins as well as number.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even though the Servants are quite weak individually,<br> the sheer number of them can cause problems.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And that can lead to observational errors in critical Singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like you to head there and eliminate these Shadow Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave choosing the team to you. Actually, all you have to do is to Rayshift to the location and summon your Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Servants should be able to handle these enemies without much direction from you, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So where&#39;re we going?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be Rayshifting somewhere you&#39;re quite familiar with, actually.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s Singularity X. I want you to go back to the Flame Contaminated City, Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You there, [\u2642 mister /\u2640\uFE0F miss}. Yeah, you, Master...the one changing into a Mystic Code and getting all pumped up.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I heard everything. You&#39;re gonna go and get rid of the bug that popped up in Fuyuki, right?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha. I&#39;ll let you in on a secret: that was my bad. So I wouldn&#39;t mind lending you a hand to straighten this little mess out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And you are...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Did we have a Servant like him...?)</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Hey! What&#39;re you lookin&#39; at me like a freakin&#39;<br> dumbass for? It&#39;s me! Me! MEEE!!!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s just great. All that hard work finally melted your damn brain, huh?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Can&#39;t remember names and faces anymore? Means you&#39;re losin&#39; your marbles. Better rethink your whole way of living your weird damn life!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Startin&#39; to show signs you&#39;re getting past your limits, so you better cut back on your workload or start getting your affairs in order before it&#39;s too late!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not THAT tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re that Avenger...</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;m the Servant who contracted with you without you knowing or wanting me to. I&#39;m the third-rate Servant whose origins are...uh...vague.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Normally I just kinda peek into the outside world from Chaldea, but I hadda call you this time &#39;cause it&#39;s got something to do with me.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to Fuyuki, right?<br> I&#39;m coming with. You can count on me. Heh.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> See, this&#39;ll be my turn to SHINE!<br> Why? Cuz these enemies are all WEAK AS SHIT!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Heh heh. As one weak-ass Servant, this&#39;ll be my one and only chance to up my kill count.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> So, hey, hold off on calling all the other Servants.<br> You know, the ones who aren&#39;t weak.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> They get PLENTY of opportunities to look good.<br> This is MY time to shine!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> So let&#39;s DO this! Just you and me!<br> Let&#39;s go fix the Doctor&#39;s mess for him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...would prefer not to? (Taking Mash...)</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh hey, thanks for the vote of confidence, dick!<br> I&#39;m not gonna let this go! I&#39;m the man for the job here!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Also, probably not a great idea to bring Ms. Demi-Servant along.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> That little biddy can only fight stuff that&#39;s as strong as or stronger than her.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> And even if there&#39;s gonna come a time for her to lay the smackdown on something weaker than her, this probably isn&#39;t really the time for that.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Aaand I think that&#39;s a nice, cryptic note to leave off on, so I&#39;mma hog all these enemies to myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Right, right!? The ones who&#39;re quick on the uptake always have an advantage, Master!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> &#39;Course it&#39;s not really a good thing to be so damn gullible, either. But let&#39;s just say that&#39;s gonna be a lesson dearly bought for you!</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Anyways, let&#39;s get to Fuyuki. You know how it goes: travels make for trials, and you never really gain anything without painstaking effort!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. With me around, this&#39;ll all be over in a heartbeat! Won&#39;t even have to go searching around the flaming city!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Those things are gonna SWARM all over me!<br> The moment we Rayshift there, it&#39;ll be freakin&#39; pandemonium!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> And, Master, it&#39;d be great if you&#39;d just sorta stand back and watch the carnage and look all grossed out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s DO this! No more hesitating!<br> Let&#39;s go straight to hell, Master!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna show you a real, all-out fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Okay! Murderify this last irritating jerk and...victory!<br> This city...is clean!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;re you griping about, Master?<br> Not good enough? Frustrated?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Actually...what was that black thing...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh. That&#39;s me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Say what now?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh crap...I mean, it&#39;s like a...uh...a metaphor.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Those were all nameless things.<br> Failures, losers, wastes of flesh...a mob of the fallen.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> They&#39;re a bunch of idiots who only want to drag you down.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> They&#39;re not out to do right for the world. They don&#39;t want to change the world. All they have is a grudge that is burned into their very being...an instinct that compels them to kill humans.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let it bother you. Think of this as a bonus game, like some freaky whack-a-mole thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What kind of hero was A\u014Bra Mainiiu?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Not a hero at all, actually! That&#39;s originally the name of the devil! Didn&#39;t you know?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But after a bunch of shenanigans, I ended up with a big fancy name and getup, and here I am!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> The only thing that&#39;s crystal clear is that I&#39;m an Avenger.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> The opposite of a hero...an Anti-Hero who allows the hero to shine. A literal and figurative punching bag who was born from multitudinous blasphemies.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> That powerful resentment never fades...and spirits harboring those feelings even after their deaths are what makes an Avenger.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But then again, I don&#39;t have any specific grudges, though there are plenty of folks who&#39;re really harboring grudges against me...</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, just to be clear, it&#39;s not about revenge, but avenging. I just want to make that clear so you get the distinction.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> So...that&#39;s what makes my position as a Servant a bit odd compared to anyone else.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I&#39;d probably not normally be able to be a part of your story.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> If this were a movie,<br> I&#39;d just be an extra in the background.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> I have neither a role nor a story, and even if I had, that story is long since over.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Even so, this whole mess was a result of my own carelessness.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> That black thing we just saw was an entity that failed to become a part of me. It looked like it didn&#39;t die off completely.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> So I did the admirable thing and offered to clean up this mess myself!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Honestly, I know it&#39;s a part of me, but how powerful of a grudge could the thing have!? There&#39;s nobody left in this city to kill!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really don&#39;t seem like a Heroic Spirit who&#39;d terrorize like that...</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Huh? What are you talking about? I AM terrifying. If I had the opportunity, I would kill you and have my way with you, maybe even in that order.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> No matter how much we get along, any Avenger would slip a knife between your ribs the moment you turn your back on them!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> ...Well, okay, some of the others might go about it a little differently...like that newbie wearing the black coat. Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some variance.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t anyone teach you what an Avenger is and how to recognize one?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Those born from hatred speak of love... /and they would show compassion after experiencing cruelty...</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Those born from love speak of hatred. /Those who experienced happiness meet their end through betrayal.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Avengers are usually one of those two. It&#39;s just the difference of whether they scorn love, or if they burn with pure hatred.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> But what both of them have in common is that they have an attachment to humans. Ever hear that the opposite of love is indifference?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> The moment it clings to humans, it loses all chance at becoming something more than human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying that they&#39;re ultimately the same as people?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s meaningless hatred?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Yeah, exactly! It&#39;s an endless cycle of<br> \u201Cwhat goes around comes around!\u201D You&#39;re pretty quick!</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s go back. No sense hanging around this hellhole any longer than we have to.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Once we return to Chaldea, I&#39;ll get back to hiding like the worthless Servant I am, so don&#39;t bother summoning me, okay?</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> And you take care of reporting back to the Doctor.<br> I can&#39;t stand the guy.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> Oh and one more thing...</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> This is just a little something to say thank you for being the oddball you are.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong><br> And maybe we should leave this place as is. Maybe take care of it once the other seven Singularities are done.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good work, Fujimaru.<br> Thanks to you, the strain on Sheba&#39;s been sorted out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But you got back a lot faster than expected.<br> Which Servant did you take along?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Avenger.<br> A\u014Bra Mainiiu, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never talked to him, but I&#39;ve been interested in him. He&#39;s the evil god of Zoroastrianism, you see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But based on your story, that Servant isn&#39;t really A\u014Bra Mainiiu itself. No, he sounds like someone who had the role foisted on him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Regardless, he was obviously helpful in resolving this. I&#39;ll go and thank him later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So those Shadow Servants were linked to A\u014Bra Mainiiu, huh? No wonder they were similar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, yeah...I was collecting data on my end, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What I found was that the Shadow Servants you defeated had Spirit Origins very similar to A\u014Bra Mainiiu&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m speculating here, but that A\u014Bra Mainiiu you had with you has a dormant skill that lets him keep going even after he&#39;s been killed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Think of it like a sort of reset button.<br> I&#39;m certain it only works within Fuyuki, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He has a special ability that allows him to fight well beyond his own body&#39;s limitations. However, he&#39;s so out of control when using it that it ends up killing him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, should this \u201CAnnihilation Wish\u201D be used not to destroy himself, but for some other purpose...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well...he may be able to somehow escape that endless loop of dying again and again that he&#39;s trapped himself within.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And all this time, he&#39;ll be cursed by the endless mass of his own corpses that he&#39;s left behind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, it&#39;s...very unlikely he would ever encounter someone who could give him such an opportunity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Because you know, he&#39;s really just kind of a worthless, cowardly jerk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So to make a Heroic Spirit like him turn optimist?<br> Well, that&#39;d take a saint or something!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe he encountered a plain old human...just an awkward sort of person who couldn&#39;t leave a Servant like him alone.</p>', 166);
