Enjoy!)</p><p>Fate/Grand Order\u2019s seven-part story has finally reached the second half. Kinoko Nasu shall reveal his thoughts on FGO, from the game\u2019s launch, to future developments, and even core secrets within the Fate/ universe!</p><p><strong>A Deep-Seated Mystery of the Fate/ Universe Revealed by FGO</strong></p><p>Fate/Grand Order has finally reached its fifth chapter. Let\u2019s start this interview with a basic question. What are your thoughts on FGO, having played it since the start?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> First of all, it\u2019s simply a lot of fun. At the same time, I would think, \u201Chey, this would be better if it were done this way\u201D at several places. There are a lot of parts that clearly needed more work, but put another way, it\u2019s very obvious where the game needs more improvement, so I\u2019m confident that if those problems were hammered out one by one, it\u2019ll be a lot more fun to play. As both creator and player, it\u2019s a lot more fun when there are a lot of areas to improve on, and I get happy seeing my work get closer and closer to the image I had in my mind. I think that FGO always has that feeling of expectation. I also think, \u201COh, I like this character\u2019s animation,\u201D or \u201CI like messing around with this Servant\u201D. [laughs]</p><p>Why did you make FGO a story where you get to travel to many different eras?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I wanted players to experience world history in the form of a game. Before we got to where we are now, the world had undergone a lot of eras, and within those eras were revolutions and breakthroughs. If those revolutions and breakthroughs never happened, humanity as we know it today wouldn\u2019t exist. I wanted to make FGO a stepping stone for people to realize that. World history becomes a lot more interesting the more you learn about it, and I think the story up to Chapter 4 has done a great job in showing that.</p><p>The eras up to Chapter 4 were chosen because they were periods of advancement for the human race, weren\u2019t they?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Yes. Of course, I picked the eras so they could be as fantastically \u201CFate/\u201D as possible, but they\u2019re basically all periods where \u201Cif these didn\u2019t happen, history would look completely different.\u201D Everything up to Chapter 4 was written to feel as if we\u2019re \u201Ctracing the journey of humanity up to now.\u201D On the other hand, from Chapter 5 on, it\u2019ll start to feel like \u201Cthe real FGO starts here,\u201D and the fantasy elements start becoming stronger. Chapter 6 and 7 will just be plain \u201Cthe world is in a huge crisis!\u201D [laughs]</p><p>From the start of the planning phase, I thought, \u201CFGO has to be this grand story where every single character from all the Fate/ series until now would show up, or else it would be pointless.\u201D</p><p>The release of Chapter 4 at the end of last year came as a shock to fans as it touched upon a core question of the \u201CFate/\u201D series, that question being, \u201Cwhat exactly is a Servant?\u201D How did you decide to slip in this very important piece of lore into the story?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> From the start of the planning phase, I thought, \u201CFGO has to be this grand story where every single character from all the Fate/ series until now would show up, or else it would be pointless.\u201D To put it extremely, \u201Ceven if I die, I have to pass this on to the next person\u2026 Actually, I should just pour all of my wealth and assets into this\u201D \u2013 that was how I felt, so I had to put in everything up until the core setting of the Fate/ universe. So I brought out the very first setting that I made way before Fate/stay night, the one that was supposed to be Fate/Prototype, and used it as the core of FGO. Fortunately I had already slipped in hints in many different places as to what Heroic Spirits are, so the reveal at the end of Chapter 4 is something that should\u2019ve come naturally.</p><p>It\u2019s a setting that\u2019s different from all the Holy Grail Wars until now, that Heroic Spirits exist to prevent the destruction of humanity.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Yes. I wanted to put the question \u201Cwhat is the Hero Summoning System, even?\u201D as the centerpiece, something that would be revealed right at the middle of the story. By doing that, I hope to get the people who think that FGO is just a fanservice game for the Fate/ franchise to feel that this is a cool game, that this is an honest-to-goodness Fate/ title. That\u2019s why I absolutely wanted to get everyone to play Chapter 4 before the year 2015 ended.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it very troublesome to have Chapter 4 released before the end of the year?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> It was, but it was something that I definitely wouldn\u2019t have budged on. It was something like the Grand Order of Kinoko Nasu. I wanted everything up to Chapter 4 released by the end of the year no matter what. If I didn\u2019t, FGO would be just another Fate/ spin-off. I wanted all the Fate/ fans out there to say \u201CIf this is how it\u2019ll be, I\u2019m satisfied\u201D within the year this game came out.</p><p>Is there some deeper meaning to the \u201CGrand Order\u201D in the title that will be revealed later on?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> \u201CGrand Order\u201D is exactly what it says \u2013 there\u2019s no deeper meaning other than \u201Cthe greatest command given to Magi\u201D that\u2019s been talked about up until now. It\u2019s the first command given to the first ever Magus, a duty that must be kept by all Magi.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nUeDtK0.jpg" alt=""></p><p>At the end of Chapter 4, Solomon shows up as the mastermind behind all of FGO and introduced himself as \u201CGrand Caster\u201D. Would it be right to say that there are other \u201CGrand\u201D Classes out there?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Of course. Part of the fun is having everyone try to guess who the remaining six Grand Classes are.</p><p>I see. When speculating on the nature of the Fate/ setting, I think I\u2019d like to consider the bigger whole that is the TYPE-MOON multiverse. For example, when talking about a being that will lead the humanity to destruction, it\u2019s easy to think of Primate Murder [1], so does this mean that it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors [2] come into the story?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Ahh\u2026 [laughs] The only thing I can say right now is \u201Cit\u2019ll happen when it happens\u201D. Originally, TYPE-MOON fantasy is supposed to be \u201Cthe story of a person or a city,\u201D and doesn\u2019t involve large-scale stories. I would even say I was trying to avoid \u201Cepics,\u201D since I was writing based on fantasy tales [3] from the 80s and 90s. That being said, FGO is no longer the story of an individual, but a story that can easily reach the scale of the entire world. So it wouldn\u2019t be strange at all to bring out Primate Murder. Throughout all the settings, there are a lot of things where I\u2019d think, \u201CI can\u2019t bring this into the story. That would be like bringing in Godzilla!\u201D but if it\u2019s FGO, it\u2019s not out of the question. So if the time is right, even the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors might show up.</p><p>By bringing in something as huge as \u201Cthe core of the Fate/ universe\u201D into a mobile game, do you foresee huge troubles that haven\u2019t shown up before?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Before the game was launched, the scenario up to Chapter 7 had already been completed, but at that point, none of us knew what kind of game FGO was going to be. For mobile games, it\u2019s common sense to think, \u201CNo one would read a scenario this huge,\u201D and there were people in the staff who thought that. But after the launch, we found out that players were actually reading and enjoying the story. So from Chapter 5 on, we adjusted the game balance so that, between every battle, it would be okay to have nothing but conversations for 10 minutes. In a sense, it\u2019s a bit of a relief for us on the scenario writer side.</p><p>For the scenario writers, was it unexpected for mobile game players to actually read and enjoy the story?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> It was. For a mobile game, we were expecting that players would be skipping the story, and that there\u2019s nothing we could do about that. But to write a good story is something where the creator\u2019s pride, the scenario writer\u2019s honor is at stake. To write a story also means to write something that we could be proud of. By putting that in mind, even if no one ends up reading it, each writer would put out something that they would be satisfied with. Actually, up until Chapter 4 I had been supervising the scenario, but I was planning to leave the scenario from Chapter 5 onward to the writers, except for the parts where Chaldea was involved. From Chapter 5 on, Higashide and Sakurai had already grasped \u201Ctheir own way of getting along with FGO.\u201D To be honest, from there, I was thinking, \u201Cthis is a new Fate/ story, so it\u2019s okay even if it no longer feels very \u2018Fate/\u2019, right?\u201D But everyone was earnestly reading the story, and they all feel that it\u2019s still a \u2018Fate/\u2019 game. The response to Chapter 1 was so huge that I said, \u201CI\u2019m sorry, please let me supervise Chapter 5 onwards too!\u201D</p><p>So, for the sake of the players who read the entire story up to Chapter 4, you wanted to put in more effort from Chapter 5 onwards?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Yes. I think it\u2019s a huge thing for me that all the fans who have loved TYPE-MOON over these 15 years are also enjoying FGO. I have this renewed feeling of wanting to write more for the people who love the stories we make, and it\u2019s thanks to all of those fans who have stayed as fans over the years. My workload has increased thanks to that, but I\u2019m still glad.</p><p>All of TYPE-MOON\u2019s games until now have been completed games released and sold in one package. How different does working on FGO feel, it being a single game where the contents are released part by part?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> It\u2019s very different. In particular, the aspect of releasing new Servants periodically is a big difference with packaged games. It takes a lot of time for a Servant to get released, so early on four Servants a month was our limit. The plan before launch was to use the year to make around 60 or so Servants, and then just slowly add more every month after the game was released. But now there\u2019s a lot more staff working on the game, so development speed is faster. It\u2019s faster, but\u2026 The staff and personnel of Delight Works are all very passionate, even giving reassuring quips like, \u201Cnow we can make something that\u2019s even better than before!\u201D but somehow things still end up finishing just barely before the deadline. [laughs] The improved animation quality of Servants released starting from October last year is all thanks to all the staff who work hard on the game. It doesn\u2019t get easier because of more staff, but rather the more staff there are, the more they\u2019re willing to sink deeper into the pits of hell. It\u2019s very reassuring to see that kind of passion from them every day.</p><p>I have this renewed feeling of wanting to write more for the people who love the stories we make, and it\u2019s thanks to all of those fans who have stayed as fans over the years.</p><p>What will collab events be like in the future?</p><p>During the Kara no Kyoukai event [4], a slightly different Shiki Ryougi had appeared, which the fans enjoyed.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> The Shiki in the event is the Shiki after the events of Kara no Kyoukai. But even if the characters of Kara no Kyoukai show up in the world of FGO, the whole city would\u2019ve already been in ruins. But Shiki is special \u2013 she\u2019s dead, but not quite. Her body had burned, but it\u2019s yet to completely burn up. She\u2019s there, just right before dying, asleep. The Ogawa Apartments that we see is the dream that Shiki is seeing. During the event, Shiki would say things like, \u201CThis is an awful nightmare,\u201D or \u201CI can\u2019t wake up, so come with me,\u201D and if she does wake up, she, like everyone else, would die out along with the time period she\u2019s in. But if she doesn\u2019t wake up, she\u2019ll avoid the destruction of humanity as long as she\u2019s in that dream, and she\u2019ll be able to return to her original world. If she\u2019s in that situation, Shiki Ryougi can show up in the scenario. The collab is between FGO and a previous TYPE-MOON work, so I wrote it so that it\u2019s still FGO without ruining the core of the Kara no Kyoukai series.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pkdI9KO.png" alt=""></p><p>The event story stepped pretty deep into the story of Kara no Kyoukai, didn\u2019t it?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I think I hit a good balance with the story. Actually, when it was first decided that we were going to have a Kara no Kyoukai collab event, I said, \u201COh, but there aren\u2019t a lot of people who\u2019ve read Rakkyo. Everyone\u2019s just gonna give us blank stares.\u201D [laughs] So I didn\u2019t touch on the events of Kara no Kyoukai\u2019s main story, so that the people playing FGO who haven\u2019t read Kara no Kyoukai would say, \u201CThis new Servant is pretty fun!\u201D while the people who know Kara no Kyoukai by heart would say, \u201CAh, everything this Servant is saying is about Shiki.\u201D In the end, I was able to write a TYPE-MOON fantasy while also sticking to the festive style of FGO. The way missions were unlocked throughout the event was also very \u201Cdetective-like, mystery-like,\u201D so it was very Kara no Kyoukai. That\u2019s all thanks to FGO\u2019s game designer, TYPE-MOON\u2019s very own Azanashi.</p>', 39);

Actually, during the planning phase a year ago, there was a character that we were writing as a surprise for players, and when I asked (Gen) Urobuchi to write a story with that character as protagonist, he gladly accepted it. But during the plotting stage, even though I said, \u201CWrite something with a happy ending for once,\u201D first he asked me, \u201CCan\u2019t I have this character kill this other character and end it there?\u201D and he gave me a plot that was even darker than Fate/Zero. [laughs] I said, \u201CWhat kind of festival do you think we\u2019re making here?! Gen, you should believe more in dreams, aspirations, and the bonds between people!\u201D and had him revise the whole thing. Urobuchi also plays FGO, so the meeting was pretty simple. It went like, \u201CUrobuchi, I want you to write a Fate/Zero collab event for FGO. Actually, just do it.\u201D \u201CUnderstood. I\u2019ll burn through it with my 3\u2606 party. Though I did get Kintarou [5] during the New Year.\u201D There was absolutely no need to explain the system, so it was all just \u201CI\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201D</p><p>Other than collab events, I get the impression that the seasonal events are very detailed.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I think that out of all the seasonal events, the \u201CAlmost One-Week with Santa Alter\u201D [6] event was the most enjoyable. The present system for that event was also really fun. Actually, when I was writing the event scenario during October last year, I got ideas from the responses of the players. I think that the first event where I got to use that knowledge was the Christmas event. Put another way, from the service launch to the Halloween event [7], everything proceeded as we planned. But after the Halloween event, we already had \u2013 to some degree \u2013 an idea of how players enjoy FGO, so we started making events with that in mind. As a result, I think our efforts were rewarded by players who enjoyed those events.</p><p>Is updating and revising based on the user response also part of the big difference between FGO and a complete package game?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> For the latter, I think it\u2019s like a long marathon. There\u2019s already a preset goal, so you know how many kilometers you need to run every day to get there. So it feels like you just have to work little by little to get there. On the other hand, for mobile games, of course there\u2019s a goal, but it feels more like you\u2019re sprinting short distances over and over again. You know where to run next, but you don\u2019t know how far you need to run after that. The only thing you know is that you have to run. Your goals change depending on the situation. And as long as there are players, the sprint will never end. There\u2019s a strong real-time feeling to it. And because of that, we get to feel the affection of the players directly. The staff of TYPE-MOON and Delight Works can work hard because they can feel the heat and warmth from all of the players.</p><p><strong>Episodes and Mysteries to be Revealed in the Second Half</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S7lGvKS.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I\u2019d now like to ask about the scenario writing. Yuuichirou Higashide and Hikaru Sakurai have said, \u201CNasu\u2019s supervision has increased the Fate/ feel of the story\u201D. How exactly do you put in more of that Fate/ feel?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> There\u2019s basically nothing that I left untouched. Fate/Apocrypha and Fate/Prototype: Fragments of Blue and Silver are Higashide\u2019s and Sakurai\u2019s own stories, respectively, so anything they do with those is okay, except for setting mistakes. But FGO is a poster game for TYPE-MOON, so Kinoko Nasu has to put in his word into this scenario. I have to harden my heart and supervise this game. Both Higashide and Sakurai have said, \u201CWe submitted 100 kb of text to Nasu, then it came back as 180 kb of text.\u201D But that\u2019s not just simply adding 80 kb of text; it\u2019s also revising the original 100 kb so that it becomes more Fate/-like.</p><p>So you did the same adding and rewriting process for all of the chapters?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> I would basically add and rewrite while checking everything from start to finish, and also adding some plot points related to the overall setting, but I think I had been a lot more involved with Chapters 1 and 3. Chapter 1 was the entry point so I had to put in everything I could, and Chapter 3\u2019s heroine was Drake, so I was really fussy about that. \u201CSupervised by TYPE-MOON\u201D just refers to management of the setting, which is a job for someone at the digital rights management department, but \u201CSupervised by Kinoko Nasu\u201D means that it\u2019s all up to me, and that I get to intervene until it becomes a work I\u2019m satisfied with. That said, at first I was all, \u201CI\u2019ll be supervising everything for the first half, but once the game launches I have to work on some other things, so I\u2019ll leave the second half all to you two!\u201D but even now I still can\u2019t leave my seat. How did this end up happening?! [laughs]</p><p>When you say rewriting, does a lot of that involve the background behind the world and the characters?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Simply put, it\u2019s filling in the gaps and fixing the scraps. FGO is basically a conversation theater, so if there\u2019s a chance to make a Servant shine, I\u2019ll add it, and if I can mess around with dialogue trees, then I\u2019ll do it. On the other hand, I rarely interfere with the flow and structure of the scenario. I\u2019d just make places which end in two words 10 words long, make conversations denser, and if it\u2019s a Servant that\u2019s already showed up, put in references to their original story in their lines. I do my revisions thinking that readers would enjoy it better this way. Early in development, we were planning to keep the text at a low volume. But that\u2019s not very Fate/-like. All of the characters are heroes; in other words, none of them are mob characters. I want them to be written such that players will go \u201Chey, this character is a legendary hero\u201D when they show up, and when they exit the story, I want the player to end up loving that Servant.</p><p>Is that connected to the Fate/ feel that Higashide and Sakurai refer to?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> That\u2019s right. I\u2019m sure everyone has their idea of what \u201CFate/-like\u201D means, but this is what \u201CFate/-like\u201D means to Kinoko Nasu, and that\u2019s what I add to the scenario. I believe that making those kinds of judgments is the responsibility of the supervisor. If Higashide and Sakurai were put in the role of supervisor, I\u2019m sure they would do the same thing. \u201CLet\u2019s make this part serious.\u201D \u201CLet\u2019s make this part comical.\u201D At first it\u2019s the writer that gets to write with that sense, but in the end it\u2019s the role of the supervisor to adjust things as they see fit. It\u2019s like taste-testing and adding more salt as needed.</p><p>An important part of the scenario is introducing the characters and picking the scenes where they show up. That said, for characters that have shown up in previous Fate/ works, are there any characters that are easy or difficult to write into FGO\u2019s story?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> In the end, all of the characters introduced will become FGO characters, so I think there are no problems introducing them into the story. For example, characters that show up in Fate/EXTRA are coupled with Hakuno, but in FGO it\u2019s inevitable that their affection for the protagonist will increase. Nero Bride is an example of that. By writing them into special circumstances, it\u2019s possible for them to approve of them as a partner or comrade. As a result, for cases like Shiki Ryougi where it\u2019s absolutely impossible for her to become a heroine to \u201Cany other protagonist,\u201D she\u2019s able to become one just for this story. We\u2019re planning to introduce more characters like that, so even if they weren\u2019t able to reach a good ending before, in FGO I\u2019ll write them as if I\u2019m writing a condensed gal game heroine route for them. No one says this out loud, but it\u2019s nice having everyone be happy, isn\u2019t it? Good Smile.</p><p>Speaking of the Fate/ feel, most of your previous works have protagonists with special powers, which result in them being given important roles in the story. On the other hand, up until now we still don\u2019t know who or what exactly FGO\u2019s protagonist is. Will this be touched upon in the story later on?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> No. Everyone seems to think that the protagonist might be Character XX, but we decided that, as a mobile game, the protagonist would be the players themselves, a person who had been living a normal life up until now. We avoided turning the protagonist into \u201Csomeone who actually had this backstory behind them.\u201D I want everyone to think of FGO\u2019s protagonist as someone who just happened to see a recruitment flyer at a station, applied and got accepted into the job, and somehow ended up getting taken into Chaldea. I wish I could live a life like that too.</p><p>I see. Next I\u2019d like to ask about the screentime of Servants in the future. Are there still any Servants that have already shown up, like Asterios in Chapter 3 or Andersen in Chapter 4, who will get another chance to shine in later chapters?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> Of course. In the first place, there are characters who have been in the game since the start who will get their chance to shine in much later chapters. Originally I wanted to introduce the characters along with the chapter they debut in, but we had to put in a set number of characters by game launch, so players would have to wait and look forward to their turn in the spotlight later on. Which characters they are and which chapters they\u2019ll show up in have already been decided while writing each chapter.</p><p>So it\u2019s possible for Servants already in-game but still have yet to get any screentime to show up later on.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> There are also some exceptional cases where we couldn\u2019t quite get them into the story. If I had to give an example, there\u2019s Kojirou Sasaki. He doesn\u2019t get any screentime in any of the seven chapters, but in Chapter 1\u2019s battle portions, he shone as the premier dragon slayer [8], so in a sense he got his time under the spotlight. It\u2019s those little, coincidental things outside of the scenario that add a different layer of fun to games.</p><p>Speaking of games, in all the Fate/ series since Fate/stay night, each Servant would get these status sheets that give an RPG feel to the visual novel. Since FGO is an RPG-like system with command input, how did you put this into consideration?</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> If we put those status sheets into consideration and play them straight, in the first place, it would be impossible for Servants to get killed by three Roman soldiers. [laughs] But as long as it\u2019s made into an RPG, it would be impossible to include all those settings that are in the story portions, so we had to make some sacrifices. Because of those, FGO became a \u201Cplayable game.\u201D I had mentioned Azanashi earlier, who\u2019s in charge of the game balance. At first he argued, \u201CThe game balance is too plain! Kids these days won\u2019t be able to stick with this!\u201D But when we saw that the game balance was just right, he gave in. Azanashi had said from the start that \u201CIf you\u2019re writing the scenario to cover a whole year, then you also have to think of the balance over the span of a year.\u201D The story doesn\u2019t cover a span of just one or two weeks. If it covers a whole year, the gameplay should also cover a whole year. If we had set it to be too easy right from the start, then by the time we got to the second half the game would already be dead. That\u2019s why even if staff like Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi would complain and say, \u201CMake it easier to get Ascension Mats!\u201D he would, with a resolve of steel, keep protecting the balance settings.</p><p>If players keep on supporting us and the game keeps on going, we have plans for what comes after.</p><p>I\u2019d like to ask about the end of that one-year span, once we\u2019ve sprinted past Chapter 7. Please tell us about the future of the game once all seven chapters are released.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> To tell you the truth, the original plan for FGO was to have it be a two-part story. I wrote the settings and backstories while dreaming sweet dreams like, \u201CIf this game becomes popular\u2026\u201D This hasn\u2019t changed since Fate/EXTRA\u2019s inception. So if players keep on supporting us and the game keeps on going, we have plans for what comes after. Honestly, working on FGO is incredibly fun, if only I didn\u2019t have any other work on the side. Unfortunately I can\u2019t just keep on focusing on FGO since I have other titles that I have to work on, and it\u2019s a lot of hard work to find the right balance. Right now, the only thing I can say is that we do have plans for what comes after.</p><p>Thank you very much. To end, now that FGO is entering its second half, please give a message to all the fans who have been enjoying the game until now.</p><p><strong>Nasu:</strong> The story has finally gotten to its main plot and is geared to head towards the finale. I want to surge towards the climax of Chapter 7 without forgetting to make a game that everyone can enjoy, and all the way being excited as a player. Right now all of the staff are working hard every day so the story can head to its finale, so everyone, please look forward to the second half of FGO!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><p>[1] Primate Murder (\u30D7\u30E9\u30A4\u30DF\u30C3\u30C4\u30FB\u30DE\u30FC\u30C0\u30FC) \u2013 seat #1 of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors (see note [2]).
