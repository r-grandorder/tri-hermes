Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Why did you laugh at that!?<br> That was horrifying, not funny!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I thought you were telling us a joke about a cherry blossom picnic! How the hell does this story have a severed head!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> And why were you so quick to cut it off in the first place!? There&#39;s nothing funny about any of this!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Forget sketch comedy; that was a horror story!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to forgive her. Lord Ushiwakamaru&#39;s jokes have always been on the bleeding edge of humor.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Well yeah, with a punch line like that, I could&#39;ve told you there&#39;d be bleeding involved.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> At any rate, no more Genji jokes!<br> They&#39;re just...unsettling!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know what you mean, but while I may not be able to empathize with their situations...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I do think they convey the intensity that comes with being a samurai warrior!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got that right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Definitely!</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha. I&#39;m not surprised to know that our customs are a bit difficult for people from other lands and times to appreciate.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Even in our own time, there were some who never quite \u201Cgot\u201D them.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> So that&#39;s just how Genji jokes are, huh?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, let me stop you right there, Lord Jason. Calling them \u201CGenji jokes\u201D could cause problems for numerous people...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> So would you mind calling them \u201CGenpei War jokes\u201D instead?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> How is that any different!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Eh, fine, whatever. You say it&#39;s different, I&#39;ll take your word for it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The Genji warriors I knew certainly had no end of brave tales to tell.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It seems like you&#39;re continuing their tradition admirably, Lord Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I spend every day applying myself so I don&#39;t fall behind my ancestors.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And since Master continues to face more and more deadly threats by the day, I need to be more diligent with my training than ever.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I may be a Heroic Spirit, but I still have to train. I must get stronger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Ushiwakamaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll keep doing the best I can, too.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> While I commend your spirit, Master, I think it would do you well to get more rest, not less.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Yeah, exactly. Part of a leader&#39;s job is resting up whenever they can.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You said you wish to be stronger?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I did, and I do!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Good. I&#39;m pleased to hear you wish to become stronger.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You are a true warrior, Ushiwakamaru. I commend you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You are too kind, Lady Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If I may be so bold, would you do me the honor of teaching me a move or two!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> What are you saying, Lord Ushiwakamaru!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, are you nuts!?<br> How is that what&#39;s happening now!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Go on, Master, you&#39;ve gotta stop them before they kill each other! You know they will!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yeah, good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just make sure you stick to the simulator, okay!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An emergency alert!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s an automated alarm! There must have been some damage to the base!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go find out what&#39;s happening!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There! I&#39;m seeing a powerful magical energy signal in the underground library!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And...it&#39;s making its way to the Command Room!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Command Room!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But, WE&#39;RE in the Command Room!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh no. This is terrible!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Lord Caesar and Lord Fergus are in the library right now!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> They said they would fill in for me while I was here at the Command Room!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm. Caesar and Fergus, huh.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Given how quickly the signal is making its way here, they must have been taken down in no time.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ahh... Lord Caesar... Lord Fergus...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Is that so!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then this formidable new foe must have taken both their hea\u2013</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Please stop smiling, Lord Ushiwakamaru!<br> Now is not the time!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother; she obviously can&#39;t help it. At least she seems to be reacting to the formidable foe part, not the casualty part.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Worry not.<br> I can sense that neither of them have vanished.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a relief...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It is strange, though.<br> Two Sabers, each of whom use magical swords...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> One such sword can carve through the earth itself, and the other can move at godlike speed.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, they both obviously lust after Murasaki, so we can be assured each would do his best to impress her.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> So then... Hmm?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No matter how great a hero or Divine Spirit this intruder may be, they should not have been able to get past those two so easily.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That leaves only one possibility...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> (The intruder&#39;s a woman?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The signal is almost here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look out!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Aah! The Command Room door!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oho. They kicked it open, did they?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s a power move!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Here they come! Be on your guard, everyone!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Kanra kara kara!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> How nice of you all to come and greet me like this!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit? No...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So this is where great heroes from across time and all the world gather, is it? One, two, three... Yes, it seems the rumors were true.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Indeed, those other two swordsmen weren&#39;t half bad themselves...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And I see there are a number of other formidable fighters here as well. Not bad at all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, I suppose it&#39;s only fitting that I introduce myself properly!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey there, everyone!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am one of the greatest swordfighters and strategists of all time, as well as one of Kyo&#39;s most famous onmyouji!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am blazing flame that pierces the heavens like a pillar of fire.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The heavenly drums ring, but not with thunder!<br> I streak through the night like a shooting star!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am Kiichi Hogen!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I am Kiichi Hogen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kiichi Hogen...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A legendary onmyouji from the tail end of Japan&#39;s Heian period! She&#39;s also the founder of a legendary swordfighting style, Kyouhachiryu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The legendary onmyouji!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kiichi Hogen is a renowned onmyouji from the tail end of Japan&#39;s Heian period! She&#39;s also the founder of a legendary swordfighting style, Kyouhachiryu!</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...She is also the custodian of the Rikutou, or \u201CSix Secret Teachings\u201D and Sanryaku, or \u201CThree Strategies of Huang Shigong,\u201D two of the greatest treatises on military strategy ever written. She is from the same era as Lord Ushiwakamaru and me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oho.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. And many legends also say that Kiichi Hogen was Ushiwakamaru&#39;s mentor!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Hello, Mentor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru&#39;s mentor!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> U-um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The legends pertaining to Kiichi Hogen were from after my time, but I have studied some of them since I materialized.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So I know that she is famous for their wisdom, and for being one of the greatest teachers of all time!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But even though she is a legendary onmyouji and sword saint, her true identity is\u2013</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No human could ever possess a Spirit Origin like that!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Be on your guard, everyone. Believe me when I say this Kiichi person is practically a god.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Well now.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Interesting.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I thought I&#39;d only find human heroes here.<br> What a surprise.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> It seems there&#39;re some godlike ones, too. Quite the fun place you&#39;ve got here.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh great, an Eastern god!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I thought they were dignified, graceful, and kept to themselves, unlike some Western ones I could name...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> But I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> This one&#39;s clearly got the arrogance and intimidating presence down to an art form!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Are there ANY gods out there who do ANYTHING other than cause trouble?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...And I see there&#39;s no shortage of insolent humans here too. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Aah! Don&#39;t look at me! I didn&#39;t say anything!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> S-so what&#39;s somebody so amazing doing here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As they are standing right in front of you, you may as well just ask.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Well, yeah, sure, but still.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> U-um, seeing as she is a legendary figure, and has already introduced herself, perhaps we shouldn&#39;t be so quick to pick a fight...?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Agreed. Speaking as a Buddhist monk, I certainly have no wish to cut down every new person I encounter.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> However, if she has no wish<br> to engage in peaceful dialogue...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be a fool.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> She already kicked down our door and demolished two other Servants. Well, probably, in the latter case.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Therefore only one option remains to us. Am I wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe not, but let&#39;s just wait a minute.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> H-hang on, Mistress Sc\xE1thach. Let&#39;s try talking first.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Ahahahahahahahaha.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I like you, Red Eyes!<br> I think we might have a lot in common!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> The two Servants I ran into down below were so busy trying to hit on me that they barely put up a fight.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I wonder how you lot will fare?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her magical energy levels are spiking!<br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to\u2013</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Ushiwakamaru, wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Forgive me!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> What were you thinking, you idiot?<br> Didn&#39;t I teach you better than that?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Forgive me, Mentor! I don&#39;t know why it is you&#39;ve come here... But Chaldea is my Master&#39;s castle!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never forget the debt I owe you,<br> but if you mean to threaten it...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...then mentor or not, I won&#39;t show you any mercy!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Oho.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Well, well, well.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Now, that, I did not expect to hear.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Kanra kara kara...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Who do you think you&#39;re talking to, Shana-oh!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Aw crap! Now she&#39;s really mad!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Lady Kiichi!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong></p><p>Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh! H-her magical energy is so strong! My own spells can&#39;t even begin to compare!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s more like it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Come, Master! I could ask for few opponents more worthy than an Eastern demigod!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> This is exactly the sort of thing we&#39;ve been training for. Everyone, follow my lead!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It seems we have no choice!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> O-okaaay!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hold up. When you say \u201Ceveryone,\u201D did you mean me, too!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, everyone, battle formations!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right, everyone, let&#39;s start by getting Kiichi to settle down!</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Hmm!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Nicely done. Nicely done! You did well holding your ground against me!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Then again, this is my first time materializing as a Servant, so maybe this Spirit Origin isn&#39;t quite up to the task.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Then what will you do now, Kiichi Hogen?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Even if you are a demigod from the East, it was foolish of you to invade Chaldea on your own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, she wasn&#39;t completely alone, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about those tengu-looking things she had with her?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Familiars do not count! Oh, wait. I suppose that<br> would mean Servants do not count either, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> It would have been foolish of me if I&#39;d meant to capture this place!

Please, allow me.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> As the legends say, Lord Ushiwakamaru did indeed train under Lady Kiichi, though she had already changed her name to Shana-oh at the time.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> At any rate, while Lord Ushiwakamaru was learning the ways of martial arts under Lady Kiichi&#39;s tutelage...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...she made off with Lady Kiichi&#39;s ultimate strategies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Say what?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> She made off with Lady Kiichi&#39;s ultimate strategies.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Yeah, no, we heard you the first time. That&#39;s not really the question.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Lord Ushiwakamaru, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Made off...?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Though it pains me to say it, Lord Ushiwakamaru tricked Lady Kiichi&#39;s daughter into bringing out her parent&#39;s secret scrolls of ultimate strategies before she, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> She read the contents of a treasure said to grant godly power to any who could absorb its contents...and she did so without permission.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You little scamp.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ahaha.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> This is no laughing matter!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> When I first materialized, I was surprised to see what a wreck the human world had become in the twenty-first century...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> But then, I sensed your presence here!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I never had a chance to punish you back when we were alive since you met your end as Yoshitsune in Oushu...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...and it would&#39;ve been too much trouble to track you down in the afterlife.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> But! Now that we&#39;ve both materialized in this world, all bets are off!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if your body&#39;s merely transient ether...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...or that humanity&#39;s barely hanging on by a thread!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit now, huh? A shadow of humanity here from the Throne of Heroes?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So what!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Shana-oh!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Y-yes!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> It&#39;s time for you to pay for your past misdeeds!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Now you wait right there while I prepare your punishment!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> (I see.

She really does seem to be doing this for Ushiwakamaru&#39;s own good.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> (I see. This just goes to show why you shouldn&#39;t take what doesn&#39;t belong to you.)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. Very well then, go ahead and punish her as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Lady Sc\xE1thach!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> From everything we have heard, it is clear that you were entirely in the wrong. As a teacher with foolish students of my own, I can sympathize.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Or do you have something to say on your behalf?<br> If you do, then by all means, let us hear it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, maybe she had a good reason for sneaking a peek at that scroll.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I am Ushiwaka.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Yes, I know.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As such, I know nothing about my life after I became known as Shana-oh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And of course, I know even less<br> about my life as Yoshitsune!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So...could you maybe let me off the hook?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Lady Kiichi.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh come on, you can&#39;t expect us to buy that. I&#39;m sure you remember everything up to your death, just like the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hmm. A typically valiant effort from Lord Ushiwakamaru, but in this case, it was not successful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, she&#39;s still on the hook then?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It would seem so...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s like saying Alexander doesn&#39;t remember anything about being King Iskandar just &#39;cause he&#39;s still a kid.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> No, wait. That actually sounds plausible.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Absolutely not! You remain very much on the hook!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Oh well, it was worth a shot.

And as Benkei said, it possesses power very similar to a wish granter!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Here I go!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What happened to me!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> A single tap with the Mallet of Fortune, and voil\xE0!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Embiggen!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> No more Ushiwakamaru for you!

Okay, I think I understand now.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Then Shana-oh must have used the Mallet of Fortune to give back what she took with it.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Talk about a crazy experiment, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> She&#39;s definitely always been quick on her feet,<br> in more ways than one...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Um...

Are you some sort of doll?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Have you all been shrunken down too, though in a very different way than I was...?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> Well, I couldn&#39;t say for sure whether she looked like you or not...</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong><br> ...but I did see a Heroic Spirit<br> carrying a small wooden mallet.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I-I did, too!</p><p><strong>Sitonai:</strong><br> Me too. She&#39;s not here anymore, though.</p><p><strong>Sitonai:</strong><br> One moment, she was smacking us with that mallet, and the next, she&#39;d run off.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll just have to track her down with the needle again. Dammit.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Mentor.<br> I won&#39;t let her get away next time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Just you wait, Evil Ushiwaka!<br> Soon, your head will be mine!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> U-uh...right.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Y-yes, I suppose it will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yeah...

Haven&#39;t we been over this?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hesitate? Why would I?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> My job is to offer the enemy&#39;s head to my lord, regardless of who that enemy may be.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Even if it&#39;s your own head?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Shaaanaaa-ohhh!

I&#39;m checking your coordinates now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and it seems you&#39;re somewhere high above the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> All right, then I guess it&#39;s time to go cloud walking\u2013</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> And resume our search for Evil Ushiwaka!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Coming, C\xFA!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It&#39;s wonderful seeing those two get along so well.<br> It never fails to warm my heart.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Man, you gotta put actual work into being that dumb.

I&#39;m touched, too.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Those siblings&#39; love for each other was something special... But I know we can still beat them!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I told you that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.<br> Knock it off.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Now then.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well, Chaldeans, I only have one more thing left to say.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong></p><h1 id="we-surrender" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-surrender" aria-hidden="true">#</a> We surrender!</h1><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> After seeing fireworks like that,<br> I&#39;m plenty satisfied with this outcome!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Me too, Sister!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...O-oh.

Isn&#39;t that exactly where we should be working together!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Ideally, sure, but it&#39;s not that simple.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Once we get in, we still have to figure out how we can defeat him, being tiny and all.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> In fairy tales, heroes would kill giants this way by stabbing their stomachs with a needle, passing through their eyes, and so on...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t yet know if that giant there has any of those weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to trust all of you to figure out exactly what needs to be done to beat him!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Once we do that, then we work together to execute our new strategy. Makes sense, right?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s a completely insane idea, but it could work...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Are you going to be okay coming along with us, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Honestly, it sounds like fun!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ahahahaha, you have a real reckless side to you, don&#39;t you, Master? I like it!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Oh, come on...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No problems here!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F She&#39;s] not thinking about how we&#39;re gonna<br> get out of Heracles later at all, is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s our Master for you!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> All right, everyone, let&#39;s go climb that building and pay the big guy a visit!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Medb:</strong></p><h1 id="ugh-this-sucks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ugh-this-sucks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ugh, this sucks!</h1><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> When you said we&#39;d be making our way up, I thought you meant we&#39;d be taking the elevator, not the stairs!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmph. Seems to me like a perfect opportunity to make up for all the exercise you haven&#39;t been getting.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s a concern for flabby people, not me.

Then let&#39;s just focus on Heracles now!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Good, this roof should work nicely.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> All right, here&#39;s the plan.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> We all jump at his mouth together, then I&#39;ll make you all Issun Boushi-sized before we land inside it.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be better for you to shrink us before we jump? That would reduce the odds of him spotting us, too.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be an idiot, Benkei.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We&#39;ll never be able to jump that distance if Mentor shrinks us down beforehand.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Besides, we want him to notice us! That way, he&#39;ll be looking right at us, so it&#39;ll be easier to land in his mouth.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;m going to cast a spell that will carry you all over to him!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> The heavenly drums ring, but not with thunder.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> The tengu streaks through the night like a shooting star!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Come forth, gales of a stormy night!<br> Rain down, fires of hell!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Now flap and flap until you&#39;ve flown far, far away!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s seen us!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Well sure he has.

Now that I think about it, why am I jumping into Heracles&#39;s stomach with the rest of you!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Groooss!

Your current coordinates put you in Kamakura, in the southern part of Japan&#39;s Kantou area.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Kamakura?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What could you\u2013I mean, Evil Ushiwaka be doing here? This place means a lot to you, right, Ushiwakamaru?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So Evil Ushiwaka probably didn&#39;t just end up here by happenstance...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Right. This was almost certainly her ultimate destination all along.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> As for what it is she could be doing here...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing she wants to destroy the place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Destroy it? Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Remember, Evil Ushiwaka began acting independently\u2013not as Ushiwakamaru or Shana-oh, but as Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So it&#39;s no surprise that she might want to crush Kamakura, given how much she hated it when she was alive.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> There&#39;s only one thing I don&#39;t understand. Singularities basically let you go back in time, right?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So if she wanted to destroy Kamakura, I would&#39;ve thought she&#39;d try to do so while Yoritomo was still alive.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> But this Kamakura looks like it&#39;s pretty close to the present day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, it is fairly common for minute Singularities to manifest in modern times, so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too strange, but still...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Oh, so that&#39;s common? I see.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Maybe she just didn&#39;t have enough magical energy to turn back time, even with the Mallet of Fortune?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> If so, maybe she just decided she&#39;d settle for destroying a more modern Kamakura?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong, Kiichi Hogen.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> There she is.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Finally.

Why go to so much trouble?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru?:</strong><br> I&#39;ve told you already.

What trait?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I imagine it&#39;s something that&#39;ll give her attacks greater potency.

How odd.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> I see. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> I thought it was odd that I felt so at home here in Yoshitsune&#39;s Spirit Origin, but now, it all makes sense.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve merged at least once before. That bond must have remained, even if this Spirit Origin retained no record of it.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Fascinating!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Taira-no-Kagekiyo... As I recall, they were a legendary samurai for the Kanmu Heishi around the end of the Heian period.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They despise the Genji clan for deposing the Taira clan and establishing the shogunate, and they&#39;re hell-bent on taking revenge on Minamoto-no-Yoritomo in particular.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are a great many legends about them, but I think the most outlandish has to be the one about their immortality.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what sort of magecraft mechanism they employed, but it&#39;s said that not even cutting off Taira-no-Kagekiyo&#39;s head was enough to stop them from coming back to life.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What, are they some kind of immortal Heroic Spirit!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Nn...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So why&#39;s someone like that walking around wearing Ushiwakamaru&#39;s face\u2013er, her whole Spirit Origin?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Are we just looking at a combination of two Heroic Spirits or something?</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> All right, I see what&#39;s going on now. So that&#39;s the Taira-no-Kagekiyo spoken of in countless legends, huh?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> And while there are many legends about them, there are also quite a few about Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Despite belonging to the Taira and Genji clans respectively, you both have a lot in common.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> The only difference is that there&#39;s less substance to Taira-no-Kagekiyo in the legends than there is to Ushiwakamaru, no?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While the Palace Guard Akushichi Kagekiyo depicted in \u201CThe Tale of the Heike\u201D might have truly existed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...the Taira-no-Kagekiyo depicted in the legends of Kagekiyo was born more from fiction than historical events.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> While it&#39;s not unusual for details about a Heroic Spirit to be scarce...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I get the sense that you never even possessed a body of your own, Kagekiyo.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Let me guess. You&#39;re more of a ghost or a vengeful spirit than a Heroic Spirit, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I knew it. And now, for some reason, you&#39;ve shown up and possessed my student!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did he end up possessing Ushiwakamaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Taira-no-Kagekiyo.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You mean to completely take over Shana-oh\u2013no, Yoshitsune&#39;s Spirit Origin for yourself, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you went to all this trouble of changing Kamakura into a nightmare land...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> A place that turns any who set<br> foot in it into your quarry!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> At first, I thought you were doing this so you could kill me...but it seems your true target is the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Yoshitsune&#39;s Spirit Origin is a real wonder.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Were I to properly fuse with it, I have no doubt I could carry out my life&#39;s work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, eradicating the Genji.</p><hr><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Once I have slaughtered every last Genji across every period of time...</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> ...both Yoshitsune&#39;s revenge and my own will at last be complete.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> This Yoshitsune Spirit Origin derived from the Heroic Spirit Ushiwakamaru has proved quite stubborn.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Even now, it continues to prattle on about how it refuses to aid me.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Which is why I have no choice but to shatter its soul and break its spirit.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> And to do that, I must kill the one Yoshitsune\u2013that is, Ushiwakamaru of Chaldea\u2013thinks of as she once did Yoritomo.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> I speak, of course, of you: the Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I see. Kind of like how a loyal dog loses its way after losing its master.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You expect that if Shana-oh were to lose her Master now...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...her soul would vanish instantly, leaving her body empty.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> That, in turn, would give you a chance to completely take it over, hm?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Talk about dirty, underhanded tactics.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait! Think about it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Without a Master anchoring them to this world, nearly every Heroic Spirit currently materialized will disappear!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Surely you don&#39;t want that to happen...right?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You&#39;re forgetting something, Mash. Remember, she still has the Mallet of Fortune.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t planning on revealing this much, but no matter. At least it should save me some time.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Anyway, now that the explanations are over...</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Let me ask you this, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> It would be all too easy to kill you now.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> It would also be a waste.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> For you see, this Spirit Origin still recognizes you as its Master. So I am offering you a deal.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> If you agree to serve me, I will spare your life.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> If you refuse...you will die, here and now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but I still have to refuse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No. What you&#39;re doing is wrong, and I can&#39;t be part of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Taira-no-Kagekiyo:</strong><br> Then, it seems I have no choice but to kill\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Oh no you don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You&#39;re not laying a finger on [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]!<br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] belongs to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mentor?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

[\u2642 Don&#39;t you mean &quot;groom&quot; /\u2640\uFE0F Did you just say &quot;bride&quot;]?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What are you saying, Mentor!?<br> Have you lost your mind!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> What do you mean? Besides, I saw [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] first.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You \u201Csaw [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] first\u201D!?

How do we stop them!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> We can&#39;t even reach Kagekiyo like this, much less harm her!

I suppose it was still important that we go after Lord Ushiwakamaru...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But if you can summon the mallet back to you like that, couldn&#39;t you have done so much earlier?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It certainly seems like something you should be able to do even from a great distance...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Ghhhhhh.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I-I just thought I would see what Chaldea was capable of, since Shana-oh seems so comfortable there!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Waaah!

What a bald-faced lie.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> That&#39;s a horrible thing to say, and what&#39;s worse,<br> your eyes tell me you mean it.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Very well then, Shana-oh.<br> Here are my conditions.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Warrior or not, I have nothing to teach to a child made of cold, unfeeling steel.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So before you turn yourself into a weapon, you need to live as the human child you are.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> And that means...you need to play!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You need to play games, run around,<br> fall down, and laugh!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> If you can do that\u2013and I mean really throw yourself into it\u2013then and only then will I be willing to teach you to fight.</p><p><strong>Shana-oh:</strong><br> H-huh?</p><p><strong>Shana-oh:</strong><br> Then...does that mean you&#39;ll teach me!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Yes, I will. Didn&#39;t I just say as much?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Of course, by the time you&#39;ve met these conditions...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be no more than an ordinary child who would never talk about beheading someone!</p><p><strong>Shana-oh:</strong><br> Oh no, Lady Kiichi, you&#39;re wrong!<br> I won&#39;t ever just be an ordinary chil\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Shut it!</p><p><strong>Shana-oh:</strong><br> Aah!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> If that didn&#39;t scare you off, then come to my garden. Kouju! Are you there, Kouju!?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Before you can even think of dying alone, you&#39;re going to learn how to play a decent game of tag!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Since your head&#39;s evidently been stuffed with nonsense, I&#39;m going to make sure it&#39;s good and empty before we begin your lessons!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I really thought I could do it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I thought I could purge this small, stubborn child of her anger and turn her into an ordinary, foolish, innocent child.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I was so very, very wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You beat me, Shana-oh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I completely and utterly failed to<br> teach you what I truly wanted to.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> But...I won&#39;t fail again. That&#39;s the whole reason I came here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Why couldn&#39;t you see that all my talk about punishing you was just a pretense? Idiot.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> (Indistinct muttering)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, did you say something, Mentor?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And, um...I expect you&#39;ll be leaving soon, right?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You do seem to be a Servant yourself, but I&#39;m sure you must have come here from your mountain, right?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So then, you must be going home soon...right?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> How could I when humanity faces such a crisis?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Besides, you moron, my mountain doesn&#39;t even exist right now! I died, just like Lady Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> In any case...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I do still need to make you atone for what you did.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Aww.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I also need to keep an eye on you, to make sure you don&#39;t go down the same path you did when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> And most importantly, I have a new student now!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;ll be helping us out, but...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you sure about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to fail again. This time, I&#39;m going to make sure I save my students.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Huh? You mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Yes, I mean you, too.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> That said, it does seem as though Benkei and many others here at Chaldea have been doing you a world of good.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> (Obviously bashful) I-I&#39;m honestly a little embarrassed, hearing you say that.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What&#39;s so embarrassing about it, Benkei!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahahaha, that hurts, Lord Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I can see that the path ahead of you is long and arduous.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just disappear and leave you to tackle it on your own. I&#39;m a teacher, after all.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So now that I&#39;ve taken you on as my student...</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to see your path through to the end.<br> If I can keep you safe along the way, I will.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to make the same mistakes. I never want to see one of my students die a miserable death again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Mentor.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Kanra kara kara!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Come now, no need to be modest! The greatest teacher of all time is offering to teach you!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> So I suggest you two prepare yourselves!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Prepare ourselves?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh...for what?</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to make the same mistakes I did with Shana-oh! No way in hell!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> This time, I&#39;m focusing entirely on making you two the greatest students I&#39;ve ever had!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> All you two need to do is relax and prepare yourselves!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Nooo! I refuuuse!</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Where are you going, Shana-oh!?<br> I just said there&#39;s no need to be modest!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Hey, Lord Caesar.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Yes, Lord Fergus?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been lying on the floor for a long time now.<br> How come you haven&#39;t gotten back up?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I could ask the same of you. Hahaha, are we perhaps thinking the same thing?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> As you well know, this library&#39;s custodian is Lady Murasaki Shikibu.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Indeed.<br> A fair and beautiful Heroic Spirit widow, she is.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And once she sees us here sprawled on the floor after losing a fight against a vicious ruffian...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> She will surely nurse us back to health.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> The perfect\u2013</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Plan.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Aah! You&#39;re both hurt! Oh, this is terrible!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> (She&#39;s here!)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go fetch the first aid kit right away!<br> Just give me a moment to\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No need. I will treat their \u201Cinjuries\u201D myself.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I know just what they need!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Craaaaaap!<br> Sc\xE1thaaaaaach!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oho. Well, well, well. It seems you&#39;re even more insolent than I thought, failing to address Lady Sc\xE1thach properly.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And what letches you both are, using our sparring session where, I should mention, I took it easy on you, as pretext to have a beautiful woman look after you.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear you both need a harsh lesson of your own!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hehe, I like the way you think, Lady Kiichi.<br> Allow me to help you.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Why thank you, Lady Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No need for formalities. We may come from very different lands, but we are both teachers. Please, think of us as friends. The Western teacher and the Eastern teacher, if you will.</p><p><strong>Kiichi Hogen:</strong><br> Friends, huh? I like the sound of that!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> We doooooon&#39;t!!!</p><p></p>', 3031);
