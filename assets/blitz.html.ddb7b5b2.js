Choices must be considered. Commitment is essential. Agony is crucial.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In other words...experience is key.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> So, there you have it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong></p><h1 id="now-stand-up-bow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#now-stand-up-bow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Now stand up!

One moment, we run into Sc\xE1thach in the hall, and the next, we&#39;re Rayshifting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Can you tell us what&#39;s going on, Sc\xE1thach?<br> And why are you wearing that costume?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Mash.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Right now, under these circumstances,<br> I am not your Servant.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I am your teacher, here to guide you on this new journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Teacher? Journey?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Indeed. Listen well, both of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...If possible, I would like you to address me as<br> \u201CMs. Sc\xE1thach.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Ms. Sc\xE1thach!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, Ms. Sc\xE1thach!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Much better.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The road to humanity&#39;s restoration is long and arduous.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Humanity has been bleached away, and those of us who remain are once again fighting for our right to exist.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And while your Servants may have plenty of experience on the field of battle, you, Master, do not. At least, not when it comes to fighting as a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess I can&#39;t argue with that...</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Indeed, you cannot.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> This is no fault of your own, of course. As the last Master of all humanity, you do not exactly have a wealth of contemporaries to look to for direction.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I suppose we could find a few Servants who have also served as Masters if we were to look hard enough, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait a moment, Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this why we have the simulator? So that Senpai\u2013Master, can gain the experience [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]<br> needs for battle?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The simulator does indeed work well for practicing individual battles, but that is as far as it goes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> In a war with all of humanity at stake, we will also need to keep a firm eye on the larger picture.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Let me ask you this, Master. What is the worst thing that could happen in this situation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me failing to protect humanity?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Wrong. That would only be the ultimate result of this catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The correct answer is your death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Me dying?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Correct.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Servants cannot exist without a Master, which makes your continued survival of the utmost importance.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And since there are no other Masters left in the entire world right now, our fate is entirely in your hands.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And since all other potential Masters in this world are on the enemy&#39;s side, our fate is entirely in your hands.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As such, it is your duty to<br> continue winning at all costs.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> However, that does not mean you must<br> always win every battle no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> What good could it do to win<br> the battle but lose the war?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> If you must, at times, flee the field of battle, we can make up those losses later, so long as you yet live.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Today, you will learn from both defeat and victory.<br> That is the purpose of this Grail Front!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Grail Front?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That is why I have modeled this environment after my own Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Needless to say, a loss in this<br> war will not prove fatal.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But, should you emerge triumphant...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong></p><h1 id="i-will-grant-you-a-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-will-grant-you-a-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I will grant you a Holy Grail!</h1><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> H-hold up!

Did you say a Holy Grail!? You&#39;ve just HAD one all this time!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can&#39;t just have those things floating around willy-nilly. Can you just skip the pageantry and give it to us now!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m just guessing here, but I don&#39;t see her just handing it over.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I know that look well. It&#39;s the same one Toole always had during her \u201CThis is for your own good\u201D lessons.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aw man...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Indeed, Chaldea is currently starved for resources, so I can only imagine how desperately you must want this grail.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But, I am the one who found it,<br> so it is mine to do with as I will.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ugh. Why is every hero from the<br> Age of Gods always like this?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;d heard heroes from the Age of Gods were...a lot,<br> but this is ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And of course,<br> there is a Master on the enemy&#39;s side as well.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> While there may not be Masters to<br> be found in every Singularity...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...there is most assuredly one orchestrating the battle somewhere.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Remember, there are other Masters calling themselves Crypters on the enemy&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> So gaining experience in determining what an enemy commander is thinking will only work to your benefit in the future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> G-good point. There ARE other Masters on the enemy&#39;s side, after all!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As for the Master you will be facing here...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well, while I do get the impression he is somewhat...unbalanced, he should still suffice as a worthy opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder who it could be...</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> W-well, you will find that out soon enough.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> My name is of little consequence,<br> but if you must address me, you may call me...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Mister M.</p><p><strong>Mister M:</strong><br> Yes, that will do nicely!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Well, the \u201CM\u201D clearly doesn&#39;t stand for \u201CMystery\u201D...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Senpai&#39;s goal is to defeat Mister M&#39;s Servants then?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Indeed. But unlike the battles you have faced thus far, this will be an intense and brutal series of skirmishes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Of course, while I have no desire to tell you to fight ceaselessly, even if it should result in your death...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> N-no, I certainly do not wish to say that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (She wants to say it really badly, doesn&#39;t she, Senpai?)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No! I am not going to say it (Biting her lip)<br> Grr, when did I get so stodgy?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> At any rate, since this is meant to provide a special combat experience, I have prepared both real battles and training battles.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The live battles will constitute the Holy Grail War, and for the training battles...take a look!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All the fighters who came here for the training battles... A ton of materials... A gift shop... Wait! Does this mean...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wooo! Roulette time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Woohoo! Now we&#39;re talking!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> (Obviously proud)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. No longer will anyone be able to mock me by saying my disciples only \u201Cgraduate\u201D when they die.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> In addition to my stick, I have also arranged for,<br> um... What is it that goes with sticks again?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Cannons, woof!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s it. For this event, I have arranged for festivities to accompany my harsh training\u2013the cannon and the stick, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Sc\xE1thach, I understand what&#39;s going on here now. However\u2013</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You still haven&#39;t answered the question<br> we asked you earlier.

Does it have something to do with<br> this Grail Front!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No, it does not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you modify your Spirit Origin<br> using Primordial Runes?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No, I did not.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> When I awoke this morning, well...<br> I found myself dressed like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!? They&#39;re not even trying tojustify this kind of thing anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> W-well, never mind how I got this outfit.<br> It does look good on me, does it not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well... Yeah, I can&#39;t deny that...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While I agree that it does look very good on you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t help but think Mas\u2013er, everyone might find it more than a little distracting!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong></p><h1 id="that-s-the-point" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#that-s-the-point" aria-hidden="true">#</a> That&#39;s the point!!!</h1><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Sure, it may not be the best thing for Master&#39;s moral upbringing, but sometimes, you&#39;ve just gotta give the people what they want!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> A cat can&#39;t survive on bargain bin canned food alone. Every now and then, you&#39;ve gotta crack open the top-shelf stuff.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> All of which is to say that Sc\xE1thach&#39;s brand-new bunny britches are a gift from yours truly!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I was going for something both sexy and deadly, and the bunny has long been known as the strongest of the solitary animals, though admittedly at the cost of dying alone.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Would you like me to whip you one up too, Mash? Who knows? It might help bring back some...dangerous memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-me!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh, wait. Cat scratch that. I only had enough material on me for Sc\xE1thach&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not as though I wanted to wear one, but...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t understand.<br> Why did you make me a bunny outfit?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> You have to ask!?<br> Don&#39;t try to hide it from me, Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I know how you&#39;ve been keeping your nose to the grindstone lately. I&#39;ve got a nose for that kind of thing myself.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I also know that yarn about the elves and the shoemaker, and this cat&#39;s never been big on leather.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Which is why I worked my toe beans off to make you that outfit! I always had a feeling it&#39;d look good on you, and besides, you can&#39;t take the lead on a big production like this in your usual outfit!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> So go on, enjoy it!<br> Consider it your reward for all your hard work, woof!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I-I see. So this is what they mean nowadays when they talk about practicing self-care!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang on. Something doesn&#39;t add up here.</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> If you got a problem with my fashion sense, any and all complaints must go through our Servantverse office.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> All right then, farewell, my fellow CAGs (short for \u201CChaldea Animal Girls\u201D)! See you in the finals!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh, and if you ever want to make that new outfit permanent, just give me a holler!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> At any rate, you will have a great deal you<br> must consider over the course of this war.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> For example, there is no guarantee that the Servants you are able to summon will be suited to every environment in which you will do battle.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You will need to consider their affinities, their skills, their Noble Phantasms, their personalities, and more.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Will your victories be flawless, or will you only succeed by the skin of your teeth?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Will your losses be painful injuries,<br> or opportunities for further growth?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You must be prepared for everything to change in the blink of an eye. That is what it means to wage war.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> From here on out, you and your Servants must think together, fight together, and win together!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Make sure you have a full grasp of your party&#39;s capabilities before you head into battle.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Now, are you ready to get started?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go for it!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Good.

I knew we shouldn&#39;t have sent in the Archer here.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> In retrospect, the potential rewards of doing so were great, but so were the risks.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Perhaps we should have opened with a different move.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hey now, don&#39;t rule that sort of thing out too quick.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Even if trying to overpower your opponent with brute strength doesn&#39;t succeed on its own, it has a knock-on effect of throwing them off-balance.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> And you can&#39;t underestimate knock-on effects.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> There is rarely a time when Chaldea is not at a severe disadvantage in this campaign we are fighting, after all. More so when fights are drawn out.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> In some ways, it feels as though we are constantly laying siege to an impenetrable castle. Keeping fights as short as possible is not bad civilization at all.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> You sure you don&#39;t mean \u201Cstrategy\u201D instead of \u201Ccivilization\u201D?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I know what I said.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh, hey, Mordred.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Say, you&#39;re a Knight of the Round Table.<br> What do you make of all this?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Well, I like brief showdowns<br> as much as the next knight...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But aren&#39;t you guys forgetting that Chaldea&#39;s got almost zilch in the way of supply lines?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve basically got no choice<br> but to go full guerilla warfare.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Forget short-term or long-term warfare.<br> If I had to sum up our strategy... Hmm...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;d call it general mid-term warfare?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So we&#39;re prolly better off assessing the situation early on, then findin&#39; an opening in the mid-game and hammering it as hard as we can.</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What? What is it?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know you could be so, you know, thoughtful.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You want a piece of me, Celt!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now, now, no need for that.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Really, we shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Of course the Knight of Treachery would know about that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t have guessed that about you in a million years, but it does make sense when you think about it.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You guys want me to Clarent all your asses?

I don&#39;t see how this is going to be of much use.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I feel like I just wasted our finite and all-too-precious resources on some trivial entertainment...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, Gordy.<br> This entertainment&#39;s anything but trivial.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Remember, this is a full-blown Holy Grail War simulator.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Granted, we won&#39;t be able to use it until the recycling system gives us some more resources to run it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But once it does, it ought to provide some really valuable experiences!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oho... Oho, oho.<br> I see, I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It was a lot of work,<br> coming up with this Grail Front system.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I had to gather a great deal of magical energy resources as I went around making intricate modifications to a minute Singularity, and now...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> (Sniff)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Ms. Sc\xE1thach! We still need you to be an advisor!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> An...advisor?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, Mentor.<br> I know the system&#39;s already been put together...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...but the enemy Masters and Servants aren&#39;t gonna position themselves, right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So we&#39;re still gonna need someone who knows the ins and outs of battle to set things up. Someone like you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> (...That oughta do it, right?)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see... An advisor, huh?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Right, of course.<br> Well, in that case...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I suppose my effort wasn&#39;t for nothing after all. And if it will help Chaldea bolster its fighting forces further, I certainly have no objections.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Besides, I have already received a fine reward in this outfit. My self-care regimen, if you will.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It seems I am truly in Tamamo Cat&#39;s debt. I&#39;ll have to be nice to any other cats I meet from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. Thanks to you and Cat, this first round of the Grail Front as turned out wonderfully.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On that note, Senpai, it looks like we&#39;ve got a special new regular event to look forward to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s make sure they&#39;re all as successful as this one!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said it!</p><hr><p></p>', 319);
