As such she still holds the conceit that her painting skills will one day surpass even her father Hokusai\u2019s.</p><p>Her father told her the rather dubious story that within her runs the blood the \u201CChuushingura\u201D, something which she has taken to heart. She now completely believes herself a swordswoman. Having read a large number of \u2018materials\u2019 like the novels of Kyokutei Bakin, and the Water Margin from China, she has given rein to her delusions and the result is as you can see\u2026</p><p>For the actual Katsushika Hokusai this is the embodiment of her shameful past she thought sealed within her memories.

Thus she wishes that both her father and her Master can see her succeed in that.</p><p>She brags that though her painterly skills may still have a ways to go, her creativity is as good as it gets. She wants to make use of the mobility and scope of activity that is possible when one is a Servant to take in all kinds of experiences. Brimming with curiosity, she believes it will become a source of inspiration for her.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CIyoo~!

If we suppose that it is true, it would make Oui his great-great-grandchild.</p><p>It is said Oui loved watching fires.<br> The first pseudonym that Oui went by is speculated to be Katsushika Tatsujo. Perhaps she liked dragons (Tatsu) from the very beginning.</p><p>Her younger sister Onao was born with poor eyesight and so was entrusted to a convent only to later die an early death in her teens due to her weak body. The energetic and preposterous disposition that Hokusai (Saber) possesses is partially an expression of the sentiment Oui had in trying to cheer up this weak little sister. As she could not convey her feelings through her usual forte in painting to her blind sister, she did so instead through tall tales.</p><p>Nevertheless, for Oui herself, the experiences that coincided with her sister\u2019s death\u2014her moving back with her father from her marriage family, and her works not being fairly evaluated due to living under his shadow\u2014eventually culminated in a period that was a turning point for her not only as a painter, but fostered a necessary growth in her as a human as well.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>First appeared in the event \u201CHere We Come!

For some reason she has changed into a swimsuit and in this Saber form now set out to become the greatest blademaster in all the lands. Having deemed his daughter helpless on her own, poppa came along and managed to just barely maintain her Saint Graph.</p><p>In her ardent desire to surpass her father she fancies herself having succeeded to his name and so tries to introduce herself as \u201CKatsushika Hokusai\u201D even though she\u2019s still rather inexperienced.<br> Still, she hides within her a luster not present in the adult Oui.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Three japanese katanas and one western sword.
