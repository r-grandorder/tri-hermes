Xuanzang Sanzang\u2019s whole body is wrapped in an aureole, and she temporarily attains a limited Buddha Mode. She can repel most attacks in this mode, and although her offensive power is not even that much, she has high resilience by further being able to repel mental interferences and push aside abnormal status attacks in addition to keeping up a large recovery ability continuously around her own position. However, after using this, her entire Saint Graph will be destroyed and Xuanzang Sanzang will disappear.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: atashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / anta / \u25CB\u25CB<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ano hito</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A bundle of curiosity. Xuanzang Sanzang loves adventure! A figure brimming with the spirit of inquiry towards the unknown with an unwavering self-confidence. Although gracefully silent as a beautiful and faithful monk, her spirit that is overflowing with a desire to challenge herself is decorating her facial expressions, and it truly does not conceal her nature of having an unyielding spirit. \u201CAs long as there are the chippings of the adorable songbirds that signal the morning\u2019s rise, and the divine protection, compassion and guidance of the Honourable Buddha, my journey won\u2019t be hindered by anybody and everybody!\u201D</p><p>Xuanzang Sanzang is confident in herself\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014or so it looks like with an open glance of her. As a matter of fact, the reason she is confident in herself is in regard to the sacred Buddhism religion, so she does not believe in even the slightest in her very own self as such a magnificent person. She is also not self-aware of herself as a talented student. Although she remembers only a faint bit concerning her experience of being kicked out of the heavens for having deceived Master Tathagata in the spur of the moment in the heavens, the root of her is humble given that it is permeated with the depths of her memories.</p><p>Xuanzang Sanzang appears strict, but her nature is gentle. Especially to the weak, she is earnestly kind, and if a person is troubled, she will not forsake them. She is extremely positive thinking-oriented, but that is not because she is happy-go-lucky; it is because she has an unshakable belief called \u201Cbeing rewarded if one perseveres three times the hardship.\u201D<br> Taking into consideration that she is never mistaken regarding the \u201CWay of Man\u201D, she often becomes lost during her travels. And because she gets lonely when she becomes lost, she cries before long.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Xuanzang Sanzang recognizes her Master as a \u201Cdisciple\u201D. Frankly, she is strict to her companion that she deemed as a \u201Cdisciple\u201D. Although, given that she expects a growth from them that progresses them down the tough path of a \u201CBuddhist disciple\u201D sufficiently to the point that they will receive the same rewards like any other Buddhist disciple, when it comes to the crunch, she will be gentle either way.

Travelling through the Silk Road in search of the original Buddhist scriptures, it resulted in Xuanzang Sanzang heading to India from Central Asia, before bringing back to China sutras amounting up to 657 items from India and becoming the founder of the Chinese Faxiang Buddhist sect.</p><p>Xuanzang Sanzang is also known as a key character in the Chinese novel \u201CJourney to the West\u201D. Receiving a command from Guanyin, this beautiful monk, while riding Bai Long (Yulong) \u2013 the son of the Dragon King of the West Sea who transformed into a white horse \u2013 had Qitiang Dasheng (Great Sage Equal to Heaven) Sun Wukong (Sun Xingzhe), Tianpeng Yuanshuai (Marshal Canopy) Zhu Bajie (Zhu Wuneng) and Juanlian Dajiang (Curtain-Lifting General) Sha Wujing (Sha Heshang) as her disciples, and she headed for India without ever losing heart in the face of the many monsters obstructing her path.</p><p>In \u201CJourney to the West\u201D, it is said that Xuanzang Sanzang originally lived in the heavens as Jin Chanzi (Golden Cicada), a disciple of Shakyamuni, but she fell into a secular lifestyle because of a \u201Ccertain incident\u201D being the impetus. In other words, Xuanzang Sanzang is the reincarnation of Jin Chanzi. (It is because of this that the Demon King and the monsters are enticed by and tried to eat Xuanzang Sanzang\u2019s flesh again and again during the story of \u201CJourney to the West\u201D. If one eats Xuanzang Sanzang, one gets to acquire a tremendous power associated with eternal youth.)</p><p>Xuanzang Sanzang had a Prophecy of Future Enlightenment and became the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit, so she is originally not a being that can respond to a person\u2019s summoning, even with the one done by Chaldea\u2019s system. Materializing and being successfully summoned at this time is only because of these exceptional circumstances. The phenomenon called the Human Order Incineration; that alone, must be perceived as an extremely serious threat.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Xuanzang Sanzang mainly makes use of bare-handed techniques that appears to be taught by her teacher in the heavens. Also, she uses the weapons and techniques associated with Sun Wukong and her disciples, although Xuanzang Sanzang herself is not aware of this situation. Dr. Roman expressed jokingly that the fragmented thoughts of her disciples\u2019 worries for their great master may be lurking within her Saint Graph.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>The Enlightened One</strong></p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s always the Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s divine protection.

Although there are some divine articles as well as even more young Chinese characters, the finish is as you see, and it was also when I drew her that I at last understood why this design pattern was chosen when playing the scenario.
