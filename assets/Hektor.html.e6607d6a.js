That is, it is nothing but him extending the handle of the sword (spada) on occasions and throwing it as a spear. Although he cannot use both the sword and the spear forms simultaneously, even if he is summoned as either a Saber or a Lancer, he will always possess both the sword and the spear Noble Phantasms. To defend against this thrown spear, one must prepare a Defensive Noble Phantasm that is at least equivalent to \u201CRho Aias\u201D.</p><p>Also, both True Names of the two forms are strictly called \u201CDurindana\u201D, so even if the second half of the names are omitted, it is possible for Hector to activate them as Noble Phantasms and display the corresponding effects based on the form it is in.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronouns: ore / ojisan (Old Man) (during the moments where Hector is somewhat messing around)</li><li>Second Person Pronouns: anta / omaesan</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A general of the \u201Ccompetent yet lazy persona\u201D type, so to speak, that uses frivolous talk and displays an attitude of low motivation. Rather than saying it is calm, Hector\u2019s attitude can be seen like something a little jestful, but that analytical sight of his is perceptive. In the case where he judged his Master\u2019s orders to be made with mistakes, Hector will go against them with composure and speak in a way so that what he is saying can be comprehended. He is in a carefree mood from beginning to end, saying \u201CSeems there\u2019s no problem if it eventually goes smoothly.\u201D He is the type of person who would not unite with someone deadly like Professor Kayneth in an alliance.</p><p>However, having a resourcefulness thoroughly tempered for the sake of winning through the Trojan War, which became these hopeless defensive siege battles for the Trojans, one cannot conclude that Hector is called an irresponsible kind of person or a gambler that suddenly arose from the depths of his mind. It is surely because he was screwing around that he was able to prolong those hopeless battles up to that point. Even though Hector was eventually defeated\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014it was not only his individual military prowess, but him also having that daring smile worn on his face that made the Achaean army thoroughly suffer. Also, he was talented in provoking his enemies. From the way it seems, whether it appears to be in the middle of a battle or during a break, the impulsive Achilles was thoroughly harassed by Hector.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Regarding his Master, Hector\u2019s relationship with them is somewhat overfamiliar for him, bordering on an impression that can pretty much be called a relationship between retainer and lord. Rather than calling them retainer and lord though, it is more like Hector being a veteran sergeant towards a second lieutenant who is a stranger to the battlefield. In the case where his Master is of the unjust sort, he will run counter to his declared intentions and limit his wisdom as well while outwardly appearing subordinate to them.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CNooow.

He was called \u201CHector of the Shining Helmet\u201D. Hector scolded Troy who was at a disadvantage in regard to numbers, moved to the aged King who was his father, brought together the Trojan army, and continued to wage war against the Achaeans. When and after Hector lost to Achilles in a one-on-one duel, the Trojan side proceeded to decline.</p><p>Originally, the impetus of the Trojan War rose forth from the beginning when Paris, Hector\u2019s younger brother, snatched away Helen, the Queen of the Achaeans. Helen had received abuse from her husband Menelaus, and as far as Paris was concerned, it was a justified reason for him to save her back then. (In the first place, Menelaus married Helen for the purpose of reaching Elysium after death. Helen was a Priestess of the Moon Goddess, and it was a condition to marry her in order to reach Elysium.)</p><p>No matter what, Hector could not grow to dislike his younger brother, who was not able to look at the whole picture and completely made the situation worse by saving whichever person that ends up just before his eyes. \u201COlder Brother. I can\u2019t get used to becoming King. I\u2026 can\u2019t abandon a crying woman before my eyes after all.\u201D If they returned Helen, it might not be obvious that it will result in reparations in some way or another, such as the cession of territories and even Paris\u2019 decapitation in the case that they do so. However, Hector refused those options and decided to fight.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s no justice in this conflict. If that happens to be so, then it\u2019s really about the resentment towards Paris for harbouring Helen for himself.\u201D</p><p>And as he recited this to himself, Hector has decided that he will fight to the bitter end his opponents, the Greek heroes who gathered in the Achaean army, for ten years thereafter. Hector was viewed as the strongest warrior of the Trojan army, their army commander, and even a politician on top of that, easily betraying even the expectations of the gods and having cornered the Achaean army to the brink of retreat for a period of time.</p><p>However, the war situation was proceeding to be gradually overturned by Achilles, a hero loved by the gods. Although Hector held out somehow by sometimes repeatedly escaping and by sometimes repeatedly fighting, all while repeatedly making provocations, he was compelled to engage in a one-on-one duel in a semi-compulsory manner because of Achilles\u2019 spear, which was his foe\u2019s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Hector already resigned for his luck to run out, but on the other hand, he had not cast away his temptation for victory, and so he accepted the one-on-one duel, where he happened to lose that duel. However, he realized the secret of Achilles\u2019 body just before he died, so he carved a dying message on his body. Paris became aware of that message when Hector\u2019s body was later returned to Troy, and later on in the war, he happens to splendidly shoot through Achilles\u2019 heel by borrowing the support of the Sun God Apollo.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Achilles</strong></p><p>As a Servant, Achilles has not appeared yet in the Grand Orders.</p><p>\u201CHey, if he comes to stand out, I can say with confidence that this Old Man intends to run away immediately!\u201D</p><p><strong>Leonidas</strong></p><p>As similar defensive-type Servants, in one way or another, they would occasionally talk together about things such as \u201CHow are we able to hold onto these things in these situations?\u201D And among other things in the opposite direction, the talk would be about muscle foundations, so with that being the case, it does not result in much of a consultation then for Hector.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Someone who should be\u2026 a hero in the Trojan War\u2026 to an old man who feels like he is aloof from the world. The image I referred to is a middle-aged man who has the nerve to become useless. A shrewd middle-aged man is nice, don\u2019t you think? Because Hector was a very easy-to-understand character, it was fun to draw him. By the way, the design of his right arm is a creation added to him after his design was finished. I can tell you that, because there was a request that wants to have his Noble Phantasm direction be flashy, his right arm would be remodelled for that flow of emotion. Although this weapon of his also has a strange shape, the setting says that it can be either a sword or a spear by shortening or extending its handle respectively.
