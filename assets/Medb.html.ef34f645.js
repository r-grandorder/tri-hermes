This place is great!<br> There&#39;s so much space!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I did say, \u201CTake me someplace we can be alone...\u2661\u201D Hehe!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t expect you to play along when I seduced you.<br> I&#39;m a little impressed.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Thank you, Fujimaru. For granting my selfish request. But...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You lose points for having a third wheel.<br> Is that little shrimp your bodyguard?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> She&#39;s always around you, Fujimaru.<br> I haven&#39;t really cared to remember her name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Sorry. I&#39;m Senpai&#39;s ever-reliable Demi-Servant, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem. And of course, I&#39;m here too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As Fujimaru&#39;s supervisor, I can&#39;t let anybody get any strange ideas!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I see. Well, whatever.<br> I&#39;m not interested in either of you.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What&#39;s important is that Fujimaru heard my request, and properly granted it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And to willingly choose a place like this... You&#39;re way beyond lacking in a sense of danger, big shot.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If it&#39;s this simple, it&#39;s honestly too easy for me.<br> It makes me a little worried that you trust me this much.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got some time. So before we get started, let me ask you a question.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What do you think of me? Am I an Anti-Hero?<br> A prima donna queen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re a potential friend or lover?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I see. I don&#39;t mind you being so blunt about it, but that will never happen. After all, you&#39;re no warrior.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What I need is a warrior. I don&#39;t know how to handle ordinary humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... Prickly but with a heart of gold?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Heh. You make light of Queen Medb. But too bad.<br> You&#39;ll never see me cooing.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I was called to rule and to take from others. I only need talented warriors and fertile lands to plunder.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I came to Chaldea to scout this place out.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Just you wait. I&#39;ll make my preparations in secret, and invade you again and again.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Doctor Roman, was it? You should store the Holy Grails in places harder to find.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You look easy to seduce. If three more Servants as wicked as me get involved, the Holy Grails would easily be taken.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. Don&#39;t worry about that.<br> The locks on the safe were specially made by Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even I don&#39;t know how to open it! No matter how much I beg her, she won&#39;t tell me, damn it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So seduction won&#39;t work with me.<br> And even if it did, it wouldn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The ultimate security is ignorance!<br> No honey trap would be a threat!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nothing less from Da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s some skilled handling of the Doctor...</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Da Vinci... That pesky wench. I should be the only one with the body version of \u201CGolden Rule.\u201D</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Maybe I&#39;ll assassinate her... Casters are sitting ducks, anyway.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But there&#39;s something odd about her... Like she might turn into an Assassin if she needed to...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Medb. May I say something too?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmm? What is it? I&#39;ll answer if it&#39;s interesting.<br> But keep it quick.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right, I&#39;ll do my best. As you just mentioned, you&#39;re a Rider... right?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes. My class is Rider. I ride all day and all night.<br> What of it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, um... You usually fight with that staff-like thing...<br> So I thought maybe you were a Caster.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen you summon your chariot as your Noble Phantasm, but I can&#39;t exactly tell what&#39;s happening there, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You don&#39;t send the enemy flying, so I wondered what kind of attack it is.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh? Really? You want to see it? Do you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No! Is that really your question, Mash!?<br> Lancelot might give me an earful for this!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou, fou!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, not another word.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, as a fellow Servant, I can increase our odds of survival by knowing her tactics.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is also for your sake, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, I want to know too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No! You&#39;re too young to learn about the affairs of the Celtic heroes!</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really need to tell you what happens in that chariot, do I?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I am Queen Medb. The mother of warriors.<br> My class isn&#39;t Rider because I ride a chariot.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I ride men. Men!<br> I&#39;m a Rider, so it&#39;s only natural.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, um... That&#39;s...um...uh...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s so much fun, and it feels so good to ride that thing. It&#39;s exhilarating to be in control!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course, I don&#39;t mind being ridden, but I prefer to be in charge, you know?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Especially big strong warriors.<br> I get so excited, I want to put a collar on them!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You know what I mean? The stronger the warrior, the more my body goes crazy!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My very cells start to boil, and so many things get secreted in my head that makes me dizzy...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Each time it feels like I&#39;m being reborn! It&#39;s like honey. Once you start you can&#39;t stop!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I say, men get little pleasure in life.<br> I almost pity them.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A warrior merely kills the enemy. Such pleasure is trivial compared to the pleasure of birth.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I love a strong warrior. And I love the battlefield where I can find good warriors!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No matter what I become, this truth will never change.<br> I ride my chariot, I ride my men, and ride the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That is the way of Queen Medb, the invader.<br> Well? Does that explain things?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes... Not really, but I&#39;ve recorded your statements.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But um... You said \u201Cbirth.\u201D<br> Do you have children?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ve given birth to more than I can count. They&#39;re the foundation of a nation. You need them to protect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So... you like kids?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Not really?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> They&#39;re a pain to raise. I just let other people do that.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What I&#39;m saying is that a woman should ride all the men she can, and have all the children she can! It feels good, and it&#39;s a necessity.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, wait. I forgot to mention one thing.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Did I mention that \u201Ccreating soldiers\u201D and the typical \u201Cbirth\u201D are separate things to me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, you didn&#39;t. Please elaborate.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m the Queen of Connacht. So giving birth to soldiers isn&#39;t like giving birth to an heir.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> To make a soldier, I just need the bodily fluids of a warrior.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I take them into my chariot, we lie together, and then I prick my index finger and drip blood on to the ground.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Like mixing blood into mead, you see.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And then my beautiful new soldier is created.<br> It&#39;s like an instant homunculus.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a personal soldier that will never disobey me.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Unfortunately they aren&#39;t as strong as the original warrior, but my style is to compensate with sheer quantity.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Do you understand? This is how I fight. And that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> An heir is a different matter. It&#39;s more like, you know...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I won&#39;t bear an heir unless it&#39;s with someone I&#39;m head over heels for, body and soul.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (That&#39;s an unexpected maidenly comment...!)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Her moral values with that maiden attitude... She is definitely a pain...!)</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Anyway, enough of that! Back on topic!<br> Let&#39;s take off our clothes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We went back to a point in the conversation I don&#39;t remember talking about!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Why? Are you and Senpai going to...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m taking your Master. I&#39;ll cut off their head and use it to decorate my chariot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I never forget a humiliation.<br> I won&#39;t rest until I get even.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Fujimaru. I know that in this Singularity, you defeated my kingdom.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I have to do this, for my existence.<br> What&#39;s a queen to do without seeking revenge?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible! Once a contract is formed, Servants can&#39;t hurt their Masters!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Queen Medb may be a free spirit, but that doesn&#39;t change! We can use a Command Spell to get rid of her if need be!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe. That&#39;s not happening. Right now my selfishness holds sway.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Remember what I said?<br> I invited you, and you accepted.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That formed a geas bond. And it won&#39;t be released until I&#39;m satisfied.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Do you understand, my bratty little cattle?<br> It means you can no longer escape.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What a wicked smile...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a wicked honey trap...!</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hah! That&#39;s just the reaction I wanted to see!<br> That&#39;s the Master who defeated me once!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now fight for me, my soldiers! Show them the power of Celtic warriors!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Soldiers just appeared out of the ground! Get ready! She&#39;s serious, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;m always serious when I do something. Master or not, I always jump on the chance to devastate.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see who falls first!<br> Your Servants, or my soldiers!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Let&#39;s find out right now!<br> Here I come, Fujimaru, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Servant Queen Medb is attacking!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight her with all we&#39;ve got, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Queen Medb has been defeated!<br> She&#39;s also out of her seeds of soldiers!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Excellent work, Fujimaru!<br> And Mash, let&#39;s just say she ran out of stock.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> HOW COULD THIS BE!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I had everything set up perfectly!<br> I didn&#39;t let my guard down this time!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> They took me down head-on... completely!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She took a lot of damage, but her frustration is making her forget her pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s a good tantrum.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s a good whipping.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, that should have undone Medb&#39;s geas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her \u201Ctemptation\u201D was completely shot down by Senpai.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Watch your mouth! That&#39;s infuriating!<br> I wasn&#39;t rejected, I just wasn&#39;t strong enough!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If I was in my proper state, I could seduce anybody, man or woman!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This only happened because you&#39;re not strong enough to properly handle me!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If you would&#39;ve made me stronger, I could&#39;ve kicked your butt!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All you guys at Chaldea are just a bunch of wimps! Put me in charge, and the restoration of humanity would be done in no time!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And Fujimaru wouldn&#39;t have to go to the front lines, but fight from somewhere safe!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Forget it! I&#39;m leaving! Just make sure I&#39;m stronger before the next fight!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I won&#39;t say how to make me stronger, though!<br> Just use a Holy Grail or something! A Holy Grail!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hahaha. Yeah, not happening.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> How perfectly infuriating!<br> You dummy! I&#39;ll get you for this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I already used it, Medb...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh... Really? You used it on me...?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But wait, then I&#39;m a bad queen who still lost in peak condition?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, unfortunately. I&#39;m female, so your attack bonus didn&#39;t work on me either...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Tch! This won&#39;t happen next time. Make sure to create your party with only male Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Queen Medb has retreated.<br> Most likely she&#39;s gone back to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I see her response over here.<br> She&#39;s heading to the cafeteria at incredible speed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mmm, I bet she&#39;s going there to binge eat.<br> I hope she doesn&#39;t eat all of Chaldea&#39;s food.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Her frustration will help her gain maturity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The calories will help her gain weight.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. I was worried for a minute, but this should hopefully teach her a lesson!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And now we know what abilities Medb was hiding.<br> She can be even more helpful from here on out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it was Medb&#39;s way of getting closer to us. Though I doubt she realized it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I think in her own way, Medb is starting to trust Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since she&#39;s fighting out of frustration instead of hatred. Which means... you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. She thinks of us as friends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! I can&#39;t wait to battle her again next time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. She might just be an airhead.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><hr><h2 id="my-lovely" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-lovely" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My Lovely...</h2><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Are you here, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, thanks for announcing yourself with a whip crack.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh? A fine way to greet a queen.<br> You may just make a decent Connacht citizen yet.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Still, there&#39;s something to be said for being TOO obedient, you know? It&#39;s just not as much...fun, I guess?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Twitch)</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Whoopsie, what am I doing?<br> That&#39;s the whole reason I&#39;m here.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m not sure I follow, Medb.<br> Can I ask why you&#39;re here?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, frankly...I feel like lately I&#39;ve been going for my whip a little too quickly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm...did you just say \u201Clately\u201D? This has been an everyday thing from the moment we met you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are practically synonymous with the phrase, \u201Ccracking the whip\u201D in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m not talking about my actual whip, dummy.<br> I mean I&#39;ve been all stick and no carrot lately.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m a queen. That means I have to see to the whole nation, not just my own desires.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Sometimes, instead of the stick\u2013whip in my case\u2013I need some lovely carrots to win over those of my citizens who&#39;re too frigid to fall for\u2013</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Erm, I mean, who are stubbornly holding out, the poor things.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Once they see the light, they will have the honor of being a true citizen of Connacht, and accept the carrot and stick alike.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Tell me, is there another queen in this world more dedicated and tireless in working for her citizens?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> One so truly dedicated to helping each and every one of them find true happiness in their queen&#39;s warm embrace?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Not to mention one so gorgeous? Of course not!<br> Medb is utterly perfect in every way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah there&#39;s...definitely no queen like you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re, uh, certainly one of a kind.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Right?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Still...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been giving my citizens enough positive incentive lately, and it&#39;s got things all out of whack.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... I&#39;m not sure I quite understand what you&#39;re after, but bringing people joy is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you take it easy with the whip for a while, and start giving people thoughtful gifts...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I think that would be a great way to improve your standing among your people!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What exactly do you have in mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to give them a present. Something that will make my people weep with joy and find a whole new appreciation for me!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always had it, but since I could never bring it to Chaldea for some reason, I&#39;ll just have to make it again.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Master, Mash, I expect you two to help me collect the materials I need. Got that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How will we collect them? Will we need to go mining? Hunting? Something else?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How are we supposed to collect these materials?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe, as if you need to ask. I am going to exercise my God-given right as queen for a little bit of...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...requisitioning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (So she wants to take things from her citizens, and use their own stuff to make a gift for them? Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose?)</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> First, we need something for the foundation.<br> I heard we&#39;d be able to find it around here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?<br> Do you hear that, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. I smell alcohol, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That sounds like...a party!</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hehe... Hehehe. What a wonderfully tragic banquet this turned out to be! I love it!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Here we are, a group of oni, sitting out in the open and having a hanami picnic in broad daylight! I bet if any human happened by and saw this they&#39;d jump out of their skins in terror!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Now keep those dumplings coming! And don&#39;t expect me to leave any for you lot. I&#39;ve always got room for more dumplings!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Go on then, drink up. Don&#39;t be shy.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Oh I&#39;m drinking plenty, don&#39;t worry. Mmm, I didn&#39;t know Japanese alcohol tasted so good! I like this!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t know about Japanese alcohol. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the contents of that gourd in particular that are so special!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufu, I know I&#39;m the one who invited you two here and all, but I&#39;m still surprised how much oni wine you&#39;ve been able to drink without so much as a hiccup!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s veeery impressive.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re this country&#39;s Dionysus, or some kind of satyr, but whatever you are, you definitely know your liquor.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> But, eh... Human wine, oni wine...<br> Who cares? All that matters is how good it tastes!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> You said it! Now give me another bottle! This stuff goes down so smoothly, it feels like I&#39;ll never get drunk!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Tch... Dammit, I&#39;m gonna have some wine too, Shuten! It&#39;s too good to waste on them!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> So this is what Japan calls \u201Chanami,\u201D huh?<br> Incredibly delicious wine, beautiful flowers...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Mmm, I could get used to this. I&#39;ll have to move this country up on my schedule of conquest...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hup.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> What&#39;s the big idea?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Tch, missed agaaain! The more kingly you act,<br> the more it makes me want to kill yooou!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hahaha, this added tension makes the wine go down even better. Go on then, drink up! Try and kill me if it makes you happy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like the heavy drinkers are having a hanami picnic...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This party could easily go one of two ways: completely without incident, or incredibly dangerous...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> There they are. You there!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm? Oh, if it isn&#39;t the queen of the Celts.<br> Fancy seeing you here. Care to join our picnic?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hell no. Just shut up and hand over the wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm? This isn&#39;t a liquor store, you know.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I know, and I don&#39;t care. I need the wine,<br> and as queen, I&#39;m officially requisitioning it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m preeetty sure I am not one of your advisors,<br> and I&#39;m deeefinitely not one of your subjects.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m not so crazy that I&#39;d make someone like you one of my advisors.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So this is just me giving you a simple order.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> We&#39;re both beautiful and we&#39;re both wicked,<br> so I demand you cooperate.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ohhh, I know who she is now, Shuten. This is that idiot of an oni who likes bathing in hot springs.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufu, I think you&#39;ve already had too much to drink, and you haven&#39;t even touched my wine.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I&#39;m like you. I don&#39;t get intoxicated,<br> I AM intoxicating. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Wait, wait! Are you serious about this, Queen Medb?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> This wonderful hanami requires both wine and scenery in equal measure to be properly enjoyed.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> We will not be able to enjoy ourselves if you take our wine back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Yeah! You better not be serious about taking it with you. This is OUR wine!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> You can&#39;t just take it!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fair!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um... Let&#39;s all just try to stay calm, okay, everyone?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> We are calm.<br> Not our fault that queenie here is having a cow.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You know, speaking of cattle, you remind me of Raikou. Charging headlong into a situation, oblivious to everything you think doesn&#39;t matter...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d be careful if I were you.<br> The penalty for insulting a queen is death.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmph. I don&#39;t like this whole high-and-mighty act of hers. She&#39;s not better than us.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I can&#39;t enjoy my dumplings like this.<br> Wanna kill her, Shuten?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm, you&#39;re right. Maybe we had better show her what happens when you try to boss oni around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just take it easy, everyone! Please!</p><hr><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hmm. Your request is certainly reasonable, Master, but I am afraid there is no peaceful resolution here.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I&#39;m used to taking what I want.<br> I certainly would not let anyone disturb my parties.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> If this queen means to ruin our hanami,<br> she&#39;d best be prepared to face the consequences.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You know, you&#39;re pretty easy on the eyes. I wouldn&#39;t mind adding you to my collection if only you didn&#39;t reek of alcohol.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Gahaha, I&#39;m impressed! I think you may be the most uncompromising queen I&#39;ve ever met!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> However, my wives were all strong women too, just like you. I wonder how well your strength matches theirs?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Hmm? I just had a flash of insight,<br> and all because I&#39;m not the least bit drunk!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s a queen, so that makes her sorta like a lady king, right?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Yay! Mind if I just go ahead and assassinate you so we can get back to our hanami?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now that I get a good look at you, you kind of look like a cherry blossom tree yourself, what with that outfit and the pink hair.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you do something useful and go tie yourself to one of the trees so we can enjoy the show?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I thought I told you that the penalty for insulting a queen is death. Did you not hear me, or are you Far Eastern demons as dumb as you look?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, no matter. I am a merciful queen, lenient to all my subjects, including country bumpkin oni who don&#39;t seem to know any better.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If you refuse to hand over your wine peacefully,<br> I&#39;ll just have to pry it out of your cold, dead hands!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t sound lenient at all! M-Master!<br> We need to stop them before this gets out of hand!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hmm, well this won&#39;t do.<br> Maybe I have had a little too much to drink.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Not sure if it was the oni wine or the sweet Celtic mead, but whatever it was, it must have been powerful stuff indeed to make me back down from a fight...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Same here. I&#39;m full to bursting after all those dumplings. Of course, I&#39;ve always got room for a human or two...hundred, but right now...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> (Zzz)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The hanami picnickers are all down for the count,<br> so that just leaves... Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It looks like they&#39;re...hitting it off?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No way! You always make guys you like literally spill their guts for you? That&#39;s awesome!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I could never do that myself, and I wouldn&#39;t want to anyway since it&#39;d make them worthless as soldiers, but that&#39;s definitely one way to make a guy literally fall for you!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a little bit of an oni in you, don&#39;t you, sweetie? Fairy blood, you say? Iiinteresting...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure what happened during the battle, but they seem to be having a lively conversation now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is the scariest girl talk I&#39;ve ever heard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess...it just goes to show the power of having things in common?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It may look like they&#39;ve reached an understanding...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but I also get the feeling they could go right back into a fight to the death at the drop of a hat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suppose it reflects well on how open-minded they both are...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Say, what is it you want to do with my wine, anyway?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, did I not mention that?<br> Well...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Hmm, Is that so? That sounds kind of intriguing. Can&#39;t remember the last time someone entertained me instead of the other way around.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> In that case...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t mind sharing some of my wine with you. Although...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I know.<br> I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s ready.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...you got what you wanted?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe, don&#39;t underestimate the power of royalty.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course the people I choose to requisition from are going to cry tears of joy and celebrate this day for the rest of their lives, like a second birthday.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Anyway, that takes care of the first item: wine with high magical energy affinity. Excellent wine at that since it&#39;s basically her purified magical energy!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s go requisition the next item!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what do we need next?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Good question. Here&#39;s a hint.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s something...very sweet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sugar?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ooh, so close. Yes, sugar is sweet,<br> but it&#39;s not what we&#39;re after.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something sweet that&#39;s not sugar...<br> That could be any number of things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Romance?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Pffft!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medb! There&#39;s no need to be rude!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I thought that was a lovely response! Even poetic!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, I&#39;ve only ever read about romance in books, so I couldn&#39;t tell you exactly how it&#39;s sweet, but...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re right. Romance IS pretty sweet. Hehehe.<br> I just never expected to hear that here.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> (Sigh) Okay, since you&#39;re as adorably clueless as ever, Master, I&#39;ll go ahead and spell it out for you. Honey. We&#39;re here for honey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. True, honey is definitely sweet.<br> But, are we really going to find it here?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I heard there&#39;s someone here who has it in ample supply. Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Huh? Honey?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother playing dumb.<br> That witch in the purple robes told me you had it.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Well sure, I always keep some on hand to make kykeon.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Not every recipe uses honey,<br> but Aeaea Island kykeon calls for lots of it.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> ...Hold on a minute. You didn&#39;t come all this way just to demand I hand over my honey, did you?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well obviously. I&#39;m Queen Medb!<br> The woman with charm sweeter than any honey!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> That&#39;s obvious, is it? Maybe to you, but not to me.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> But before we go any further here, let me give you my answer: hell no. I mean, how am I supposed to make kykeon without it?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Not to mention it&#39;s an essential sweetener for the other dishes in my banquet.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> In fact, you showed up at just the right time, Piglet.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been waiting for you to show up or anything. More that I was just thinking how I might entertain you if you did. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Now I can test those ideas and see if they work.<br> That&#39;s all I care about. No, really.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Anyway, just sit tight and I&#39;ll make you some welcome kykeon right now. Know how they say anyone who shows up late needs to chug three drinks to catch up? I&#39;m sure you understand where I&#39;m going with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yum, I can&#39;t wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m kind of already full right now, so...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Well, then we&#39;ll have to take a walk to burn off some of those calories, won&#39;t we!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> But as I&#39;m sure you know, this island is riddled with rocky paths and uncertain footing. So, much as I&#39;d rather not, I guess it falls to me to ensure my Master&#39;s safety and all.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> All right, you&#39;ve convinced me. Just hold my hand while we walk together and everything will be fine.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> ...Anyway, queen of the Celts, you can&#39;t have my kykeon honey and that&#39;s that! Just give it up and leave already!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> If you want honey so badly, go talk to the young Medea. She always keeps it on hand for pancakes.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want just any old honey.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I need honey so tantalizingly sweet the smell alone would make you quiver all over.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Something so alluring a man would kill his own family for it... That&#39;s the kind of honey I&#39;m looking for.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But since there is no such honey, I thought the stuff used by the witch of Aeaea would be a decent substitute.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You should be honored to give me your honey.<br> Now hand it over.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> A substitute! I hardly see why I should be honored, but THAT is why you&#39;re interfering with my kykeon making!? What do you take me for!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Actually...now that I think of it,<br> I have an even more basic question for you.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What&#39;s kykeon...?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Wha... Wha... You didn&#39;t even know THAT!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong></p><p>This is beyond ridiculous!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> ...Fine then. You want to know what kykeon is?<br> I&#39;ll tell you what kykeon is!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Most people know it by its jingle, which says that it&#39;s delicious, nutritious, improves your complexion, and makes you lucky in love...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> ...and these days, there have been pictures of people in bathtubs full of money talking about how kykeon led to their success.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Hehe, I tell you, it&#39;s not as easy being a trendsetter among trendsetters as you&#39;d think!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Are you getting it now? As for what it looks like... I&#39;m fresh out at the moment, so I&#39;ll have to conjure up an illusion.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> There, see for yourself! Doesn&#39;t that make you want to dig in right this moment?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> I can see you gazing longingly at it too, Piglet! How utterly shameless of you! What am I going to do with you!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Anyway, now do you understand? If you take my honey,<br> I won&#39;t be able to make this any\u2013</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, I got that. I&#39;ll admit, this kykeon stuff does seem pretty healthy, and I like that it&#39;s good for your complexion too.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Right? Right!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But you know...I can&#39;t get over the fact that it&#39;s just so, well...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...plain.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean, plain!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> W-well... Maybe I can admit that it lacks the presentation of a fancy entr\xE9e, since it&#39;s technically porridge, but...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> No! On second thought, I will NOT admit that!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If I were you, I&#39;d try to dress it up a little.<br> Add a few more ingredients, a little color...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Really, the whole porridge thing is kind of old-fashioned to begin with, so maybe try and work out something a little less watery and dull?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I mean, this is supposed to be a dish you pull out to snag a guy you&#39;re interested in, right? Don&#39;t you think it being plain is a fatal flaw, then?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Stop! I don&#39;t want to hear it!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> You... You...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Of course I know that!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> But if I start dressing it up,<br> it won&#39;t be kykeon anymore!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> This is my thing! I can&#39;t just throw it all out and start over as the Queen Witch of risotto or something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, the Queen Witch looks like she&#39;s about to burst into tears! Medb must have touched a nerve!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Poor Queen Witch...)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Are you...pitying me, Piglet?<br> That does it! I can&#39;t take it anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Auntie looks so cute right now...)</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> I can feel you staring at me, Piglet. Normally I&#39;d be happy about that, but not right now. I am DONE!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Prepare yourself, queen of the Celts! I&#39;m going to turn you into a piglet and see how your meat works as a topping for my kykeon!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> ...Yes, a topping, not an ingredient.<br> I&#39;m not making fried rice here.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If anyone&#39;s becoming a pig here, it&#39;s you.<br> After all...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...what goes together better than swine and whips!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Dammit!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Good! Now I&#39;ve got the witch&#39;s honey too!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> And after Master came all this way.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> This was the perfect moment for me to have had kykeon ready to serve, and I didn&#39;t. I blew it.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> I only get one chance to meet the sailors that stop by this island. Once that passes, that&#39;s it, they&#39;re gone... Not even coming back as a Heroic Spirit is enough to let me forget the ones that got away...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... Do you think you could say something to the Queen Witch to help her feel better?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kykeon is the only food that I always wants seconds of!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll come back for kykeon once you have some honey again!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Really? You mean it? You promise? I&#39;m gonna turn you into a pig if you&#39;re lying, okay?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> Well, okay then. I guess I can wait. I&#39;ll make sure everything&#39;s ready the next time you come here.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A:</strong><br> All right, Queenie, you got what you came for, yeah? Good! Now get lost. Besides, you stink of fairies and alcohol, and I&#39;m sick of it.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmph, I was just leaving anyway. I still have to get the last component, after all.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Although...this one&#39;s going to be the biggest hassle. You have to do a little ritual thing to get it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ritual...?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Here&#39;s a question for you two...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Where can I find a prime specimen of cow?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I-I see. Those certainly are impressive.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The gloss, the sheen, the sheer size...<br> That is definitely a grade A cow.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Oh yes. Absolute prime all the way, Medb!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I&#39;ve attempted to land her a number of times, but I&#39;ve yet to lay so much as a finger on those beauties.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Perhaps it&#39;s the same principle as building a tolerance to electricity through repeated jolts, but the numbness I feel throughout my muscles is just as stimulating as what I get from training...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...can I ask what Fergus is doing here?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> He seemed like the right man for the job, plus, he used to be on my side anyway, so I asked him to play the same part now that he did back then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I loved Medb with all my heart back when I was a general of Connacht.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I see no reason to refuse a request for help.<br> So, what do you think, Medb?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, you were right. If someone bragged about this cow to me...I don&#39;t think I could contain myself.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m already jealous enough as it is.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All right! I am queen, so I can&#39;t have anyone showing me up! That means I need to find a cow that&#39;s just as amazing as this one!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Luckily, I&#39;ve heard rumors of an amazing bull that should do the trick nicely.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see about borrowing it. Onward!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Excuse me, but...what was that all about...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, just don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Honestly, I haven&#39;t the foggiest.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All I can say for sure is that I have another bad feeling about what&#39;s going to happen next...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> As queen, I hereby requisition that bull!<br> Hand it over!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> My queen is a woman of few words,<br> so allow me to elaborate on her behalf.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Queen Medb, the former ruler of Connacht, once competed with her husband, Ailill, to see who had the best possessions.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Their treasure alone wasn&#39;t enough to settle the score, so the next thing they compared was livestock.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Unfortunately for Medb, she did not have a cow that could match up to Ailill&#39;s incredible steer, Finnbhennach.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Finnbhennach used to be mine, dammit! I never would&#39;ve lost if he hadn&#39;t gone off to Ailill&#39;s side at some point!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> So now, Medb would like to borrow the fabulous cow said to reside in Cooley, in the neighboring province of Ulster.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Uh, yeah, I still have no idea what you&#39;re on about.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> You want...to play...with Euryale...and me?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here to play. You should be honored that the queen herself has come here asking to borrow your bull.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s not like he&#39;s MY bull...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I just like riding him better than walking. And where do you get off talking to a goddess like that?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m at least as much of a goddess as any old Greek bimbo.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m the undisputed queen of Connacht. My subjects worship me, I rule over them with a benevolent iron fist, and they show no mercy to any who might threaten our land.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What&#39;s a little pissant goddess holed up on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere compared to that?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What was that? That does it...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t...bully...Euryale!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I&#39;m not being bullied!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, have you seen C\xFA anywhere?<br> I sent him an anonymous letter asking him to come.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn? Of course not. You think I&#39;d be here dealing with your nonsense myself if he was?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I&#39;d have sicced that dog on you the moment you started ruining my mood.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;d think he would be here, seeing as he&#39;s part of Ulster...but perhaps he saw through Medb&#39;s ploy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Whoever wrote this letter&#39;s in for it now!<br> I&#39;m gonna find them and plant my spear in their...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No, wait.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Whoever wrote this knew exactly which of my buttons to push. Suspiciously so, in fact.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...This is Medb&#39;s handiwork. She might not&#39;ve signed her name, but I can practically smell her all over this letter.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And if she went to the trouble of sending me a letter like this...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Nope, forget it. It&#39;s obviously another one of her harebrained schemes.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna pretend I never got this and go back to fishing! There&#39;s nothing like it to clear your mind!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmm. It&#39;s too bad C\xFA didn&#39;t show up,<br> but there&#39;s nothing we can do about that now.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, it&#39;s up to you guys whether I end up leaving this place with what I came for.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sh-shouldn&#39;t we stop them, Senpai...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. Abducting Asterios is going too far...</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Now, now, hang on, Master.<br> There&#39;s nothing to worry about.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Medb may be...Medb, but she is a true queen. I&#39;m sure there is more to her plan than she&#39;s letting on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh, I see... So, she&#39;s actually just bluffing,<br> and her real goal lies elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hmph... At this point, I don&#39;t even care about lending him out. I just hate the idea of doing what you want!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Get them, Asterios!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> We should play...together!<br> Let&#39;s all have...some fun!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe, that&#39;s more like it. I love putting rowdy bulls in their place. Plus, it&#39;s good exercise!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re about to fight! I am not okay with this!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hahaha, I never said there wouldn&#39;t be any fighting.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, everything will be fine. Medb&#39;s true goal lies in what comes before the fighting.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> It would have gone faster if C\xFA Chulainn had shown up, but as it stands, how long this goes on is up to them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll make it simple. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already noticed, Master, but this is all just a game.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> And as a game, the whole point is to have fun. As for what kind of game...I think you may have heard of it before.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You&#39;re taking part in a reenactment of the famous Cattle Raid of Cooley.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Not only that, two of the participants here even took part in the original one. Just keep that in mind and enjoy the show!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> (Huff, huff...) Not bad...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Ugh, I can&#39;t believe you made me work so hard.<br> Don&#39;t you know how frail I am?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> How do you not see that even just making us run and sweat is just plain rude!?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Are you okay...Euryale?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Leave...queen! From now on...no more games. You&#39;re already...bleeding. Keep going...and you&#39;ll bleed more!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh? I&#39;m bleeding? Where?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a little scratch around your navel...</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, what do you know. I was enjoying this little workout so much I didn&#39;t even notice.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Okay, we can call it quits now.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I mean we&#39;re done here. I got what I came for.<br> I never actually wanted that bull to begin with.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> The whole point of a game is in playing, right?<br> That&#39;s just as true for Medb too.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about what you can get from a game, it&#39;s about what you do in it. That&#39;s what she was really after, just the natural result of playing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come to think of it...Medb did say something about a ritual for this last component.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Indeed. That ritual was a reenactment of one of her most famous battles.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> And what follows naturally from that battle? Blood shed in pain. And that&#39;s exactly what she needed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Her own blood...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So her blood was the last ingredient?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you that?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually supposed to be different blood, but of course, we Servants can&#39;t bleed unless we incarnate.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So I figured I could make do with pain and blood shed in a battle that recreates one of my legends.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I doubt it&#39;ll reach my true Noble Phantasm&#39;s level,<br> but it should be a decent imitation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your true Noble Phantasm...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! Master, I think I know what she&#39;s up to now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen it in the database before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medb has a number of other possible Noble Phantasms besides her chariot, and one of them is\u2013</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehehe. Okay, let&#39;s start synthesizing these puppies.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ll start with Shuten-Douji&#39;s magical energy-melting wine, add the Queen Witch&#39;s tantalizingly sweet honey...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...and finish off with my blood. Mix them all together carefully, with a few little secret touches and...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehe... Hehehe! It&#39;s done!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s a variation on My Red Mead. The sweetest liquor I can easily command under my current rule...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My new Siren Song, Dazzling Mead!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Its scent eviscerates any man who would defy me,<br> and enthralls any man who obeys me...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s the perfect Authority for a queen who&#39;s all about taking what she wants! You rock, Medb!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not quite sure how you get mead from Japanese wine,<br> since mead is made from fermented honey...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, at least I think I know why it&#39;s called \u201Cred\u201D mead now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d be hard-pressed to drink some if someone offered me a glass now that I know how it got its name...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What is that, wine? Yikes...<br> It reeks of magical energy meant for Charm skills!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It might not be as strong as my gaze, but I doubt any ordinary human who caught a whiff of that stuff would be able to resist.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I thought you were a Rider.<br> What are you doing with a Noble Phantasm like that?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I&#39;d say that&#39;s because Medb is the Queen of Connacht first and a Rider second.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I&#39;ve also heard that fairy blood runs through her veins.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> No doubt that&#39;s because she needed fairy queen power to rule Connacht and keep it safe from its enemies.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Mmm, there we go! It looks, smells, and tastes perfect!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This&#39;ll be just the carrot I need to keep Connacht&#39;s citizens in line!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I almost forgot that&#39;s why you were doing this.</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You&#39;ll see. This will make my rule even more complete than it already was.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, no matter how my citizens choose to rebel against me, I&#39;ll be able to quell it with a metaphorical carrot and stick in equal measure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be honest, while I still have some...considerable concerns about this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...thinking about it from a more practical perspective...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I guess we should be glad that one of Chaldea&#39;s Servants has gotten stronger.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> So, what, she just used me to level herself up?<br> Now I&#39;m really insulted.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You&#39;d better make this up to me, Master.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> In fact, I think this calls for doubling my vacation time and doubling her shifts to make up the difference.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (They might both have Charm, but they use it in completely different ways...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (You don&#39;t use Charm so much as you zero in on men&#39;s weaknesses, so...)</p><hr><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Um...Euryale? What&#39;s...going on?<br> I don&#39;t...get it.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s nothing. Everything&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> But...we were...fighting. We hurt her.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hmm, how can I put this...<br> Let&#39;s say we were just play wrestling.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Wrestling! I&#39;ve heard...of that!<br> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s always...inviting me...to do it!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> So that&#39;s...how you wrestle.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> By the way, Medb, since I&#39;m officially here as your lover, and your Charm mead turned out nicely...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...what do you say we take this to the bedroom, have a glass ourselves, and see where things go from\u2013</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now that it&#39;s done, the first thing I&#39;m gonna do is give some to C\xFA!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Did he really think he could escape me just by not showing up? Silly C\xFA!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...(Dejected)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, there, Fergus...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although, I have to ask...are you really okay with drinking Medb&#39;s mead?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> You bet! Delicious booze is delicious booze,<br> after all. Who cares what else might be in it?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> As for the Charm effects, well, maybe I&#39;ll manage to shrug them off with sheer willpower...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...or maybe I already fell prey to her charms long ago. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Still...that&#39;s a good question. Will the Celts&#39; greatest hero agree to drink her mead?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> And if he does...will he fall prey to her Charm?</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong></p><p>...!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What is it, Lancer? Why&#39;s your rod shaking even though you haven&#39;t got a bite yet? Is this some kind of master angling trick?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No, nothing like that.<br> I just felt the most horrible chill down my spine.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...<br> I think something terrible is about to happen.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sorry Archer, I&#39;ll have to take a rain check on our fishing contest. Don&#39;t get me wrong! I&#39;ll still beat you when we pick this back up!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that every bone in my body is screaming at me to leave this place right now before...</p>', 616);
