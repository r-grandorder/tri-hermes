Even if it is insignificant in all that has happened...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Even if it was just me slaying my enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The indescribable sadness, anger, happiness, and more than anything\u2014relief, I can still remember it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Relief.<br> Yes, that can only be called &quot;relief.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Like when a scab is torn off, it&#39;s an odd pleasure. The fear that sent a shiver up my spine, it too has vanished into thin air.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But I was unable to touch the arrow that I myself had shot.

Also, I had nothing better to do, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who are you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure how to answer that.<br> You see, I am not entirely sure myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am a nameless man. The only thing that I remember is that I am an Archer Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I also have no idea where this ship will take us.<br> Though I am a Servant, I don&#39;t even know who I am.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It does seem that you are my Master.<br> If possible, may I accompany you for a while?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That is fine.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thank you. My name... Though I do not know it, I am sure I am an Archer Servant.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It is nice to meet you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where is Mash?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Mash? I am not sure...<br> There may be someone else inside this ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!?<br> Are you here, Master!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai\u2014!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who is that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A dependable Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness, Master.<br> I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I am (Your Name) Senpai&#39;s Servant.<br> My name is Mash Kyrielight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My charming Kohai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? Charming Kohai...<br> Oh, I am hardly that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I am still very much your Servant!<br> You must call me dependable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...at any rate...<br> Thank you...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here is our situation, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Apparently, during the Rayshift, we were blown off course by a strange Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we&#39;re unable to contact the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, who is that person?<br> He looks like a well-known Servant somehow.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I seem to have left my identity behind.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> However, I do know that I am an Archer. As you can see, I carry a bow for a weapon. So quite obviously I am.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, uhm...Excuse me. I don&#39;t mean to seem rude, but that&#39;s not a Class that can be determined by one&#39;s weapon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In this world where an Archer can wield two swords ([[Emiya]]), or strike with a club ([[Orion]])...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and even hurl valuable treasures at random ([[Gilgamesh]])...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit premature to assume you&#39;re an Archer just because you carry a bow.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> There is quite a variety of heroes in the world, it seems...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Senpai, what were you doing... Were you napping?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is so like you, Senpai. You&#39;ve been like that since I found you sound asleep in the corridor at Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I can even relax. In fact, I feel a little sick...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No matter how many times I&#39;ve been through this, I still can&#39;t get used to a ship deck during a storm...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Though this ship is quite sturdy, there could still be trouble if the storm continues...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> What was that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Ghost-type enemy.<br> Excuse me, but we could use your help!</p><h2 id="part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#part-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> (Part 2)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have annihilated them.<br> Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...How humiliating.<br> I was hardly any help at all. I&#39;m so ashamed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, not at all.<br> I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You seemed like you had doubts.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...You have a keen eye.<br> That&#39;s exactly right. I...have doubts about fighting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want to fight?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> A skilled Master must be able to understand a Servant, even if the Servant is not their own.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. For me -- battle carries only melancholy with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> I know not my True Name, nor how many Holy Grail Wars I fought, nor how many I emerged from victorious.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...But I don&#39;t think I have been defeated.<br> I have the utmost confidence in my abilities.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> If I suffered a terrible defeat, Master certainly would have ordered me to commit suicide.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Talk about confidence!<br> But what he says is not a lie, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Perhaps I remained undefeated when I was alive as well That is precisely why it is all feels so empty.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Whether I am victorious or defeated...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> It is all just an infinitesimal ship washed away by the enormous waves of time.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> The joy of victory has no meaning.<br> The humiliation of defeat has no meaning.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Therefore, nothing has any meaning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even your life now?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. It is not easy for me to say, but that is the present condition I am in.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> If it were not for your presence, Master, I most likely would have abandoned the battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even death?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> I am a Servant to begin with... I am sure I belonged to the warrior class long before as well.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Therefore, I have no fear of death.</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true, Archer.<br> You are not a warrior unafraid of death.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Who was that!?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> The man you are now is not someone unafraid of death.<br> You merely have not seen death.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> You achieved so much glory so easily and with so little challenge that you ended up tired of life.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Your philosophy has led you to nothing more than desperation. You merely have a low opinion of your own existence.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s not even martyrdom.<br> I won&#39;t allow you to take that path!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...Who...are you?<br> No, wait... Who am I?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> ...How infuriating! Even though I proclaim the truth, you still do not understand.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> The one and only person in this world that I cannot accept. That one person is you, bowman!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...ugh!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> A wild and crude shot. Is that the best you can do?<br> Then you had better restring your bow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Archer!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Calm down, please! He&#39;s not an ally, but that doesn&#39;t make him an enemy!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> ...I know. I know that, but...<br> That man\u2014I won&#39;t stand for him!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> I cannot stand your presence.<br> For whatever reason, I cannot stand your presence!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> \u2014Now that&#39;s a little more like it.<br> That fury. That unreasonable malevolence.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That arrogance is what makes you who you are. That aura of righteous anger is most fitting for the man who carries that bow.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Fire away without reservation.<br> Come on, don&#39;t hold back.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I won&#39;t pull any punches either.<br> I will run my shadow lance through your throat!</p><h3>(After Battle)</h3><p><strong>Archer:</strong><br> Haa, haa, haa...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> A tenacity that ignores the Class affinity...<br> Our fates are truly intertwined.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> ...But that is all for now.<br> We must each again inquire of the Bhagavad-Gita.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> We can continue this after that is finished. ...the Master over there, and the one who watched over that Master.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> ...I know it may be a burden to you, but I want you to guide him.
