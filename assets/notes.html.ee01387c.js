I guess I\u2019ve finally gone insane. She had long, wavy blonde hair and wore a pure white one-piece dress. Her face still had hints of girlish youth, and she had\u2026 a ring of light floating over her head? If this wasn\u2019t an angel, I sure as hell didn\u2019t know what one looked like.</p><p>\u201CGood evening.\u201D The angel bowed and smiled awkwardly.</p><p>Rubbing my eyes, I walked inside. The angel kept standing in the middle of the room holding the guitar, looking at me with some kind of anticipation.</p><p>\u201COkay, who the hell are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m an angel.\u201D She laughed. She smiled, a real one this time.</p><p>\u201CYeah, I can tell. What I meant was, why are you in my room? If you\u2019re here to sell yourself, you came to the wrong place. I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t make enough to buy an angel.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I\u2019m not here for that. Hm, what\u2019s the best way to say it? I\u2019d like to do your housework.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can do it myself. Get out.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow, I can\u2019t do just that. I can do anything!\u201D</p><p>Since she was full of confidence, I let her clean up the place. The result was more gruesome than an old tragedy.</p><p>\u201C\u2026uh, my cooking\u2019s perfect,\u201D the angel said, quickly putting up her pointer finger.</p><p>\u201CNo thanks. I can\u2019t eat factory produced food. It\u2019s too nutritious; my veins will rupture. You understand me?\u201D</p><p>The angel nodded. It seemed like she at least knew I was a human and not a member of an a-ray species.</p><p>\u201COkay, so what else can you do?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can play the guitar!\u201D she said, happily, stroking the guitar.</p><p>Her blue guitar was the type that used electricity to make sound.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that fit aesthetically with angels. And it wasn\u2019t just that. She was terrible.</p><p>\u201CGet out.\u201D I took the angel by the hands and forced her outside.</p><p>A few days later I went to the hospital.</p><p>\u201CThere is nothing wrong with your brain,\u201D answered a fish-faced doctor.</p><p>Every day after finishing my work, I wasted energy chasing away the angel. Eventually, I gave up.</p><p>\u201CThe sky is dark,\u201D the angel murmured as she looked out at the sky from the window.</p><p>An angel who didn\u2019t even know that. Figures. She didn\u2019t seem to be one of the artificial a-ray angels.</p><p>\u201CHey. Where did you come from?

She was too beautiful for the land of steel. Her golden hair was so dazzling it seemed like the warning colors of the poisonous animal.</p><p><em>So that means she\u2019s an illusion only I could see?</em></p><p>\u201C\u2026why is the manifestation of everybody\u2019s imagination in my room?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause you killed me!\u201D She seemed madder that I hadn\u2019t realized who she was than that I\u2019d \u2018killed\u2019 her. When I asked her if she came here to get revenge, she simply answered, \u201CWhat\u2019s revenge?\u201D</p><p>The angel turned out to be pretty handy, and over time learned many things. Now she\u2019s apparently grasped what cleaning means. The only exception to her skill was anything involving the guitar.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not getting better at guitar at all. I\u2019m playing it just how I imagine it, but what I\u2019m thinking and what\u2019s coming out are completely different.\u201D</p><p>Oh, so there was a song she wanted to play.

That why I wasn\u2019t surprised that an angel saw me as an enemy.</p><p>I came to this city a year ago. It\u2019s the strangest city in the land of steel. No plants can grow in the soil of this planet. In this city, however, there are many grey trees, and even some withered gray grass at the top of a hill. On the hill at the heart of the city, there are two giant trees that cover the sky. They reach the sea of clouds. They are called the world tree for their size.</p><p>I chose to be an angel hunter. Here, angels came down from the sky every day and attacked people like wild dogs. It was more an annoyance than a real problem, but if we left them alone, the city would be filled with angels. So, the city council hired hunters. I don\u2019t know if the angels had set landing spots, but I mostly saw them in the forest on the edge of the city.</p><p>Pulling the trigger of my gun, I felt the kickback in my shoulder. The naked angel slammed into the floor as the bullet hit its forehead. The forest floor was covered with leaves and countless dead angels. Walking across the rough earth, I re-entered the walled city. A beast man who handled another sector waved his hand as he approached me.</p><p>\u201CHey. How\u2019s it going?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh.

And so, a-rays were invented, and that caused the great war.</p><p>That\u2019s how pure humans died.</p><p>After the freeloader angel started living at my house, I took on more work. That angel ate food. The factory made materials for free, but only so much.

Instead, they were a sort of capture dish for the heavy particles in the air. Angel a-rays could fly without wings. Once the protectors of the a-rays called the Six Sisters, angels were considered to be equal in power as the Demonic Sword wielding Knights. Another way of saying it would be that they have the destructive capacity of a nuclear bomb all on their own.</p><p>As we drank more and more of our true selves were revealed, she asked a weird question.</p><p>\u201CHey, why do you use a gun?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHumans can\u2019t use grain like you a-rays, y\u2019know.

The temperature would pass the freezing threshold and the city itself would soon literally freeze.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be passing a second winter in this city.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of commotion in the city lately.\u201D</p><p>The angel said this as she looked out from the window.</p><p>The large window was bigger than the angel and looked like a church-window I saw once in a picture book.</p><p>The blond haired, bright-winged angel bent over with a sad expression on her face. Behind her, the city and the two [world trees] blurred like a mirage.</p><p>The whole world was that gray steel color. Only the angel was pretty enough to be a nightmare.</p><p>The angel looked down towards the distant ground.</p><p>The city was full of people trying to leave.</p><p>\u201CWhat is everyone doing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey are all moving out together. A neighboring area was destroyed by the 3000 meter Aristoteles. According to calculations, it\u2019ll pass through this city in three days.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAbove me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAbove us. It might collide with the World Tree. Either way, it destroys everything in its path. It\u2019s obvious why people are fleeing.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, so that\u2019s why everyone\u2019s so desperate to leave.\u201D</p><p>The angel said that and looked down vacantly.</p><p>With a last glance at the angel just standing there, I started packing up my belongings. I packed winter equipment and clothing, my personal air maker, and several guns into my bag. I decided to leave everything else behind.</p><p>\u201CAre you going too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, because I don\u2019t want to die. But not right away. I\u2019ll head out on my own after the commotion dies out down there.\u201D</p><p>The angel lowered her eyes sadly. Since she always looked happy for no reason, this made her look really lonely.</p><p>\u201C\u2026This may be our last day together, so let me ask you a question. What were you, after all?\u201D</p><p>The angel made a sigh with nothing under it.</p><p>I had only figured out that she wasn\u2019t the kind of angel known to me. That\u2019s why\u2026 that\u2019s why I wanted to know the truth, in the end.</p><p>The angel answered plainly, \u201CWhat everyone calls an Aristoteles.\u201D She looked at me like she was surprised I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Aristoteles. A thing that appeared suddenly on this planet and became the enemy of all living things. An unpredictable enemy with no obvious methods of communication, no clear living biological structure.</p><p>And that this was in a little city like this, in a room in a deserted tower, shaped like an angel, and playing a guitar? What kind of joke was that? No living thing on this planet could stand up against this creature; what a punishment from God.</p><p>\u201CReally? You?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, well, more the thing under this city, to be exact. What I used to be was shot down and fell to this place. It was an instant death. Trees grew there, and people started living on them.\u201D</p><p>The angel went on. This planet can no longer raise life. That\u2019s why green things wouldn\u2019t grow; but they could grow in some other life, from somewhere else.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m normally not like this, but it\u2019s how I ended up. What everyone calls the World Trees used to be my wings\u2026 or feathers on those wings. The feathers, as they fell, took what used to be my form. I was originally that sort of invasive species. They\u2019re not angels like the ones from this planet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you\u2019re still shaped like an angel.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause I\u2019m everyone\u2019s fantasy. My old body is already dead, but it seems something like my mind lived on. But I never had a concept of mind. The species of this planet have the wonderful ability to form shapes out of knowledge. Using everyone around me as a model, I made a shape out of the knowledge I\u2019d had but never used. I\u2019m shaped like an angel because it\u2019s the closest shape to what I used to be. That\u2019s how I was able to communicate with everyone; I created similar mental circuits. I was able to become myself by taking this form of the imaginary angel.\u201D</p><p>The angel detached herself from the thing called Aristoteles by becoming an illusion. She was able to know herself for the first time by becoming something other than herself.</p><p>She\u2019s no one, a realization of an image of an angel imagined by the people on their own.</p><p>\u201CAre you happy?\u201D</p><p>The angel happily replied \u201CYes.\u201D Only an illusion stood there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. An angel can only live within an imagination.\u201D</p><p>The thought of the definition of an angel. Wings, a halo, being really beautiful, and finally, that it\u2019s only an illusion.</p><p>After all, the things that bring you hope can only be fantasy.</p><p>When I thought about that, the angel sadly answered, \u201CYou\u2019re right.\u201D</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>\u201CI wish I was a real angel.\u201D</p><p>Looking more like an angel than any real angel, she said that.</p><h2 id="v-how-a-star-is-born" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v-how-a-star-is-born" aria-hidden="true">#</a> v How A Star Is Born</h2><p>The huge flying cross moved away into the ashen clouds. It had changed its course and was now disappearing from sight even as it kept pouring down its rain of judgement.</p><p>Seems like battle is over.</p><p>The plane I was on kept going higher and higher in the troposphere.

A pair of wings. A figure that somehow resembled a human. I shot that thing that looked like an angel. A bullet that was little more than a grain of sand to that thing drilled into its forehead and felled that angel.</p><p>In that moment. In that instant I pulled the trigger, our eyes met through the scope. There was no communication. That was all.</p><p>But since then, I kept dreaming of that thing falling through the sea of clouds, forever.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The angel that accompanied my plane woke up. One of her wings was ripped horribly.</p><p>As a high-ranking kind of a-ray, she was naturally forced to join this mission, and she jumped inside the plane after being badly wounded.</p><p>She only came in her to rest her wings, but we were out of luck. The moment she entered the open door, an arrow of light ripped through this plane that was too close to the Cross.</p><p>The light tore through her wing and the body of the plane, knocking her unconscious and knocking out the plane\u2019s AI.</p><p>And now, several minutes later, the unconscious angel slowly woke up.</p><p>\u201CGood morning.\u201D When I said that to her, she turned around and looked out. The thing called the Aristoteles was disappearing into the distance.</p><p>I told the barely conscious angel our losses, that our mission had succeeded.</p><p>The angel approached me joyfully. Unable to stand up, she crawled along the floor, her hand slipping on something wet. My blood had spilled out over the floor and dyed the angel\u2019s body red.</p><p>\u201CWhen you\u2026 shoved me aside?\u201D</p><p>Without answering her question, I looked out.

It was so absurd it made me laugh. \u201CThat doesn\u2019t suit your character,\u201D she said, agreeing.</p><p>We just kept on laughing without looking at each other. In a small, weak, gentle voice:</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve changed. You weren\u2019t this honest with your feelings before. So it is true that you found someone else than me.\u201D</p><p>I wonder if there really was such a person. Although if it was the angel who said she\u2019d rather be a fake, she must still be waiting in my room for my return.</p><p>They say that angels cure the mind, not the body.</p><p>\u201CBut that\u2019s not true. People don\u2019t change because of others. I was always like this. I just acted like I didn\u2019t care. I really was a good person. You couldn\u2019t tell, could you?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, really?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, really. I wanted to become a hero when I was small. I was immature, probably still am\u2026 you should go.

If we have more fire power than them, they\u2019re not unstoppable.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know about all that. They can\u2019t be judged by this world\u2019s common sense.

It\u2019s not <em>our</em> objective, but we have it. They arrived to fulfil the last with of this planet. This planet died by the hand of the lifeforms that lived on it. The planet itself doesn\u2019t grieve this. Even perishing at the hand of its own life is all right. A planet only has a will; it doesn\u2019t have meaning. But even it had expectations. The planet could forgive because its life would follow its fate. But mankind was able to live on, even on this dead land. This planet was frightened by the creatures that kept on living on top of its corpse and cried out for help at its death. \u201CPlease, wipe out the creatures that still live.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. That\u2019s what you were.\u201D</p><p>When I muttered that, the Angel said no, and shook her head.</p><p>\u201CThe only ones who heard the planet\u2019s cry were the other planets. I, no, we were the highest ranking species of those planets who heard the earth\u2019s death wish. For instance, the Aristoteles \u2018Heaven\u2019s Corpse,\u2019 what I used to be, was the strongest thing on Venus.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026What?\u201D</p><p>I\u2019d lost my ability to breathe without realizing it. Our enemies were the rulers of alien planets, where our understanding of the world meant nothing. The strongest creature on a planet was the planet itself. Mankind, fighting for our survival, was at war with 8 planets.</p><p>\u201CYeah, we have no chance. You got that right.\u201D</p><p>The angel nodded sadly.</p><p>\u201CAnd they have the moral high ground. Ugh. If humanity had accepted out end in the year 2000, we would have gotten away with just being the victim.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo! The ones in the wrong are the Aristoteles. They don\u2019t have any will. Isn\u2019t it awful to erase life without even wanting to?\u201D</p><p>The angel who learned to understand this world said that.</p><p>But \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cbad\u201D didn\u2019t matter any more on earth.</p><p>The only rule was whether you lived, or you died.</p><p>That\u2019s why\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019ve lived until now. Because I didn\u2019t want to side with death.</p><p>\u201CIt won\u2019t change anything. I don\u2019t have a reason to fight anymore. I probably never will again. At this point, if we\u2019re killing each other for no reason, we\u2019re all equal. Isn\u2019t that the simplest way to live?\u201D</p><p>The angel won\u2019t answer me.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you going to do? Even if you have the same objective, the Cross and you are different things, right? Then your body will be destroyed alongside this city. You said you died instantly, but that\u2019s by our understanding. I doubt how we understand death applies to other worlds. Aren\u2019t you still able to move?\u201D</p><p>The angel, looking down, shook her head.</p><p>\u201CNo. If I move, the outer shells of the wings will shatter. All the leaves on what you call the World Tree will fall. If that happens, uncountable numbers of angels will rain down. If that happens, everyone will die before the Aristoteles even arrives.\u201D</p><p>The angel said this gloomily.</p><p>She\u2019s right. The leaves on that cloud-scraping tree outnumber humanity. Billions of released angels would cover the whole planet in an instant.</p><p>\u201CBut you\u2019ll die if you don\u2019t.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all right. I am the people here. I am just an image they made.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey just gave you knowledge. You are different from us. To you, we are just accessories. You should shake off us. You\u2019ll feel lighter.\u201D</p><p>The angel smiled sadly, and once again shook her head.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know I am. But I can\u2019t help it. I love this place.\u201D</p><p>The angel said that with tears in her eyes and odd feeling of satisfaction.</p><p>How could I argue with that?</p><p>\u201COkay. I guess that can\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Yes, and as the Angel nodded her head, she stared at me. Her unblinking gaze asked me, how about you?</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going to die soon, you know. I think you can least admit that, and the heavens won\u2019t punish you.\u201D</p><p>The punishment already came when the planet irresponsibly broadcast its own death. As I packed my belongings on my back, I said.</p><p>\u201CYeah, I\u2019ll be honest, I love this city to. Anyway, since that first moment, I was possessed by you.\u201D</p><p>Huh. The Angel\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise.</p><p>\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt must mean I\u2019ve fallen in love with you since that moment. I only just realized that now.\u201D</p><p>When I said that, the angel\u2019s expression sparkled, but she quickly put her head back down.</p><p>\u201CBut I\u2019m not a human being.\u201D</p><p>The angel only just realized that.</p><p>Geez. She\u2019s a real idiot.</p><p>\u201CYou know. There\u2019s only one being left in the whole world, and that\u2019s me. What does that have to do with anything, anymore?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re right.\u201D</p><p>The angel nodded.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing left to talk about. The made my way outside as it grew nearer to the appointed time.</p><p>\u201CSee you. Go to someone with a better imagination, next time.
