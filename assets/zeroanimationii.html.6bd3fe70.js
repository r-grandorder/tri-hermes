Friends with Kinoko Nasu since middle school.</strong></p><p>What to do as a bonus for the Fate/Zero Blu-ray? That has been a long-standing question since the start of the project. After a lot of trial and error, the Einzbern Question Corner was born, featuring Miss Iri and Zero-chan. This extra is also a piece directed at Fate fans who joined us with Fate/stay night. In the Fate/stay night novel game, there is a location called the Tiger Dojo. It is a hint corner for players who experienced the bad ending that is meant to give them hints and tips to avoid that bad ending. The concept for the Einzbern Question Corner was for it to be like the Tiger Dojo, but for Zero. The extra visuals project kicked off right when the 1st season&#39;s broadcasts were finishing up and retakes were being done for the Blu-ray. The work was done in a studio that was the scene of a raging inferno as it was, and we only added to the flames. &quot;Making it in a picture-story format would keep the costs down, so we should be able to make it work...&quot; Which is what convinced President Kondo to green-light it, but we could only keep it up for episode 1. Episodes 2 and 3 drifted farther and farther away from the picture story format, to the point where episodes 4, 5, and 6, which we&#39;re recording now, are essentially regular anime. Mr. Nasu, who is doing the scripts, is a dyed-in-the-wool long-form writer. Back in middle school, if I asked him to write a 10-page short story, he&#39;s the sort of guy who would come back with a 100-page novel. Even though the speed of his output has dropped a bit compared to his twenties, but the quantity he produces hasn&#39;t fallen off one bit. The length of the bonus material for Blu-Ray BOX I was about 30 minutes. I heard from the studio that this was much more work than they had expected. And even though I made extra sure to ask him to make this one half the length of BOX I&#39;s, the finished script was twice as long. 50 minutes total. Seriously, this is an everyday occurrence at TYPE-MOON. And Mr. Nasu is just working normally. So, what does this Question Corner have to offer in Zero, in which all the endings are bad ones? If you stick with us until the very end, I think you&#39;ll find the answers, along with the love that the production staff poured into it. These are the zany antics of Zero characters that have been tacked on to the end of the story. I hope that you will enjoy them as much as you enjoyed the main feature.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Introduction</h2><p><strong>Special Issue</strong><br><strong>Gen Urobuchi (Original Story)</strong></p><h3 id="gen-urobuchi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gen-urobuchi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Gen Urobuchi:</h3><p>Born in Tokyo. Affiliated with Nitroplus. Notable works include the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica (chief story editor, screenplays for all episodes), the anime Blassreiter (chief story editor), and the game &quot;Phantom of Inferno&quot; (scenario). Writer of the original Fate/Zero novel. Participated in production meetings for the anime as the creator.</p><p><strong>&quot;When the team of ufotable and Director Ei Aoki so easily dispelled my misgivings at a test screening, I had complete faith that they would be able to surmount any and all obstacles.</strong></p><p>Fate/Zero was never a story made with video adaptation in mind. On the contrary, because of this lack of interest in visual adaptation, there are a great many scenes that rely on techniques that can only be employed in the print medium. The decision to take such a thing and adapt it into an anime, not to mention a two-season show placed within the constraints of terrestrial broadcast, with the stated aim of remaining true to the source material, can only be called foolhardy. To be honest, if I&#39;d only read the proposal, I would have burst out laughing, thinking it was a joke, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that ufotable (who had so successfully adapted the Garden of sinners) would be doing the adaptation.</p><p>In terms of degree of difficulty, I had always thought that the Garden of sinners: Chapter I was the toughest; a piece that was beyond &quot;hard&quot; and well into &quot;impossible&quot; territory. When the team of ufotable and Director Ei Aoki so easily dispelled my misgivings at a test screening, I had complete faith that they would be able to surmount any and all obstacles. And just as I expected, my expectations were met twenty times over.</p><p>Of course, even though I had absolute faith that they had the leg strength to leap over any ordeal, the height of the hurdles was never lowered one bit. It was only when I went to the studio to sit in on a script reading that I learned just how grueling an obstacle course race this had been, given the constraints placed on it to be a faithful adaptation.</p><p>The fence between print and visual media tends to look lower than it really is, but the fact is that their structure, concepts and the goals that they set out to accomplish are as different as the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. While visuals greatly surpass the imagination of the written word, there are some concepts that can only be conveyed by the written word. Visuals should only<br> strive to express, never to recreate.</p><p>The process of adapting a novel can be described as two athletes in a shot put event trying to land the shot in the same spot from<br> different starting spots. Now, imagine that everything about them is different: they have different builds, different degrees of strength, and even the weight of the shot puts are different. If the throw by the first athlete is the source material, then the throw by the second athlete, who is trying to land his throw in exactly the same spot as the first shot, is the faithful adaptation. Naturally, if he throws his using exactly the same form as the first athlete, the shot will land in a completely different spot. The<br> more meticulously you go about planning to hit the same spot, the more you will be forced to take a different approach using a<br> different form.</p><p>In this anime adaptation, a great many scenes are revised from the original novel, or were deleted or added. These all fall under<br> the &quot;differing form&quot; in my analogy above, and as a result, the second shot thrown by the anime staff landed in the same spot as<br> the one thrown by the original novel. It isn&#39;t the throw that should be copied, but rather where it lands. This is why it is impossible<br> to produce a proper visual work by simply lifting dialogue or scene descriptions from the novel and dropping them verbatim<br> into the screenplay.</p><p>Having taken part in both the novel and visual productions, the main difference I sensed was in how time was manipulated. The pace at which sentences are read - even though the author has some slight control over this by means of the rhythm of the writing style and so on - is fundamentally dependent on the speed at which the reader progresses along the page. The running time of a visual work, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t allow for audience interference. In a text medium, it&#39;s possible for the reader to slow down as they read an emotionally moving passage, or even reread it, or close the book and bask in its afterglow, but in a visual medium, every depiction washes over the audience at an even speed all in one go, and then is done and gone.</p><p>When all is said and done, let&#39;s say that reading is the act of directly pouring ideas into the consciousness of the reader, whose all five senses have been sealed, while viewing video could be described as a vicarious experience that is conveyed through only the two senses of sight and hearing. Inasmuch as video graphically appeals to the body more than text does, there is a faint visceral pleasure that is magnified while reading. It makes you start to want to interpret each scene of the story only as information. that can be more readily taken in by the body. The ability to have that urge stimulated is the visual medium&#39;s strength, while conversely, being able to skip that urge entirely and appeal directly to thought is the strength of the text medium.</p><p>To give a specific example, allow me to explain Berserker&#39;s flashback scenes, which were probably the most heavily revised from the original. In the original novel, it is a scene that jumps to an entirely different time period that is inserted right in the middle of the duel at the end. It is precisely because the depiction of the fight had been placed in the back of the reader&#39;s mind as a concept that it was possible to depict and link this to his past as a separate narrative thread.</p><p>With that said, in the visual medium, because the audience takes in the battle in the underground garage by means of sights and sounds, the scene has a sense of place which helps to make it seem as if they themselves are there. If the point of view were to suddenly shift to another time, another story, the tension that suffused that showdown scene would suddenly evaporate. Although humans can develop differing concepts in parallel, they can only focus on and process one viewpoint at a time. If the anime version had ignored this difference and stayed slavishly true to the original novel and revealed Berserker&#39;s past in exactly the same way, the viewers probably would have felt a visceral sense of incongruity and instantly been thrown out of the moment.</p><p>The same goes for the flashback scene where Gilgamesh reminisces about Enkidu. In the novel, I took care to write it with deliberately vague, ambiguous imagery to depict Gilgamesh&#39;s flashback so as not to ruin the afterimage of Excalibur&#39;s activation scene that immediately preceded it. However, this sort of allowance isn&#39;t possible in visual media. Every scene is depicted with the same resolution and the same sense of presence as time unfolds at the same pace. So with that in mind, they had no choice but to place both the catharsis of Excalibur and the information dealing with Enkidu on the table and decide between them. Of course, it was obviously the former that was more vital to the overall story.</p><p>I suppose the ideal relationship would be for the original novel and visual adaptation to be served as two different styles of cooking, with both different flavors and different ways of eating. If the sense of satisfaction and fullness after being fed either one is the same, it could be considered a perfect case of having your cake and eating it, too. Assuming there ever was a visual adaptation of an original novel that perfectly reproduced its source material, the novel would become useless wastepaper the instant that adaptation was completed.</p><p>My goal as the author of the original novel was to create something that would inspire my readers to go replay Fate/stay night after the curtain falls on this story. And that sentiment has carried over to the anime version, and I believe it has borne fruit in the ideal way. They landed their shot put smack-dab on the same spot. The ideas that I placed in the novel have been fired off at a new audience, and have reached more people than ever. The anime version has inherited Zero&#39;s spirit as a faithful visual adaptation.</p><h2 id="master-session-001-caster-side" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#master-session-001-caster-side" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Master Session 001 - Caster Side</h2><p><strong>Team Caster</strong><br> Ryunosuke Uryu: Akira Ishida / Caster: Satoshi Tsuruoka</p><hr><p><strong>&quot;An actor&#39;s greatest joy is being able to become someone other than who they are every day.&quot; -Akira Ishida</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;So I thought I would play him in a kabuki style.&quot; - Satoshi Tsuruoka</strong></p><p><strong>Akira Ishida</strong><br> Born November 2nd in Aichi Prefecture.

Lots of our scenes wrapped with just us two, so it seemed like we recorded together and then went our separate ways without working with anyone else. That&#39;s why I was able to get a fresh feel for the other teams while recording the anime.</p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> When we worked on &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; it was something that Mr. Ishida and I created ourselves, so we gave a lot of thought as to how we would smash and tear down the sense of tension in the recording booth. Those ADR sessions were thrilling, challenging, and a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>Apparently, the Caster/Ryunosuke duo was rather popular in some quarters.</strong></p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> We went to the caf\xE9 that ufotable runs. Ryunosuke and Gilles were popular. I was shocked that characters like them could be so well received.</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> There&#39;s a lot of strange people in the world. I guess this is proof of that (laughs). I mean, we are complete and utter heels (villains). Well, this show is wall-to-wall heels, but we&#39;re the most overt. You could badmouth Caster all you want, and no one would stand up to defend him. I have mixed feelings over the fact that a character like him is being well received.</p><p><strong>Where did you draw your portrayals of Caster and Ryunosuke from?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> Some of it comes from looking at the visuals. The bulging eyes say it all. I learned from reading the novel that he has a talkative personality, so I thought I would play him in a kabuki style in spite of the fact that he&#39;s European. I based his speaking style on big actresses and entertainers and decided that he would tend to use kabuki tones when he becomes emotional.</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> Back when I first played him in &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;Boy, this character is horrible&quot; (laughs). &quot;A character like this can only exist inside a story.&quot; Plus, since &quot;Sound Drama&quot; had no visuals, I had no choice but to rely on the insanity inside myself. Even at the risk of being misunderstood, I believe that Ryunosuke&#39;s emotions are ones that everyone has deep down. I thought I would give that a broad interpretation. I was a bit hesitant when I first started playing him, but then I gradually started thinking, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s fun to be able to cut loose like this.&quot; In the end, I&#39;ve managed to reach a place where I understand Ryunosuke, as dangerous as that sounds (laughs).</p><h3 id="discussions-about-god-that-cement-their-relationship" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discussions-about-god-that-cement-their-relationship" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Discussions about God that cement their relationship</h3><p><strong>Which scenes in Fate/Zero stand out for you?</strong></p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> Although I can&#39;t say for sure if Ryunosuke is smart or dumb, I thought his line of reasoning to accept the situation he finds himself in was really clever. His summoning of Caster might have been a complete fluke, and Caster might have been the one summoned because it was Ryunosuke who was calling. In any case, I thought it was fascinating how the thinking of Caster, who doubts God&#39;s existence, and Ryunosuke, who is a believer, mesh so well together somehow.</p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> There was the big God discussion in episode 13. Even though Gilles believes in God, his messenger Jeanne was killed. And to make matters worse, God did nothing to intervene. So given all that, he&#39;s confused about what God is. His feeling is that if God exists, He should punish him for the atrocities he&#39;s committing. The visuals for this scene are so beautiful. Light is streaming down from the heavens. I loved that light. Ryunosuke&#39;s explanation begins then, and it leads in to the scene where he and Gilles really find a kindred spirit in each other. That scene was a real positive moment for both Satoshi Tsuruoka and Gilles. Like we&#39;d finally gotten something we&#39;d been waiting and hoping for. That scene was so charming. It&#39;s hard for me to explain.</p><p><strong>And in the latter half of the episode, Caster summons that enormous monstrosity and it turned into a real spectacle.</strong></p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> In the latter half of the episode (#13), Gilles is absorbed into the monster, so frankly, there&#39;s no point of contact with Ryunosuke. But because of their discussion about God, he was able to be firm in his convictions and say, &quot;I shall do what I ought to do.&quot;When Ryunosuke is shot (#14), I was overjoyed that I was able to feel, &quot;Oh, no... Ryunosuke...&quot; That scene was original to the anime, and I recorded two versions after discussing the performance with Director Ei Aoki. One was an upbeat performance, like, &quot;But do not worry, Ryunosuke!&quot; The other performance, &quot;You have died and left me all alone&quot; was sadder, said as if he were cradling Ryunosuke. The former was chosen for the broadcast version, but at the end, I go, &quot;Behold, Ryunosuke!&quot; As a performer, I was happy that he had realized that Ryunosuke still existed somewhere inside his heart.</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> When I recorded the scene where Ryunosuke gets shot, I had a huge sense of accomplishment. Ryunosuke had managed to find his<br> answer, and he&#39;s suddenly killed while at the pinnacle of happiness. Even I felt a sense of satisfaction that he was able to die at the absolute ideal time of his life. But when I watched the broadcast, it was over too quickly for him (laughs)! For a character like that, someone who was so brutal and inhuman, to be killed so cleanly, I have to wonder if the audience was satisfied with that. I was even thinking, &quot;Didn&#39;t they have to torture him by pulling off his fingernails one by one?&quot; I guess for Ryunosuke, he died happy.</p><p><strong>True, Ryunosuke was definitely depicted as being happy when he died. Given the nature of Team Caster, what do you think they should have done to win the Holy Grail War?</strong></p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> I think they really just needed to apply themselves a little more. The thing that got Team Caster eliminated was that they never<br> went all-out to take the Grail.</p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> Exactly! Gilles is a slacker. He&#39;s always letting his hobbies get the better of him... (laughs)</p><p><strong>And because he let his extracurricular interests get the better of him, he incurred the wrath of the other Masters.</strong></p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> Yeah, he was able to summon that enormous monster that gave even Rider a tough time. Even if he could defeat that horror, it wouldn&#39;t affect Caster in the least, and even Rider&#39;s Ionian Hetairoi could only slow it down. And Archer wasn&#39;t the least bit interested in fighting it.</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> I think that if they&#39;d gone all-out, they might have even won the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Thank you. In closing, please give us any thoughts you might have regarding participating in this work.</strong></p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> There were a lot of times when I had to say, &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot;</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> (laughs)</p><p><strong>Tsuruoka:</strong> I had a lot of Ryunosukes around me (laughs). I&#39;m saying this as a voice actor, but it&#39;s rare to be in a studio with so many<br> mentor figures. There are a lot of other shows where I&#39;m the old man in the recording studio, but Fate/Zero was a precious experience. You definitely get a different vibe when you&#39;re in a studio with so many esteemed voice actors. I&#39;ll never forget my experience there for<br> as long as I live.</p><p><strong>Ishida:</strong> They say that an actor&#39;s greatest joy is being able to become someone other than who they are every day, but if I hadn&#39;t met Fate/Zero&#39;s Ryunosuke Uryu, I never could have given this performance, and I experienced sensations I never could have had on my own. Looking back, I&#39;m glad that I met him.</p><h3 id="animation-material" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p><strong>Team Caster</strong><br> Episode 14: &quot;The Mion River Battle&quot;<br> Episode 15: &quot;Golden Shine&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis:</strong><br> The rampage of Master Ryunosuke Uryu and Servant Caster has begun. As a result of Caster summoning an enormous Horror, the Holy Grail War is at risk of falling apart, and Saber, Lancer, and Rider decide to join forces. Caster&#39;s summoned monster, the F-15 that Berserker has fused with, and Archer&#39;s Vimana Noble Phantasm were all depicted using 3DCG. The battle between the keyframe-animated Servants<br> and 3DCG monster has tremendous impact. During the battle, Ryunosuke and Caster both meet their deaths with no regrets.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Director of Photography Yuichi Terao<br> Episodes 14 and 15 involved tackling unknown expressions and massive quantities of material. It was a huge help that 3D Director (Kojiro)<br> Shishido personally took on the monster and all related effects. This battle is the highlight of the second season. This incident is crucial to the story, and the know-how we on the digital team gained from it is what let us fight through to the bitter end of the second half of the game. Counting the 3D staff, the digital team has nine members. I firmly believe that we managed to make it through to the end because every last team member approached this show with love in his heart. This is one that will stick with me. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Ryunosuke Uryu</strong><br> Caster&#39;s Master. His fascination with, and lust for, death leads him to become a serial killer who commits murder after murder. He has two piercings, a chain at his waist, and a quiet disposition. The bracelet on his wrist is a magical item given to him by Caster, however, it is destroyed by Rin Tohsaka. Atsushi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Caster</strong><br> True name: Gilles de Rais. Doubting God, he becomes a Heroic Spirit to try to resurrect the holy virgin Jeanne D&#39;Arc. In the original novel, he is described as having &quot;huge, rolling eyes and oily, glistening cheeks.&quot; Because he was originally a knight, he has a muscular build. Atsushi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Prelati&#39;s Spellbook</strong><br> An autonomous, summoning mana power core. An unconventional mana power core, it has the ability to create original spells and rituals. It bestowed limitless mana on Caster, who is not an innate Mage, and gave him the ability to summon and control Horrors (i.e. monsters,<br> demons). The cover is inlaid with silverwork, depicting the face of a young boy. The otherworldly Horror summoned by Caster. It has no skeleton or internal organs. It possesses incredible regenerative abilities, devours anything and everything, and converts it to mana. Absorbing Caster, its summoner, into its body, it tries to come ashore onto the streets of Fuyuki from the Mion River.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Kojiro Shishido<br> Giant Horror Supervisor, 3D Director</p><p>(Regarding the Horror) I put a lot of effort into incorporating the translucent quality of squid and octopuses, details that would give the impression of disgustingness and massiveness. If I could have, I would&#39;ve made it a giant monster movie where a city gets totally<br> demolished...<br> (Finishing Fate/Zero) I&#39;m grateful to the staffers who pumped out such a huge quantity of 3DCG material. I know that we&#39;ll get criticized<br> that it looks different or sticks out if we incorporate 3DCG into Japanese anime, but since this show places visual impact above all else, I feel like that was a plus for us. Although I keep thinking that maybe I should have done this or that differently, I think that there&#39;s passion when you create something with limited resources, even in CG. I hope I&#39;ll be able to look back on this years from now and think, &quot;Boy we really pulled out all the stops on that, didn&#39;t we?&quot;</p><p><strong>F-15</strong><br> An air-superiority fighter jet utilized by the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force.

Of course, I also loved his scenes in bed and in the wheelchair in season 2.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> He tormented Waver as his teacher in episode 1, but he&#39;s so pathetic in episode 16 (laughs)... He schemed and maneuvered in<br> season 2 to try to win the Holy Grail War, but there were villains who were much worse than him. And to think his weak spot would be<br> someone so close to him.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> And Sola-Ui doesn&#39;t just break fingers, she gets her arm chopped off... But rather than giving an understated performance,<br> I guess you could say that scenes like that where you really put your emotions up front are a terrific way to relieve stress (laughs). Scenes where she&#39;s being incredibly cold toward Kayneth, scenes where she&#39;s begging and pleading, and scenes where she&#39;s screaming her head off, they were all totally worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> Lancer had quite a few great scenes, but I was struck by the scene where he curses them as he dies (episode 16), and by the<br> way he&#39;s shown as being so vigorous in the first half of the episode. He was so lively that when he&#39;s forced to kill himself, you feel even sorrier for him. I thought his suicide scene was handled delicately. There&#39;s an illustration for that scene in the original (the TYPE-MOON version). But they presented it differently in the anime. I was really impressed at how well they pulled it off.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> I bet that if we&#39;d applied ourselves, we would&#39;ve been the favorite to win the Holy Grail War. We&#39;re each very strong in combat. Look at Lancer, he fought Saber to a standstill. If only I&#39;d used that Command Seal in that episode to say, &quot;Now, take Saber&#39;s head!&quot;...</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> We&#39;re undefeated in battle. We&#39;re winning, in fact.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> If only love hadn&#39;t entered into it... Right?</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong> I know, right? --- (laugh)</p><h3 id="three-way-team-standoff-it-would-have-worked-if-one-of-the-three-weren-t-there" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#three-way-team-standoff-it-would-have-worked-if-one-of-the-three-weren-t-there" aria-hidden="true">#</a> &quot;Three-way Team Standoff\u201D It would have worked if one of the three weren&#39;t there</h3><p><strong>What did you think of the relationships between each of the three?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> I think that Sola-Ui never liked Kayneth much from the very beginning. Theirs was a strategic marriage, after all. But if it<br> weren&#39;t for Lancer, I think their relationship was fine for what it was. But then she fell in love with someone... I think that if one of the three hadn&#39;t been on the team, they might have pulled it off.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> That&#39;s why I call it a &quot;three-way team standoff&quot; (laughs). Lancer isn&#39;t interested in Sola-Ui, and is loyal to Kayneth. Kayneth<br> loves Sola-Ui, and treats Lancer like a tool. Sola-Ui loves Lancer, and... It&#39;s like their relationship is a game of rock-paper-scissors.</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> I really wish Kayneth had had his act together a little more (laughs).</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> My utmost apologies! (laughs)</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> I wish Lancer had acted better towards Sola-Ui. If only he&#39;d acted a little more maturely (laughs). His experiences in the<br> past were so bad that he was probably freaked out that he&#39;d gotten himself caught up in the same sort of pattern.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> If you didn&#39;t like her, you should have just said so! (laughs) And it would have worked out differently if Kayneth wasn&#39;t in love with Sola-Ui.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> It may have been a strategic marriage, but he fell in love with her! The way she was so diligent in her Magecraft studies must have made him fall for her.</p><p><strong>What do you think Team Lancer could have done to win the Holy Grail War?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> I think they should have had a team meeting and said, &quot;Let&#39;s set aside all our personal baggage for a while and focus only on winning.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> Right, they had a good strategy. They let personal feelings get involved. That&#39;s always a recipe for failure.</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> Lancer only fought against Saber and Berserker, but I think he&#39;s particularly strong against opponents that follow the code of chivalry.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> The other teams were nothing but bad eggs all around.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> In the recording sessions, Kiritsugu&#39;s team was called &quot;Team Scoundrel.&quot; Irisviel and Saber fought fairly, but Kiritsugu<br> followed no code whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Please tell us your impressions regarding taking part in this project.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> I never met some of the teams. Team Saber, Team Rider, Team Caster... I think I worked with them. I wish I could have recorded with everyone more.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> Oh, right, those times when Sola-Ui was onscreen didn&#39;t occur when everyone else was together. That&#39;s too bad. The recording<br> sessions for this show were a lot of fun because the quality of the performances and visuals were so high.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> The contents of the story were brutal, but the studio was a fun place to be. Like when Yoshikazu Iwanami, the audio director,<br> suddenly broke out into a Kiritsugu impression. &quot;Maiya...&quot; (laughs).</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> You really want to do that sometimes.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> Whenever Tsuruoka (Caster) started to talk, the temperature in the studio went up two degrees.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> I love Caster!</p><p><strong>Midorikawa:</strong> Lancer really seemed to be enjoying himself in the times when he was fighting Saber. I wished that we could have let them go on fighting forever. It was a genuinely wonderful show with seriously beautiful visuals. We&#39;re talking theatrical quality.</p><p><strong>Toyoguchi:</strong> I had auditioned back during stay night, and now I&#39;m finally getting to play Sola-Ui in this show. I&#39;m so glad that I was able to be a part of the Fate series, my dream job. I think that as I&#39;ve gotten older, it&#39;s become easier to play Sola-Ui, easier than in &quot;Sound Drama.&quot; There wasn&#39;t a single happy scene, but it was worth it to seize the day and experience all you can, so I had a wonderful time.</p><p><strong>Yamazaki:</strong> I&#39;d love to see Kayneth and Sola-Ui&#39;s first meeting in a side story (laughs).</p><h3 id="animation-material-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p>Team Lancer<br> Episode 16: &quot;The End of Honor&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis</strong><br> Sola-Ui, Kayneth El-Melloi&#39;s partner, has been abducted.

Lancer and Saber engage in a fair, one-on-one combat, but then... there is a<br> sudden, tragic incident. This is Animation Director Toshiyuki Shirai&#39;s debut in this show. His young and vivacious pen draws Lancer and Saber&#39;s lively battle, as well as the anguished expressions on Lancer and Kayneth&#39;s faces. This is also the episode in which Kiritsugu Emiya&#39;s true nature is finally made clear.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Art Director Koji Eto<br> It was fun, the way Fate/Zero uses variations in color tones to match the setup of a scene, even in the same location. Up until episode<br> 5, I went with blues for nighttime Fuyuki cityscapes that made it look cool and stylish. After episode 6, I changed the palette to reds/<br> yellows to give it a slight sense of spookiness and fear. Especially in the street scenes in episode 10, it was a perfect match for the streets and back alleys in the Garden of sinners movie 7, so I worked to give it the same color tone and same level of quality. As a result, the production period lasted over a month and the staff and I both moaned and groaned, but we were happy that we had produced such terrific visuals.<br> (His impressions on Fate/Zero)<br> ufotable&#39;s work on Fate/Zero was really grueling.</p><p><strong>Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald</strong><br> Lancer&#39;s Master.

Even if I said to myself, &quot;Let&#39;s make him a hateful bastard&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s make him a real sleaze,&quot; whenever I let my guard down, he kept ending up suave and cool... He was the character whose facial expressions I agonized over the most. At first, the plan for Lancer&#39;s death scene was to have him turn into particles of light and fade away. But since he was the type of person who would curse everything as he died, I changed it so that he would be enveloped in black mist and crumble away. Even though it was a last-second change of plans, thanks to our staff who churned out terrific elements, it ended up being a memorable scene.</p><h2 id="master-session-003-rider-side" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#master-session-003-rider-side" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Master Session 003 - Rider Side</h2><p><strong>Team Rider</strong><br> Waver: Daisuke Namikawa / Rider: Akio Otsuka</p><hr><p><strong>&quot;Waver was a difficult role to play.

They were both very touching. First, please tell us your memories of the recording sessions.</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> The recording sessions, huh? They were a blast. I think that about sums it up.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> The energy of it was amazing. I had worked with Rider since &quot;Sound Drama&quot; to create audio plays, but the other teams had<br> also been working together over the years. In the anime adaptation, all of the team members were introduced to each other, so there was<br> a tension where these mature teams played off each other. But I was reassured by having Rider with me. I could have gone anywhere and<br> not been afraid (laughs).</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> What&#39;re you talking about (laughs)?</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> No, no, I&#39;m serious.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Anyway, everyone had a deep understanding of their characters, so it was fascinating to have the chance to do a recording<br> session with them.</p><p><strong>Team Rider was very popular.</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear it. That&#39;s all thanks to the material (the original novel and screenplay) and the characters. I&#39;m really thankful.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> To be honest, that put a lot of pressure on us. Since it was a terrific novel and great role, Waver was a tough character to play.</p><p>Even though he&#39;s a Master, he&#39;s hardly ever in charge. It was his job to get jerked around by Rider all the time and be the butt of jokes.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Rider delicately deflects Waver&#39;s sharp comments and steps in when he&#39;s good and ready. They have an interesting relationship.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> As much as I love Waver, the other characters in this show are amazing. I keep worrying that he&#39;ll be thought of as an incompetent bungler.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> If everyone&#39;s the same, you get lost in the crowd. Better to strike out in your own direction, right?</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> Maybe, but don&#39;t you think we were a little too freewheeling?</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> You have a point there (laughs). Our team might have had that problem.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> It&#39;s turned into a very influential show, but I&#39;ve been told by people that they just can&#39;t picture me playing a character like<br> Waver.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> I think that Rider is also a character that you don&#39;t see very often in anime these days. Maybe that&#39;s where his popularity came<br> from.</p><p><strong>Although you die in episode 23, please tell us about any scenes that stand out in your memory.</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> My favorite scene is my farewell scene with Waver. The fact that Waver stands firm when Death appears before them in the form of Archer (Gilgamesh) speaks volumes about him. I love that scene. I guess you could say, it&#39;s like the butterfly emerging from the cocoon. I love stories of personal growth. I&#39;m moved by how much Waver grows.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> That&#39;s one scene I can&#39;t leave out. I built up Waver with that scene in mind. He had been so desperate to get Rider to obey him, but he acknowledges the worth of Rider&#39;s ideals and swears to serve Rider as his vassal. I think that this change is his growth. Up<br> until this point, he&#39;d charge at Rider, who would neatly spin out of the way, but here, he&#39;s managed to get a solid grip on him. I think this is when they finally become a team. That&#39;s why the outcome is so sad. He finally made it to the top, and then he&#39;s forced to let him go. I thought that made it even sadder.</p><p><strong>The subtleties of Waver&#39;s feelings were certainly striking.</strong></p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> The thing that I always kept in the back of my mind was that Waver had a respect for Rider from the very beginning. But Waver could only express that in one way - anger. Well, maybe that&#39;s because he had an inferiority complex.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Right, Waver always had that nagging doubt in his mind, &quot;Am I worthy?&quot;</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> Waver is a role that has to be in a constant state of agitation, and even when he&#39;s shouting, &quot;You total idiot!&quot; at Rider, I&#39;d have to slip in hints of doubt, uncertainty and respect for Rider underneath it, or Waver and Rider wouldn&#39;t look like a good team.<br> Striking that tone was incredibly difficult. I agonized over that when we were recording.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Waver was a role that required a delicate performance. I really appreciated that.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> Well, when push came to shove, I turned to Rider for help (laughs).</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> A lot went into Team Rider that wasn&#39;t in the dialogue or shown in scenes. I think the unspoken interactions make theirs the closest team.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> That&#39;s because Rider and Waver were living together the whole time (laughs).</p><h3 id="the-relationship-of-trust-that-team-rider-built" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-relationship-of-trust-that-team-rider-built" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Relationship of Trust that Team Rider Built</h3><p><strong>I thought that Rider had to shout really loudly in combat scenes, such as when using the Ionian Hetairoi. What was that like?</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Since Rider is making such a huge army risk their lives for him with a single shout, you have to shout just short of your breaking point. After all, people don&#39;t flock to you just because you have a cool voice (laughs). There has to be some kind of spiritual<br> power of words there that agitates and excites people. That was incredibly difficult. It was hard in terms of technique, too.</p><p><strong>Because you&#39;re always straining your voice.</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Normally, if you don&#39;t take a deep breath after speaking loudly through a long line of dialogue, you&#39;re not going to make it<br> through that next line. But with long lines, you use your voice well, gradually build it up, and then finish it off by hitting a crescendo at exactly the right time... That&#39;s all about technique. Call it a trade secret if you want (laughs). People don&#39;t get what I&#39;m talking about, though.</p><p><strong>Rider does seem to talk with other Servants more than anyone else, doesn&#39;t he?</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> He does. I gave various distances to my performance depending on the other person. With Saber, he speaks with affection. With Archer, it&#39;s with a sense of tension, &quot;This guy is dangerous.&quot; With Assassin, it&#39;s &quot;I can abide by this person.&quot; Our job isn&#39;t just<br> to read the lines, it&#39;s to establish a sense of distance and relationship with the other characters. I was very careful about making those distinctions.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> Right, that&#39;s exactly how it is. It&#39;s not the words that are important, it&#39;s the emotions. That&#39;s very informative! (laughs)</p><p><strong>And now, I&#39;d like to ask you two what you think Team Rider should have done in order to win the Holy Grail War?</strong></p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> No matter what plan they came up with, Rider wouldn&#39;t have been satisfied if it didn&#39;t involve attacking head-on.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Right, he&#39;s proud about tackling everything head-on. I don&#39;t think that winning is his goal.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> The thing is, Rider can unleash a huge amount of explosive power in one strike. On that front, all Waver can do is try hard.<br> He feeds Rider delicious food, takes him to hot springs, keeps him charged up and ready. And every once in a while, he attacks from<br> head-on. Maybe Waver needs a command baton like pro baseball coaches have.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> Yeah, and send out the troublemaker to fight the other Servants. I like it!</p><p><strong>I see, it&#39;s &quot;Waver, you can do it!&quot; In closing, please tell us your thoughts on being part of this show.</strong></p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> It&#39;s probably in the top 10 most fun jobs I&#39;ve ever worked on in my entire life. The material, the cast, and the audience were all great. I think they all came together to form an invincible fighting force and created this show.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> I&#39;m truly grateful that I was teamed up with Rider, and am thankful from the bottom of my heart that I was able to take part in this. But to be honest, Waver was a difficult role to play. All through the recording period, I was agonizing over how to deliver my<br> lines. Even thinking back on it now, it still gives me chills. It was only after we wrapped that I finally felt, &quot;Boy, I&#39;m glad I got to play him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> I wonder if the viewers empathized with Waver the most?</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> I think I was always asking myself, &quot;If I were really in the Holy Grail War, what would I do?&quot; as I was playing Waver.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> And I bet the fans love it when big, tough Rider stands behind delicate Waver.</p><p><strong>Namikawa:</strong> That&#39;s for sure. If I had Rider with me, I&#39;d want to turn to him, too (laughs). How many times did he save him? I guess that&#39;s what trust is all about.</p><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> And ours is the only team that had won such a level of trust. In a sense, I guess you could say that we&#39;re the winners of the Holy Grail War (laughs).</p><h3 id="animation-material-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p>Team Rider<br> Episode 20: &quot;The Assassin Returns&quot; through<br> Episode 23: &quot;The Sea at the End of the World&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis</strong><br> The Holy Grail War finally rushes towards its climax. Rider and Saber clash as a result of Kirei Kotomine and Kariya Matou&#39;s scheme. Though pressed hard by the repeated use of his Noble Phantasms, their bond grows even stronger, and they face their final battle side by side. The bike action scene in episode 21 was a complicated process in which a 3DCG bike was pasted in after motion was applied using keyframed animation, then Saber was animated on top of that, and image processing was then applied at the end. Fate/Zero employed a freewheeling style where different production methods were used from cut to cut.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Character Designer, Animation Director<br> Atsushi Ikariya<br> The character I had the most fun drawing was Rider. That wasn&#39;t the case at first, but I grew more and more attached to him the more I<br> drew him, and the number of lines increased in proportion to that, which I eventually strangled myself with.

To a Mage, even a place that is a sinister, bloody battlefield can be a beautiful, serene vista when bathed in moonlight.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Kei Tsunematsu<br> Assistant Director, ep.23 Storyboard Artist and Episode Director<br> The thing I paid closest attention to, direction-wise - to give Rider a death befitting a great king and to give a sense of Waver&#39;s growth - might actually be Archer, and not those two. Rider, who charges at Archer, knowing that he is hopelessly overpowered, and Waver, who remains faithful to his king, who will not return... Archer&#39;s words of respect to them is what stuck in my mind since the time I first read the book, so I thought I had to do that justice. I think it has been about two and a half years ago since I read the book before I started on this show. That was actually my first exposure to the Fate universe. I hope that the many viewers who have stuck with us over the long 9-month broadcast period enjoyed this scene.</p><h3 id="saying-farewell-to-waver" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#saying-farewell-to-waver" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Saying Farewell to Waver**</h3><p>Episode 23: &quot;The Sea at the End of the World&quot;<br> Storyboards: Kei Tsunematsu</p><p>Rider receives three commands from Waver, and goes into battle prepared to die.

I used Berserker and all I wanted was to be able to save Sakura, and Berserker was completely unaware of that situation.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> Right, he was only being supplied with mana by Kariya. Since he fights with no sense of self-awareness, he doesn&#39;t need to<br> think about the nature of his relationship with Kariya. All Berserker has is his hatred towards Saber.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> There was only that one time when they worked together, right? Just that time when Berserker transformed himself to look like<br> Rider and abducted Irisviel. (episodes 20, 21)</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Right. He used a lot of Kirei&#39;s Command Seals to make Berserker transform into Rider then, as well as to make him kidnap Irisviel... He won&#39;t do as he&#39;s told unless you use a lot of Command Seals.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Even when he&#39;s near Saber, you have to keep him under control using Command Seals to keep him from going on a rampage.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> Right, right. That&#39;s why Berserker screams and howls the instant he drops his disguise. (episode 21)</p><p><strong>Tell us about the scenes that stick in your mind. Kariya was popular right from episode 1!</strong></p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Gosh, you really want to root for him in that episode and shout, &quot;You can do it, Uncle Kariya!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> You know, I didn&#39;t expect him to get the support from the audience that he did. He isn&#39;t understood by Sakura, doesn&#39;t<br> communicate with Berserker, and I thought of the team as sort of traveling in parallel with the others, but separate. My thought was to<br> play Kariya as having a self-righteous personality, so it never occurred to me that he would win so much support from the audience.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> Kariya was a real stud in episode 1.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Episode 1 was the only time he looked at peace. After that, he was suffering for the most part. My friends kept asking me, &quot;So, when is Kariya gonna die?&quot; (laughs)</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Amazingly enough, it wasn&#39;t until the final episode (laughs). Halfway through the recording, Yoshikazu Iwanami, the audio director, came up to me and said, &quot;Apparently, Kariya and the others have appearances up until the final episode.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> He looked so shocked by that (laughs).</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Right, out of all the teams, he seemed like the Master who would die first.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Right, because he was given a death sentence in episode 1. And Kariya&#39;s was the first blood spilled. I mean, he was bleeding from his eyes just from summoning Berserker. He was really working from a handicap from the get-go.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> The thing that was most shocking with Sakura was that worm pit in episode 1, right? I thought to myself, &quot;I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re airing this!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Those worms were amazing, weren&#39;t they? Ever since they announced they were animating Fate/Zero, I was curious how they were going to depict that worm scene. But I was surprised that they did a faithful visual rendition of it.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> I think that showing Sakura in the worm pit like that conveys to the audience in no uncertain terms what Kariya&#39;s motivation<br> for fighting is.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> It definitely conveyed Kariya&#39;s resolve and fear of being implanted with that Crest Worm.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> It was a brutal scene, but I think it was indispensable to the story.</p><h3 id="facing-reality-when-pushed-to-the-breaking-point" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#facing-reality-when-pushed-to-the-breaking-point" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Facing reality when pushed to the breaking point</h3><p><strong>Don&#39;t think that the most shocking thing for Kariya were the developments after episode 21?</strong></p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Yeah, and after he gave up all but a month of his life for someone he loves! (laughs) Lurking behind Kariya&#39;s desire to save the daughter of the woman he loves is jealousy towards Tokiomi. Aoi is already married to Tokiomi. Kariya is masking that reality and pretending not to see it. When he&#39;s pushed to the breaking point, he&#39;s forced to face reality. That progression was intense. When we were recording, I had to give my performance without really knowing what the visuals were going to look like. As I was playing against Hasumi Itoh, who plays Aoi Tohsaka, I would sort of gradually start to hyperventilate. Since I was delivering my lines in a state of oxygen deprivation with my fingertips tingling, I couldn&#39;t keep up with the boards (captions that indicate timing for line delivery). I did do all of the lines for the scene, but since the audio director okayed them even though they didn&#39;t match the lip flaps, I wasn&#39;t sure what was going to happen with them. The visuals team used scene direction and other tricks to get them to sync up.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> From a visuals standpoint, the staff really pulled out all the stops on Berserker, too. When I heard that they could only finish a handful of cuts in a day, I was shocked at the craftsmanship. Since the visuals weren&#39;t done when I was recording, I only did growls and howls for timing.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Gosh, every scene Berserker appears in is a classic scene.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> Since my lines were mostly just screaming &quot;Aaaah!&quot;, it was surprisingly hard to pick out my lines in the scripts. When I was<br> recording &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; I was told that the &quot;Aaaah!&quot; howl was him trying to shout &quot;Arthur,&quot; but his hatred is so strong that he can&#39;t<br> get the word out.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Oh, so it&#39;s the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Arthur.&quot;</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> I think it&#39;s hard to pick up on that when I first appear, but I made a point of going &quot;Aaaah!&quot; after we started the 2nd season.</p><p><strong>There was a Kariya/Berserker scene in the final episode too, wasn&#39;t there?</strong></p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Right, there&#39;s that scene in the last episode where Sakura and Rin say, &quot;Thank you, Daddy Kariya&quot; to him. Even though Kariya must realize that future is never going to happen, he has to cling to that happy ending inside his mind. That&#39;s... brutal.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> He gets eaten by the worms without hearing Sakura&#39;s line there at the end. His only consolation is that he got to dream a happy<br> dream before dying.</p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> Back during the 1st season, there were a lot of people who didn&#39;t know that I was playing Berserker because he&#39;s always howling. Well, he does stand by a riverbank with his back to the camera in the 1st season&#39;s closing credit sequence (laughs). I&#39;m really happy that I got to deliver some proper lines in the last two episodes.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> I loved how heartbroken Saber looked when she got a look at his face after his helmet split open in episode 23.</p><p><strong>I&#39;d like to ask you what strategy you think Team Berserker should have taken to win the Holy Grail War.</strong></p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Even if he had won, he would&#39;ve had to hand over the Grail to Zouken Matou, the head of the Matou family, so Kariya&#39;s real<br> wish to be together with Aoi - would never come true.</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> Sakura&#39;s life would change! She might even turn into a cheery person. And the big Fuyuki fire might not have happened.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> Archer doesn&#39;t deal well with Berserker, you know? He throws every Noble Phantasm that Archer fires at him right back in<br> his face. Kariya could just lay low in that mysterious underground room he&#39;s always hiding in and wait until Archer is the only Servant<br> left. And then he has Berserker take Archer out.</p><p><strong>In closing, please tell us your thoughts on taking part in Fate/Zero.</strong></p><p><strong>Okiayu:</strong> I&#39;m re-watching it right now. I keep thinking, &quot;Boy, I got to take part in a fascinating show, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shitaya:</strong> I went back in time to the world of Fate/Zero after taking part in Fate/stay night, but I&#39;m really happy that I was able to be a part of Zero.</p><p><strong>Shingaki:</strong> The original novel was interesting, and it&#39;s even more interesting in visual form. I think I was lucky to be an actor in it. Even though my performances were all about feeling pain, as a result, I mastered all sorts of variations of portraying pain (laughs).</p><h3 id="animation-material-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p>Team Berserker<br> Episode 23: &quot;The Sea at the End of the World&quot; through<br> Episode 25: &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis</strong><br> Berserker, a Servant who attacks friend and foe alike as he howls and roars while wreathed in black mist. His armor splits open, and his true identity is finally revealed. Berserker&#39;s Master is Kariya Matou, who winces in agony and coughs up blood every time Berserker goes on a rampage. Where will their journey take them? Berserker&#39;s movements are first drawn with keyframe animation, and then a 3DCG Berserker is animated to match, and finally, black mist is added over the top of that. After the mist clears, Berserker is fully animated using keyframe animation. Just like Kariya, the animation staff worked so hard they coughed up blood when they animated Berserker.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Atsushi Ikariya (Character Designer, Animation Director)<br> Kariya was a character who was heartbreaking both from a design standpoint and as a human being. I thought I ought to draw Kariya a little bit cool back when he was healthy when he first appears in episode 1. It was fun to draw him progressively breaking down as the episodes went on. Drawing Kariya when he was on fire in episode 15 was particularly worthwhile. I basically drew Berserker like a mecha, so I used lots of shadows and lines and tried to give a sense of the metal of the armor.<br> (On Fate/Zero ending)<br> For me, it was a career highlight. All of the experiences I had were both great and fun. A big thank you to all you fans out there who supported us.</p><p><strong>Kariya Matou</strong><br> Berserker&#39;s Master. Second oldest son of the Matou family, one of the three founding Mage families. Although his Magecraft aptitude was higher than his older brother&#39;s, he hated the vile nature of the Matou family&#39;s magic. To save Sakura, the daughter of Aoi Tohsaka, he agrees to participate in the Holy Grail War. As a side effect of the Crest Worms, half his body is twisted and distorted. Atsushi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Berserker</strong><br> A mad knight Heroic Spirit who is clad in black armor. The &quot;Berserk&quot; affinity was added to him, as he is unable to speak, and he refuses<br> to obey his Master&#39;s instructions. His abilities include For Someone Else&#39;s Glory, which conceals his own abilities, and Knight of Honor,<br> which allows him to turn anything into a Noble Phantasm. He demonstrates an unnatural fixation on Saber. Atsushi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Worms</strong><br> The Matou family uses Worms in their Magecraft. In combat, they can be summoned and employed at will. There are various kinds, including the flesh-eating Blade Wing Worms that Kariya employs, and the Crest Worms that crawl around the Worm Pit.</p><p><strong>The Matou Family Worm Pit</strong><br> A room located under the Matou manor. Contains countless worms. This huge mass of worms is drawn with 3DCG. 3D Director Kojiro Shishido was in charge of the 3D work on the worms. The Matou family worm pit is one visual that he poured his heart and soul into. It in the first and last episode, and reinforces the dark tone of the story.</p><p><strong>Berserker vs. Saber</strong><br> Episode 23: &quot;The Sea at the End of the World&quot;<br> Storyboards: Kei Tsunematsu</p><p>Saber and Berserker square off in the underground parking garage of Fuyuki City Hall. Saber puts all her strength into a single blow. However, Berserker blocks the strike with his bare hands. The scene shows the horror of Berserker, who is fully acquainted with Saber&#39;s<br> tactics. Berserker&#39;s motions are done in CG.</p><p><strong>Zouken Matou</strong><br> Head of the Matou family. After repeatedly extending his life, this Mage is already not quite human. He is well-versed in all things related to the Holy Grail, and gives Kariya Crest Worms. He observes the proceedings of the Fourth Holy Grail War from a distance.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Berserker 3DCG Supervisor Masato Takizawa<br> With Berserker&#39;s movements, I tweaked things like warping the parts and altering the scale so that it wouldn&#39;t look like stiff CG<br> animation. Although there were a ton of difficult areas over the course of the series, I believe that all that hard work really can be seen on the screen and made for better visuals. I think that shows like this that are so beloved by the audience come around once in a blue moon, so it&#39;s a real honor to have been given the opportunity to take part in it.</p><p><strong>Lancelot</strong><br> A Knight of the Round Table who served Arthur (Arturia). He falls in love with King Arthur&#39;s wife, Guinevere, and this dishonor brings<br> about the fall of Britain. Also, in the anime, he is drawn with keyframe animation after his face is revealed. Because his complex armor<br> was being drawn by hand, it involved huge amounts of time and effort.</p><h2 id="master-session-005-archer-side" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#master-session-005-archer-side" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Master Session 005 - Archer Side</h2><p><strong>Team Archer</strong><br> Tokiomi Tohsaka: Sho Hayami / Kirei Kotomine: Joji Nakata<br> Archer: Tomokazu Seki / Rin Tohsaka: Kana Ueda</p><hr><p><strong>&quot;And it is because of that fate that the Tohsaka family failed?&quot; -Sho Hayami</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Make it sound like you&#39;re performing a play in a Greek temple, and your audience are the stars.&quot; -Tomokazu Seki</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;I sense a touch of happiness in him over (remaining a complete scoundrel).

Personally speaking, I thought that my days of<br> playing Kirei Kotomine were over with the Fifth Holy Grail War. But now, I would be playing him ten years earlier, in the Fourth Holy<br> Grail War. I felt a lot of pressure to not make his voice too booming or give him any verbal ticks as I played him.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> When we did &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; we had to use our imaginations to bring the text in the scripts to life, but this time, there were<br> amazing visuals ready to go right from episode 1, which I thought was terrific. Each time, I would think to myself, &quot;Wow, are we going<br> to be able to record while watching such amazing images?&quot; But no, it didn&#39;t work out that way (laughs). They ran out of material partway<br> through.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> But this was the first anime I&#39;ve worked on where the various cast groups came in to record together, so I was psyched to see<br> how everybody handled their breathing and what kind of tension they would bring to it. More so than I ever imagined... Archer was<br> despicable.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> (laughs)</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> Rin was sweeter than I expected, and Kirei was intolerable. What made me happiest of all was that I could sense the scheming<br> of the drama there in the real-life studio.</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> The cast of Fate/Zero has more adults in it than Fate/stay night did. The nature of the fighting is different, too. The fighting in<br> Fate/stay night was about fighting to survive, but in Zero, it&#39;s about fighting to win. The different atmosphere of the Holy Grail War was fascinating, I thought. Rin is only in a limited number of episodes, so if it weren&#39;t for the fact that she also appears in Fate/stay night, I would have been worried about her chances of survival.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> The Rin episode (episode 10) was beautiful. I got the impression that the staff all loved Rin.</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> I was shocked at how sweet it was. That particular episode was really sad in the original novel, so I was happy that they lent her a helping hand in the anime.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> What I remember from the recording sessions is &quot;kanji.&quot; This was a show where the kanji in the recording scripts were killer.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> Like the ones for &quot;impertinent,&quot; right?</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> I looked them up in the dictionary before coming in, but there were some expressions that weren&#39;t in there. I&#39;d go in early to the<br> studio to get confirmation from the staff. And since I didn&#39;t know where to put the stress on the obscure kanji, it was also hard to use<br> them in my performance.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> The word &quot;Mage&quot; popped up a lot in Tokiomi&#39;s lines, but it&#39;s hard to read smoothly. It crushed my spirit.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> It&#39;s the fate of the Tohsakas. Back during Fate/stay night, I had to say &quot;Mage&quot; a lot, too.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> And it is because of that fate that the Tohsaka family failed? (laughs)</p><h3 id="what-is-the-joy-in-being-a-scoundrel-to-the-very-end" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-joy-in-being-a-scoundrel-to-the-very-end" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the joy in being a scoundrel to the very end?</h3><p><strong>What are the scenes that stick in your minds?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> I think that Kirei is by nature a very difficult character to draw. I thought that I knew from the Garden of sinners the level of quality that ufotable could put out, but my frank opinion was that I thought it was wonderful that they were putting out this level of quality in a TV series. They held a test screening at a movie theater and played it on the big screen, and it was so impressive. I thought, &quot;I&#39;m so glad I got to be in this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> Archer&#39;s relaxed air when he was lounging on the sofa really struck me. I could tell instantly from the visuals that he existed in a whole different dimension from us Mages. Or things like Rider&#39;s muscle shirt. It was interesting to see things that transcend the ordinary surrounded by ordinary, everyday things.</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> Rin is always striving to live up to what is expected of her as a daughter of the Tohsaka Mage family, so they asked me right from episode 1 not to play her too sadly. Even in the funeral scene in the final episode for her father, Tokiomi, I thought that she wouldn&#39;t cry, so I didn&#39;t let my feelings show on my own face. When Kirei gives her father&#39;s Azoth dagger as a keepsake and she can&#39;t hold it in anymore and starts crying, I myself was about to break into tears in that scene. Although Rin doesn&#39;t know how her father really died, I do, so some of that resentment might have crept in.</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Please accept my heartfelt apologies.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> What sticks in my mind the most was &quot;Discussing the Grail&quot; (episode 11), where Rider, Saber, and Archer talk with each other.</p><p>Since we recorded our parts separately when we did &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; our performances didn&#39;t quite match up. When I listen to it again now, while Ms. Kawasumi&#39;s Saber and Mr. Otsuka&#39;s Rider are talking, you hear Archer laughing in the background for 3 or 4 minutes (laughs). Since the three of us recorded the scene together in the anime version, it has an entirely different vibe now. Personally speaking, some of what Mr. Otsuka&#39;s Rider had to say won me over. Also, Rider and Waver are depicted with such appeal in Zero. At the very end, Archer senses the chivalrous spirit in Waver, and spares him and lets him go. I got to make Archer look really cool, and I got to play a juicy role. (laughs).</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> I loved your portrayal of Gilgamesh, Seki.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> I wonder if you&#39;d call that youshikibi (the beauty of process and form)? There are those archaic turns of phrase like you&#39;d hear<br> in kabuki. It was awfully pleasant to listen to.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> When I played Gilgamesh in Fate/stay night years ago, the audio director at the time, Koji Tsujitani, gave me the direction, &quot;Make it sound like you&#39;re performing a play in a Greek temple, and your audience are the stars.&quot; He might have been on to something there. This time, I was able to record with the mentors who nurtured me in my formative years, so there was a sense of security. In these recording sessions, I was the least senior.</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> And with each passing episode, there are one or two fewer mentor voice actors in the studio (laughs)... After all, the way the 2nd season is set up, a Master or Servant leaves every episode.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> Right, right.</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Kirei even lays a hand on your Tokiomi, Mr. Hayami. I got a lot of grief from everyone over that (laughs).</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Tokiomi is the best of all the people in Zero. Why in the world would someone go and kill him? (laughs) Oh, perhaps the Azoth dagger is to blame. Right after Kirei receives the Azoth dagger from Tokiomi, he stabs him with it.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> Ah, I follow you... I shouldn&#39;t have given Kirei a sharp object (laughs).</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Kiritsugu&#39;s past is laid out in detail (episodes 18, 19), and after Archer defeats Rider, he shows us his softer side and lets Waver go (episode 23). Kirei is the only one who ends the show remaining a complete scoundrel (laughs). On the contrary, I sense a touch of happiness in him over that. This is joy.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> He experienced joy?!</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Indeed.</p><h3 id="the-holy-grail-war-postmortem-meeting-will-now-begin-why-did-this-team-lose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-holy-grail-war-postmortem-meeting-will-now-begin-why-did-this-team-lose" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Holy Grail War Postmortem Meeting will now begin. Why did this team lose?</h3><p><strong>Thank you. Now, Team Archer survived the Holy Grail War, so in a sense, one could even say that they are the victors. However, what strategies would you have employed to have won more effectively?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> Normally, the war would have been won the instant Gilgamesh was summoned.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> You&#39;re right. Which means that Tokiomi shouldn&#39;t have laid out such intricate plans.</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> He should&#39;ve sent Archer on an all-out offensive right away and asked him to go defeat all the other Servants. And have Kirei tell<br> Assassin to target the Masters.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> You&#39;re right. Tokiomi didn&#39;t use Archer very effectively at all.</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> I suppose Tokiomi and Archer didn&#39;t get along very well. Whenever Tokiomi used a Command Seal, Archer got enraged. But when Kirei said to Archer that he wanted to use a Command Seal, he would say, &quot;As you wish&quot; and go along with it.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> In other words, our Team Archer underwent an internal collapse as the series progressed. Tokiomi, Kirei, and Archer, they didn&#39;t lose to the other teams. The fact that Tokiomi&#39;s, Archer&#39;s, and Kirei&#39;s personalities didn&#39;t mesh is what brought them down.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> Tokiomi was convinced that he understood what makes Archer tick, though. He behaves subserviently towards Archer, but Archer sees right through his act. It means that Tokiomi was a rank amateur.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> Even when Archer was fighting in the first half of the show, I got the impression that Tokiomi was holding him back.</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> I&#39;ve got it! What this team lacks is communication! We should&#39;ve had drinking parties and called them meetings! (laughs)</p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> If this team had won unscathed, Rin might not have had to fight in the Fifth Holy Grail War, and she might&#39;ve grown to become a fine young lady (laughs).</p><p><strong>Yours was a team that deserved better. And now, I believe that all of you have been associated with Fate/Zero for quite some time. In closing, please tell us your thoughts on taking part in this show.</strong></p><p><strong>Ueda:</strong> When Zero wrapped up, it hit me all over again that it was the starting point for Fate/stay night. When I look at Zero that way, it<br> makes me want to play Rin Tohsaka again. I think I could work up even more hatred for Kirei now (laughs).</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> (laughs)</p><p><strong>Hayami:</strong> I first learned that this title was going to be animated from a poster in a bookstore. I went, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s starting? Hey, and my name is on there!&quot; Even after Tokiomi was knocked out of the running, I&#39;d sometimes catch glimpses of visuals in bookstores and go,<br> &quot;Oh, I know this show!&quot; I was interacting with it like a fan would, with a distance between it and me. Catching glimpses of Zero in<br> various locations like that must mean that it&#39;s being supported by lots of fans, and I think that the show was well worth being part of.</p><p><strong>Seki:</strong> The role of Gilgamesh has such a clear-cut personality that it was a lot of fun to play him. If the chance ever came up, I&#39;d love<br> to play him again. Gilgamesh appears in both the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars, so I&#39;m waiting for him to be summoned to fight in<br> others.</p><p><strong>Nakata:</strong> When I was acting in Fate/stay night, I wasn&#39;t familiar with Zero, so I was surprised when I first saw a compilation volume<br> of Mr. Urobuchi&#39;s Zero. I was incredibly impressed by the way they managed to condense such a thick book down into two seasons and<br> transform its complex psychological descriptions into visual form. I&#39;m glad that we were able to have this cast and have so much support<br> from the fans. I hope that it will go down in anime history as a monumental achievement.</p><h3 id="animation-material-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p>Team Archer<br> Episode 17: &quot;The Eighth Contract&quot;<br> Episode 25: &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis</strong></p><p>He kills Tokiomi Tohsaka, the Mage he once called master from behind, and he drives Kariya to despair and basks in the joy of it. Egged<br> on by Archer, Kirei Kotomine, having awakened to the pleasures of depravity, leaves morality behind and satisfies his dark appetites.<br> Having to depict change via inner workings without changing his facial expression was where the production staff truly put their skill<br> on display. By carefully drawing the dialogue scenes between Archer and Kirei, they meticulously depicted the minute changes in his<br> mentality. His unusual Master/Servant relationship with Archer could be said to be the show&#39;s highlight.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Tomonori Sudo<br> Character Designs, Animation Director<br> Episode 24 was cool, wasn&#39;t it? It was an episode where the younger staff members handled the animation direction, but even though it<br> was completely out of my hands, I wasn&#39;t worried at all when I watched it. I took a completely hands-off approach, but I wasn&#39;t worried<br> at all when I watched it. Episode 25 is the final episode, for one thing, so I made sure to work very carefully as I was directing the animation. Still, since it&#39;s the culmination of everything that&#39;s come before it, Kirei and Archer are both seen here in ways they&#39;ve never been seen before. Literally and figuratively speaking.</p><p><strong>Kirei Kotomine</strong><br> Assassin&#39;s Master.<br> Executor of the Holy Church. Ostensibly, he fights in the Holy Grail War as the former pupil of Tokiomi Tohsaka. Although he was forced out of the war after losing Assassin, he gains more Command Seals and returns as Archer&#39;s Master. Tomonori Sudo was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Archer</strong><br> True name: Gilgamesh. The King of Babylon, said to be humanity&#39;s oldest Heroic Spirit. Possesses a treasury that houses the original items that myths and legends were based on. He carries the key sword, Gate of Babylon, that retrieves Noble Phantasms from it. He is<br> also the most powerful Servant, one who can wield Ea, the Sword of Rupture that rends time and space asunder. Tomonori Sudo was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi Tohsaka</strong><br> Archer&#39;s Master. Head of the noted Tohsaka Mage family. He seeks the Grail to achieve the long-cherished goal of Mages, to reach the<br> Source. He conspires with Risei Kotomine, who acts as overseer for the Holy Grail War, and expects an easy victory. Unable to control<br> Archer, he is betrayed by Kirei Kotomine. Tomonori Sudo was in charge of the character design for the anime version.</p><p><strong>Rin Tohsaka</strong><br> Oldest daughter of Tokiomi Tohsaka. She is proud that she will inherit the Tohsaka family magecraft, and respects her father. She follows the family credo of always remaining reserved and elegant. Able to use magic from a young age, she is shown in the anime version rescuing children who had been abducted by Ryunosuke.</p><p><strong>Tohsaka Manor</strong><br> The Tohsakas are one of the three founding Mage families.

It unleashes the anti-world Noble Phantasm, Enuma Elish, the &quot;star of creation that divided Heaven and Earth&quot;; it shatters the earth and rends time and space asunder. With one blast of this in episode 23, it shatters the Reality Marble of Rider&#39;s Ionian Hetairoi Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Kirei holds his sides, laughing</strong><br> Keyframe: #25 CUT 99/ Shinji Yamamoto<br> Either through the will of the Holy Grail or through some fluke, Kirei has been brought back to life.

Honestly, I hate to leave. Memories of the recording sessions, eh? There were sometimes actors there who were such veterans that they made me look like a newcomer, and that the<br> recording period was brief. It went so smoothly that I almost wish there had been more excitement.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> The shortest ones were where you could be finished doing your lines for an episode in two hours.</p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> The audio director had incredibly sharp ears and could give us precise directions when doing retakes, which made it easy to perform our lines. Basically, he would give us free rein, and would talk things over with us only on areas that concerned him.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Four years ago, I recorded &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; and that had about the same volume of dialogue as the original novel. Since<br> we already thoroughly pinned down her state of mind back then, the nature of her character didn&#39;t deviate from that when recording the<br> anime version.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> After &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; I worked on the radio show &quot;Sound Drama Fate/Zero: Radio Material&quot; with Mr. Koyama, so I tackled the anime version after having discussed the characters at length with him. That&#39;s why the recording process was relatively pain-free in spite of the fact that it&#39;s such difficult material. The thing that sticks in my mind from the recording sessions is Mai Kadowaki. She would always say, &quot;I want to savor the freshness of the visuals, so I don&#39;t read the scene descriptions in the recording script.&quot; I thought to<br> myself, &quot;Wow, she really loves the Fate series, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; (laughs)</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> I like to think that I do normally read the scene descriptions, but between you and me... I tried to avoid reading them as<br> much as possible for scenes that I didn&#39;t appear in (laughs). I&#39;ve acted in the Fate series for a long time, and now I&#39;ve met my father and mother in Zero. I have fond memories of the littlest details. I kept a loving watch over them, even the episodes that I didn&#39;t appear in.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> I bet you watched it sitting straight up with your legs tucked neatly beneath you!</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> Speaking of memories, I missed my connecting train once when we were recording episode 2 and I barely made it to the studio in time. I was drenched in sweat, and Mother (Ohara) and Saber (Kawasumi) fanned me to cool me off. They sprayed me with something that smelled wonderful.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Oh, I remember that!</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> I was a magical spray.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> That was a rare schoolgirl-ish episode on your part.</p><p><strong>Tsunematsu:</strong> The memory that I have isn&#39;t of a schoolgirl-ish episode, but, well... I&#39;m from the same town as Mr. Hayami, who plays Tokiomi, and he graduated from the same high school years before me. When he was recording the episode where he dies (episode 17), he told me, &quot;Now, you hurry up and die, too.&quot;</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh) What a terrible sempai!</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> Such horrible words said in that wonderful voice of his! Still, when I think about it, Maiya had the best death of anyone, didn&#39;t<br> she? (episode 20) She died in the arms of the man she loved.</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> Right, because lots of us die all alone in this show.</p><h3 id="sobbing-like-a-baby-over-the-ending-showing-when-iri-and-kiritsugu-first-met" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sobbing-like-a-baby-over-the-ending-showing-when-iri-and-kiritsugu-first-met" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sobbing like a baby over the ending showing when Iri and Kiritsugu first met.</h3><p><strong>Please tell us about any scenes that stand out in your minds.</strong></p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> Iri had a lot of really great scenes in the first half of the show.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> Right, Iri is Kiritsugu&#39;s conscience.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> As someone who is familiar with Fate/stay night, my impression of Illyasviel changed dramatically. Mai had some hard scenes in both Fate/stay night and the movie Fate/stay night UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS. At the time, Illya was a hated adversary to Saber, but by learning about Illya and Kiritsugu&#39;s relationship in Zero, I got to know Shirou better, so it was extremely useful.</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> When Iri collapses (episode 20), she and Kiritsugu talked about Illya. That was when I got the clearest sense of the love between them.</p><p><strong>Tsunematsu:</strong> For me, Maiya&#39;s final scene (episode 20) is what stands out. I had thought, &quot;I bet they&#39;re going to show her death from a distance and not even show her expression.&quot; But there it was, plain as day. I was shocked. Even though I had gotten into Maiya&#39;s headspace during the recording, I can&#39;t bear to watch that scene as an ordinary viewer. The day it aired, I was crying so much I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I even got a nosebleed.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> (all laugh)</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> When Maiya died, you said, &quot;I think she deserves a kiss at this point, don&#39;t you?&quot; at a press event, Mr. Koyama!</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> I apologize for my husband&#39;s (Kiritsugu&#39;s) behavior (laughs).</p><p><strong>Tsunematsu:</strong> I even got reports on Twitter about that!</p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> No, no, you have it all wrong. I&#39;m not the sort of man who can say what really needs to be said. I end up saying stupid things.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> You&#39;re so shy!</p><p><strong>Given your shy nature, Mr. Koyama, are there any scenes that stand out for you?</strong></p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> What struck me were the vivid visuals. The way every minute detail is drawn. For instance, the detailed compositions when Kiritsugu is on the radio with Natalia (episode 19). But Archer is the one I could stand the least. &quot;Saber, lay down your blade and be my wife!&quot; Can you believe that? (episode 24) Intolerable!</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> Oh, so it wasn&#39;t just me (laughs). Illya has a connection with him in Fate/stay night, too, so I was never comfortable around<br> Gilgamesh...</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Oh, really? Personally, I&#39;m like Gilgamesh. He was a minor character in Fate/stay night, but he&#39;s so cool in Zero.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> You&#39;re only saying that because you like Mr. Seki!</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Gilgamesh is an unprincipled scoundrel, but he does have his charms.</p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> I hate to say it, but Gilgamesh was pretty cool when he let Waver go (episode 23).</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Zero is a story about Saber&#39;s despair, so I knew going into it that she would be put through the wringer both emotionally and physically. So much so that when we were recording &quot;Sound Drama,&quot; Mr. Urobuchi came up to me and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for publicly tormenting Saber&quot; (laughs). There are two things that stand out in my mind. The first is &quot;Discussing the Grail&quot; (episode 11) in the 1st<br> season, and the other is definitely the scene with Lancelot at the end (episodes 24, 25). The scene with Lancelot in particular was so<br> heartbreaking that it was hard to do.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> It was the next to last episode, and Mr. Okiayu, Lancelot&#39;s actor, was saying nothing but &quot;Aaarrrrthuuuuur!&quot; I was so wound up,<br> thinking, &quot;Come on, what if they end it like this?&quot; (laughs)</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> The scene with Lancelot is split up, so it was really thrilling. I think that gave the conclusion a much bigger punch. What<br> stands out most for me is that final cut where Saber looks up. I interpret that as maybe she was being summoned by Shirou at that instant.</p><p>That maybe they showed a bit of hope there at the end.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> Although every scene stands out in my mind, the biggest surprise for me in the 2nd season was the end credit sequence!</p><p><strong>All:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> I had no idea it was going to be like that before it aired. At first, I was like, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s Iri&quot; and watched it without getting the significance. But it clicked after about five cuts. I was bawling like a baby. This is how Kiritsugu and Iri first met. I had always begged and pleaded with Mr. Urobuchi, saying that I wanted to read about how they met. And then he wrote it as a drama CD for Blu-ray Box I. Even though I was more than satisfied with that, they went and created artwork for it. I thought it was a miracle. I never thought my wish would come true, and then I got even more on top of that.</p><p><strong>What did each of you make of your individual relationships?</strong></p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> I think that this team wouldn&#39;t have functioned at all if it weren&#39;t for Iri.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> True. I was the buffer between my husband (Kiritsugu) and Saber.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Saber is highly moral. But she just can&#39;t go along with Kiritsugu&#39;s methodology. It was the worst pairing imaginable. Especially in the scene where he talks to Saber through Iri after he&#39;s killed Kayneth, she was thinking, &quot;He&#39;s completely twisted.&quot; That<br> was really hard on her.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> And the fact that Lancer absolutely must have thought that Saber and Kiritsugu were in cahoots. That must have shocked Saber.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> But I think that scene must have been hardest on Iri. I mean, that was the first time she had seen what Kiritsugu actually does.</p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> The name Kiritsugu means &quot;to sever and bind.&quot; Once something is severed, it will never be the same, you know? After all, he&#39;s someone who has lived his life by throwing away everything and never allowing anyone to touch what&#39;s most important to him. There&#39;s a romance to a heart that&#39;s never been touched, and also a glaring flaw as a human being, as well as the core of the story.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> I think that Kiritsugu is the purest character, and that he&#39;s just going about it the wrong way. That&#39;s what made Saber and Kiritsugu two of a kind. They both know deep down that it&#39;s impossible to save everyone, but they try to anyway.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> Iri can understand both sets of ideals. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard for her.</p><h3 id="as-a-show-that-was-pushed-forward-by-the-strength-of-everyone-involved-in-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#as-a-show-that-was-pushed-forward-by-the-strength-of-everyone-involved-in-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a> As a show that was pushed forward by the strength of everyone involved in it</h3><p><strong>Do you think there was a way that your team could have won the Holy Grail War with a minimum of fuss?</strong></p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> The only way to win without fuss would be to have Saber marry Archer and make him part of our team. Then we would take out all the Servants in one go.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> Wha-? Personally, I&#39;m fine with it, but Saber would probably hate the idea.</p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> Use a Command Seal, then.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> That&#39;s our scoundrel!</p><p><strong>In closing, tell us your thoughts on taking part in Fate/Zero.</strong></p><p><strong>Kadowaki:</strong> I received so much love as Illya, and there were twists and turns each week that got me worked up as an ordinary viewer. I<br> enjoyed myself in both capacities.</p><p><strong>Tsunematsu:</strong> On the one hand, you have Iri, who was created as a homunculus but is very human. On the other, you have Maiya, who is<br> human, but has lost her humanity. I loved the contrast between those two. I wish I could have seen a few little incidents where it was just the girls out having fun together.</p><p><strong>Ohara:</strong> It was a happy studio environment where love went into each of the characters. I bet that I could watch it again and again and be<br> moved each time. It still feels like it hasn&#39;t ended, (laughs), and I&#39;m looking forward to what&#39;s to come.</p><p><strong>Kawasumi:</strong> You could feel the passion of the staff in the artwork and visuals of the anime. From the very first episode, I thought that the art helped draw out the performances of the cast members. This show was challenging to us as performers, with its clashing emotions and the way it depicts the darker side of humanity. But when I watched the broadcasts, it all came together. It made me feel like I should have faith in the staff. Plus, this show has gotten so much love from the fans. Mr. Koyama and I have both appeared at countless<br> promotional events, and we could feel that love.. I could face the recording sessions with confidence as I was being urged forward by so<br> many people.</p><p><strong>Koyama:</strong> Actually, there was talk of wanting to make it into an anime ever since the radio show. When the anime got the green light, even Mr. Urobuchi was giddy as a schoolboy. I believe it turned into a show that will push the animation medium to new heights because<br> it had so many people behind it.</p><h3 id="animation-material-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animation-material-5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Animation Material</h3><p>Team Saber<br> Episode 18: &quot;Distant Memories&quot;<br> Episode 25: &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;</p><p><strong>Story Synopsis</strong></p><p>Where did Kiritsugu Emiya come from, this man with the lofty wish to free the world of fighting?

Eventually, his wish grows vast in scope, to the point where he seeks the Grail to fulfill it. The Fourth Holy Grail War comes to an end. Although he has lost everything, his wish never died. His dream is taken up by the next generation. The story arrives at its beginning.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Tomonori Sudo<br> Character Designs, Animation Director</p><p>At first, I thought that he (Kiritsugu) was a character who wasn&#39;t capable of expressing much emotion, but I think that in the latter half of the show, we might have managed to bring out the side of him that&#39;s rather frail and weak in comparison to his hard exterior. And since he&#39;s a character with the strength to blot that out, it&#39;s a difficult thing to do. And as for Saber, since she&#39;s the symbolic character of the Fate series, there was a lot of pressure because if we got her wrong, it wouldn&#39;t get together as Fate. Still, it was fun to show a Saber that you didn&#39;t get to see in Fate/stay night. Thank you for the precious life experience. This was my first two-season TV anime, so I&#39;m glad I overcame the challenge. Although I had no idea that there would be so many female fans, I like that the male characters got some fans, too.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu Emiya</strong><br> Saber&#39;s Master. A freelance Mage-killer. Asked to marry into the Einzbern family, and then becomes their trump card in the Holy Grail War. He uses the magic of Innate Time Control to manipulate and alter the flow of time within his own body.

She met Kiritsugu on the battlefield, and has fought her entire life like a machine, considering herself a part whose only function is to help Kiritsugu.

Kiritsugu&#39;s eyes are full of tears, and he says, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Having found a survivor, he says this as if he was the one who was saved. An expression of heartfelt joy rises to Kiritsugu&#39;s face. These cuts show Kiritsugu&#39;s despair and hope.</p><p><strong>Comment</strong><br> Director Ei Aoki<br> Fate/Zero was a heavy series, both in terms of the scope of the project and the quantities of material involved. But the staff was all young and full of energy, and we couldn&#39;t have done it without the tireless efforts of the key animation staff in particular. The studio has a caf\xE9 on the first floor, and lots of Fate fans came there every day, and we fed off of that energy to help make the show.</p>', 459);
