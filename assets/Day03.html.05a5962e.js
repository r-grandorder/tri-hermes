You&#39;re going to school?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Do you have a problem with that, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No problems, it&#39;s just...&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer hesitates, but does not object.</p><p>He must have realized yesterday that I&#39;m not the type to take back my decisions.</p><p>I can kind of tell without him saying so. Archer is sarcastic, but he has an honest side to him. So it seems he won&#39;t complain about something he&#39;s accepted.</p><hr><p>Yes, in other words, he&#39;s faithful in an awkward way.</p><p>This is my conclusion... no, more of an intuition after watching Archer for all of yesterday.</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. As you are a Master now, you must always be cautious of other Masters. School is a place where it&#39;s hard to remain prepared against sudden attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. Look, Archer, even though I am a Master now, I don&#39;t intend to change my lifestyle. Besides, a battle between Masters is something that should be done out of public view, right? So, if we are at school where there are lots of people, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see any kind of surprise attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. If that&#39;s what you&#39;ve decided, I can only obey.</p><p>But I can guard you in spirit form, right? You don&#39;t intend for me to stay here while you go to school?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. Not just at school, but I will want you by my side whenever I go outside. It is the Servant&#39;s role to protect the Master, so I&#39;ll be counting on you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m relieved to hear that. It is the duty of a knight to answer trust placed on us. I shall do my best to meet your expectations.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But Rin, just hypothetically, what would you do if there were an enemy in that safe place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? What, are you suggesting there might be a Master at school?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. It&#39;s certainly hard for anyone who isn&#39;t a teacher or student to get in, but wouldn&#39;t it be a problem if someone already there is a Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible. In this town, there&#39;s only one family of magi other than the Tohsaka. That other family has declined, and they don&#39;t even have a Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;How do you know there isn&#39;t a Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, it&#39;s only natural to investigate another family of magi in the same town.</p><p>He isn&#39;t a Master and his successor doesn&#39;t have enough magical energy to become a Master, so we can just ignore them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So, there is another magus at the school you go to. But you say that magus doesn&#39;t have sufficient magical energy to become a Master, is that correct?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Exactly. So most Masters will probably be coming from elsewhere. I don&#39;t think such people would come to the school.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Well, for now, at least.</p><p>But Rin, there are always exceptions. What if there is a magus at your school that you don&#39;t know about?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Like I said, there aren&#39;t any. Magi are sensitive to other magi. If we were at the same school for a year, I should be able to sense other magi no matter how well they hide it.</p><p>I will state with confidence that there are only two magi at our school. One of them is me, and the other is only an apprentice who doesn&#39;t have enough power to become a Master.</p><p>Do you understand? Your caution is just needless worrying. It&#39;s completely impossible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why this is only a hypothetical scenario. There&#39;s always another side to things.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for unexpected things to occur.</p><p>I&#39;m saying that when it does happen, do not blame me.&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer smiles dryly.</p><p>...Just that action makes me want to take it out on him, but if I did, I would be late for school.</p><hr><p>&quot;That won&#39;t happen. A hypothetical is a hypothetical because it won&#39;t happen. If it does, it just means my analysis was too shallow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, I&#39;ll remember that. Let&#39;s go then, Rin.</p><p>It should take thirty minutes to get to the school, so we won&#39;t make it unless we leave soon.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised. Hypotheticals do happen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I am surprised as well. Wow, it pays to argue over everything. It had an unexpected payoff.&quot;</p><hr><p>As soon as we pass the school&#39;s main gate, we joke around like that.</p><p>Around us are students heading to classrooms and it&#39;s almost time for homeroom.</p><p>In the crowd of people rushing into the school building, we stand dumbfounded.</p><hr><p>&quot;This isn&#39;t just the air stagnating. Isn&#39;t there a boundary field set up already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not complete, but the preparation seems to have already started.</p><p>If he&#39;s doing this so openly, he must be a real big shot....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Or a complete amateur. A boundary field that lets others notice the abnormality is only third class. To be first class, it has to be hidden until it&#39;s activated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So. Which do you think it is, Rin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows? I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s third class or first class.</p><p>I&#39;m just going to beat him mercilessly for setting up such an indecent thing in my territory.&quot;</p><hr><p>I walk angrily through the schoolyard.</p><p>As a magus, I&#39;m not about to mince words, but I can&#39;t be satisfied until I properly punish the creator of this boundary field.</p><hr><p>After second period, while walking back from the music room...</p><p>I see a first year student walking unsteadily.</p><p>The student is carrying some stack of papers and it looks like she &#39;s having trouble.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll help, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, Tohsaka...Senpai\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, handouts? World history... that&#39;ll be my homeroom teacher. That Kuzuki, what&#39;s he thinking making a girl do this? Here, give me half of it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... Yes. Thank you, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. So, we&#39;re taking these to your classroom?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No, we&#39;re taking them to Kuzuki-Sensei. He said he&#39;s recalling them because there was a misspelling.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand. Kuzuki&#39;s really stubborn. He&#39;s the guy who cancelled a whole test just because there was one misspelling in it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Huh? You mean the school&#39;s exam?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. I think it was last year&#39;s midterm. He came in while everyone was filling in their names and said in his usual tone that the midterm has a misspelling in it. He said that the question was not correct, so the midterm was to be cancelled and retaken at a later date. We were surprised, but so were the teachers, and they still talk about it today.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s just like Kuzuki-Sensei. He doesn&#39;t think teachers should make any mistakes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He goes too far, though. You&#39;ll realize soon, too. Kuzuki is as stubborn as a rock or a mountain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heehee. Tohsaka-Senpai, you must like Kuzuki-Sensei. It&#39;s rare for you to talk about someone like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? ...Well, I do think he should be more flexible, but...&quot;</p><p>I think that, but I also think he&#39;s not bad this way.</p><hr><p>At our school, there&#39;s a teacher liked by all students and a teacher feared by all students.</p><p>The balance between the two works so well that I think Kuzuki-Sensei is a good disciplinarian. He&#39;s the stick in the carrot and stick approach.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, you&#39;ll get to see more of him once you reach second year. He teaches ethics too.</p><p>...More importantly, Sakura, is it all right if I ask you something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? What is it, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s about yesterday. Were you talking to a strange foreigner?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... y-you were watching, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just by chance. So, what was it? Do you know him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No. Well, he was a strange person and he seemed to be lost. He asked me lots of things, but I couldn&#39;t make out what he was saying, so, um...&quot;</p><p>Ah, so she ran away.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Sorry, I was just a bit curious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s all right... Um, here is fine, Senpai. I only have to hand these to him now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. See you later then.&quot;</p><p>I pass the handouts back to Sakura.</p><p>As I start to head back to my classroom, I pause.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura, how are things?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... yes, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m doing fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. Well, if Shinji does something again, tell me. He doesn&#39;t know when to stop, so it will only get worse if you don&#39;t say anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. You don&#39;t need to worry, Senpai. Nii-san has been kind recently.&quot;</p><p>...If she says that with such a smile, I can&#39;t say anything else.</p><p>I bid her goodbye once more and turn my back on the familiar junior.</p><hr><p>The day ends.</p><p>Students leave the classroom and the building gets darker by the second.</p><p>The sun will set soon.</p><p>When the red sun sets and night falls, there should be no one left in the school.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s begin, Archer. First, we need to check out the boundary field. Once we figure out what kind of boundary field it is, we&#39;ll decide whether to eliminate it or leave it.&quot;</p><p>I address my invisible partner.</p><p>Archer must understand as I sense him nodding.</p><hr><p>A boundary field is something that protects its caster.</p><p>You could call it a geographical magecraft in which one knits a line of magecraft across a land to change the interior.</p><hr><p>Infinite different effects are possible within a boundary field.</p><p>There are all sorts of boundary field, from ones that conceal the area from people&#39;s eyes, to ones that limit the use of magecraft within them.</p><p>The most aggressive of all are those that oppress life forms within them.</p><hr><p>The boundary field laid out over our school is of that kind.</p><p>It is not yet complete, but once it is, everyone in the school should fall unconscious.</p><hr><p>But something like this won&#39;t affect me.</p><p>After all, a boundary field is something targeted not at me, but at the place I am in.</p><p>Such an indirect magical energy intervention has no effect on magi, who have magical energy throughout their bodies.</p><p>A weak current floating through the air will only be repelled by a strong current like myself.</p><hr><p>So this boundary field has a different intention.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of person set up this boundary field, but his intention is not to defeat a Master.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to believe, but his target is everyone in this school.</p><p>...There&#39;s only one reason to do something like that.</p><p>Unbelievably, this guy is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>I search the school building and emerge onto the rooftop to finish.</p><p>It&#39;s dark outside.</p><p>It&#39;s eight o&#39;clock now, way past the school closing time which is six.</p><p>The only people still in the school are me and Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So, this makes seven. Well, it looks like this is the origin.&quot;</p><p>A seven-stroke mark is openly drawn on the rooftop.</p><p>This purplish-red character only visible to magi is something I have never seen before, engraved with something unknown.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Dammit. This isn&#39;t something I can handle.&quot;</p><p>The person who set up this boundary field didn&#39;t think about anything.</p><p>He didn&#39;t think, but the boundary field is bound with amazing skill.</p><p>I can temporarily drain magical energy from this boundary field, but I cannot eliminate the boundary field itself.</p><p>The boundary field can be reactivated just by having the caster put more magical energy into it again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer says nothing.</p><p>...He&#39;s been quiet ever since we came out onto the rooftop, probably because he too recognizes the power of this boundary field.</p><p>This boundary field doesn&#39;t just drain one&#39;s strength.</p><p>Once activated, it will literally &quot;dissolve&quot; all the people within it.</p><hr><p>There are boundary fields that drain physical and mental strength from people within them.</p><p>But the boundary field laid out over this school is on a completely different level.</p><p>This is a soul-eater. It is a Bloodfort that dissolves people within it and claims the souls that seep out.</p><hr><p>Since ancient times, souls have been hard to handle.</p><p>Even though they&#39;re believed to exist and are necessary for magecraft, only one magus has ever understood the soul.</p><hr><p>Souls are only &quot;things to be investigated&quot;, or &quot;things to be moved into containers&quot;.</p><p>It&#39;s incomprehensible not merely to suck them out but also to collect them in a single place.</p><p>It&#39;s because a magus has no use for them even if one were to collect this unconvertible energy.</p><p>So if there&#39;s a reason, it must be...</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer. Are you Servants... this kind of creature?&quot;</p><p>I ask coldly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It is as you suspect. I told you we are basically spirits. Therefore, our meals consist of souls and mental constituents.</p><p>As you subsist on meat, we subsist on souls and minds.</p><p>Our basic abilities do not change from such nourishment, but we do become tougher. In other words, our magical energy capacity increases.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Yes.</p><p>To strengthen your Servant, you must attack people indiscriminately.</p><hr><p>&quot;So the magical energy the Master provides isn&#39;t enough?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not that, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to have more. In war, if you lack strength, you make up for it with supplies, right?</p><p>It&#39;s a basic tactic for a Master to steal energy from the people around them. In that regard, this boundary field is very efficient.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer is saying that if I want to win, I should kill people and steal their strength.</p><p>How simple.</p><p>I already knew that.</p><p>That&#39;s why I think I know which path I am going to choose.</p><hr><p>&quot;That annoys me. Don&#39;t ever mention it again, Archer.&quot;</p><p>I say so while staring at the mark on the ground.</p><p>For some reason, Archer sounds happy as he confidently answers,[r]</p><p>&quot;I feel the same way. I do not intend to do so either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, let&#39;s erase this. It&#39;s meaningless, but it should hinder them a bit.&quot;</p><p>I approach the mark engraved on the ground and extend my left arm.</p><p>The Magic Crest on my left arm is the &quot;book of magecraft&quot; passed down the Tohsaka family.</p><hr><p>I switch on my sense.</p><p>I push magical energy into my Magic Crest, read the part that explains the elimination of boundary fields, and now all I have to do is activate it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Abzug. Bedienung Mittelstand.&quot;</p><p>Eliminate. Surgical extraction, second section.</p><p>I touch the ground with my left hand and let my magical energy flow out.</p><p>This will at least wash the color off this mark, but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;What, you&#39;re going to erase it? What a waste.&quot;</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>As if to stop the erasure of the boundary field, a voice echoes over.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I quickly stand up and turn around.</p><p>On top of the water tower.</p><p>In the sky ten meters away, a guy is looking down at me.</p><hr><p>Deep ultramarine that melts into the night.</p><p>His grin is wild and a bestial smell carries on the wind.</p><p>...The stare of the beast is a cool one.</p><p>The man in blue looks at me like an old friend, even in this situation\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Is this your doing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Petty tricks are the magi&#39;s job. We only fight as we are commanded to. Isn&#39;t that right, you over there?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Casual, but his voice is filled with murderous intent.</p><p>This guy can see Archer...!</p><hr><p>&quot;As I thought, a Servant...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. Since you can tell, I can consider you as my enemy, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My spine freezes.</p><p>A normal, light tone of voice.</p><p>And it&#39;s colder than anything I&#39;ve ever heard, scary enough to make me vomit....</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t tell how I should move or what my best course is.</p><p>But my reason is telling me absolutely not to fight this man right here\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow. That&#39;s pretty good. You seem like you don&#39;t know anything, but you grasp the important points.</p><p>Man, I messed up. I shouldn&#39;t have called out to you just for fun.&quot;</p><p>The man raises his arm.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It happens in an instant.</p><p>The arm that held nothing until now...</p><p>Now holds a red weapon, two meters long.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I jump to the side without thinking.</p><p>I can&#39;t spare the time to consider that I can&#39;t jump full force while on a rooftop.</p><p>I just jump with full force to the side as if trying to smash the fence...!</p><hr><p>A whirlwind brushes past my hair.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Barely made it.</p><p>He rushed me in an eyeblink and mercilessly slashed at the space I just occupied.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, you&#39;ve got some good legs, young lady...!&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The blue whirlwind pursues me.</p><p>There are no escapes.</p><p>The fence is behind me. To my sides... no, I won&#39;t make it...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Es ist gros, es ist klein....!!&quot;</p><p>My response is fast.</p><p>I run the Magic Crest on my left arm and assemble the magecraft in a single measure.</p><p>It lightens my body and adjusts gravity.</p><p>In this instant, my body becomes light as a feather, and I leap\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, let me handle it...!&quot;</p><p>I jump over the fence and fall from the rooftop.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The wind and pressure push against my body.</p><p>Fifteen meters to the ground, 1.7 seconds until landing...[r]</p><p>No, that&#39;s too slow. He&#39;ll catch up...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Vox, gott es Atlas\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Archer, take care of the landing...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I let Archer take the impact of the landing and start to run as soon as my feet touch the ground.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015First, I have to change the location.</p><p>We have to go somewhere we can move around freely, not a small place like a rooftop.</p><p>We have to move to a large field with no obstacles, to play to Archer&#39;s and my strengths...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, hah...!&quot;</p><p>I run from the rooftop to the schoolground in less than seven seconds.</p><p>It&#39;s more than a hundred meters. My speed is so fast that normal people would see only a blur.</p><hr><p>But that&#39;s...</p><p>&quot;Man, those are really good legs. It&#39;ll be a waste to kill you here.&quot;</p><p>...Meaningless against a Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>At the moment I step back, Archer steps in front, taking form.</p><p>A cloudy night.</p><p>In Archer&#39;s hand is a shortsword that reflects the weak moonlight.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Wow.&quot;</p><p>The man crooks his mouth.</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s good. That&#39;s the way to go. I don&#39;t mind people who are quick on the uptake.&quot;</p><p>A large whirlwind.</p><p>...That&#39;s the weapon swung at me on the rooftop... the blood red crimson lance that tried to mercilessly slaughter me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Servant... Lancer\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. And your Servant is Saber</p><p>...Or maybe not. Who the hell are you?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of his previous casual demeanor.</p><p>In response to Lancer, full of murderous intent, Archer remains silent.</p><hr><p>...The distance between the two is about five meters.</p><p>The weapon in Lancer&#39;s hand is about two meters.</p><p>For that man with the bestial smell, I feel like the remaining three meters are meaningless.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. You&#39;re not the type to engage in one-on-one combat. So you must be Archer.&quot;</p><p>Archer doesn&#39;t respond to the sneering voice either.</p><p>Confronting each other, strangely, are red and blue.</p><p>The two counterfeit colored knights are already watching for the other&#39;s clinching blow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. I don&#39;t like it, but now we&#39;ve met, we&#39;ll just have to fight.

Why does it have to be you?&quot;</p><p>I grit my teeth.</p><p>Not to suppress my trembling.</p><p>I&#39;m really pissed off.</p><p>Why is it him?</p><p>Why did it have to be him?</p><p>I&#39;m not mad at Lancer for killing a witness quickly and perfectly, just as a Servant should do.</p><p>I&#39;m just angry at him for staying late at this place, on this day...!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Sakura&#39;s face flashes in my mind.</p><p>She will definitely cry.</p><p>And I recall one red-tinted day after school, a long time ago.</p><p>...A distant sunset.</p><p>Someone always running alone.</p><p>And a boring girl, staring at that from far away.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And before me, the corpse of someone who happened to get involved.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...There is a way.</p><p>I might fail and lose my last resort in the process, but there is still a way.</p><p>No, I&#39;ll lose my last resort whether I succeed or fail, so the result for me won&#39;t change.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a mistake.</p><p>The fact of his death is already determined.</p><p>It&#39;s my fault for not noticing the things around me.</p><p>It&#39;s his fault for unluckily staying late.</p><hr><p>So I don&#39;t need to go that far.</p><p>Yes, because this is what my father, who gave me nothing else, left just for me.</p><p>A powerful chunk of magical energy, a reliable last resort to win through this battle.</p><p>A precious, precious thing just for me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So what, idiot?&quot;</p><p>I shake the feeling off and kneel in front of the one who will become a corpse in another second.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man, I&#39;ve done it.&quot;</p><p>The pendant in my hand becomes lighter.</p><p>My father&#39;s memento is drained almost to emptiness,</p><p>and falls onto what used to be a dying body.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</p><p>Yes, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have the power or skills to revive someone with a damaged heart, damaged blood vessels, and on the verge of brain death on top of that.</p><p>That&#39;s why I had to make up for my lack of skill with this powerful object.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s lucky he was still breathing. If he was completely dead, no amount of magical energy could have revived him.&quot;</p><p>But since he was still alive...</p><p>I just did what I could, and ended up saving his life.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It would have been awful if I failed, but since I succeeded, I guess it&#39;s all right. Yeah, I feel fulfilled to be honest, so this wasn&#39;t such a bad experience.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m just bluffing.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let&#39;s go. What&#39;s done is done. I have to head back before he wakes up.&quot;</p><p>Yeah, there&#39;s no need for me to stay here any longer.</p><p>Archer should be following Lancer, so I should go home by myself.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015On my way back, I remember.</p><p>I left the pendant at school, just a pendant now that the magical energy has been drained out of it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve no more use for that pendant.</p><p>Sure, it might have a bit of magical energy left in it, but surely less than the ten jewels I have.</p><p>What my father intended to leave for me was enough magical energy to win the Holy Grail War.</p><p>So now, without magical energy, that thing is meaningless.</p><hr><p>I enter the house without saying anything and sit on the sofa.</p><p>Archer isn&#39;t back yet.</p><p>I sigh and listen to the clock for a few minutes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh, I have to switch gears.</p><p>What am I doing, daydreaming after a battle like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>I jump up and brew some tea.</p><p>There are so many things to think about.</p><p>Most importantly, the Servants.</p><p>I have just witnessed a battle between Servants I had previously only understood intellectually.</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer, huh...? I panicked when he almost used his Noble Phantasm, but I would have found out his identity if he had used it...&quot;</p><hr><p>The easiest way to beat an enemy Servant is to learn their identity.</p><p>Ignoring for the moment the idiot who doesn&#39;t even know his own identity, the biggest weak point of a Servant is their &quot;true name&quot;.</p><p>Discovering the Servant&#39;s true name... in other words, figuring out their identity... should let you take a guess at what kind of Noble Phantasm they might have.</p><hr><p>It goes without saying, but since Servants are heroic spirits, they have a legend associated with them.</p><p>If you figure out their legend, you should be able to find out most of their abilities.</p><p>Servants are called by their class names because they want to hide their true names.</p><p>Because the more famous a hero is, the more people know about their weapons and their weaknesses.</p><hr><p>A heroic spirit that becomes a Servant never gives out their true identity.</p><p>The only ones that know the Servants&#39; identities are the Masters.</p><p>There&#39;s even a tacit understanding that the Masters hide their Servants&#39; identities while trying to discover the identities of the others.</p><hr><p>...This is the fifth Holy Grail War.</p><p>The qualities of the Servants are determined by the ranks of the summoned heroic spirits.</p><p>It goes without saying that the more famous heroes and the heroes with better weapons are stronger.</p><hr><p>But it&#39;s difficult to summon such heroic spirits.</p><p>To summon a heroic spirit, one must have a connection with them such as a weapon they used during their lives.</p><p>Even the magecraft Association has a few of such things.</p><p>So generally, one will summon a heroic spirit that suits them, like I did.</p><hr><p>A Servant&#39;s strength is determined by the rank of the heroic spirit.</p><p>But it&#39;s not that simple as even the most powerful heroic spirits may have a hard time depending on the class they are assigned to.</p><p>That is because of the special abilities assigned to each class, the possibility of the weak defeating the strong.</p><hr><p>The seven classes each have a different additional ability, and one even has a chance of defeating an opponent of higher rank depending on the ability&#39;s affinity.</p><p>To take an example, an infamous hero has defeated a great hero four times in the past.</p><p>As far as I know, the most powerful Servant is Saber.</p><hr><p>In all the previous four wars, Saber has made it to the final fight.</p><p>It is said that the three classes Saber, Lancer and Archer have strong magecraft resistance.</p><p>To put it simply, magecraft is pretty much useless against them.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s because they are fighters who fought through the age of myths, when magics were used widely.</p><p>Magics that magi use now would probably dissipate just by touching them.</p><p>...Anyways, that&#39;s why these three classes are considered the basics and the best.</p><hr><p>Another that&#39;s worthy of mention is the Servant Berserker.</p><p>The heroic spirit summoned into this class loses their sanity.</p><p>Just as the name implies, they become a mad warrior puppet of their Master. The benefit from this is a &quot;strengthening&quot; of their power, far exceeding the powers they had when alive.</p><hr><p>However, the more powerful a Servant becomes, the greater the burden it imposes on the Master.</p><p>In the past, Masters who summoned Berserker couldn&#39;t control their rampaging Servants, and destroyed themselves by running out of magical energy.</p><p>No exceptions.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The winners and losers of the Holy Grail War are largely determined by the abilities of the Servants.</p><p>Well, I expect there are ways to win it by the Master&#39;s efforts, but it is basically a fight between the Servants.</p><p>That is why a Master should be very careful when summoning a Servant....</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I silently consider the plans we should make from now on.</p><p>The clock, fixed already, strikes eleven while I do so... and Archer comes home.</p><hr><p>&quot;Welcome back. How did it go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry. I failed. It must be one cautious Master. At the very least, Lancer&#39;s Master is not on this side of town.&quot;</p><hr><p>As I expected.</p><p>Lancer was alone and it seems his Master isn&#39;t the type to show up for battles personally.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Well, I guess it won&#39;t be that easy.&quot;</p><p>Yes, there&#39;s no way everything will go as I might hope.</p><p>So it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>Let&#39;s consider what happened tonight as a tuition fee for the lessons learned.</p><hr><p>&quot;You seem down, Master. Where are your high spirits? Don&#39;t tell me you got scared by that one fight. If you so order, I am ready to go battle Lancer again right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer protests silently that we should do so.</p><p>...I see.</p><p>I guess I look depressed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. I&#39;m staying in only because I don&#39;t want to do anything pointless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Anything pointless...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, all the Masters aren&#39;t present yet, right? Tonight couldn&#39;t be helped, but I wouldn&#39;t start fighting before we get the signal. My father told me this is one of the rules of the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see, so your father was also a Master.&quot;</p><p>Archer nods, understanding.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>Archer makes a troubled face and starts to ponder something.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Do you have something you want to say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s something I forgot to ask.</p><p>Rin, you&#39;ve been raised since you were small to be a Master and you&#39;ve accepted that, right? So you&#39;ve expected to be a Master since the beginning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. Well, there certainly are Masters that are suddenly appointed, but I&#39;m different. For the Tohsaka family, the Holy Grail has been our earnest desire for many generations.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I thought so. So having been raised to become a Master, you must have a purpose.</p><p>I forgot to ask about that. I cannot swear my sword to you unless I know my Master&#39;s wish.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So Rin, what is your wish?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wish? I don&#39;t really have one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>Oh, Archer&#39;s making a funny face.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That can&#39;t be true! The Holy Grail is an almighty grail that grants wishes. Becoming a Master means obtaining the Holy Grail, so how can you say you have no wish to grant...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer is asking with a serious expression.</p><hr><p>...Oh, I see.</p><p>The Master&#39;s wish after obtaining the Holy Grail isn&#39;t irrelevant to the Servant.</p><p>But it&#39;s strange. Father said that Servants have wishes as well, but that is only their wish.</p><p>I don&#39;t think Archer should be concerned because I don&#39;t have any wishes.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, if you don&#39;t have a specific wish, why not wish for something ambiguous? Like ruling the world?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? The world is already mine.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey now, Archer. The world is just another word for the things you value around you, right? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer looks at me with a troubled expression.</p><p>I&#39;m amazed. The guy really is hard-headed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ridiculous. The Holy Grail is a power to grant wishes, a power to obtain the world. Are you saying you&#39;re seeking it, yet you have no wish?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But ruling the world would be so troublesome and there&#39;s no point in wishing for something so pointless. You seem to lack imagination.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t understand. For what then, do you fight?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I fight because there&#39;s a battle, Archer. And I&#39;ll take whatever I can get. I don&#39;t know about this Holy Grail thing, but I can just use it when I find something I want, right? As a human, there are infinite things I might want in life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So, you&#39;re saying...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;m fighting to win, Archer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s shoulders slump.</p><p>Maybe he&#39;s disappointed in my opinions, but it seems he&#39;s finally relaxed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I give up. You&#39;re certainly a worthy Master for me.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.</p><p>...I find it hard to deal with that kind of comment, so I wish he&#39;d stop saying such things....</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh. A Servant has no right to choose their Master, but I&#39;ll ask for the heck of it. Why am I a worthy Master for you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It goes without saying. You&#39;re unmistakably the strongest Master.</p><p>No one would be a better Master to serve than you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, thanks. It doesn&#39;t sound like flattery when you say it.&quot;</p><p>...I look away because I&#39;m embarrassed.</p><hr><p>I find it hard to deal with Archer because he speaks frankly like this even though he&#39;s so cynical.</p><p>...But, well, I&#39;m honestly happy that he trusts me.</p><p>I trust Archer and he trusts me.</p><p>I don&#39;t think this sense of solidarity is a bad thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well then, let&#39;s take a break. Even if the seventh Master is going to appear, it won&#39;t be right now\u2015\u2015\u2015wait a minute, Rin. What happened to that jewelry of yours?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You mean my pendant? Oh, I forgot it. It&#39;s out of power, so there&#39;s no use for it, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s true, but... well, if you say so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a memento of my father, but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s my only memory of him\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s no good. You don&#39;t have to be that strong, Rin.&quot;</p><hr><p>So saying,</p><p>Archer takes out the pendant I left at school.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... you went and picked it up for me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t forget it again. It only looks right on you, Rin.&quot;</p><p>As if he&#39;s embarrassed, Archer looks away as he hands me the pendant.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Thanks.&quot;</p><p>I accept it.</p><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t know if I should be embarrassed or cool about it.</p><hr><p>The pendant is as it was.</p><p>...As expected, there&#39;s no magical energy left in it.</p><p>Empty of magical energy, it&#39;s just an expensive but ordinary jewel, and it doesn&#39;t hold any power.</p><p>But, as Archer would put it.</p><p>Even if there&#39;s no power left in this pendant, it still has meaning as something my father specifically left for me.</p><p>Then... maybe I can just laugh off the fact that I helped that guy by sacrificing my trump card.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey, wait a sec.&quot;</p><p>Something clicks in my head.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t thinking straight back then because of my regret, but thinking about it calmly, I missed something.</p><hr><p>He saw us, so it&#39;ll be dangerous unless we adjust his memory.</p><p>Basically, Lancer prioritized eliminating the witness over his battle with us.</p><p>Lancer&#39;s thinking probably matches his Master&#39;s.</p><p>So... if such a Master finds out the guy they killed didn&#39;t die, what would he do?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015He wouldn&#39;t let the guy keep on living\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I get up from my sofa.</p><p>...It&#39;s been three hours since then.</p><p>I might not make it, but...</p><p>After all I did, I have to make it on time\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>I run through the night.</p><p>Fortunately, I know where his house is.</p><p>No, I didn&#39;t look it up, but it just happens that an acquaintance of mine goes there a lot... though I&#39;ve never been there myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Honestly, you&#39;re just taking on unwanted troubles.&quot;</p><p>Archer has no interest in cooperating.</p><p>He was against saving the guy when he was dying, and he&#39;s against me going to help him right now.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s midnight.</p><p>Under the cloudy night sky, we reach the Japanese-styled house.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no sight of anyone in this house on the edge of the residential district.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many houses around it, and there&#39;s no one to come and help if something happens here.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My breath is white.</p><p>A wind starts to pick up.</p><p>It must be quite strong as the clouds start to drift fast.</p><p>The supposedly warm wind of Fuyuki sends chills down my spine, making me tremble.</p><hr><p>Even if Fuyuki City is considered warm, it&#39;s still cold on the hill.</p><hr><p>The air around here is frozen.</p><p>I strain my ears in the cold atmosphere.</p><p>In the frozen feeling, I feel a small sense of an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...He&#39;s here. The Servant from before...!&quot;</p><p>I bite my lip.</p><p>His presence is perceptible on the other side of this wall.</p><p>Lancer is in the house already and about to kill the same guy again, who has just come home without a clue as to what happened.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll just have to jump in and beat him. I&#39;ll worry about what comes next when it happens\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Just as I&#39;m about to command Archer to go in.</p><p>A bright white light, like a fallen sun, comes from within the house.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The presence is eclipsed by another presence.</p><p>The wave of power of the Servant Lancer is consumed by an even larger wave.</p><p>...The instantaneous explosion of ether gives the spiritual being a body, summoned to overpower Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;No way...&quot;</p><p>I can only mutter.</p><p>But it&#39;s true.</p><p>To prove it\u2015\u2015\u2015Lancer jumps over the wall and leaps away as if fleeing from this place.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, Archer. Is this another one of your hypothetical scenarios?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But this makes seven. All the Masters are here now, Rin.&quot;</p><p>Archer answers calmly.</p><p>I&#39;ve lost my normal judgment.</p><p>That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t even consider the obvious event that would follow.</p><hr><p>The wind blows strongly.</p><p>Clouds cover the sky like an umbrella.</p><p>The unlit suburbs are enclosed by darkness.</p><p>And the Servant jumps over the wall, coming down like a demonic bird\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Archer has reacted already.</p><p>But I couldn&#39;t react.</p><p>That was my mistake.</p><p>The battle ended with that small opening, not lasting even a second.</p><p>It might have been only a second for me, but for that Servant, it was an opening that couldn&#39;t be ignored.</p><hr><p>A sword rushes for me.</p><p>&quot;Huh, Archer...?&quot;</p><p>Archer pushes me aside and the Servant slashes him.</p><p>It happens in an instant.</p><p>Archer, who handled Lancer&#39;s fury of attacks beautifully, has been taken down with one blow\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer, disappear...!&quot;</p><p>But I make it in time this time.</p><p>Just as the enemy Servant is about to cut off Archer&#39;s head with her blade, I forcibly remove him.</p><p>A pain in my right hand.</p><p>It must have been an excessive command, so a Command Spell has disappeared from my hand.</p><hr><p>...Now there&#39;s only one remaining.</p><p>But this is for the best.</p><p>Rather than having Archer die, I would prefer to lose one or two Command Spells...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Giving no consideration to Archer&#39;s disappearance, the Servant attacks me.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t underestimate me!&quot;</p><p>I take from my pocket a topaz with a wind spell stored in it. Then, I launch all the magical energy it contains at her without processing it...!</p><hr><p>This thing, which can blow away a house without a trace, is a bundle of wind spells I&#39;ve stocked up over time.</p><p>It&#39;s one of the ten jewels I&#39;ve been putting my magical energy into for seventeen years without rest.</p><p>I&#39;m using all the magical energy stored in it, so even if I can&#39;t defeat her, it should at least slow her down a bit\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>...No, not even that.</p><p>It did nothing.</p><p>The swirl of wind that instantly tears apart anything caught within it disappears like a magecraft trick the instant it touches the Servant.</p><p>...Such strong magecraft resistance.</p><p>Mere magical energy from a magus cannot hurt this Servant...!</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So, this is it.</p><p>She can&#39;t be hurt by magecraft, and I&#39;ve lost the protection of Archer, so I can&#39;t stop this Servant.</p><p>I barely managed to avoid one blow, but that&#39;s all.</p><p>I look up at the night sky.</p><p>In it is the figure of cold-hearted Death who is looking down at me as I lay miserably on the ground\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Wha...&quot;</p><p>The wind blows.</p><p>In between the dark clouds in the spiral sky, the moon shines.</p><p>The falling moonlight and the beautiful face...</p><p>This is the Servant that drove off Lancer,</p><p>defeated my Archer in one strike,</p><p>and annulled my magecraft with no trouble.</p><hr><p>&quot;That magecraft was splendid, magus.&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl&#39;s voice is like a bell.</p><p>Yes, this voice is like a nightmare right now.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>The more beautiful my enemy is, the more of a nightmare it is as I cannot believe the difference in our strength.</p><hr><p>&quot;But this is your end, Master of Archer.&quot;</p><hr><p>The point of the sword shines brilliantly.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015On the verge of death, I understand.</p><p>With just one look, without proof...</p><hr><p>This is the card I wanted.</p><p>The one said to be the strongest of all Servants, the hero of the sword.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I look up at the moon, accepting my death.</p><p>There&#39;s no time for me to flee or plead for my life.</p><p>I will die here and Tohsaka Rin&#39;s Holy Grail War will end on the third day.</p><p>There is only disgrace and regret, and I will probably vanish bearing a grudge against my enemy.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But still, I don&#39;t feel anything.</p><p>Something must really be wrong with me.</p><p>Even though I&#39;m going to be killed in an instant, I adore her again.</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>If you ask for regrets, that&#39;s it.</p><hr><p>But I guess it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Because she&#39;s the most powerful Servant.</p><p>Because her figure is just so heartless, so infinitely valiant, and so beautiful\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p>', 1166);
