Well, I just think it&#39;d be best if they heard it from you instead.\u201D</p><p>Those two probably have a deeper connection with Kiritsugu than I do.</p><p>But even then, I don&#39;t think Illya or Saber ever\u2015\u2015\u2015visited his tombstone in this forest.</p><hr><p>\u201COh?

Caster!?\u201D</p><p>\u201C? What&#39;s with that face?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I mean...\u201D</p><p>Caster is supposed to be, you know, someone with a hood and robe, with nothing but mouth and hands in plain sight. No, trivial details aside,</p><hr><p>\u201C...What a surprise. It turns out you are quite a beauty.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015W-What&#39;s that all of a sudden?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, anyways.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Oops. I really gotta fix this habit of thinking out loud.</p><hr><p>\u201CAt any rate, that&#39;s quite a load you have. Do you really intend to carry it all the way back by yourself?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd what if I do?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I was just thinking it would be quite a challenge.\u201D</p><hr><p>In fact, a lot of those look pretty unwieldy.</p><p>Nah, Caster&#39;s a Servant, they must be featherlight to her... I guess?</p><p>She did lose to Tohsaka in close combat. Indeed, other than magecraft, I wonder if she isn&#39;t just a regular girl.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Huh. And if I said that it is, you wouldn&#39;t be kind enough to help me, would you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI would? I was about to go home, anyways.\u201D</p><p>I hold out a hand to take some of the bags, but Caster keeps eyeing me with suspicion.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm? I bet it is pretty difficult to carry it all yourself, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Indeed. Alright, if you will.\u201D</p><p>She passes me one of a paper bag&#39;s handles.</p><p>This is a lot heavier than I expected. The string is digging deeply into my palm.</p><hr><p>\u201CAck. Unbelievable.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNevermind the trivial. Aren&#39;t you a man, boy?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUgh...\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t argue with that.</p><p>...Come to think of it, it&#39;s unusual for Caster to be this familiar.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnyhow, you really should have asked somebody to come along if you were planning on buying this much.</p><p>Like Issei, or maybe Kuzuki-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CToday was hobby shopping.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t want to bother Souichirou-sama with it, and I doubt Issei would help.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sounds like Issei-Caster relations are as delicate as ever.</p><p>That is, they wouldn&#39;t start a fight, but they do regard each other in a pretty reserved manner.</p><p>...It&#39;s definitely a problem.</p><p>Even though, unlike at our place, they may not meet one-on-one very often, with all the monks living at the Ryuudou temple and whatnot.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Alright, I guess it&#39;s none of my business, after all.</p><p>That aside, you said you have a hobby?\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yes? A Servant without entertainment would have to be somebody like Berserker, probably.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that&#39;s how it is...\u201D</p><hr><p>Now that I look at it, Saber does have a preoccupation with consuming food, while Rider seems to have taken a liking to reading books.</p><p>The other guys must have something they enjoy, too. And had Berserker been summoned into a different class, even he would probably have some kind of hobby.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo what&#39;s in there, anyways?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTools for making a ship in a bottle, actually.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm.\u201D</p><p>Ship in a bottle, ship in a bottle...</p><p>Now where have I seen one recently\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CWait a second, that decoration at Issei&#39;s place, were you the one who made it?! I did think that it was a strange choice of decor for a temple&#39;s entrance.\u201D</p><p>\u201CH-How rude! The chief priest wanted to put it there, so\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You mean Issei&#39;s father?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s somebody else now.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see. A stout man, his father&#39;s looks are nowhere near Issei&#39;s, almost to the point of a mystery.</p><p>If it was him, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a suspicious-looking Caster-made bottle-ship ended up as decoration, be it a temple or anywhere else... Oh, that&#39;s right.</p><hr><p>\u201CI just remembered something. Caster, please stop sending us strange stuff, it bothers Saber.\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t know exactly what it was, but for some reason, Tohsaka kept grinning when she got it.</p><p>That time...</p><p>\u201CIt was sent by Caster. I&#39;ll check it over, just in case.\u201D</p><hr><p>And so she took it away.</p><p>Tohsaka then called for Saber, and after that, all I know is that something had upset her.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, but it looked so great on her.\u201D</p><p>Does that mean that the other parcels had stuff like those clothes in them, too?</p><hr><p>\u201C...But you wouldn&#39;t wear something that Saber asked you to, would you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m offended. Getting someone to wear nice clothing, especially this well-fitting, is something I enjoy greatly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see... Unfortunately, Saber isn&#39;t willing to.\u201D</p><p>I also think that the pretty clothes Caster bought for her suit Saber well, but she must hate them herself.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat a pity.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo what about all of these? You bought this much, yet no one is going to wear them? What a waste.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh well, it&#39;s too bad there isn&#39;t a young kid I could dress up at the temple.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor starters, Issei could fill in as one of those.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIndeed, he could. He wouldn&#39;t be a bad choice, actually, although I would prefer a girl\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you asked him, I&#39;m sure he would disagree.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but... even like that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>A distant look in Caster&#39;s eyes.</p><p>...Issei in a frilly dress?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015.</p><hr><p>\u201CGive me a break...\u201D</p><p>That much was said with all my might.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night\u30FBritual-window" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night\u30FBritual-window" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night\u30FBRitual window</h3><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h2 id="day-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2</h2><h3 id="emiya-s\u30FBday-2-the-trap-of-high-class-ingredients" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-s\u30FBday-2-the-trap-of-high-class-ingredients" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya&#39;s\u30FBDay 2 The trap of high-class ingredients</h3><hr><p>As I was passing through the living room to start the usual lunch preparations, I noticed Saber, engrossed in reading, quite unusual for her.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Not having noticed my presence just yet, she&#39;s leaning forward, her cat-like eyes wide open, staring intently at something on top of the table.</p><p>While I sure am interested in the contents of that magazine now, I wouldn&#39;t want to interrupt. I&#39;ll just go straight to the kitch\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, great timing.\u201D</p><p>\u201CF-For what?\u201D</p><p>As I turn around, Saber finally peels her eyes off the page.</p><p>The thing she presents in front of her chest is a large magazine with a colorful banner headline. That&#39;s a bit of a surprise. I imagined Saber would be interested in more serious magazines.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, what kind of taste does this &quot;foie gras&quot; have?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Foie gras?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, that&#39;s right. Also, what about caviar, truffles, shark fin, bird&#39;s nest soup, Matsutake mushrooms, splendid alfonsino, spine lobster, Jinhua ham, Peking duck, guinea fowl, puffer fish, soft-shelled turtle, wasanbon sugar, Yubari melon, Matsuzaka beef\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201CH-Hold on. What on Earth are you talking about?\u201D</p><p>Saber&#39;s eyes were so serious, I unconsciously got scared and interrupted her.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy are you suddenly so interested in those things?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis.\u201D</p><p>And so, Saber turns the cover of the book she&#39;s holding towards me.</p><p>&quot;High class food you have to try once&quot;...?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is this book?\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t recall buying this book. Come to think of it, there&#39;s no reason for me to have it, either.</p><p>Sakura has a collection of recipe books that I&#39;ll never be able to match, but this is more like a guide book.</p><hr><p>\u201CTaiga left it here some time ago.\u201D</p><p>Now I understand. I can see the underlying motive.</p><hr><p>She probably thought that by leaving it here in the living room, Sakura or I would look it over and say &quot;Okay, let&#39;s have Matsutake mushrooms for dinner tonight.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And judging by Saber&#39;s shining eyes, Fuji-Nee&#39;s plan is already about 50% successful.</p><p>\u201C...So, you&#39;re saying you&#39;re interested in this.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. These are all ingredients I would like to taste. I am certain they would be delicious.\u201D</p><p>Saber visualizes the high class ingredients she&#39;s yet to try.</p><p>But with the normal person&#39;s access to high quality goods, I doubt I can rise to the culinary standard of a high-ranking person.</p><hr><p>\u201CDidn&#39;t you live in a castle as a king? That&#39;s very luxurious\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Crap. It wasn&#39;t like that, what a gaffe.</p><p>Certainly, Saber lived a courtly life. However, at that time, there were no pompous royal feasts or formal table manners, for that matter.</p><p>To begin with, the French brought high class food with them... what century are we talking about here?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Shirou, I believe I told you before. In my time, there were no plates, the meat was merely cooked and thrown on the table, and you shaved it off with a knife\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry, Saber. That was my bad\u2015\u2015\u2015While I do want to say that you can have whatever you like to eat as an apology\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Indeed, with our household&#39;s finances, saying &quot;Alright, how about we go eat there?&quot; with that menu is an impossible dream.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s a stretch, but if it&#39;s for you alone, I&#39;ll do it somehow.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe alone, you say?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, that&#39;s the limit.</p><p>Apart from that, if Rin lends me a hand with an investment of a jewel or something, maybe I can take everyone out to a fancy place in Shinto\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Knowing Rin, that kind of a fictional scene is hardly imaginable.\u201D</p><p>I agree completely.</p><p>She is distinctively cheap, stingy, and a born miser. I don&#39;t want to hear her complaining\u2015\u2015\u2015besides, I simply can&#39;t imagine Tohsaka being this lavish.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. I do want to take you to a rich celebrity-like place someday, but until then, you&#39;ll have to put up with the food that I make.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you saying, Shirou? I&#39;m very satisfied with the food in this house. I&#39;ve never considered myself to be patiently enduring it.\u201D</p><hr><p>She says such a wonderful thing with a straight face.</p><p>If you say it like that, my fighting spirit will be boosted even with just lunch preparations.</p><hr><p>\u201CTherefore... I believe that, some day, you will personally harvest high-class ingredients. You will make a splendid meal, which you will use to decorate this dining table.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Eh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause I believe in you.\u201D</p><hr><p>W-What do you believe in?</p><p>Saber throws out a reckless word of belief.</p><p>She flips through the magazine in her hand, and finally opens the page she was after.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. Goose. Foie &quot;quack.&quot; How about we start from the matter of feeding and caring for the goose itself?\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;Quack?&quot; Hold on a minute, Saber.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf a goose is too much trouble, a pig is another choice. As far as feeding livestock goes, pigs are ideal.</p><p>Moreover, did you know, Shirou? According to this book, only sows can find truffles underground.</p><p>Of course, there&#39;s different varieties of ham, so we will have to choose the breed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGive me that. I&#39;ll make sure to smack its rightful <ruby>owner<rt>idiot</rt></ruby> with it!\u201D</p><hr><p>In one smooth motion, she stands up and quickly evades my hand.</p><p>Nimbly walking through the corridor, she puts on the slippers and goes out to the yard.</p><p>\u201CHeeey!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber, it&#39;s dangerous to walk with your head up\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou finally noticed, Shirou.</p><p>Compared to my <ruby>faraway castle<rt>Camelot</rt></ruby>,the Emiya residence is missing something\u2015\u2015\u2015that is, a vegetable garden and livestock hut! Fortunately, there&#39;s plenty of space here in the yard...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh... Could it be that Kiritsugu have anticipated this, and thus secured an appropriate site!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNope.

Eh?\u201D</p><hr><p>I get dragged back inside the student council room, just like that.</p><hr><p>\u201C...So it was all a misunderstanding, huh?</p><p>Should have just told me from the start.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou left before I could correct it. Now go and reflect on your actions.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Um. So is that my fault now?\u201D</p><hr><p>She seems to be laughing, yet she isn&#39;t smiling at all.</p><p>Despite the fact that they&#39;re just friends, she reminds me of Tohsaka.</p><p>...Lately, I&#39;ve started noticing Sakura laughing the exact same way.</p><p>But, she&#39;s probably just taking after her sister.</p><hr><p>\u201C...No way, am I getting surrounded by Tohsakas?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat kind of ominous nonsense are you muttering with that serious face of yours?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, it&#39;s not the future I would wish for.</p><p>...So. What were you two up to, anyways?\u201D</p><hr><p>...And then...</p><p>Looking closer, I see a large amount of documents spread out onto the desk.</p><p>Was this some kind of business meeting...?</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, a cultural festival meeting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I see.</p><p>But why is Mitsuzuri with you? Was there some kind of issue with the archery club?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m the festival committee chief.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh, since when?\u201D</p><hr><p>All I get is a collective sigh.</p><hr><p>\u201CSpeaking of which, it may not seem that way, but Emiya is also one of its members.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...My bad. Totally forgot about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, none of the activities have started yet, so it doesn&#39;t matter.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm.\u201D</p><hr><p>Cultural festival, is it...? Outsiders are welcome to participate, too, so both Saber and Rider should get a chance to have some fun...</p><p>Illya hasn&#39;t been to one, either. There could be trouble if I bring her along\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CAnyhow, that&#39;s how it is at the moment.</p><p>Since we had some preparations to sort out, I couldn&#39;t accompany you while you were out fixing equipment. I&#39;m sorry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s alright, everyone has their own job to do.</p><p>And now, as for that heater I came to look at\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>As I&#39;m inspecting the heater, Mitsuzuri keeps staring at me.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, nothing. Just that you&#39;ve been zoning out even more than usual lately. I sure hope you won&#39;t forget it once preparations start, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.\u201D</p><hr><p>The stuff about the festival and the committee that we just talked about. Can&#39;t argue with that.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm, tell you what. Mitsuzuri&#39;s concern is very real, indeed. Emiya, come with me when you&#39;re done. We will discuss the cultural festival matters in detail.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that&#39;d be good. Please make sure he doesn&#39;t forget it again.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight. Leave it to me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, are you telling me\u2015\u2015\u2015to go home with Issei tonight?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, we are. You don&#39;t have work today, do you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNope. Wouldn&#39;t have come to help if I did.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; Mitsuzuri nods in satisfaction.</p><p>Well, I bet it&#39;d be more of a lecture than a discussion. But I haven&#39;t walked home with Issei lately, either, so I don&#39;t mind...</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015But why are you so happy, Ryuudou?\u201D</p><hr><p>Yeah, I noticed it, too.</p><hr><p>\u201CAck. I am not.</p><p>I mean, not in that sense, I&#39;m just glad that I can do something in return for Emiya\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, yeah, I got it.</p><p>Well then, would you mind a bit more repair work? There&#39;s a long-neglected broken air conditioner at the gym storehouse. And Ryuudou and I will keep going with the athletics program.</p><p>The archery club still doesn&#39;t have a set one, though...\u201D</p><hr><p>And so I&#39;m shooed out of the student council room.</p><p>...Oh well.</p><p>Can&#39;t back out now. Until Issei&#39;s finished, equipment repair it is.</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-2-towards-the-cultural-festival" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-2-towards-the-cultural-festival" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 2 Towards the cultural festival</h3><hr><p>\u201CSorry to keep you waiting, Emiya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNah, I finished up just a moment ago, too. No worries.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Sorry. That Mitsuzuri just kept extending the agenda. Good grief, am I really expected to approve a cake shop for an archery club?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha. Did you have a quarrel over that?</p><p>What is the archery club doing, anyway?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Anything alumi... No, as far as the idea goes, it seems to be a family restaurant parody.</p><p>Focusing on cakes sounds fairly interesting, but unfortunately, our food and drink group is already filled up. I&#39;m afraid the archery club will have to resubmit their proposal before the 11th.\u201D</p><hr><p>...So that&#39;s how it is...</p><p>It&#39;s tough for both the archery club and the student council chairman.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood work today. Working on a day off to keep things running behind the scenes, that&#39;s our chairman, Issei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome now, it is always overtime work on the mountain. This is but a trifle in comparison.\u201D</p><p>Not just the temple, this is the exactly the way he manages whatever undertaking he&#39;s responsible for.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are your plans, Emiya? Are you going straight home?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><p>Come to think about it, it&#39;s been awhile since we went home together.</p><p>Back in the first year, it&#39;s always been either Shinji or Issei.</p><p>Shinji came along just for fun, and Issei went home on the same path as me.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, let&#39;s go to Shinto or something, for once.</p><p>Unless you really need to help with something at home, of course.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t you have a lot of mouths to feed yourself, Emiya? Is that alright?\u201D</p><p>Thus worrying about each other&#39;s matters, the question remains unsettled. Issei looks at me with his usual disappointed expression.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt can&#39;t be helped, this discussion is nothing but a waste of time. Let us go to Shinto.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRoger that... so what should we do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA movie or something... that would take far too much time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm, it&#39;s either &quot;NECOARC&quot; or &quot;Tiger Dojo: The Movie.&quot; Have you heard anything about those, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBoth of them nonsensical, from what I&#39;ve heard.\u201D</p><p>\u201CComedy, I see.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey say it&#39;s more of a tragedy, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>What&#39;s up with that, anyway.</p><p>A game center is a no-go for either for us, and, well... something like a pool is definitely out of the question.</p><p>While I&#39;m thinking, Issei comes up with an idea.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, you know, after a long while of ascetic temple life, I want to have a small bite of something sweet. How about we go to Verde?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, the main branch. Let&#39;s do it.\u201D</p><p>And thus our destination has been decided.</p><p>In the past, we used to just wander around aimlessly, and that&#39;s fine. But living in a temple, constantly deprived of sweets and meat, gotta be tough.</p><hr><p>\u201CWeren&#39;t you going to buy a study or exam book?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ah, I did have something like that in mind.\u201D</p><p>We chat while looking at the bookstore display.</p><p>An honor student like Issei has got to know a lot about this stuff.</p><hr><p>\u201CSpeaking of which, any recommendations?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have a few, in a way... Although I thought I gave you an overview of the study material already.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s right, it&#39;s always either Fuji-Nee or Issei who keeps bugging me. Tohsaka sort of pays attention to my studies, but she mostly just keeps drilling me on the magic front.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood grief, the rest of your classmates are busy with prep school and mock exams. Your exceptionally carefree attitude in this regard worries me greatly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf at least you could... Oh, wait. You will be going into training, won&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.</p><p>Like entirely devoting himself to ascetic practice at the Ryuudou temple after graduation. It&#39;s no wonder he remained at the chairman&#39;s post for the whole three years.</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, secluding myself from the joys of the mortal world, resisting the temptations, concealing my body in black, the intention is to bind myself to Somaya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s with that? Somaya? The temple&#39;s large, too...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? First and foremost, I will be praying for the fulfillment of Emiya&#39;s aspirations. One ought to establish a solid foundation first, I believe.\u201D</p><p>Issei cackles.</p><p>My future is still unclear, but I feel safe knowing my friend is praying for my success.</p><hr><p>\u201CI... hm, I guess I won&#39;t be buying any. What about you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSadly, neither am I. Then let us go on downstairs.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah... They had obanyaki and soft icecream and the like.\u201D</p><p>In the corner of the underground food court, there&#39;s some space to have a light meal.</p><p>Issei sure seems to have taken a liking to it... I guess he likes the hidden-away from the public eye feel of it?</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, what&#39;s your preference for obanyaki?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRed bean, <ruby>whole.<rt>tsubu-an</rt></ruby>\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm, not a perfect score, but a pass you have managed. Had you stated &quot;cheese and custard,&quot; I&#39;d have no choice but to call for divine punishment and reeducation there and then.\u201D</p><hr><p>Well, sounds like he has plenty of preferences even for sweets.</p><p>Offering a crepe from La Fleur sounds like a sure way to get Issei mad.</p><p>Tohsaka would probably like something astringent like jam obanyaki.</p><hr><p>\u201CVery well, for the occasion, I shall treat you to strained bean paste one.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, much obliged.\u201D</p><p>Should Issei really go into seclusion, I doubt he&#39;ll be getting another chance for a sweet wafer cake...</p><hr><p>We ended up packing the obanyaki into a bag and eating on the way back.</p><p>Even buying some extra as presents did not hurt the wallet much. Truly wonderful sweets for the masses.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, Emiya, there are a few things I&#39;ll need you to do next week, as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLike taiyaki and stuff?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm, while that would not be bad, this time, the cultural festival takes priority. I also ought to explain the fine details of the executive committee&#39;s role to you.</p><p>...Well, we can leave that for tomorrow. In view of the obanyaki, it shall be deferred for today.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Crap, I forgot about it again.</p><p>It&#39;s because Mitsuzuri got mad at me that we&#39;re going home like this in the first place.</p><p>\u201C......Forgetful, you sure are......\u201D</p><p>Especially with cultural festival-related matters.</p><p>How should I put it...</p><p>It&#39;s as if I avoid thinking about it on purpose.</p><hr><p>\u201C...But now that I&#39;ve remembered...</p><p>Starting tomorrow, I&#39;ll prepare myself and be as helpful as I can.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight, please do. Once the festival starts, there&#39;s a mountain-load of matters that we&#39;ll need your help with, Emiya.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, Issei puts three more obanyaki into my bag.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease think of this as a prepayment for tomorrow&#39;s effort.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not like I work just for the obanyaki, you know.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, refusing an offer of alms will not do, either. I am always in your debt for all the trouble.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; he nods in consent.</p><p>Going through the trouble to help Issei has become pretty much natural for me. It&#39;s already a habit...</p><p>Well, it is indeed rather impolite of me to just refuse it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. Alright, I will take it as a donation, then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha, Emiya the Great Deity of Miracles... that&#39;s right, speaking of donations, deities and avatars, are you aware of those matters?\u201D</p><p>Issei diverts the conversation. I guess he wants to show another piece of his knowledge?</p><p>Of course, I know nothing of the sort, so I just nod\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CLong ago, a dragon god lived in this river, and various rituals to appease him would take place.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Never heard about it before... So is the autumn festival now somehow related to that god?\u201D</p><p>I knew that an autumn festival and a Bird Day take place at the Ryuudou temple, but I never heard about their origins. Growing up in the temple, Issei seems to be well-versed in this subject.</p><p>Expecting more explanation, I nod once again.</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, there is no relation to the modern festivals. A monk from the Ryuudou temple, using his powers of Buddha, would spend 3 days and 3 nights in prayer to placate the raging dragon god. As the high priest passed away, the people of Miyama would once again yearn for a virtuous monk that could calm the unruly god...\u201D</p><p>...Oh, I have a feeling I&#39;ve already heard the story about people with such powers disappearing from the temple.</p><p>Another one of the complicated ancient legends passed down through generations. I don&#39;t understand the old folklore very well, either.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong? Was that a boring story?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, it was quite interesting. But... is there really a dragon god in this river?\u201D</p><p>Gazing at the river, I feel no presence there.</p><p>And besides, I suspect the modern river pollution has taken its toll on the living conditions of the great dragon god as well.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, we are almost there... Hmmm, as I thought, strained bean paste is quite agreeable...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you going to give the rest to Reikan-san and Kuzuki-sensei?\u201D</p><p>I peek at the obanyaki still in Issei&#39;s bag.</p><p>Now, I have some, too, but once you divide by the number of people I have to split them amongst... Compared to that, Issei&#39;s share...</p><hr><p>\u201CBlast. I am sure to get confined by father if he finds out about this purchase. It can&#39;t be helped, I shall request your assistance.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, are you planning to eat it all here...? Alright, oh, how I wish for some tea...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm, the thought of manju and tea on the mountain is indeed frightening.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I&#39;m telling you, I&#39;ll come by to resupply you later, Issei.\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-rider-investigates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-rider-investigates" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 3 Rider investigates</h3><hr><p>Turning my back towards the temple, I head for the forest in the back.</p><p>The back road leading to the temple is one of my favorite walking routes.</p><p>Avoiding the path that goes through the vast cemetery, I stroll around the periphery.</p><p>...Suddenly,</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Is that really you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>A familiar voice stops me.</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, Rider? Why are you here?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Something was bothering me, and I came to investigate.\u201D</p><p>Rider comes out of the bushes.</p><p>...Seeing the old black clothes, my body stiffens before I realize it.</p><p>Old experience, I guess. Made me a bit nervous by reflex.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Shirou. Why are you in this place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Oh, just taking a walk... You know Issei, at the Ryuudou Temple? We use it all the time.</p><p>But nevermind that, what was it that&#39;s bothering you...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Rider does not answer.</p><p>...Did a thought cross her mind? Her pointed gaze from beyond the mask is still aimed at me.</p><p>Not quite murderous, but the coldness in her eyes is almost hostile.</p><p>...It might as well be a snake staring at me. Though I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not using her Mystic Eyes, I&#39;m already starting to feel paralyzed.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................No, I must have been wrong. Since you&#39;ve walked around here a lot, traces of your presence are probably lingering around.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRider...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m sorry, Shirou.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I would be grateful if you could forget what I have just said.\u201D</p><hr><p>The tension starts to fade.</p><p>To amend her hostility from a moment ago, Rider smiles gently.</p><p>\u201C...If you say so, I won&#39;t ask.</p><p>Should I perhaps not ask why you were here, either?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, that one is not a problem.</p><p>...The reason for my visit is that I&#39;ve felt a disturbance in the ley line. Being Caster&#39;s domain, a variety of sorcery traces are here, but this new twist is not one of her doing.</p><p>I suspect influence of another Master or Servant at first, but that appears to not be the case, either.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnother Servant... You didn&#39;t just have a fight with Assassin at the gate, did you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I have passed through the gate with nothing but a normal greeting.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean a\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;Hello&quot; kind of greeting?\u201D</p><p>Rider nods.</p><p>...Some gatekeeper he is.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s self-confidence is only matched by his ability to detect malicious intent.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Pardon me. It seems this outfit is putting an undue pressure on you, Shirou. It does let me concentrate, but since it bothers you, should I perhaps revert back to my ordinary clothing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, no, it&#39;s fine... That aside, when you mentioned a disturbance in the ley line... What kind of disturbance?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Can you not feel it?\u201D</p><hr><p>Now that she asks, I concentrate on my senses.</p><p>...While I cannot perceive the flow of magical energy, I can tell other abnormalities or torn seams in the world around me.</p><p>Using not technique, but intuition, not theory, but instinct, I probe around the entire structure of the mountain.</p><hr><p>\u201C...First of all, I feel a deep aura around the mountain. Being Fuyuki&#39;s life line, it&#39;s natural... Overlapping each other, all sorts of arteries run on top of that. It&#39;s cleverly disguised, but I guess that&#39;s Caster&#39;s barrier.</p><p>Other than that... Can&#39;t really feel anything unusual.\u201D</p><hr><p>I raise my head.</p><p>...Covering her face as if in deep thought, Rider seems to be irritated.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Is that so?</p><p>If you can&#39;t feel it, then something is wrong not with this mountain, but with my own self.</p><p>...Assuming the odd one is me, it is probably coming here, unlike what I thought.\u201D</p><hr><p>Coming here.</p><p>...Those words can be nothing but an ill omen.</p><p>But clenching her teeth, Rider shakes her head in denial and turns to me again.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo not worry about it, it has nothing to do with you, Shirou.</p><p>I am a divine creature with a strong connection to the Earth to start with, it is no wonder I&#39;d be sensitive to the disturbances in the ley line. It was a bit much this time, and the uncomfortable feeling made me overreact, that&#39;s all.</p><p>...Yes, thinking it over, it is just a feeling of discomfort that I could not really place. Like a mosquito descending on your bare shoulder, minor and vaguely uncomfortable... You can blow it off in one breath, but it still annoys you for some time after.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Rider is unusually talkative.</p><p>As if she&#39;s persuading herself, trying to brush off whatever&#39;s worrying her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...But no matter how trivial it is, it still bothers you? Isn&#39;t that... how this Heaven&#39;s Feel got restarted?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRest assured, this issue is mine alone. Neither you nor Sakura would be harmed by it.</p><p>...No. If it does come to that, as before, I have to, this time for sure\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>&quot;Protect the two of you.&quot;</p><p>Murmurs Rider, failures of the past still in mind.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Rider? What the heck is wrong with you, you&#39;re acting strange.</p><p>Whatever&#39;s bothering you... Well, to each his own, I won&#39;t ask you about it. But if there&#39;s anything at all you want to talk about, I&#39;d like to do my best to help.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, no, that was, just thinking out loud, it&#39;s not like it has anything to do with you or Sakura, I&#39;m just projecting myself on you two.\u201D</p><hr><p>In a haste, she starts mingling words.</p><p>...I feel bad for her, but Rider is kind of charming this way.</p><p>She always feels so much older than me, yet somehow, she looks like a girl around my age right now.</p><hr><p>\u201CA-Anyway, please leave Sakura&#39;s safety to me, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. Thanks, Rider.\u201D</p><p>Probably sensing my absolute faith, she finally managed a smile.</p><p>If anything were to happen, Sakura should be safe with Rider around.</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you.</p><p>...Also, while I should not be saying this, Sakura is not the only person I guard. Even you, Shirou, are under my protection.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Why is that?\u201D</p><p>Even though Rider is Sakura&#39;s Servant?</p><hr><p>\u201C..............................</p><p>Well, it does not matter. Protecting Sakura includes protecting you, that is how it is.\u201D</p><p>Rider turns away pouting.</p><p>Funny... Did I say something wrong...?</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then. With that, I am done here. What about you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll walk around the temple for a little longer. Ah, will you go for a prayer?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Would the spirits here be offended if I prayed for Sakura&#39;s safety?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy would they? Might as well teach you the proper etiquette for a temple visit, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat would be helpful\u2015\u2015\u2015Then, I am gratefully looking forward to the formal tour of the temple.\u201D</p><hr>', 656);
