You need a new bodyguard now that Berserker is defeated.&quot;</p><hr><p>The voice echoes.</p><p>The girl clad in black curse\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Matou Sakura doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>Ignoring the one who has absolute control over her, she looks off blankly into space.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What are you doing, Sakura? Are you disobeying me?&quot;</p><p>The irritated voice also contains danger.</p><p>The old man is irritated.</p><p>He&#39;s angry that she lost Illyasviel and Berserker.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura. I will ask you one more time. Are you going to defy me?&quot;</p><p>Cold scorn.</p><p>The girl has never disobeyed this voice.</p><p>It&#39;s not fear, but submission to his absolute controlling power.</p><p>The girl does fear the old man.</p><p>Moreover, the girl cannot disobey him.</p><p>Because her heart is...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold, magus. Perhaps there is no intelligence left in her. She has such a great power within her; it&#39;s not something a weak girl can withstand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm?&quot;</p><p>His irritation disappears.</p><p>...A gentle silence.</p><p>The sounds of worms crawling fills the hell lit by black flame.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. It seems that way. I thought she would last a while, but the end came rather quickly.&quot;</p><p>The old magus sounds disappointed, yet happy.</p><p>The girl doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>Her mind has been swallowed by darkness.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you will take the girl as planned?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not put it like that. It is not as planned. It cannot be helped. Matou Sakura&#39;s mind disappeared.

My body is disappearing. I will disappear unless I am quickly supplied with magical energy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very well. I shall start.</p><p>...My, this is disappointing, Sakura. You raised it to that degree. I wanted to give you the glory of obtaining the Holy Grail, but it cannot be helped.</p><p>If you must curse someone, curse yourself. The ritual did not succeed in time because you let Illyasviel go.&quot;</p><hr><p>A gritting sound.</p><p>A worm squirms to swap her head.</p><p>It isn&#39;t visible.</p><p>There are no worms on the girl&#39;s body.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s not on the outside...</p><p>It&#39;s a distorted thought that creeps up from her heart.</p><hr><p>Worm-user, Matou Zouken.</p><p>His main body, the host of his rotting soul, is a false nerve hidden within Matou Sakura&#39;s heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah, her body hasn&#39;t changed yet, but I am not one to complain. I shall now take your flesh as my own.</p><p>Farewell, Sakura. You&#39;ve endured more than I expected from an experiment. You have done well to please me...!&quot;</p><p>A sound of writhing blood vessels.</p><p>Matou Zouken&#39;s spirit orders his main body to eat the girl&#39;s brain.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But.</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no need for that, Grandfather. I&#39;m fine.&quot;</p><hr><p>The girl puts her hand on her chest and wakes up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I thought it had consumed you, but you still persist? ......Hm. Sakura. The circumstances have changed, and I can no longer maintain Assassin.</p><p>It will burden you, but form a contract with him.&quot;</p><p>The old magus gives her an order.</p><p>But the girl shakes her head in refusal.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told you already, Grandfather. There&#39;s no need for that.&quot;</p><p>An ice-cold voice.</p><p>At that instant.</p><p>A vast darkness swallows the white skull on the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gi\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>The surprise comes too late.</p><p>The assassin&#39;s body is compressed in an instant, his mask the only part not crushed.</p><p>&quot;Gah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!?&quot;</p><p>The mask falls.</p><p>Under the white skull...</p><p>The face that should be there is a skull, just like the mask.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Fufu. Oh, I wondered what sort of face you had, but you had none to begin with.</p><p>You didn&#39;t hide your face, but wore the mask to make people think a face lay beneath it. Such a disappointment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gi\u2015\u2015\u2015Girl, you\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;You lost your face and name, but you still wanted eternity? ...But how unfortunate. If you seek eternity, you should&#39;ve sought to live forever like my grandfather.</p><p>The Holy Grail can&#39;t go back into the past and regain your name.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Disappear, old man of the mountain. You&#39;re nothing but an assassin. You can&#39;t become the one and only Hassan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gi, giaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Even his death cry is swallowed by the shadow.</p><p>The white skulled assassin is swallowed by the girl&#39;s shadow.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015are you insane!? What are you doing, fool...!?&quot;</p><p>His panic is akin to fury.</p><p>Is he surprised, or\u2015\u2015\u2015is he frightened?</p><hr><p>In response to the old man&#39;s scream, the girl smiles.</p><p>&quot;He attacked Senpai twice.</p><p>That&#39;s why I killed him. I&#39;m the only one allowed to hurt him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;And Grandfather. You don&#39;t need to be protected by him anymore. So we have to give him leave.&quot;</p><hr><p>And then...</p><p>She sticks her finger into her heart and pulls out a worm that was deep within her nerves.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!!!&quot;</p><p>How do you describe the fear, the terror?</p><p>She gouged her heart and tore her nerves, but still smiles.</p><hr><p>&quot;W\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What, what are you doing, Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The worm wriggles.</p><p>The girl stares with empty eyes at her grandfather, what used to be her grandfather, what seems to have been her grandfather.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. It was easier than I expected. I thought you would be bigger.&quot;</p><p>No. Actually, Matou Zouken&#39;s true body wasn&#39;t this small.</p><p>The old magus switched his main body when he planted himself in her heart.</p><p>To inhabit her heart, he had to be smaller than a heart.</p><p>In retrospect, his strange preference was his downfall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura, don&#39;t tell me...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should thank the priest. I would&#39;ve been swallowed if he hadn&#39;t eliminated you.&quot;</p><hr><p>She sees through his plan.</p><p>No, this outcome was inevitable.</p><p>The old magus didn&#39;t even try to hide his intentions, and the girl didn&#39;t disobey him.</p><p>So there was no problem.</p><p>She was just a piece of flesh that the old magus would eventually take over.</p><p>Until she betrayed him.</p><hr><p>&quot;H\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...!!</p><p>No, no, Sakura...! Possessing you is my last resort. I shall entrust you with the gate as long as you are still conscious. All I want is for the Matou bloodline to prosper.</p><p>All I want is for you to win and obtain everything...!&quot;</p><hr><p>The worm squirms around.</p><p>The girl smiles at the trash in her fingers.</p><hr><p>&quot;All the better, then. I don&#39;t need your help anymore. I can open the gate by myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>The impossible occurs.</p><p>The old magus only made one mistake.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!

It seems something is being created in the pond behind the compound.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, we don&#39;t have any business there. The gate above must be the ostensible gate for the Masters that want the Holy Grail. ...If we want the Great Holy Grail, we have to go down instead of up.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka walks away from the stairs into the forest.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Are you all right, Rider? There&#39;s a boundary field around the Ryuudou Temple, right? I heard Servants can only go in from the front gate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I feel some strain, but this is tolerable.</p><p>This area contains the most suitable ley line in the land. Once we get inside, I can recover by drawing magical energy from the air.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. It must be tough, but please bear with us for a bit.&quot;</p><hr><p>We push our way through the tree branches.</p><p>There&#39;s not even an animal trail over the mountain, so we even have to climb down rock walls.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015it should be around here, according to Illya... Do you see anything like an entrance, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean, &#39;like&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Like a crack in a rock that we can slip through, or a suspicious-looking shrine. It&#39;s an entrance, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;d just be a pit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t be ridiculous. The stars are out, but I can&#39;t see anything in a forest at night\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>...Oh, I can.</p><p>We must be behind the temple, because I see many dead trees.</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of human influence. There&#39;s nothing here but dead trees and a small stream.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Small stream?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>That means the water&#39;s coming from somewhere.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Rider. There&#39;s a bunch of rocks above the stream, right?</p><p>It&#39;s too dark for me to see, but is that a cave?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Please do not turn around, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>I hear a small metallic sound.</p><p>Rider must&#39;ve taken off her restraint.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Yes. It&#39;s a natural cave, but you should just be able to fit through. It looks like the path ends about a meter in, but I sense a magical camouflage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see, thanks. \u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka. I guess there is something like it.&quot;</p><hr><p>We pick our way down to the stream.</p><p>...It&#39;s more like a spring flowing out from the rocks.</p><hr><p>The stones are piled atop one another where it starts. There&#39;s a crack big enough for one person to fit through.</p><p>It&#39;s like a snow hut made from rocks.</p><p>You can see that a huge boulder is blocking the entrance, so nobody would even try to go in it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015This is it. You can pass through the rock.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka walks into the darkness without turning around.</p><p>&quot;Please go ahead. I shall protect your back.&quot;</p><p>I nod and enter the darkness.</p><hr><p>The sound of scraping on a hard surface.</p><p>I progress down the wet rock using my hands.</p><p>The ground slopes steeply downward.</p><hr><p>...The weight of the darkness is stifling.</p><p>Unless I keep my back to the ground as I move, I might fall into the endless dark.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I lay flat on my back as I slowly descend.</p><p>......It&#39;s dark, and I can&#39;t tell how far down this path goes.</p><p>My breathing echoes in my ears.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. I&#39;m going to ask you now.&quot;</p><p>...Then.</p><p>Tohsaka, the one leading the way, suddenly speaks up.</p><hr><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The gem sword. Why did you make it for me?&quot;</p><p>She sounds blunt, as if she&#39;s just asking to kill time while we&#39;re descending.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ve told you I&#39;m planning to kill Sakura.</p><p>Can you really give me a weapon, knowing that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I nod in agreement.</p><p>Well, Tohsaka certainly has a point.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m not okay with that. But I can&#39;t save Sakura without you. It&#39;s better to have two people instead of one.</p><p>And projecting the sword was a promise.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t keep one of my promises with you, so I wanted to keep the other.&quot;</p><hr><p>It happened a long time ago.</p><p>I asked for Tohsaka&#39;s help after I lost Saber.</p><p>Tohsaka responded to my call for help, and I made a promise with her.</p><hr><p>To let her win.</p><p>I promised to make her the victor.</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t keep that promise anymore.</p><p>So I have to keep the other promise with her.</p><p>For the girl I used to admire...</p><p>For Tohsaka Rin, who believed in someone who had nothing at the time.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You&#39;re pretty faithful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but not as much as you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Silence returns to the darkness.</p><p>The conversation ends.</p><p>We continue our descent without looking at each other.</p><hr><p>A long path that seems to lead to hell.</p><p>The path spirals downward, and just as I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re over a hundred meters underground...</p><p>The dark cave changes completely, welcoming us.</p><hr><p>The path that could only accomodate one person widens up and leads on.</p><p>There&#39;s no need for light.</p><p>The cave is lit by a dim green glow, probably from some kind of luminous moss.</p><hr><p>The path is saturated with life force.</p><p>It feels too lively.</p><p>An air of birth, filled with vigor and the joy of life.</p><p>An immense amount of odo, and magical energy so strong that it&#39;s almost visible.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It makes me want to vomit.</p><p>The warmth of life should be dazzling, but instead it&#39;s something rotten, making me want to look away.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I have no words to say to her.</p><p>This is a land of death.</p><p>Talking to each other to soften the tension would only cost us our lives.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s go.

You don&#39;t have enough strength to even kill one of my shadows, so why...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We&#39;re just having a pure contest of power.</p><p>I can&#39;t dispel a curse. I&#39;m merely using my magical energy to eliminate your magical energy that&#39;s creating the shadow. Can&#39;t you tell?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying that&#39;s impossible...!</p><p>You don&#39;t have such magical energy. No, the light you&#39;re firing is like...&quot;</p><hr><p>The greatest Servant.</p><p>The light of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm, Excalibur.</p><hr><p>&quot;.....Is it that sword? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible, but that&#39;s copying the power of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Is it a limited weapon, activated with your small magical energy, that&#39;s specialized in killing shadows?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You can&#39;t tell? What have they been teaching you, Sakura?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015d-don&#39;t mock me...! That&#39;s the only sound explanation...&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing to explain. This isn&#39;t a copy of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm nor a shadow-killing demonic sword. Sakura. This is Zelretch, a gem sword passed down the Tohsaka family.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh...? Zelretch...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe this. You don&#39;t even know the name Zelretch?</p><p>...I don&#39;t even want to explain, but in short, it&#39;s your natural enemy.</p><p>You use souls as a perpetual motion machine to create magical energy. You&#39;re just a poor imitation of the Third True magecraft.</p><p>And I use an imitation of my great master, who travels across infinite parallel worlds. So it means I&#39;m a copycat of the Second True magecraft...!&quot;</p><hr><p>A flash from the blade.</p><p>Light traces the dagger&#39;s swing, obliterating Matou Sakura&#39;s guardian shadows.</p><p>Not only that. Light and heat, like those of a miniature Excalibur, send rumbles through the cavern.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a pure contest of magical energy.</p><p>What kind of magecraft\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015no, True magecraft was used?</p><p>Tohsaka Rin has a stock of magical energy equal to that of Matou Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t even need to get close to you. This is actually a projectile weapon, and you&#39;re hiding yourself in the shadows.</p><p>There&#39;s no problem with exchanging blows until one of us runs out of power. ...Well, I guess the ceiling will give out before we do.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No way... Exchange blows? Don&#39;t joke around.</p><p>You don&#39;t have any magical energy left. No matter what that sword is, you can&#39;t attack anymore\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then let&#39;s try. Come on, Sakura. You won&#39;t reach me, no matter what you do.</p><p>It&#39;s a drastic treatment, but consider it a fee for your lesson. I&#39;ll make sure you regret doing whatever you wanted just because you got a bit stronger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......!</p><p>Not yet!

Someone at your level can&#39;t do anything but get swallowed...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s where you got it wrong. Even if you have a large supply, it&#39;s the caster that uses it.</p><p>Do you get it? No matter how much water you have, the amount that comes out depends on the size of the faucet.</p><p>The Magic Circuit called Matou Sakura can only instantaneously release about a thousand.</p><p>Then we both have the same release rate, no matter how much you may have in your stock...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Kya......!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So! I don&#39;t need to prepare a supply as large as yours! I merely need a thousand magical energy each time...!</p><p>Such a large supply of magical energy is just a waste\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>The line of light is swung.</p><p>If a thousand light is smashed against a thousand shadow, the powers will certainly cancel each other.</p><p>But Tohsaka Rin&#39;s magical energy doesn&#39;t even reach a hundred.</p><p>The contradiction.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t need to be said that her sword creates the competition that should not be possible.</p><hr><p>A sword of light that releases a thousand units of magical energy with each attack and replenishes even more.</p><p>It&#39;s not using Tohsaka Rin&#39;s magical energy.</p><p>She&#39;s merely collecting the magical energy saturating this cavern and releasing it through the gem sword.</p><hr><p>Odo is the energy within a magus, while magical energy is energy within the air.</p><p>It&#39;s self-evident which is stronger.</p><p>As Rin is inferior to Sakura, the only thing she can rely on is the magical energy in the air.</p><hr><p>True.

That would mean she could oppose her enemy one more time.</p><hr><p>And what happens if something can make that &quot;if&quot; into reality?</p><p>Parallel worlds.</p><p>What will happen if one can open a hole into a parallel world and pull out the unused magical energy from the cavern there?</p><hr><p>&quot;......! That distortion&#39;s the same as the Holy Grail\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Nee-san, it can&#39;t be...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup, you&#39;re not the only one pulling magical energy from elsewhere.

Are you saying murder is an absolute evil?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s......&quot;</p><p>...I can&#39;t answer such a question.</p><p>Good and evil mean nothing to me now.</p><p>The justice Emiya Shirou believed in disappeared the instant I decided to save Sakura.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Fair enough. There is no answer from the start. That&#39;s what humans are like. There is no clear answer, and they accept a changing truth. We have no absolute truth from the very beginning.</p><p>Humans have both good and evil, and it&#39;s up to you to decide which is which. The start is at zero, and there is no crime in being born. I thought I&#39;d already told you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. You said there&#39;s no crime in the baby even if it&#39;s evil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Correct. Humans become good or evil through learning.</p><p>A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior beings to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil.</p><p>It&#39;s different from angels, who only know of good since birth.</p><p>Humans have evil, but can live as good, so they are superior to angels, who only know of good.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015And at the same time.</p><p>There are rare moments of goodwill shown by evil men.</p><p>There are bad intentions shown on a whim by saints.</p><p>The contradiction. The coexistence of good and evil is the Holy Grail that makes people human.</p><p>Living is a crime by itself, and there are punishments because one is alive. Good exists with life, and evil exists with life.</p><p>Therefore\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015You cannot inquire about the crime of one who has not yet been born.</p><p>There is no existence that is born as evil, that is unwanted by everyone.</p><p>It has no reason to be punished until it is born.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s Kotomine&#39;s answer.</p><p>That man pardons &quot;all evils of this world&quot; for this reason alone.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So you&#39;re going to forgive him? He&#39;s someone that can only kill. If you know he&#39;ll kill many people once he comes out, he&#39;s a definite evil for us...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. His nature is evil. He was made that way, after all. He was born to be evil from the very beginning.</p><p>He&#39;s not like people. This is a pure deity that people made.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015even if his actions are evil, we have yet to know what he thinks of it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh...?&quot;</p><p>What Angra Manyu thinks about his own actions...?</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes.</p><p>If Angra Manyu considers them evil and agonizes over them, or considers them good and laughs about them. That is not something we can assume.</p><p>If that thing has emotions like those of humans and agonizes over its doings, it is evil.</p><p>But if it has no doubt about its existence, it is good. Everyone wished for him to be that way, after all. If it has no doubt about its function, it cannot be evil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.</p><p>Those with defects at birth.</p><p>Those who were not wanted, even before birth.</p><p>It should show us the worth of worthless life: the meaning of birth.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Would it be able to forgive itself after destroying and losing everything?</p><p>That&#39;s what I would like to know.</p><p>I want to know if it is a crime to live as you are, when you are different from others.</p><p>That is why I killed your father and let Matou Sakura live.
