Being one of the Dragon Kins, and as a monster that can freely move on both land and water, the Tarasque lurked in the Rh\xF4ne River, sinking ships and eating people; his hard shell entirely repelled all the blades and arrows of the warriors called upon to subjugate him, and he went to breathe out fire at them until they burned out.

The woman\u2019s interior is also that of a perfect Saint. Perhaps due to the existence of her younger sister, Martha fundamentally displays words and deeds in the manner of an elder sister frequently. A woman who holds an indomitable spirit, is tender on top of that, and would become reliable for others. If she can say, \u201CI am okay\u201D, her companions will truly believe that she is assuredly okay, and they will be moved to get back onto their feet no matter what kind of difficult situation they are in. Even when everybody receives an attack, and even with a monster raging around wildly, they will completely embrace that sanctity. A perfect sacred maiden.</p><p>However\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014especially around those she grew close to, she may come to show a \u201CMartha who is not a Saint.\u201D Her words and facial expressions suddenly turn sharp, and she becomes dynamic and determined right after. This face that is shown to her close companions, from the form of herself as \u201Cthe town girl who lived together with her younger sister and brother before He had passed by\u201D and from before she ended up as a Saint, is also a form of herself that comes from her trust \u2013 as someone who shows a kind of dependence on others. Even though it is a bit distant from the \u201Cimage of a perfect Saint\u201D, her charm that captivates everybody, her indomitable spirit and belief that guides and protects every single person, her love for people, and so on, are all fundamentally constant with her saintly essence. Nevertheless, the difference is whether her filter is ON or OFF.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Saint Martha has nothing to wish for on a Holy Grail that does not belong to the Messiah. Similarly like the times of before, Martha will live as a Saint even after she had materialized as a Servant. Therefore, she will be cooperative with the activities of her Master. So long as her Master continues to walk on the correct path.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CListen, we will surely save the world.

Even the circumstance of being born in that way is just one of the reasons. If that is the case, things like that are nothing to be afraid of. So that is why, with the hands of man, the likes of those reasons are not even unfathomable to us.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2026 Ha. What?

Guided by the words of the Messiah, who she warmly welcomed with her younger sister and brother, Martha became a person of faith. She did not abandon her faith even later on after the Messiah was executed, further avoiding death as she was exiled by the Roman viceroy and was placed in a boat with neither a paddle or sail to use, and drifted to southern France upon receiving the Grace of God. At the town Nerluc, which was located ahead of her as she went north along the Rh\xF4ne River, she confronted the monster Tarasque, who was also called the child of Leviathan and was a tyrannical dragon tormenting the people. Martha was not afraid of this monster and suppressed him with discipline carried out through her sacred powers. Afterwards, Nerluc changed its name to \u201CTarascon\u201D, and it is currently prospering as a city that enshrines Saint Martha and Tarasque.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A sacred maiden who made a terribly grotesque monster fall madly in love. A perfect person, endowed with beauty and overflowing with charm. As a Servant, Martha would be accompanied by the monster Tarasque when materializing as a Rider. Although there are various opinions on the details of how Tarasque was suppressed, from the scene back in Martha\u2019s lifetime, Tarasque wears an expression similar to one who cannot be managed, but within Fate/Grand Order, Tarasque always appears to be sad; one can presume that what this matter in question is, is domestic violence done to a degree.</p><h2 id="role-within-the-game-s-story-selling-points" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-within-the-game-s-story-selling-points" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role within the Game\u2019s Story, Selling Points</h2><p>A beautiful holy woman. Kind, chaste, gentle\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The radiant and perfect Saint. Although then, to her companions who she can particularly confide in, Martha displays different facial expressions as a Saint. During that, her gaze and facial expressions suddenly turn sharp, and the atmosphere around her becomes unyielding. This happens when she is also doing things such as sulking, getting angry, or unconsciously getting quite irritated at those being dangerous. But she will control no more than her bare-knuckle brawling. Given that, she received her cross staff from \u201CHim\u201D. Although she is a genuine Saint, this persona is a little extreme.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Martha can carry out distant attacks through her prayers (magic attacks). She can deliver damage to her target by praying on her lengthy cross staff that she carries, of which it can be seen like a spear. This is not with something that causes an impact/violently explodes because of a fireball or an energy wave respectively flying through the air, but an attack where after Martha\u2019s cross staff starts to shine, her target will automatically emit a magical light and \u201Cexplode\u201D or \u201Cburst\u201D. There is almost never a course for that, but that result can be generated.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Georgios</strong></p><p>A connection between them as fellow Saints. \u201CGeorge is also not half bad.\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne d\u2019Arc</strong></p><p>A connection between them as fellow Saintesses.
