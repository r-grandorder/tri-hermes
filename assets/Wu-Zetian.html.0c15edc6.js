The First Empress in the history of China.</p><p>In the beginning, Wu Zetian was one of the concubines and consorts of Emperor Taizong, the Tang Dynasty\u2019s Second Emperor. Although she was given the status of a \u201Ctalented person\u201D and rose up the ranks within the inner palace, she could not show her presence in the imperial court to a great extent during Emperor Taizong\u2019s reign. Moreover, in those days, a plausible rumour began to spread throughout Emperor Taizong\u2019s surroundings about an ominous prophecy where \u201Cafter Tang\u2019s third generation, Queen Wu will prosper\u201D, so it appears that she \u2013 who possesses that name \u2013 has been shunned by the others all the more. In other words, she could not curry favour with the most important people to seize power.</p><p>If so, what can Wu Zetian do?</p><p>It was then that she had her eyes on Emperor Taizong\u2019s crown prince, Li Zhi (who later became Emperor Gaozong, the Tang Dynasty\u2019s Third Emperor).</p><p>Naturally, the likes of a woman and the Emperor\u2019s son making love to each other within the Emperor\u2019s inner palace was not a topic that is ethically allowed. But Wu Zetian made use of every art of coaxing she has, stabbed at the crack within the system and the morality adhered within it, and furthermore used the antagonism between Emperor Gaozong\u2019s wife, Empress Wang, and Emperor Gaozong\u2019s favourite mistress, Consort Xiao, all to come back to the imperial court. Overcoming the hardships, Wu Zetian obtained the position that officially received the Emperor\u2019s favour, and thereafter, she had all of her children with Emperor Gaozong, but\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014among them, the flame of one life \u2013 the life of a tiny baby \u2013 had gone out.</p><p>\u2026 After Wu Zetian entered the imperial court, the elimination of her obstacles was necessary. The woman decided that she herself should be the one to reach out her hand to the greatest power \u2013 the seat of Emperor, hold it close to her chest, and eventually steal that position for herself. Consequently, it is said that Wu Zetian questioned Empress Wang as the culprit who killed her child, causing Empress Wang and Consort Xiao together to be overthrown, and she sat on the throne as Emperor Gaozong\u2019s Empress. When she did so, Wu Zetian executed Consort Xiao by cutting off her hands and feet, and on top of that, tossed her into a jar filled with wine. From this course of events, there are also some people who thought that perhaps, Wu Zetian killed her own child to pin the blame on the Empress, but\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the truth\u2026 is not clear.</p><p>Moreover, it is said that because she was told at this time of a curse addressed to her by the dying Consort Xiao, who spoke \u201CYou will become a mouse. I will be reincarnated as a cat and bite you to death\u201D, Wu Zetian absolutely prohibited cats to be kept within the imperial court thereafter. There is also a theory where Wu Zetian moved the capital from Chang\u2019an to Luoyang due to becoming frightened of ghosts.</p><p>In any case, Wu Zetian seized the country\u2019s political power from behind the bamboo blinds and further killed (assassinated) her hindering relatives/political opponents one by one after that. After Emperor Gaozong\u2019s death, because she was finally on the imperial throne, she changed the country\u2019s name to \u201CZhou\u201D and gave herself the name \u201CShengshen Huangdi (Sacred and Divine Empress Regnant)\u201D. At the time of governing her country, she laid out a reign of terror that encouraged anonymous reports. It is said that the populace were afraid of the brutal tortures done by the government officials \u2013 whom were called the \u201CKu Li\u201D \u2013 from the bottom of their hearts\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Wu Zetian was not a person who became Empress according to her birth. She is a being who climbed up to the top position due to effort. She herself does not even feel the likes of surprise for that in the slightest.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Wu Zetian\u2026 became Empress by doing as much as she could.</p><p>It was a matter of course, because she absolutely resolved herself to become one.</p><p>It was a matter of course, because she continuously endeavoured for that sake.</p><p>The journey that was smeared with blood, starting from entering the inner palace, becoming an adult, and obtaining power\u2026 It was, so to speak, a throwaway match where everything has already been decided.</p><p>For the sake of becoming Empress, all that was absolutely needed was, simply, nothing more than having determination since the beginning.</p><p>When she was being oppressed during her childhood, Wu Zetian looked up at the heavens and swore\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>A pure determination, where she would obtain this country without fail.</p><p>A noble determination, where she would guide this country properly.</p><p>She considers \u201Cthat moment\u201D to be \u201Cthe golden age of her life\u201D.
