Grandson of King Fereydun, the hero who fought against Zahhak, an avatar of the evil dragon Azi Dahaka), he was the last archer, ending the war 60-year war between Persia and Turan.</p><p>A savior hero who brought peace and tranquility to both countries.</p><p>His story says that by shooting an arrow with all his strength, he ended all battles and performed a feat that exceeds human comprehension, but in exchange he burst and scattered his entire body, meeting his end.</p><p>In Persian mythology, at the end of a long war between two countries, the enemy army of Turan sieged King Manuchehr\u2019s army and this leads to the kings of both countries deciding to sign a peace treaty and establish their national borders.</p><p>That entailed making someone climb Mount Damavand and shoot an arrow to the East from there, and the place where this arrow fell would mark the location of the national border.</p><p>The only volunteer at the time was the Persian army\u2019s best archer, Arash.</p><p>During the first month of the summer, on a sunny morning of Tirgan (Persian for \u201Csummer solstice\u201D), Arash drew his bow more than ever before and shot an arrow.</p><p>It\u2019s said that at that moment his body went flying in all directions.</p><p>Most legends say the arrow kept flying the entire morning and landed at noon on the coast of the Oxus River in central Asia, 2500 km away from the shooting point.</p><p>That river remained as the two countries\u2019 border line until the 10th Century, when the Mongol armies pushed the Persian territory to the south.</p><p>The distance the arrow flew is different in various sources.</p><p>One version says the distance was 1000 farsakhs and other says the distance was a 40 days walk.</p><p>Most stories say the arrow flew from the daybreak until noon, but some say it flew from daybreak to sunset.</p><p>The name Arash in Ancient Persian has meanings associated with \u201Ccheerfulness\u201D and lack of \u201Ccommon sense\u201D.</p><p>He is also known as Arash Kamangir. Or \u201Cswift archer\u201D.</p><p>Translating it to English, Arash Kamangir would be \u201CArash the Archer\u201D. In West Asia, the word \u201Carcher\u201D refers to the peace-bringing Arash.</p><p>In Iran, he is celebrated in Tirgan Festivals on summer solstices.</p><p>Even now, the hero Arash is still loved by the West Asians.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A bow he built himself.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Ozymandias</strong></p><p>Both acknowledge each other as heroes of the same era.</p><p><strong>Hassan of Serenity</strong></p><p>Since her entire body is a poisonous Noble Phantasm, she is someone who \u201Ccannot be touched by anyone\u201D, but Arash is an exception to this rule.

At the time I still didn\u2019t how to draw characters for smartphone games, so I was trying a lot of different ideas and ended up thinking too much about his rarity when I designed him. Despite this, he got the Self-Destruct Noble Phantasm and was promoted to a Sougin no Fragments character. Thank you everyone, specially Sakurai-san and Nakahara-san. Although I\u2019m saying all this, I really liked the design for the armor and weapons. I like thinking about the balance between lame and cool and about making things visually memorable when I design characters. I designed the bow in a way you could feel like he cut down some holy tree to make it. By the way, the first idea for his Noble Phantasm was making the bow grow giant, but it got cut for several reasons (laughs).
