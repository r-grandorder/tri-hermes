I&#39;m pleased to see you in such good spirits.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually taking a walk myself right now. If it&#39;s not an imposition, would it be all right if I joined you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You need to ask? Of course!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, how&#39;ve you been lately?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, I kind of feel like I&#39;ve just completed a major project.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve been taking it nice and easy and enjoying my downtime until you need me for another mission.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been cooking with Boudica, having Vlad teach me needlework, that sort of thing...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> O-oh, and of course, I still train with my spear every day, so please don&#39;t worry about that!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I am a goddess, after all, so if you ever need my help, please know that I&#39;ll always do my best to provide it!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Speaking as both a goddess and the girl whose body I&#39;m inhabiting right now...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...I would hate for you to think I&#39;m just a lazybones Servant with nothing but time on my hands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I know I can always count on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The thought never even crossed my mind.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> O-oh, good. Hehe, I&#39;m relieved to hear that.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Still... I can tell I&#39;m a little out of it right now, though I&#39;m not sure why.)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Maybe I&#39;m burned out or something?)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Whatever it is, I need to figure out what&#39;s wrong and fix it soon...)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hm? Is that...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh goodness me, whatever am I going to do?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...No, I know what I have to do.<br> I have to go with that!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, but... That&#39;s important too.<br> Which one affects me more personally?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Then...perhaps I should go with that after all?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong></p><p>Huh? Oh goodness! I was in such a hurry I didn&#39;t realize I wasn&#39;t dressed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, if it isn&#39;t Master and the goddess from India. Good day.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Have you been there this whole time?<br> I&#39;m so sorry you had to see me like that.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Please, don&#39;t be. Can I ask you what&#39;s wrong?<br> You seem very out of sorts.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes... I suppose you could say that.<br> I&#39;m afraid the fault is entirely mine.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I know that a true warrior should be able to make these sorts of choices quickly and decisively...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...but my current predicament has me going in circles.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> How so?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Well... I was originally planning to go on a public decency patrol for the first time in a while.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been so busy as of late that I&#39;ve been neglecting my prefect duties, but I figured I could wait no longer.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> After all, once public decency starts to slip, things can get out of hand very quickly.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So it is imperative that we run a tight ship when the time calls for it.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> All the more so now that a number of new Servants have joined our ranks.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s very admirable of you.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But then, just as I was about to set out on my patrol...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...I received word that those accursed horned insects were going after my darling Kintoki!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So of course, I couldn&#39;t simply wait around for them to get their claws into him.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Protecting her children from evil is a mother&#39;s sworn duty, no matter how much they may call her overprotective!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Sounds like the same old Raikou.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I know how she feels all too well by now.)</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now I see. So you couldn&#39;t make up your mind over which course of action to pursue today.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Embarrassing though it is, I&#39;m afraid not...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Well in that case, why don&#39;t I take over patrolling for public decency for you?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Th-that... That would help me enormously, but... I hesitate to ask so much of you, Lady Umahi, goddess of India.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Are you quite sure you don&#39;t mind?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Of course not. I had some free time and was already out taking a walk, so it&#39;s no trouble at all.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> If I can put myself to good use, helping everyone else just by changing my course and checking in with them...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...well, that&#39;s just a no-brainer!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my! I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, since you are a goddess and all, but I can almost see your good nature bathing you in light like a halo!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Very well then, I will gladly accept your kind offer.<br> I don&#39;t know how I can ever repay you for this...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s fine, really. Think nothing of it.<br> As I said, I was already going on a walk anyway.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Anyway, you were in a hurry, right?<br> Shouldn&#39;t you get going?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Thanks to your kind assistance, Lady Umahi, I can set out with no misgivings clouding my mind!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> At last, I can bring every single one of those insects preying on my dear Kintoki the swift and terrible retribution they deserve!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just...try not to be too hard on them, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just...try to keep it in check, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I know, Master. Don&#39;t worry. I could never bear it if my beloved child were to come to hate me, after all.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So I will do my best to keep my execution natural,<br> and stick solely to what is strictly necessary.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Specifically, I&#39;ll go after them like a mother visiting her child&#39;s school to tell them Kintoki forgot his lunch!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> For what more natural reason could there be for a mother to appear suddenly out of nowhere!?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh, yes, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> This is a list of the Servants I planned to check to ensure they weren&#39;t disturbing public decency.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I truly am sorry to foist this task upon you like this, Lady Umahi...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Please, don&#39;t be. I&#39;m doing this because I want to!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Thank you again. I swear I will repay this debt to you someday. Now then, if you&#39;ll excuse me!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hehe, I see Raikou is just as passionate about her pursuits as ever.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Just watching her in action has a way of cheering me up.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s see who we&#39;ve got on this list...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Well, well. It seems like most of these Servants should be right up my alley...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got time to kill right now, so I think I&#39;ll go with you.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.<br> Having you along would be a huge help.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go be provisional prefects!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I know I have a reputation for being a gentle goddess, but they&#39;ll soon see that I can chastise with the best of them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It looks like we have a major case right from the get-go... One with a great deal of personal significance for me.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;ve had one eye on the situation for some time. And I knew I&#39;d have to face it directly one day.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve been avoiding it up until now.<br> I guess...I just needed some time to steel myself.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Inhale)... (Exhale)...All right, I&#39;m ready.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go inside...to the rec room!</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> ...Then you take turns moving your pieces in accordance with the predetermined rules. Simple, right?</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> Hmm, yes, this could be very good practice for commanding troops. It seems there&#39;s more to these tabletop games than I thought.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Right? I&#39;m glad I invited you. I was sure you would like them if you just gave them a chance.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Okay, next, we have the rules for combat. When two pieces come in contact with each other, we each take a turn rolling the dice to\u2013</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> Urk.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> You use...dice...?</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s part of the rules. Otherwise, there would be no way to determine which piece won.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Well, each troop does have its own strength level, but that would get boring very quickly, to say nothing of lacking in flexibility.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> In reality, there are many variables that go into winning a battle\u2013like morale and hunger, to name just two\u2013so we use dice in this game to approximate that sort of unpredictability.</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> ...If it&#39;s not too much trouble,<br> could I give those dice a try?</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Of course. Go right ahead.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> (Wow, snake eyes right out of the gate...)</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> L-let me try that again...</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t believe it... She had two sets of dice and somehow managed to roll snake eyes with BOTH of them!)</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Maybe it would be better if I rolled the dice for you?</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> Y-yes, I think that would be for the best...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t expect to see those two hanging out. Is that them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are they the ones you came to check on?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. It looks like Lakshmi&#39;s getting along here better than I&#39;d hoped...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Sorry, no. One of them was on the list,<br> but she&#39;s not the main reason I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This was actually helping me to work up the courage I need. All right, here goes nothing...!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Oho, so that&#39;s how you want to play this, huh? Guess it&#39;s time for me to break out that rare drop I got earlier then!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nani!? No fair! How come you get to be that good AND get all the rares!?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> There is nothing to gain from arguing about matters of luck, Lady Osakabehime.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> That is why I only train my technique, so that I will be in fine shape regardless of the state of my equipment.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I guess you&#39;ve got a point. That does sound like how a true warrior would handle these things...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Except I really don&#39;t think that applies here, Tomocchi! This is a battle royale, remember?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If one player gets an overwhelming equipment advantage, the rest of us are over!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Here, I&#39;ve got a proposal for you! Why don&#39;t we form a temporary truce and fight together!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> That way, I&#39;m sure we can stop Gacchan from gaining any more momentum!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> We&#39;re so close together that it only makes sense! Hell, it&#39;s practically our duty to team up!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Oh? A last-minute party, huh? Fine by me!<br> This oughta make things interesting!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Heh heh. &#39;Course, you&#39;re still gonna end up losing miserably either way!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Hmm. You make a good point, Lady Osakabehime.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> A single nation gaining power far and above its nearby peers is not necessarily a good thing.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As they say, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down. That is only more true in an age of war.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> All that is to say: yes, I would be happy to accept your proposal!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yatta! Then let&#39;s get going!<br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got your back!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Although...if you leave your back TOO open, you can&#39;t complain if I stab you in it, right?)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Really, in a game like this, it would be wrong if I didn&#39;t try to kill you when I had the chance, right? Especially since I&#39;m technically still an Assassin!)</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...Ah! Someone means to kill me!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaa! But I didn&#39;t even do anything (yet)!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry! I sensed something was amiss and reacted on instinct!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? Now you&#39;re infighting before your party&#39;s even gotten off the ground?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Well then, I guess I&#39;ll just have to take advantage of this chance to demonstrate the destructive power of my ultraheavy weaponry! Eat this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah. Say no more.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you understand, Master.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Hm? Who&#39;s poking me in the shoulder? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy engaging in a serious power play here!?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> What&#39;d I just say? I&#39;m busy right now, dammit.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care how badly you want my blessing.<br> I&#39;m already closed for today, got it?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> You&#39;ll just have to come back on my next business day, whenever that turns out to be!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Aaargh, that does it! I don&#39;t know who you think you are, but you&#39;d better be prepared to face divine retribution for the crime of interrupting the great Ganesha&#39;s game\u2013</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes? What would I face divine retribution for exactly, Ganesha?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Gaaah! Ganesha&#39;s ma-maman!? Uh, I mean...<br> Mother! Wh-what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> \u201CGaaah,\u201D you say? That almost sounds as though you didn&#39;t want to see me.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> H-haha, hahaha, who, me? Don&#39;t be silly.<br> Why wouldn&#39;t I want to see you? Ahahaha.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Good. I&#39;m glad to see you still remember me, even though we&#39;re both inhabiting vessels at the moment.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Your vessel&#39;s consciousness may be stronger than your own, but that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t still my child.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> In fact, I get the sense that I&#39;m partly responsible for your current manifestation, so I would hope you remember me.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> W-well of course I do, Mother.<br> I am Ganesha right now, after all.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I can feel our relationship deep down in my soul. And stuff.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I&#39;m totally not freaked out about you surprising me like this out of nowhere. No way, no how.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> A-anyway, um... Good day to you and stuff, Mother.<br> What did you want to see me about?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Do you really need to ask? I&#39;m here to make sure you&#39;ve been living a healthy lifestyle!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;d heard rumors that a god with an elephant head had been doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and lying around playing video games while gorging herself on junk food ever since she got here!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been telling myself they must have been exaggerating, only to find out things are even worse than I&#39;d feared!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Eep! Y-you&#39;ve got it all wrong, Mother! I haven&#39;t been gorging myself in the slightest! I haven&#39;t even had a single sweet bun all day!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Sure, I&#39;ve been chugging boatloads of juice to make up for that, but it&#39;s lemonade with fruit in it, so it&#39;s good for you!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ah yes, the good old \u201Cfrench fries equals potatoes equals vegetables\u201D logic.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Anyway, are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking, Tomocchi?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes, I believe I am. There is no place for mercy in battle, after all. Hup.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Aaah! No fair attacking me while I can&#39;t look at the screen!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you turn away from me, Ganesha!<br> I&#39;m still talking to you!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> C-come on, Mother, you&#39;re supposed to have fun in the rec room, right? That&#39;s the whole reason it exists.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> If anything, it&#39;d be rude for me NOT to give our game my full attention while we&#39;re all here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not saying you can never have fun. There&#39;s nothing wrong with indulging in sweets every now and then, either.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> All I&#39;m saying is that balance is important, and I want you to be better about exercising moderation.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> For example, let me ask you this: how long have all of you been in here playing games?</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> Um... The two of us have been here for about an hour, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>Qin Liangyu:</strong><br> Yes, that sounds right.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Wonderful. Then there&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hehe, it&#39;s a mysterious feeling, talking to you like this. It must be because of the goddess inside you.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What would you say to having tea together some time, Lakshmi?</p><p><strong>Lakshmi:</strong><br> It would be my honor.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now then, what about you three?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> O-oh, yes. Well, um, to be honest...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Um... Oh bats, when did we get here again...?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I&#39;d say probably...yesterday?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s the complete opposite of balance and moderation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I gotta agree, that&#39;s kind of overdoing it!</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Y-yes, you&#39;re right. I was so caught up in our game that I lost all track of time. How embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> All right, I guess I can take a little break then.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I&#39;ll recharge with some more lemonade, and spend some time studying and working on self-improvement things.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that. As long as you understand, I&#39;m willing to let you off without a lecture this time.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m kind of thirsty too. Would you mind if I had a lemonade too, Ganesha?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Oh sure, go for it.<br> There&#39;s a whole caseload where that came from.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh, you&#39;re that into this stuff? (Gulp, gulp)... Oh wow, this IS umaicious. I like how it&#39;s really filling, too.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You know, I bet this would make a good energy drink for my next doujin all-nighter...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Are you and Ganesha good friends, Osakabehime?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hm? Uh, that&#39;s hard to say.<br> I guess we&#39;re birds of a feather, but...</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Yeah, there&#39;s definitely some stuff we just can&#39;t agree on. We&#39;re like the yin and yang of shut-ins.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hehehe. I guess you could say we&#39;re something like eternal rivals?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re talking about, but I&#39;m glad to see my child has such a good friend. I hope you&#39;ll continue to play with Ganesha for years to come.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Ugh, stop it, Mother. You&#39;re embarrassing me.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Hm? Hang on. Now that I&#39;m all reenergized, I just got a great idea. Let me just open up the old skill screen here.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Okay, if I put this here, and combine these together...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Whoa, sugoi! I think you might&#39;ve just come up with a new meta!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> You&#39;re right! I never thought of this approach before!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> There&#39;s no time to lose. I&#39;ve gotta test this baby out in live combat and level it up so\u2013</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> H-hey, come on. I took a break, just like I said I would...right?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And how long was this break?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Five minutes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Welp.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Guess I&#39;d better break out the battle gear...)</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I knew it! You still have no idea what the issue is here!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear to me now that the indolent attitudes of civilized society have infected you down to your very bones!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Needless to say, this sort of behavior is well beneath the dignity of a god.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I am a fellow Divinity of India! More importantly, I am your mother, and I cannot permit you living your life like this!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to whip you and your slovenly friends into shape myself!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wha!? How&#39;d I get caught up in this!?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Y-yes, you may be right! Perhaps I have been overly indulgent as of late.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> If the great goddess P\u0101rvat\u012B of India is offering to instruct me personally, then I will gladly accept!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Perhaps this will be like the zazen training with warning sticks I&#39;ve heard about. Thank you for this opportunity, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Cut that out! You&#39;re making the rest of us look bad!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Thank you for your instruction!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe how happy you are about this! This is exactly why I don&#39;t get you athlete gamers!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Dammit, my camouflage failed... Man, didn&#39;t you ever think about what would happen if my friends tried to invite me to their group while all this was going down?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Huh? We all know I don&#39;t have that many friends? Please don&#39;t say things like that. The truth hurts, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobody said anything of the sort!</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You&#39;re usually so responsible, Tomoe. What is it about video games that makes you lose all sense of proportion?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not entirely sure myself.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always felt like I was merely enjoying a new form of recreation...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...but I suppose I do have a tendency to become a bit...overenthusiastic when it comes to matters of warfare.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. In your case, it may be a form of training.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Well, please don&#39;t feel too bad about it. Even I know that modern games can be highly absorbing.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The only thing I&#39;ll say is to be careful not to get carried away.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> How about you, Osakabehime?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Me? I&#39;m just an otaku, that&#39;s all.<br> I daisuki this kind of stuff.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Though...I guess part of it is that games also help me come up with ideas for my next book. Research, basically.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. So you take the joy they give you, and pass it on to others in a different form.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s nothing as noble as that. It&#39;s more like I&#39;ve just gotta get it out of my system...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You might be surprised. I have a feeling most creative people would say something very similar.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> At any rate, making art is a wonderful thing, and you should be proud of it. Just make sure you don&#39;t get too carried away in your research.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Well, Ganesha? What about you?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> They&#39;re fun!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> That&#39;s literally all there is to it with me! No deeper meaning than that whatsoever!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. Then it would seem you leave me no choice!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> (Oh man, why did I say that!? Gaaah! The pressure!)</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> (I shoulda known Papan (read: Shiva) wouldn&#39;t marry just any old goddess! I mean, I DID know, but still!)</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> W-w-w-well, uh, I guess I kinda sorta thought I might be slacking off a liiittle more than I probably should...</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> And the thought did cross my mind that I should probably do some real work every now and then...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Good. As long as you understand, that&#39;s all that matters.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Phew.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> However... While I am of course willing to take you at your word...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t help but get the impression that you aren&#39;t exactly used to resisting temptation.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to take some preventative measures.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And by that... Um, what was that thing you&#39;re holding called again? A controller?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to confiscate yours for the time being!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Oh... Okay.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hate me if you wish, but know that overcoming this adversity will ultimately make you a better god.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This hurts me just as much as it hurts you, but I&#39;m doing it for your own good. I hope you can understand that.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Uh, yeah, I guess I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um... (Should I tell her?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh well, I&#39;m sure things&#39;ll work out. (Decide not to tell her)</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Good! Then that takes care of this public decency AND lifestyle check!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve had this talk, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all take better care of yourselves from now on!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s keep this momentum going with our next check-in, Master!</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Seriously, Maman? We&#39;re not stuck in the 16-bit era anymore.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> It&#39;s easy to get replacement controllers nowadays. You&#39;re not actually stopping me from playing as much as I want.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Trust Maman to be so woefully behind the times.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Hehe. Perhaps she is, but she still seems like a wonderful mother where it counts.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> She&#39;s only tough on people because she cares.<br> Not only for her own child, but for us as well.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> That much is abundantly clear.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Yeah...all right.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I guess I can do my job and be a good god for others to worship for a while.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, I don&#39;t need her getting on my case if she catches me slacking off again.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh, I guess even you have a serious side to you, Ganesha. You know, I think I&#39;ll go back to my room and start working on my next draft.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Heheheh. How many pages are you planning to make this one?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> I&#39;ll come hang out once you get bored and decide to take a break.</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have to do all our gaming here, you know! Besides, we still gotta finish this match!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Y-you haven&#39;t actually learned a thing, have you!?</p><p><strong>Ganesha:</strong><br> Hey, what Maman doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt her (or more importantly, me), right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Right. I should&#39;ve known you wouldn&#39;t be you if you weren&#39;t constantly slacking off.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m surprised you decided to do any work at all.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re free to come to my room if I get bored, but I&#39;m warning you now, depending on how my draft is going, I might not let you in!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So if I have my \u201CNo Trespassing\u201D sign up, you&#39;d better respect it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Okay, here&#39;s our next stop. I can sense multiple Servants on this list are gathered here, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The simulator room?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It looks like someone&#39;s already using\u2013Huh?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hello, Arjuna. Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Oh! Hello, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B. Hello, Master.<br> I&#39;m honored to see you today.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Um, I wouldn&#39;t say anything is...wrong right now, but... (Constant side-glancing)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you want to go inside?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want to go inside together?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s all right.<br> I don&#39;t have any reason to go in there.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If anything, I think I would only get in your way.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Please, go on in. Don&#39;t mind me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to find somewhere quiet and pray to Shiva to thank him for this fortunate encounter.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And to once again convey my gratitude to him for my Pashupata here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, right, I&#39;d forgotten you had that.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine, but...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...please do be careful with that.<br> It&#39;s very dangerous.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B. Your kinds words fill me with joy. Rest assured, I will heed your warning. Good day.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hey, Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Yes?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You are the picture of a fair and righteous warrior.<br> I know I don&#39;t have to worry about how you lead your life.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That said...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I believe it might not be so bad for you to think a little less before you act.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Much like the people in here are doing.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hehe. Thank you for another word of advice, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B. I will gladly take it to heart.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But in this case, I really do think I would only get in your way if I were to accompany you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And since that is the last thing I want, I&#39;m content to leave things be for the moment.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have plenty of other chances.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. Very well then, I won&#39;t press the issue any further.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B.<br> Now then, if you&#39;ll excuse me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that all about?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hehe. Let&#39;s just say I was heeding my goddess intuition.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Okay, now that we can check Arjuna off the list...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...I think I&#39;d better go see what things are like inside the simulator.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Is that...?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hey! Cut it out already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder what Boudica&#39;s upset about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s really going to town on that potlid with that ladle...</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hello, Boudica.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh, hi, Fujimaru. Hi, P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...Um, I know this probably isn&#39;t the reason you&#39;re here, but just to make sure...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...you aren&#39;t here to join these rowdy kids, are you?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um, no, we&#39;re here to check up on how Servants are behaving around here, on behalf of Raikou.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I must say, whatever you&#39;re cooking smells wonderful, Boudica. Are you here on a picnic or something?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> A picnic!? I wish! Just take a look over there, and you&#39;ll get an idea of what I&#39;ve had to put up with!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong><br> Woo! Damn, son, you really are a beast! I almost thought my fist was gonna burn off when I hit you!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Tch... So that&#39;s Chinese Boxing, huh?<br> Goddamn pain in the ass.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d think you were using an illusion or something. I&#39;m impressed you can pull that off with physical skill alone.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Kaka, I take it you&#39;re starting to feel the heat in more ways than one, Skillful Star?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Let me have a turn then. I&#39;ll be glad to show him all the Chinese Boxing techniques he wants.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hey now, no cutting in line.<br> It&#39;s my turn to fight him next.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Was it now? That&#39;s not how I remember it.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh yeah? Well let me give you a little reminder then!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Since it seems those two are now rather busy...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll be taking the next turn.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now, prepare to face the demonic swords of the First Knight of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hey! Don&#39;t you go cutting in line, either!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Guh, would you lot just shut up already!?<br> I don&#39;t give two shits who I fight next!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...They all seem to be having fun.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> That&#39;s great for them, but I&#39;m sure as hell not.<br> Ugh, I swear...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So what, they&#39;re having some kind of fighting party?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What in the world happened here?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You see that boy with the red hair over there?<br> I think his name&#39;s A\u015Bvatth\u0101man?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> He showed up while I was in the kitchen, looking inside the fridge and wondering what to make...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...and said something to the effect of \u201CI&#39;m hungry. Get me something to eat,\u201D so I whipped this up for him.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I knew he was from India, and he&#39;s a fellow redhead, so I can&#39;t help but feel a sense of kinship with him, you know?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> But then, after I put my heart and soul into making this food...he won&#39;t even bother to look at it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like they&#39;re really going at it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s a bunch of rowdy kids all right...</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Exactly! So I&#39;ve been doing this to try to get their attention:</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Heeey! I said, your food&#39;s ready! Take a break and eat up while it&#39;s still hot!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Sorry, can&#39;t stop now that my engine&#39;s all warmed up! Just put it down on that rock! I&#39;ll have it later!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You see!? He won&#39;t listen to a thing I say!<br> Ugh, it&#39;s so frustrating!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes, I do see what you mean... Indeed, this is absolutely unacceptable! He&#39;s not showing you the least bit of respect for cooking for him!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m very sorry...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Usually, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man could never pass up fine cooking,<br> but when he gets caught up in the heat of battle, well...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Indeed. I certainly appreciate how Boudica always cooks such delicious meals for us...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...so I would love to help her out here if I could...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m already so full on bananas that there&#39;s nothing I can do. Believe me, I feel very silly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yikes! Where&#39;d you two come from!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why are you two just sitting around on the floor!?</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> We&#39;re waiting for our turn. We originally came here hoping to get in some exercise, but then the others all said:</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> \u201CYou already had plenty of chances to fight him, right? It&#39;s only fair we get a turn now.\u201D</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t argue with that, so now, we&#39;re just waiting for the others to finish before we have a go.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What a wonderful attitude. You both get a gold star\u2661</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Aah! L-Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B? I&#39;m so sorry.<br> I didn&#39;t see you there.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Rama. There&#39;s no need to be so formal here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> We&#39;re both Fujimaru&#39;s Servants now,<br> so please, feel free to address me as an equal.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I see... As you wish then.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Oh, back to the topic at hand: if you have an issue with A\u015Bvatth\u0101man&#39;s behavior, why not tell him yourself?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I doubt even he would ignore whatever Lord Shiva&#39;s wife had to say. Ah.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry. I was only referring to your relationship. I didn&#39;t mean anything more than that.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh Rama. You may be eloquent in most things, but you can&#39;t lie to save your life. But that&#39;s hardly a bad thing.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Not to worry. Given my position, it&#39;s absolutely my duty to point out the error of his ways. All right... Let&#39;s get to it!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Ahem. Excuse me, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Ha? Who the hell do you think you are,<br> interrupting me when I&#39;m having the time of my\u2013Shit.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hi there, young man. I&#39;m P\u0101rvat\u012B. Wife to Shiva, the one who has so kindly kept you under his protection all this time.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Ma&#39;am, yes ma&#39;am! A\u015Bvatth\u0101man, at your service!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Huh, that&#39;s a surprise. I&#39;m guessing those two already kind of know each other?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You could say that. A\u015Bvatth\u0101man is actually Shiva&#39;s half-incarnation.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Given how he&#39;s acting towards her, I&#39;d say he&#39;s kind of like a young man on her husband&#39;s side of the family.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s like Par&#39;s married to the head of his syndicate?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So he&#39;s basically her son-in-law by blood oath?</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh, I think I might have seen something like that in the library. What&#39;re they called again? Yakuza families?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> So basically, they&#39;re like distant relatives?<br> I don&#39;t really get it, but I guess I can see it.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Uh, g-good day, Goddess P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Of course, I have nothing but respect for you.<br> How could I not, given my root essence?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> However, even as a br\u0101hmana, I cannot fight the fever of battle!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hehe. I understand you were preoccupied, but that&#39;s no excuse not to mind your manners. You really do remind me of Shiva, and not all in a good way.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> With all due respect, ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to him to be compared to a wild brat like me.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Anyway, as you can see, I really don&#39;t have time to eat right now!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Though I can at least grab a quick drink in between rounds.

It lets them earn money and teaches them about the ways of the world.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we have one ourselves while we&#39;re here?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Who knows?

Aww, now I&#39;m all hurt and stuff. Maybe I should sue, you know, for emotional distress or whatever.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Honestly, I haven&#39;t done anything wrong.<br> Right?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Uh-uh! She&#39;s just the little sister of the pretty lady we see sometimes. At least, we think so.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen her eating flapjacks at the cafeteria!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Me too. She likes them with lots of honey, just like\u2013I mean, just NOT like me, &#39;cause I&#39;m a grown-up and stuff.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> And today, we&#39;re selling lemonade together, as you can see!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You hear that, P\u0101rvat\u012B? If you&#39;re going to grovel for my forgiveness, now&#39;s your chance.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmph, honestly. I didn&#39;t even do anything wrong today.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> All I&#39;m guilty of is selling special lemonade just for grown-ups.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just for grown-ups, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Special lemonade, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Yes, Master? What&#39;s with the look?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s} thinking there&#39;s something very fishy about that, and I agree!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> In fact, I think I know exactly what&#39;s been nagging at me now.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Both Ganesha and A\u015Bvatth\u0101man were drinking lemonade...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The exact same kind of lemonade that you&#39;re selling right now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s no surprise. It&#39;s been quite the unexpected hit, after all.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> My special grown-up lemonade fills you up completely, both physically and mentally, giving you an overflowing feeling of well-being.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Basically...all I&#39;m doing is making everyone who drinks it happy.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That sounds for all the world like some sort of dangerous drug...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Are you sure there&#39;s no corrupting essence or something in it? Something like Paracelsus&#39;s elixirs, but for depravity?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Be honest. You&#39;re up to something with this, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> How many times do I have to say it?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I. Haven&#39;t. Done. Anything. Wrong. Not unless you think it&#39;s wrong to love people for who they are.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Continuing to glare)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Ugh, I swear, you are SO paranoid.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary in this lemonade. I can swear it on anything you want.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yes, it makes everyone who drinks it happy, but only because that&#39;s the sort of product I set out to create.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I put any special divine power into it.<br> I mean, who do you think I am? A god of alcohol, like Soma?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You believe me, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> The only reason it&#39;s so popular is that it tastes really good. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Say, I know. If you won&#39;t take my word for it, why not try it for yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm. Yeah, maybe I should.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit. Come on, right this way then.<br> Don&#39;t worry, this one&#39;s on the house.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> W-wait just one second!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re also one of Fujimaru&#39;s Servants now, Kama, so it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But it never hurts to make sure!<br> As they say, trust, but verify!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to taste it first.<br> In fact, I think I&#39;m obligated to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, that seems kind of...unsafe.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Y-you took the words right out of my mouth, Master.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I think I&#39;d better try some myself to ensure it&#39;s harmless. I mean, I&#39;m sure it is, but you can&#39;t be too careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Tch.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Fine, suit yourselves. I&#39;ll just be over here, crying on the inside about how nobody trusts me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Okay, here you go then.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Thanks. All right... Here goes nothing.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh my. This is...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. Well?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This is really good. And it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s anything strange in it, either...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The only unusual part is that it really does seem to fill me with energy...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...I still don&#39;t fully buy it, but I can at least tell that there&#39;s nothing bad in here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It feels like it has some kind of nutrient-rich substance... One that&#39;s just as good for Servants as humans.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Right? That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been telling you.<br> I didn&#39;t put anything strange in it whatsoever.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Kama.<br> I guess I was being a little overprotective.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I shouldn&#39;t have ignored the fact that you&#39;re a fellow Servant now and decided you were up to no good.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I hope you can forgi\u2013</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. There&#39;s nothing bad in it whatsoever. It just has very, very generous amounts of nonbad things.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s got calories like you wouldn&#39;t believe.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Wait. What did you say it has...?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Uh, calories? You know, those things humans are so obsessed with?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> The amount of sweet, delicious magical energy it takes to heat a kilogram of water by one degree that&#39;s also used to build our Spirit Origins?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It was a lot of work figuring out how to cram that many into a single cup of lemonade, but I eventually succeeded.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Now there&#39;s enough in every glass to pack on the pounds, even in a Servant&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Wha... Wha...!? (Trembling with anger)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Ahh, it was truly a job well done, if I do say so myself. I can almost hear my customers&#39; grateful voices now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s the perfect casual meal for shut-in gamers who don&#39;t want to move from their consoles but still need nutrients.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Sure, the more she drinks the bigger she&#39;ll grow, but seeing what she started with, she won&#39;t even notice.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And for that delinquent on Shiva&#39;s side of the family,<br> it&#39;s the perfect pre and post workout protein drink.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Of course, I had the other girls bring him his order, as he&#39;s so close to my own Divinity that it&#39;s kind of gross.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Not to mention there&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m getting close to anyone who stinks of Shiva that badly unless I have to.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Anyway, given how much high-intensity combat training he&#39;s doing...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sure he&#39;s burning so much magical energy that his appearance isn&#39;t going to change.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But what&#39;s this? Oh no!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> If an ordinary housewife like you were to drink it, the sheer amount of calories would go straight to her stom\u2013</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This ends now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yikes!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> H-hey! Hold on, P\u0101rvat\u012B! What&#39;s the problem here?<br> It&#39;s just a cute, harmless prank, right?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Okay, yes, I&#39;ll admit this wasn&#39;t the nicest thing to do to you, but you&#39;re the adult here! You shouldn&#39;t get THAT upset!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I thought you were just going to scold me for a while and leave hating me a little more than you already did!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I took all that into consideration when I tricked you into drinking the lemonade, you know?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m angry because you didn&#39;t actually take anything into consideration at all!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Despite what you may think, I don&#39;t hate you.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What Shiva did to you was wrong, and I agree that I&#39;m partially responsible for it...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...so I don&#39;t blame you at all for holding a grudge against me.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Honestly, if playing pranks on me is enough to satisfy you, I&#39;m willing to go along with them up to a point.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But this? This is going too far!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Tricking someone into gaining weight is one of the most evil things you could have done!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Maybe this is all fun and games to you because you can change your body on a whim...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...but for women who don&#39;t have that luxury,<br> this is anything but a harmless prank!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> No, Kama, this act of evil deserves my full, unbridled wrath, and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re going to get!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...Right. I forgot she was the goddess of elegance and grace.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It makes sense that she wouldn&#39;t take too kindly to a prank that messes with her core beliefs...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Ooh, it looks like we&#39;re gonna get to see a fun show, Master!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you have some lemonade while you watch?<br> Which would you like?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> One old-fashioned lemonade please, Bunyan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> One cool and refreshing lemonade please, Lily.</p><p>\uFF1F3\uFF1AOne sweet pink lemonade please, Jack, Nursery.</p><hr><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Wh-what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s sooo yummy.

I was just doling out love like I always do.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> If someone wants a full-course meal, that&#39;s what I make them. If someone wants a quick and easy bite to eat to keep them going, that&#39;s what I make them.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Pretty good service, if I do say so myself\u2661 Really, if anything, you should be praising me, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hi, don&#39;t mind me. Just your everyday unparalleled genius inventor passing through.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t help but overhear your discussion, so I&#39;m just going to analyze a dropperful of Kama&#39;s lemonade here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, interesting. With all these calories per drop, this could make for some excellent emergency rations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is too intriguing not to study further, so I&#39;m going to leave the QP here and take a cup with me to go, okay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ciao, bambinas!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...All right, I can accept that what you&#39;re doing here isn&#39;t evil.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with selling lemonade that&#39;s delicious and rich in nutrients.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> If you&#39;d just make a batch with fewer calories, I wouldn&#39;t have any issue with it. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be willing to make one?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> No way. If I made something that was all upside and no downside for someone else, well...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...that would mean I was just straight-up loving them normally.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And that&#39;s exactly the kind of serious work I told myself I would never do if I can possibly help it.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you feel better knowing that too?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Sigh) I swear...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You know, you may not have realized this yourself,<br> but thanks to all that fighting we just did...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...you probably burned all the calories you got from that lemonade. Too bad.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Guess this is your lucky day, P\u0101rvat\u012B. Looks like I&#39;ll have to wait till some other time to see you truly miserable.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, ta-ta for now.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Byyye!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Ooh, we just remembered the Red Person said there&#39;d be flan in the cafeteria today!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh my, she just made a very sudden turn around that corner.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all go get snacks after we sell a little more lemonade!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Good idea! Come on then, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Then we will see you later, Master and P\u0101rvat\u012B!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...See you later then. Oh, and be careful not to bump into anyone in the hallways, okay?</p><p><strong>Children:</strong><br> We will!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Phew.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Glad that&#39;s over, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry you had to see that, Master...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I guess there&#39;s just no escaping the fact that Kama and I have a very, um...special relationship.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Honestly, it&#39;s kind of heartwarming in its own way.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> At this point, I don&#39;t think Kama&#39;s ever going to change.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll continue to do the bare minimum required of her as a Servant, but she&#39;s also not going to stop playing these kinds of impish pranks.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, but please don&#39;t feel like you have to worry about her yourself, Master!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I feel like it&#39;s only right that I continue to keep an eye on that troublemaking goddess, even when I&#39;m not standing in for the head prefect.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...You know, now that I think about it, that might be true for all the other Indian deities as well.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> In fact...watching over them from a careful distance like this just might be part of my job.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> After all, much as it pains me to admit it, a lot of Indian deities do tend to, um, go a bit overboard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If nothing else, they definitely don&#39;t do anything by halves.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Indeed. Which is why they can easily get carried away if I don&#39;t keep an eye on them.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I think they need someone who&#39;s aware of that to help keep them in check.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And I also think that a goddess who&#39;s just a goddess is probably best suited to be that someone.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> In other words...someone like me.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m usually just sort of...there. I don&#39;t have any great talents, nor am I especially strong...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...but maybe I can be the pillar that watches over and supports everyone else.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> No... I realize now that that&#39;s what I want to be.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hehe. I can&#39;t thank Raikou enough for giving me an opportunity to figure this out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, it&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re everyone&#39;s mother.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I...guess so? It&#39;s a little embarrassing,<br> hearing it put that way.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, and of course, I&#39;ll also be sure to do my very best if you need my help in combat!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> As I&#39;ve said before, I know that sort of thing is very important, so please don&#39;t hesitate to call on me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I definitely won&#39;t. Thanks, P\u0101rvat\u012B!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2013 Bonus: The True Victim in All This\u2013</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Uso.
