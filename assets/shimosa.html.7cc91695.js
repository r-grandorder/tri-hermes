I refuse to sleep just yet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Come now, eyes, open up. Yes, that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I may well end up dying today or tomorrow,but it won&#39;t be right this instant. Patience.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>After all, my visitor has yet to arrive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Hmm, now where was I? Oh yes, my blades.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I killed...quite a few people with them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Blades...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>They are tools for killing; for cutting and slashing human bodies. They once referred to tachi and katana; now they refer to katana and wakizashi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Blades are carried by soldiers, by warriors, by bushi...They could also be called samurai, a variation of the word \u201Csaburau,\u201D meaning to serve, as they serve their masters.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In any case, those who command these warriors are known as generals.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A general is like nothing so much as a master carpenter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He must know how to make use of every tool at his disposal to carry out his master&#39;s wishes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Even now, I can hear a young Iori telling me he doesn&#39;t understand what I mean.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Perhaps Magonojou would have that smug, knowing expression about now? Yes, I imagine he would.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Me, I&#39;m hopeless. I didn&#39;t understand anything back when I was young. I just traveled the world, cutting down any who challenged me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I could never have hoped to be a general. At best, I would have ended up some minor commander bound for some tiny domain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>How foolish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Yes, foolish. What point is there in being good with a blade? It is good for nothing but killing and maiming others...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Perhaps my life might have been more worthwhile had I been a painter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No doubt Takada Matabei would laugh if he heard that.

It is far too late for me to allow myself to wallow in regret now.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...As if I would ever say something like that. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There is nothing wrong with a bit of foolishness! I lived in a chaotic age, where the screams of agony were common as bird song!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have no regrets!

Show me what my final moments hold!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Spirits in heaven, forgive me for such fruitless dreams. Treat them as no more than the ramblings of an old man on death&#39;s door, and pay them no heed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Still, I have precious little time left.

I was just heading to your room to look for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I finally found something I&#39;ve been trying to find for some time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s something that concerns you, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What were you so keen to find, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t looking for it for my sake. If anything, it&#39;s more to do with you, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Let me start at the beginning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s see...Senpai, you once said that you met Miyamoto Musashi, the famous swordmaster, during a dream-like experience, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup, I sure did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Well, this concerns her too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t remember it very clearly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>You don&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Perhaps there&#39;s some rule we don&#39;t know about that uniquely affects miniature Singularities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Very well then, let me tell you what you told me right after you returned.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Unlike the historical Miyamoto Musashi, this one you encountered was a woman. Perhaps from a world of Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>She may have been one who travels between worlds via some special means, or even a living human rather than a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Whatever the case, that was the Musashi you met.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I found this very intriguing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I had nothing to go on but what you told me,and the circumstantial evidence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>And there was one more thing, something that kept nagging at me personally.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>If Miyamoto Musashi has been split into two different people, one male, one female...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>There may be a reason for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Of course, there are a fair number of Heroic Spirits with numerous \u201CWhat if? \u201D Spirit Origins registered here at Chaldea alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Maybe that&#39;s the case with Musashi as well,or maybe she&#39;s something completely different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...Either way, I had to find out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you were looking for data on Musashi, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And did you? Find something, I mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Yes! And I couldn&#39;t have done it without the whole staff&#39;s help!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>Aw, it was no big deal. There was all sorts of always-accessible, text-formatted data already saved to the standard library.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, image data of authentic original texts isn&#39;t as easy to find.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>But luckily, we recently happened across some that was saved to a stand-alone underground library.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>I think my heart skipped a beat when it first turned up, though. After all...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>...it said not to look at it in the README file.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>Still, I scanned it for viruses and it came up clean, so it should be all right. Probably just someone&#39;s idea of a practical joke.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I hope this image taken of the original manuscript for the Book of Five Rings helps you two out. Later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Thank you so much!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is the book Musashi wrote!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, but, isn&#39;t that...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Yes. This is the book that the Miyamoto Musashi who left his mark on OUR history wrote.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>The female Musashi that you met had nothing to do with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>For one thing, she hadn&#39;t materialized as a Servant, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think she was a flesh-and-blood human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, but she was just as strong as any Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Moving between worlds while still alive...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Alternate histories...but with the exact same name...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...A different version of the exact same person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Senpai, can you wait for a little while? There&#39;s something I want to try.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>If the Musashi you met was different from our history&#39;s Miyamoto Musashi, but she also had the same name and fought with two swords...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Then we may be able to find something else they have in common, or maybe even some way in which they&#39;re entirely different, in the manuscript.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I know I&#39;m grasping at straws, so I can&#39;t offer anything more definitive right now, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll help you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe we&#39;ll learn something surprising about her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Thank you, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>...Hm. Hm hm hmm. So you were discussing The Book of Five Rings, were you?</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I really must say: it might be just a touch difficult to decipher it, and to find a proper expert.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Speak of the devil!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right, Musashi and Kojirou are like peas in a pod!</p><hr><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Oh, no. I may call myself Sasaki Kojirou,but who&#39;s to say if that is indeed who I truly am?</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>No, I am merely a stick-waving samurai who stumbled onto this name.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I have certainly heard the name \u201CMiyamoto Musashi,\u201D but I&#39;ve never actually met him. Indeed, I have no connection to him whatsoever, for good or ill.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Nonetheless, now that I go by Kojirou, I cannot ignore the mark that Shinmen Musashi has made upon the world.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Knowledge of The Book of Five Rings was bestowed upon me when I was summoned as a Servant, whether I wished it so or not.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>As such, I know it quite well, though I cannot say how comprehensible its contents will be to you, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Everything up to the Book of Earth and the Book of Water can be interpreted easily enough. But beyond that, it is more a book of riddles than a manual.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Its final chapter, the Book of Void, is nothing more than a scrap that lays Musashi&#39;s feelings bare.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Nor are they described in a tangible, material manner. Void discusses what lies beyond...The karmic laws one&#39;s eye can see.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>And the concept of \u201Czero,\u201D which at the time was at the very bleeding edge of Buddhist studies.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Indeed, it reads more like a philosophical treatise created to help the reader accept this new way of thinking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...E-excuse me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid I completely forgot...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Sasaki Kojirou!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...Oh, I-I&#39;m sorry for getting carried away. I didn&#39;t mean to shout in your face like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>But I just remembered that you showed up in the story about the famous duel on Ganryu Island!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Of course, some say that story was just invented some years later, and you&#39;re also rather unique when it comes to Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>B-but that&#39;s exactly why I should have thought to ask you about it first!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>And yet, for some reason...it never even occurred to me until now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...Huh? That&#39;s odd. It felt like my head was swimming in some kind of haze or something...</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Please calm yourself, Lady Mash. Take a few deep breaths, and make sure you are getting enough oxygen.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Now, may I ask what you mean to do with The Book of Five Rings? Do you mean to summon Musashi to Chaldea as well?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>No, not exactly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Though I would like to see her again if I could.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You never know for sure when it comes to Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Oho. So you met a Miyamoto Musashi, but not the historical Miyamoto Musashi of our world.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Rather, she is a woman with thin arms who wields two katana, claims to be Musashi, and aspires to perfect her swordsmanship, hmm.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Fascinating. She sounds very much like me, and yet entirely different.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I may be Sasaki Kojirou, but inside, I am merely a single manifestation of one of the many legends surrounding him.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I am but the shadow of the moon as reflected in a pool of water.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>But you say this mysterious Musashi you met is apparently THE Musashi, rather than one of his manifestations.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>In which case, did this female Musashi ever tell you this?</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>\u201CKojirou, you have lost. \u201D</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>According to other swordmasters, that is what Musashi said to Kojirou after the latter had cast aside his scabbard of his own accord while awaiting Musashi on Ganryu Island.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>There are numerous interpretations of their duel,but there are no lines more famous than this.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>As such, those words would prove that this Musashi was indeed who she claims.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Perhaps you even came to believe she was Musashi because you had heard her speak that line,[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, she never said anything like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s still Musashi whether she said that or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Oho. Oh, ho ho. That complicates matters. Then I believe this female Musashi has yet to reach the void.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Which may then make you the final piece of this puzzle, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Musashi was my most ephemeral rival. A wielder of two katana for whom Sasaki Kojirou had waited since time immemorial.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>There have been many great swordmasters in Japan&#39;s history, but despite being flashy and controversial, none so well-known and beloved as him.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>He was a brilliant martial artist with nary a loss to his name: Shinmen...</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Musashi-no-Kami...</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Fujiwara-no...</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Harunobu...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...That does sound like me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>But I never dreamed I&#39;d have the luxury of somebody overseeing it all to the end.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>I never thought things would turn out like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>You look pale...No, more than pale. You look ghostly white...Wait, this has happened before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s wrong, Senpai? Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Senpai! Senpai! Please wake up, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>What is all this commotion? It&#39;s eeearly. What&#39;s wrong, Mash? You seem awfully worked up.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>Why, you&#39;re pale as an oni. Oh, and I see Master&#39;s collapsed in a heap.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] out cold, isn&#39;t [\u2642 he /\u2640 she]? But don&#39;t worry, [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] still got a pulse. We&#39;re neither too late nor too early.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I shall go and fetch Lady Martha. Lady Mash,remain calm. Lady Douji, keep an eye on things.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>Well, it&#39;s not like [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] dying or anything. Although, it does feel like there&#39;s some kind of magical energy here...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>...Hmm, never mind. Guess it was just my imagination.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>Hey, Fujimaru. Wake up, or I&#39;ll start nibbling on you from the head down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Senpai...! Senpai!

At least, I think it does.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So if you end up dying here before you wake up,you&#39;ll probably end up dead for real.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve seen people die to...curses? Seen stuff like that more than a few times.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So as Musashi-no-Kami, I hereby offer to serve as your guard until this thing blows over!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Haha, it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve said something like that! Makes me feel kinda silly!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Somebody even trusted a ruffian like me to look after a plot of land once, if you can believe that!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve protected a fair few over the years,so just relax and let me handle everything!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In fact, to be honest, I just came here a day ago myself, so I&#39;ve been a little nervous about exploring this place on my own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean you got lost and ended up here too...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So...we&#39;re both in the same boat...?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yup! Though I&#39;m not nearly as out of place as you are. The air&#39;s kinda different here, but this is still the Japan I know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That said, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know anything more about what&#39;s going on than you do! Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve bounced around all kindsa worlds, but it seems I can&#39;t go back to worlds I&#39;ve been to before.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m always getting called \u201Cstranger\u201D and \u201Cworld drifter\u201D and other stuff like that wherever I go, so I&#39;m pretty much always starting from scratch.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A lotta the time, I get rough types getting in my face and picking fights and stuff. Sometimes it gets me so riled up I can&#39;t control myself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But with you here with me, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll talk me down from doing anything foolish. Lady Kannon must have had a hand in this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, you ended up here just after you were talking about me, right? It must be fate!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here with me. Let&#39;s find out what&#39;s up with this place together.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We&#39;ll look for a way to get you back to your own world, and a way for me to keep going with my journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here too, too-cute Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I am in your debt, that I am.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ehhh...That&#39;s weird coming from you. Don&#39;t talk like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We&#39;ve already shared a rice ball before! There&#39;s no need for flattery!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Okay, now that we&#39;re all caught up,what say we get moving?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>From the look of things around here, I can say for sure we&#39;re in Japan. I&#39;d guess somewhere in the center of the country?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s start by seeing what&#39;s over in that direction. If we&#39;re lucky, we&#39;ll find a village. If we&#39;re unlucky...well, we should still find a river!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Well, we&#39;ve been walking for an hour, and so far the only thing we&#39;ve found is a buncha Jizou statues.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, I bet it won&#39;t be much longer now until we find a village. Trust me, that&#39;s usually how it goes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, are you okay, Fujimaru? Did you want to take a break? I must have been walking pretty quickly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay. This is nothing compared to America.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh? You mean you&#39;ve crossed that whole continent!? That&#39;s amazing! Even I got tired just crossing the western part of it!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still...you know what America is like, huh. That country is really huge.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Although...Neeheehee. If you can handle that much land, that means you can also handle me dragging you around a kinda rough, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is nothing compared to Onigashima&#39;s mountain pass.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, yeah, compared to a giant mountain like that,a nice flat rice field like this is no big deal!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, there were real oni there! To be honest, I was scared out of my wits the first time I saw one!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Aaanyway, I guess I should save my energy and just hush a bit, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s take it nice and easy while we walk. Luckily, the sky is a beautiful blue today.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m still hungry since I lost my rice ball, but I can make do as long as the sky is nice and blue like this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sure do like blue skies, don&#39;t you, Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I do. America&#39;s sky was beautiful too, but there&#39;s just something about it here that I really love.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Like it has a kind of depth to it? No, that&#39;s not right. If anything, this sky seems more pliable.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>America&#39;s sky was so pretty you could feel your thoughts emptying out as you looked at it, but not this sky.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It feels like it could pull you into it, to a point where it&#39;s actually kind of scary. That&#39;s one of the things I love about it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess part of that has to do with my memories of watching it as a child, though. Ahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh yeah, it was cloudy the last time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Come to think of it, it was. I still enjoyed my time on that island, but that part was unfortunate.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hey, I can sense someone. Looks like we got lucky, and someone&#39;s coming this way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I wonder if they&#39;re from around here? This should work out well; we can ask them everything we want to know.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AGirl:</strong></p><p>Hi there. What are you two doing in the rice fields?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AGirl:</strong></p><p>I can tell you&#39;re not from around here. Are you travelers? Where did you come from?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right! I&#39;m a traveling swordsman! Uh, swordswoman! (And the fact that we understand each other just goes to show that this really is Japan! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t easily explain where I came from, but I was born in a town called Ohara in the Mimasaka Province.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Have you heard of it? It&#39;s home to Kenmitsu Temple...Uh, I mean, never mind; I guess that doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m Musashi. Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>My real name is a bit longer than that, but that&#39;ll do for now. What about you, miss? What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s so nice of you to help out by watching that baby. Is he your little brother? Are you his big sister?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AGirl:</strong></p><p>...Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AGirl:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re a woman samurai! And you&#39;re so pretty!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AGirl:</strong></p><p>Oh gosh, oh gosh! Your costume is really pretty too! Are you from Edo!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>M-me, pretty!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Did you hear that, Fujimaru? She called me pretty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod affirmatively)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Heeheehee. I knew it! It feels so strange, but a good kinda strange.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it really a costume though?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Yeah, I know. I knew what she meant. I like this kimono a lot myself, after all...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You&#39;re right, I should have known a wild woman going around swinging two katana like me would never be pretty to anyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, thank you for the compliment, uh...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh, uh, my name&#39;s Onui! And this is my little brother, Tasuke!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo ga.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re a good little boy, aren&#39;t you, Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Peekaaa...boo!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, Fujimaru, I didn&#39;t know you were so good with babies. I&#39;m impressed. I like babies, oh and kids too...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...but I&#39;m just no good at looking after them. Whenever they cry, I end up wanting to cry with them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Anyway, that&#39;s neither here nor there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui, you mentioned Edo, right? It sounds like it&#39;s a major city.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That would put us in the same time period I was in before: during the Tokugawa Shogunate&#39;s reign.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Edo period?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Is that what you call it in your time? Huh, interesting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s still a range of a few hundred years.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Wait, the Tokugawa Shogunate lasts for THAT long? Aw, man...Now I really wish I&#39;d enlisted...</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Are you going to Edo, Miss Samurai? Or to Toke Castle?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Toke Castle?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Uh huh. If that&#39;s where you&#39;re headed,it&#39;s just a half day&#39;s walk along the highway.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That would mean this is Kazusa Province. So we must be in the eastern part of the country.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>No, this is the Shimousa Province.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Is that so...Hm?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a really big town all around the castle. It&#39;s much bigger than our village!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait. Huh? Hold on.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I could have sworn that Toke Castle was in Kazusa, and that it was abandoned during the Toyotomi reign.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t remember it being big enough to have its own town either.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is all very different than I remember...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Say, Onui, Lord Tokugawa is the ruler of Edo, right?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. His name is Tokugawa Ie...Ie-something...Oh, Iemitsu! His name is Tokugawa Iemitsu!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga, ga!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So this is Iemitsu&#39;s reign...Even so, Toke Castle should still be in Kazusa, and still be abandoned to boot...Hmm, maybe this is part of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Part of what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh yes, that. Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the history of worlds I wander into differs slightly from the history of my own world. That&#39;s probably what&#39;s going on here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How about in your time? Is Toke Castle part of Kazusa? Was it a proper castle even during the Tokugawa reign?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Right, of course. Sorry, I should have known better than to ask!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m...gonna go with...definitely probably no?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Honestly, I should have known better than to ask that, but I&#39;m impressed you answered it so quickly. You really know your history, don&#39;t you.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At any rate, this is good. We now know that this is the Tokugawa reign under Tokugawa Iemitsu, and that we&#39;re somewhere in the Shimousa Province.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This girl was pretty quick and confident in her answers, so there&#39;s no reason to doubt her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think we&#39;ve made a lot of progress. Things are going so well it almost seems wrong!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Usually I end up having to fend off burglars before I meet a single decent person. Hell, most of the time I have to cross mountains before I even learn the name of whatever place I happened across!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You have some incredibly bad luck, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know, right? More often than not, the only people who&#39;ll talk to me are bandits! Good thing for me that you&#39;re here this time, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, that was just my stomach growling! I guess that&#39;s what happens when you haven&#39;t eaten anything for two days straight!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Say, Onui, is there a teahouse anywhere around here?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a teahouse on the other side of the village...Oh, but my grandpa&#39;s hermitage is a lot closer!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s where Tasuke and I came from.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga, ga.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Say, pretty samurai lady? Weird kimono [\u2642 guy /\u2640 lady]?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weird kimono...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess this would look real weird to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Would you two like to come to my grandpa&#39;s hermitage? I could make you tea.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You know how to make tea, Onui? So you know how to do housework as well as watch your brother, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What a responsible young girl you are. I&#39;m proud of you.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Um, anyway, please follow me and\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hm? I know this feeling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be good...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky a moment ago!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...! There are monsters nearby!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui! Get away from the cute [\u2642 guy /\u2640 girl] in the weird kimo\u2013I mean, get away from Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh gosh, oh gosh. The sky went all dark...Is this...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Waah, waah!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There there...It&#39;s okay, Tasuke. Nothing to be afraid of. W-well, maybe a little, but it&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You were right. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of!</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Aaah!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That voice...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s not the kind of voice any child should have to hear. Onui, I want you to close your eyes and plug your ears.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Children might see ghosts sometimes,but they should never have to see a real monster.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Especially not during Iemitsu&#39;s reign. Widespread war should be gone by this period.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Children shouldn&#39;t have to see people dying...to hear bodies being torn apart...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>For that matter, they shouldn&#39;t have to see me using my swords either.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Looks like my luck is just as terrible as ever. Running into this in the mountains at night is one thing, but if they&#39;re showing up in broad daylight, things must be really bad in this time period.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You there, evil spirit. I won&#39;t ask who or what you are, or why you lost your way in the first place.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m no monk, and I have no desire to hear your grudge or chant a prayer for you. If you disappear here and now, I won&#39;t even raise my katana against you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But if you turn those rotting eyes of yours to the living, all bets are off.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I especially won&#39;t have you looking at Onui or Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Musashi-no-Kami, will you help us?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course. This evil spirit is made of pure bloodlust. If I don&#39;t take care of it, the children&#39;s lives could be endangered. Or, for that matter...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...your life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll fight with you. I can back you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s great to hear! You haven&#39;t changed a bit, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I knew I could trust you. No, more than that;you truly deserve respect. After all...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>([\u2642 He /\u2640 She] moved to protect the children before I even said anything. Whereas my first move...was to take up my katana. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...Oh well, that IS who I am. No sense feeling bad about it. I&#39;m a swordsman, so I may as well act like one! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m perfectly fine facing down evil spirits! Since the sun isn&#39;t keeping you at bay, I&#39;ll just have to do it myself!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The Path of the Void demands that souls devoid of flesh be cut away from this world! With my two katana, I shall do just that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The sky is clearing up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are the sky and evil spirits connected somehow?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...It looks like the spirits are all gone now.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Whoa, I can&#39;t believe it! That was amazing! You&#39;re so strong, Miss Samurai!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>At first I thought those were ghosts, but since you were able to get rid of them and you&#39;re not a monk...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I wonder if they were actually bandits or burglars or something.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah, they did say that. I remember! Back when Mom and Dad were still alive...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...I see. So they&#39;re orphans. )</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>They always said to be careful at night&#39;cause lots of bad things show up then!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t remember if Mom and Dad said anything about shadowy things showing up when it gets really cloudy.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>But I know they told us that&#39;s what happens at night. Grandpa said so too!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Grandpa...Now I see. So they still have a grandfather. He sounds very kind, too. )</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hmm...Although, I still don&#39;t know why bandits showed up here, and when it&#39;s not even night!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They didn&#39;t look like bandits to me. What about you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought they totally looked like bandits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Same. They didn&#39;t look like bandits at all!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Either way, now we know they show up so often that they get mistaken for bandits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So there&#39;s a castle that&#39;s not supposed to be here, and evil spirits stalking fields like wild animals.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve wandered into time periods like that before, but this one seems especially dangerous.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It looks to be as bad as Onigashima,where we first met, or maybe even worse...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, for now,let&#39;s go pay Onui&#39;s house a visit.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m still hungry, and we have to get her and Tasuke back home safely!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Those dark things don&#39;t show up in Grandpa&#39;s hermitage or the village, not even at night!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d never even seen one before...You hadn&#39;t either, right, Tasuke?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>See?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That may be what Onui told us...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But things might be different from what she&#39;s used to now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>First it got dark again,and there are definitely more monsters nearby too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why so many evil spirits in this Edo period!?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Seriously! What&#39;s going on here, anyway!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The nerve of these things, making me look bad by showing up right after I say they&#39;ve all been taken care of.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s even more of them now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, Musashi! Looks like we can&#39;t rest up yet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If only I could summon Servants...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? Oh, I THOUGHT it was strange that no one else had showed up yet. Is that technique of yours not working right or something?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, if not, that&#39;s fine. It keeps things nice and simple!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I may be so hungry I&#39;m about to collapse,but I still have an example to set!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This time, I&#39;ll make sure to cut them down to such a small size that they&#39;ll never come back agai\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru! Get down!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s see, let&#39;s see.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>It looks as though I&#39;ve materialized in this world for reasons unknown. Now I find myself in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I saw monsters just appearing and attacking people left and right whenever the sky grew dark.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>So whenever I found one, I would rip them to shreds with my spear. And now, after traveling the land and destroying numberless scores of them...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>I find myself in the presence of a beautiful swordsman accompanied by a child, a baby, and a young[\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] dressed in strange clothing.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...Pray tell, how did this come to be?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Whoa, who is this guy!? He obliterated those spirits with just a single thrust of his spear! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(The way he holds his spear, his gait, his torso, his build, his breathing...! Compared to him, those spirits might as well have been kittens! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Musashi...? )</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh well, guess I&#39;d better say something.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can tell you&#39;re a skilled fighter from the way you mowed down those spirits with a single spear strike. Are you the powerful warrior I&#39;ve been hearing about?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Well now, well now.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>I wasn&#39;t expecting you to answer my question with a question of your own.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>\u201CA powerful warrior,\u201D hmm? It seems I&#39;m one of the Heroic Spirits that have left their mark on humanity, but I still find that hard to believe.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>I find quite a bit of knowledge has been stuffed into this head of mine.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>But none of it answers any truly important questions! For what purpose was I summoned here!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Where is the one who summoned me!? I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m supposed to be doing!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>For the moment, I shall tell you my name! I am Houzouin Inshun!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>I have studied both Buddhism and the spear directly under Master In&#39;ei, the founder of Houzouin-style Soujutsu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Houzouin Inshun!</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Right you are! Thank you for saying so, young one! I am indeed Houzouin Inshun, and merely passing by!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>So you&#39;re a monk? Wow, you&#39;re even stronger than those dark bandits!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo ga!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Bandits? ...Were those bandits just now? As near as I could tell, they were nothing more than evil spirits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think so too. If those are bandits,then all of Japan would be overrun by\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>W-wait a sec. Did I hear you right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Are you really Inshun? As in THE Houzouin Inshun!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The strongest jumonji spear-wielder who ever lived? The man who reinstated the Houzouin-style Soujutsu after Lord In&#39;ei passed on...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The same Houzouin Inshun whose skill with a spear even allowed him to step into the realm of the gods and the Buddha himself!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Ah, yes, I believe I&#39;m that Inshun. I have certainly never gone by any other name.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>What about you? It is rare to see a woman carrying katana, and they do not appear to be mere decoration.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>This feeling you impart...You do not possess the unique air of a Heroic Spirit, but I cannot help but sense something...familiar about you.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see. You are a swordsman.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Familiar, huh? I...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I never managed to meet him before. In all my travels across different timelines of Japan, I never once came across Lord Inshun while he was still alive. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(He&#39;s an unparalleled genius with the spear, so much so that other warrior monks, who ordinarily have no interest in who the strongest of them is, talked about him in hushed, even reverent tones. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...I never imagined I would finally end up meeting him in a place like this. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Still...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Yeah. Right now, Fujimaru and the other two come first. My own interests can wait until later.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let me thank you once again for your help earlier. I was incredibly impressed by your skill with the spear.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There can be no doubt that you are THE Houzouin Inshun...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The star pupil of the Houzouin school of Soujutsu, a warrior monk said to be invincible once he takes up his jumonji spear.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Although, I WAS under the impression that you would be quite a bit older in this time period.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Hm? Ah, is that why you weren&#39;t sure about me? I apologize for that.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a very good reason why I&#39;m younger than you expected. It&#39;s because I&#39;m a Servant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Servant...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh! You mean the kind of Servant Fujimaru talks about sometimes!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I believe [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] described them as the shadows of figures from fiction and history that materialize in this world to aid [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] in battle.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, I see. So you&#39;re one of those then.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Indeed. Thus, I can see why you may be on your guard, as we Servants are not exactly everyday occurrences. But you are hardly without blame either.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I heard you rattling your sword, attempting to provoke my ire. I cannot commend your actions!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Had those children not been present,I would already have answered such provocation!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sorry about that. It&#39;s a habit of mine. Whenever I meet an opponent who seems formidable, I end up goading them into a duel.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But I guess I missed my chance thanks to you. Seems like now&#39;s not the best time to compare skills.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see. That is at once fortunate and very much the opposite. I too have no wish to kill a swordsman who can be reasoned with.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>All the more so if she is as beautiful as you are. I may be sworn to celibacy, but that would still be a terrible shame.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. After seeing that smile,I&#39;d really like it if we could be friends.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry for not properly introducing myself earlier. I&#39;m Miyamoto Musashi. As you can see, I am indeed a traveling swordsman.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m sorry? Did you say Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Musashi.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Musashi!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Haha, Miyamoto Musashi, eh. As in Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yep, that&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Ha ha ha.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahaha.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Hahahahaha. Now I see, hahahaha! I had no idea that the famed Musashi was a woman!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Forgive me for laughing like that; it was very rude of me. I was just really surprised. What a strange twist of history!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I have spent my life walking both the paths of the Buddha and the spear...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...but nothing prepared me for the surprises that this new hollow life would have in store!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>What a great pleasure this has been to have my expectations upturned like\u2013</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Wait, wait, this is wrong! You&#39;re a far cry from the Musashi that I know!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>You there, young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]! You know who Musashi is supposed to be, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know what you mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, this is just like what happened when I first met you, Fujimaru...What&#39;s with the me from other worlds?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have any other way to explain it. I just happen to be a Musashi who&#39;s a little different from the one you&#39;re familiar with.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see...Indeed, I do have some familiarity with Shinmen Musashi. At the very least, I can say with confidence that he was not a woman.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Could it be that you inherited his name? I...doubt he had a daughter, but might you perhaps have been his disciple at one point?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>My father was Shinmen Munisai. Come to think of it...I guess he was technically my master too.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yup.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Then, you say you truly are Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thought I&#39;d already said so. Um, I didn&#39;t want to explain because I thought it might be confusing...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But I think I&#39;m actually from a different history\u2013really, a different world than the one you all know. Do you get what I mean?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...A different history. If you had told me that while I was alive, I probably would have said you were speaking nonsense, but now...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Very well then, Lady Musashi, let me ask you this: are you familiar with one Takada Matabei?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You mean Matabei the spearman?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How do YOU know about\u2013Oh, right. Come to think of it...he studied Houzouin-style Soujutsu, didn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think that when we fought, he had already opened his own school. Anyway, what about him?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Takada Matabei and I studied under the same master, and Matabei claimed he had crossed swords with Shinmen Musashi. In which case...hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hang on, both of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got a bad feeling...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Looks like your instincts were right on the mark,Fujimaru. Way to go!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Tsk tsk. Whatever happened to the rule of law in this land? Nonetheless...this is a good opportunity.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Musashi, we could merely talk about this all we want to no avail. But as warriors, we have other, far clearer ways to communicate than words alone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Indeed. I&#39;d hate to be taken lightly just because I&#39;ve got thin arms. You&#39;re more hardheaded than you seem, aren&#39;t you, Lord Inshun?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I suppose now&#39;s as good a time as any to prove who I am with my swords!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>We can only proceed so far with doubts fogging our minds. As such, there is only one path left to us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All right Lord Inshun, why don&#39;t you take the right side? Shall we say whoever slaughters the most spirits is the winner?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I heartily agree! That quick thinking is indeed the Shinmen Musashi I know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was the Edo period this lawless?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you really \u201Cshoot first\u201D types?</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Huh? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui, I want you to stick close to Fujimaru again. Make sure you don&#39;t move from [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] side.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo, ga?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re such a good little boy, Tasuke. Don&#39;t cry now. This will all be over soon.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There you are, evil spirits! Just this once,I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t know when to give up!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Heh. Such ferocity. Most men would soil their pants at the sight of such creatures, yet you yearn to fight.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>At this point, I am already willing to believe you are who you say you are, but I&#39;ll be damned if I miss this chance to compare our skills firsthand.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>You there, young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]! Make sure you keep careful track of which of us defeats more spirits!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...This is it!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Not yet, it isn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Phew.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...(Sigh). I guess you really can&#39;t put any stock in rumors.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>\u201CUnparalleled with the spear\u201D doesn&#39;t come close to doing your skill justice. It would even be an insult to call you \u201Cthe greatest of all time. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Every thrust of your spear\u2013every sweep, every strike, every slash\u2013would be ultimate finishing blows for any other fighter.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...To be honest, watching you fight up close gave me chills. It was so beautiful I could hardly believe it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No one, at any point in Japan&#39;s history, has ever wielded a spear with such absolute perfection.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The depth of your mindfulness and technique...The way your spear cut through the air with only the bare minimum distance required...The sheer mastery of your form, with not a single movement wasted...I still have a long way to go in comparison.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Incredible. You win, no doubt about it. It has been an honor to witness your skill up close, Lord Inshun.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Seriously, that was awesome! The heir to the Houzouin school was even greater than I had imagined!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see. So that is how I seemed to you, eh. In that case, I think I can finally accept this.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Oh, I don&#39;t mean your identity. I mean myself as a so-called Servant.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>To be honest, even after I learned about Heroic Spirits and Servants...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...I was unsure whether I was fit to be one myself.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>But if a swordsman of your caliber has admitted defeat,I can accept that I am worthy to be a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I am the one who should be thanking you, Shinmen Musashi. You have proven beyond all doubt how capable women warriors can be.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>(Hey, he called you Musashi! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(So he did. He even thanked me, even though I don&#39;t deserve it. Lord Inshun is truly as great as the spear he wields. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I appreciate that, but can I set the record straight about one thing? Just because I&#39;ve declared you the victor doesn&#39;t mean I lost.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru? I never said I had lost, did I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, no, you didn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Musashi sure does hate to lose...)</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see. Yes, now that you mention it, you&#39;re right! The Musashi I know would never readily admit defeat!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Indeed, you are without a doubt Shinmen Musashi! Both your skills and your speech prove it!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s the second time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It seems our contest to see whether I truly am Musashi has been settled as well.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yup, that was twice! You said \u201CShinmen Musashi\u201D twice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you agree she is Musashi, then?</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Hahahaha, I see, I see. So I&#39;ve called you that twice, have I!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Well done. I may have won our contest of skill,but it seems I&#39;ve lost in what truly mattered!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t recall ever refusing to acknowledge you for who you are, but let me make it official.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Magnificently played, Lady Musashi.... Now, at last,I know what kind of situation I&#39;ve found myself in.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I am a Servant who has been summoned to this place, and that young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady] there is one of few in this time who knows what Servants are.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>If this is not fate, then nothing is. Please, will you tell me everything you can about yourselves?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I may be Houzouin Inshun...but I have no idea as to who summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Hmm, I see. Chaldea, is it?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid I understood perhaps half of what you told me at best, Lady Musashi, but I understand what Fujimaru had to say well enough.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I have no connection to this Chaldea place whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Therefore, I must be an inhuman being who has appeared here for some other reason.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re...not human?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Servants are people too.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>They are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, they&#39;re like extra amazing people.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Amazing people...Then, they&#39;re samurai!? But, Mr. Inshun is a monk, isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Ha ha ha, that I am. No matter what else I may be, I shall always be a monk.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, I understand that you&#39;re the same kind of person as the people Fujimaru summoned the last time we met...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But is there someone controlling you? Or did you just pop right out of the grave all on your own?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I am not undead! Although, I suppose the art that summoned me is as black as those that create undead, so perhaps we are more similar than I would like...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...At any rate.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>As far as I can remember,I materialized here as a Lancer about two days ago.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I have no idea whether or not I have a Master. All I know is that when I came to, I was standing alone at the edge of the Katori Shrine grounds.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I was given very little knowledge during my summoning.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I know only that this is the 16th year of Kan&#39;ei, in which Tokugawa Iemitsu reigns, and that we are in the Shimousa Province.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The 16th year of Kan&#39;ei...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That would be 1639 A. D. , right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? What is it? ...Oh, I see. You&#39;re surprised I know about the Western calendar?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, it&#39;s just one of the many,many things I&#39;ve picked up in my travels!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In modern terms, that puts us in Chiba Prefecture...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Chiba Prefecture?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Chiba Prefecture???</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Indeed. I know where we are and when we are, but nothing more. Again, I have no idea whatsoever as to why I was summoned to begin with.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Nonetheless, when I came to, I had an ominous premonition. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, warning me not to remain a moment longer.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>So I left Katori Shrine and wandered around, slaying the spirits that appeared at night and when the sky grew dark...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s when you met us, eh. Glad you made it here safe and sound, Lord Inshun.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, you&#39;ve been walking around these mountains and fields for a whole two days without anything to eat or drink, right? I&#39;ve done that myself at times, so I know how hard it is...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Especially since that&#39;s the exact same situation I&#39;m in right now myself. I really need to eat something before my stomach turns itself inside out.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Y-you do?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>All I have is some water in my bamboo flask...I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have anything else, Mr. Monk.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>But if you come to my grandpa&#39;s hermitage, we can treat you to rice balls!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>That is most kind of you. But worry not. This form of mine is fleeting, transient.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I have no need of food or drink. Feel free to drink the water yourselves.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...(Teary eyes)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Uh oh. Is she going to cry? )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>On second thought, it appears I spoke too soon. There is no creature on earth that does not get thirsty, after all!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>In fact, I just realized how thirsty I am. Very well, Onui, I gladly accept your kind offer.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There we go.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...But man, that&#39;s unbelievable. I can&#39;t imagine being able to fight after going an entire day without a drop of water.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>That is merely what it means to be a Heroic Spirit, or a Servant. For that matter, you seem fully capable of much the same feat yourself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, I guess so. I just think it&#39;s amazing how you never get hungry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Long as you haven&#39;t run out of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There may be a Holy Grail somewhere in Shimousa.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>It is a goblet associated with Western saints, an object said to be derived from the great cauldrons used by ancient, foreign gods.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>They possess immense power, and are capable of granting wishes and performing miraculous feats with ease.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>In essence, they are omnipotent wish-granters.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>With all these wicked creatures running rampant, it is indeed possible that there is a Holy Grail here.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Someone may have obtained it, and may be using its power to bring those creatures into this world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I have to do something.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm...You have to do something, huh. That would mean going home a lot later. Are you okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really, but I still have to do something.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So the needs of the many and all that, huh? You&#39;re so young, yet you&#39;re already separating your own problems from the ones of those around you...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess I&#39;ve got no choice but to stick around and help you out then!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t very well be the only one not bothering because it sounds like too much trouble after you&#39;ve gone and said something like that, after all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As they say, \u201CWe don&#39;t meet people by accident. They&#39;re meant to cross out path for a reason. \u201D Er, or maybe \u201CWe&#39;ve come too far to turn back now\u201D is better here?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This thing presumably causing trouble is called a Holy Grail, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So if there&#39;s someone here up to no good with it, you just need to teach them a lesson before heading back to Chaldea, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Easier said than done, but pretty much, yeah.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Got it. I&#39;ll keep that in mind then.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I usually try to avoid fighting when there&#39;s nothing in it for me, but I&#39;m not so heartless as to leave you to fend for yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean you&#39;ll help me, Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course I will! Besides, I love helping out cuties like you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If anything, I&#39;ve been waiting for you to ask. If you&#39;re okay with my help, I&#39;ll gladly stick with you to the end.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...You truly are different from the Musashi I know in many ways. He would never help anyone for free...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Oh, my apologies. I did not mean to imply that you were either a man or an imposter.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>You are your own Miyamoto Musashi, with your own inimitable Niten Ichiryu swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>That aside, young Fujimaru: your fortitude is most impressive, especially given your age.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s really not, honestly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s just harder to look the other way.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I see. You are a good person, and a hardy one at that. I can see why you and Lady Musashi get along so well! It is wonderful to see!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wonderful! ...Hey, what are you all talking about?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Oh, just boring grown-up talk. No need to worry about it if you didn&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...At any rate, it&#39;s terrible that someone has seen fit to summon monsters here, especially after the Tokugawa reign only just brought Japan&#39;s period of war to an end.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what it is they&#39;re after,but they must have a lot of time on their hands.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s still too soon to say anything for certain, but I wouldn&#39;t rule it out.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Regardless, transient form or not, the fact remains that I have come back to life! As such, I must use my spear to help those suffering from these circumstances beyond their control!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I believe that to be nothing less than the reason why I was given new life!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...But, if I am being fully truthful,there is another, more selfish reason...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I now have another chance to wield my spear, and there is no better target to use it on than these creatures plaguing innocent people!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Is that so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re so honest!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, I get that a lot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re a pretty cool guy, Inshun.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>At any rate, there are matters we must discuss. Musashi, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>We do not know if you two have some connection to these creatures plaguing Shimousa...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...or if your presence here is mere coincidence. However...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>After speaking with you, and fighting by your side, I have made up my mind. I see that you are worthy of my trust. As such...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t insist that you accompany me, but I would suggest that we begin by getting Onui and Tasuke back to this hermitage place safely.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>We can plan our next move after that. Is that acceptable?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good point. We might run into more monsters!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I was already planning to continue walking with Fujimaru, and to take Onui and Tasuke home.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, Lord Inshun.

Now I should be able to fight like usual!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Awesome. That&#39;s really great to hear.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Combine that with having Lord Inshun on our side,and evil spirits like these should be no big deal.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That said, we can&#39;t get careless. We need to keep our guard up until we know for sure that we&#39;re safe...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Speak of the devil! I&#39;m sensing an evil aura!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Indeed. How right you are. A good swordsman never lets down their guard, no matter how skilled they may be.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>We are the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. You will not find us so easily defeated as ordinary evil spirits.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wh-who are you?

Waaah!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui, get behind Fujimaru! These demons are nothing like the ones we just faced!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>For one thing, they have flesh, and scents. Scents that speak volumes about what they are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...This is the 16th year of Kan&#39;ei. That scent shouldn&#39;t exist in a peaceful world where the Shimabara Rebellion is over.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It smells as though they just killed mere moments ago. They must be covered in blood from head to toe.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Hrrn!</p><p><strong>Female Archer:</strong></p><p>...What a fearsome man. He is like an oni when he wields his spear. Any ordinary Heroic Spirit&#39;s Spirit Core would have been run through.</p><p><strong>Female Archer:</strong></p><p>Be careful, everyone. This man means to kill us.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Haha, so you managed to deflect my spear with a single arrow. It seems Shimousa is home to many incredibly strong women.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Or perhaps it is simply where all manner of monsters assemble? One, two, three...Aha, so this is the aura imparted by other Servants.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Now that I have sensed their inhuman presence for myself, I see that it is a rather disturbing feeling!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Servants!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So there were more summoned here besides Inshun!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>...Indeed. Indeed.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACarnivorous Man:</strong></p><p>We are the Six Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACarnivorous Man:</strong></p><p>Lady Shinmen Musashi, of the famed Niten Ichiryu.

Her opponent remains unscathed!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AShadow-Like Woman:</strong></p><p>...I am the Assassin of Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Those brilliant flashes I heard tearing through the darkness must have been the sounds of your Niten Ichiryu techniques.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I must say, I&#39;m a bit disappointed.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>They cannot compare to those of us who know the blood and chaos of a turbulent world.... Oh, my apologies. Come to think of it, you hail from such a world as well, don&#39;t you, Shinmen Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not really.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know about the Musashi from this world, but I never fought on any turbulent battlefield like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re a shinobi who excels at stealth, right? How nice of you to show yourself in the middle of a battle like\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hrn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did she just attack midsentence...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Her attack was blocked...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...This must be the Heavenly Eye.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Once she lays eyes on her target, her next strike lands like fate crashing down. It is a blow all but assured to end her opponent&#39;s life, one of Shinmen Musashi&#39;s greatest, most formidable gifts.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Yet even that strike was blocked...How did you stop it?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATachi-Carrying Woman:</strong></p><p>...I am the Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I assure you, I did nothing special. I simply swung this sword as I saw fit.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>If I place my sword here, the enemy&#39;s blade will halt. If I swing it here, the enemy&#39;s head will fly.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s only natural I would understand that.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>How could I hunt down oni if I didn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Hehe. Hehehehehe. What a strange monk you are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(What a terrifying woman. That was the best I had,and she parried it like it was nothing...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I needed to take out at least one of them with that technique if we were going to stand a chance.... I hate to admit it, but they&#39;re all stronger than me. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) Well this is just great.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, but don&#39;t take that as an admission of defeat. I&#39;m just surprised how you&#39;re all a little tougher than you look.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Defeating all of you now would be a real pain. All the more so if I don&#39;t kill you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You all seem to know a lot about us, but unfortunately, we&#39;re still in the middle of our journey.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So, y&#39;know, you could always let us go,and we can pick this up again another time, right?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>My, oh my. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s so sweet of you. Here we are trying to kill you...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...but you have no intention of killing us. You don&#39;t even intend to protect yourself.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>You know that you cannot beat us, so instead, you&#39;re summoning up every ounce of courage you have to let the children behind you escape with their lives.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>What a kind person you are. It&#39;s wonderful to see.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...But unfortunately for you, we are not human,and cannot be moved by human emotions.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>We are Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and thus, we have no compunctions whatsoever about killing you.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>In fact, we&#39;ll begin by killing the three humans cowering behind you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...She looks oddly familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1AStunning Girlish Voice:</strong></p><p>Well done, well done. Even fairy-tale heroes would stand in line to watch you fight!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AStunning Girlish Voice:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re still alive and talking after crossing swords with K\u0101las\u016Btra.

(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>The only sort of people who live decent lives in the Tokugawa era are the ones like those children over there.

Sorry but no, K\u0101las\u016Btra!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(That voice is coming from up in the trees...I can&#39;t see her, but I can tell she&#39;s formidable too...In fact, her aura is somehow even more evil than this other woman&#39;s. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Oh man, it&#39;s enough to make me want to cry...Hell, if Lord Inshun weren&#39;t here, I think I&#39;d have already burst into tears. )</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AStunning Girlish Voice:</strong></p><p>Well, don&#39;t sweat the small stuff.

Not money, or fame, or the moon, or grace...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AStunning Girlish Voice:</strong></p><p>It can all just melt away for all we care.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Get back, Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A flash flood!? No, wait...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AStunning Girlish Voice:</strong></p><p>Have a little taste of my special brew.

This is a matter best settled between Servants!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Let me handle this!

You must be the leader.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can already tell you&#39;re not the type to tell us your objective and look for a point of compromise.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Our objective? That should be quite obvious.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>First of all, you will hand that spearman over to us.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Me?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Correct. After that, we will massacre every living person here. All who encounter the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters must die. There will be no exceptions.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you think you can pull that off, go ahead and\u2013</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Of course we can pull that off.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Did you truly think the six of us incapable of doing so, woman?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(That sly fox. Never mind all six; any one of these people could pull that off. But if we just surrender, they&#39;d end up killing us all the same...)</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Fujimaru, Fujimaru. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Words alone will not be enough to get us out of this. Should I fight all six of them, I will not be able to guarantee Onui and Tasuke&#39;s safety. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(These are not ordinary Servants. I cannot put my finger on it, but there is something highly unusual about their nature. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(But that makes me a good match for them. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(In part, because they evidently came here seeking me. Of course, that isn&#39;t the only reason. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(It&#39;s my first time fighting them, but my Noble Phantasm should be able to handle them...so I ought to at least be able to buy them some time. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Listen closely. I want you to let me handle this on my own. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, run away while you act as a decoy?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Exactly! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But, if you do that...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Unfortunately...I do not believe there is any other way. )</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(If you make a run for it, Musashi is sure to follow. That is as it should be. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(You must carry Onui and Tasuke on your back. Are we clear? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...All right.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Good. I&#39;m counting on you. )</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Hahaha! Listen up, you villainous oni calling yourselves Heroic Spirit Swordmasters!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>You certainly do reek of blood! It is as Lady Musashi said: none of you are fit to live in a peaceful world!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>How fortunate that you evidently have business with me! As one who practices the teachings of the Buddha, it is abundantly clear that you could all use a good lesson!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>There you have it, Lady Musashi! The rest is up to you now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Lord Inshun!?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru, run!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold on tight, Onui!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let go of Tasuke!</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh god, don&#39;t let them get us...(Sniff)...H-huh!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Go, Musashi! You must protect Fujimaru and the children!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Thank you, Lord Inshun! I&#39;ll be sure to pay you back for this with interest!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Good. Now we can fight without restraint.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>So, you&#39;ve chosen to let yourself be used as bait, Houzouin Inshun.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Give it up. Your plan has no hope of success.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Well, I don&#39;t know about that. It is true that your swordsman aura is immense. I believe it&#39;s on par with my own magical energy.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I can also tell that you are a true master of your art, a person with monstrous abilities much like Musashi. Be that as it may, it matters not for my purpose here.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Even as we speak, there is a young [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] carrying young children while making [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] escape, and they are accompanied by a swordsman of incredible skill.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>It falls upon me to ensure their safe passage. And that is exactly what I shall do.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ACold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I see.... Then you shall soon be dead.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...This was certainly reckless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But Inshun had no intention of fighting a losing battle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He had every confidence in his Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The Oboro Urazuki, Eleven Forms. The ultimate cross-shaped spear technique.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A form that Inshun had devised himself in response to his master In&#39;ei&#39;s Fifteen Forms.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An invincible spear technique capable of adapting to any opponent or technique! The accumulation of all his training, said to be on par with the Buddha himself!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whether using it against an opponent he had never fought before, or against any sort of weapon, armament, or technique, Inshun would never lack the advantage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He would parry, counter, or evade anything his opponent threw at him, and follow it up with a fatal strike.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A great feat, eminently worthy of leaving its mark on humanity and enshrining him as a Heroic Spirit. Ordinarily, no mere human could hope to achieve it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, Houzouin Inshun had done so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Thus, as a Lancer, Houzouin Inshun was certain that he could fight calmly and with precision for as long as needed, no matter what sort of impossible offensive the mysterious Heroic Spirit he faced might use.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Luck was even on his side in a number of ways.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His only opponent was the swordsman in the cloak. The other five Heroic Spirits did nothing but observe the battle from afar.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>They did not do this in order to go easy on him. In all likelihood, they were simply ill at ease about working with each other.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whatever their reasons for doing so, the other Heroic Spirits staying out of the battle got Inshun thinking.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Their bloodlust was tremendous, and they had positioned themselves in such a way as to make escape impossible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>First, he shall dispose of this one enemy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That done, it would be possible to find a way out of his predicament, make his escape, and reunite with Musashi and the others\u2013</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...What say we finish this, Houzouin?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Fine with me.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Very well then.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>...Hraaa!!!</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The cloaked man no doubt believed he had defended against the attack. There was no mistaking that his katana had blocked the tip of Inshun&#39;s spear several times.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But he was wrong. In fact, Inshun was matching his own strikes to the man&#39;s movements. It was impossible for any to defend against this blow.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...I see. I should have dodged instead of parrying, huh.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you fell for such a simple trick. It seems I&#39;ve misread you, Houzouin Inshun, if only slightly.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I have pierced your heart. Farewell, anonymous swordsman.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...Anonymous, hmm? Ridiculous. Your every action is ridiculous, Inshun.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>None of it more so than your mindless imprudence.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Did you truly think your admittedly incredible, but woefully human, technique would ever work against us?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>What...!? I...I can&#39;t move my spear!</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I admit, that attack would have killed a human, or any other Heroic Spirit for that matter.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>No human can survive having their heart crushed. Few Heroic Spirits could withstand their Spirit Core being shattered.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Indeed, your spear was sharp enough to even fell a god, or the Buddha himself.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately for you, my sword has surpassed even the gods and the Buddha, and ascended to true supremacy, to the realm of Empireo. Resign yourself, Houzouin.</p><p><strong>Cold-Blooded Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...My Cursed Name is Saber of Empireo.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Ghh!</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Limbo, finish him off.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hahahahahahaha you got it! Go on, my little pentagram, devour his light!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>What...is this...!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It can be such a pain to capture people with good instincts. You shouldn&#39;t be wandering around as a mere Heroic Spirit, Lord Inshun.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>You were summoned to Katori Shrine as nothing less than the seventh Servant!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Really, it&#39;s very simple. We need you to be reborn and join us as a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, whether you want to or not.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It is unfortunate that you developed a sense of freedom when you were summoned, unlike the rest of us...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>I cannot move my limbs...Is this some sort of curse!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Now let&#39;s see, which Curse of Annihilation should I infuse you with? Let&#39;s try this one!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>What the...!? Stop it...What are you doing to my Spirit Core!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I shall remake your Spirit Origin,your will...everything about you!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Soon, you too shall serve our Lord Sorcerer,and our king in hell!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>In the name of Lucifer,the great Satan himself!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>Aaaaaahhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Now fall into the abyss and become one of us!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>O Satan, our great devil king and rightful ruler!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Now, please accept our seventh, and final, offering!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Soon, we shall bring the world of humans to an end. There shall be no salvation for anyone, anywhere!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters endowed with the Curse of Annihilation shall lay waste to everything in sight! They shall be invincible blades of destruction!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Inshun&#39;s spear had found its mark.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It truly had destroyed the swordsman&#39;s heart. That much was neither illusion nor trickery. He had indeed succeeded in killing his foe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Had the swordsman possessed the flesh and blood body of a living being, or the etheric body of a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...he would have died instantly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He would have, had he only been an ordinary living being or Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong></p><p>(Now I see.

How far he can get with that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Lord Inshun&#39;s skill with a spear far exceeds that of any normal beast, oni, or person. If he were only up against ordinary swordsmen, he could easily defeat a hundred, or even a thousand of them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...But those people were anything but ordinary. They were like demons...they didn&#39;t leave a single opening.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Just thinking about them gives me the creeps.

Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>For now, we should keep running.

Unfortunately for you, I have your scent now!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Try as you might...you&#39;ll never get away from me,little girl!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...For the moment, let&#39;s try making a break for the village.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We don&#39;t know what that thing that looks like Lord Inshun is made out of, so we can&#39;t be sure it won&#39;t be able to follow us in there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, it&#39;s the only option we have right now. At least, it&#39;s the only one I can think of.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so tired of those things getting in our way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You said it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wish they&#39;d leave us alone already!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Seriously! Can&#39;t we catch a single break!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah yeah, here we go again. Onui, hang on tight to Tasuke!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>O-okay!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We&#39;re kinda in a hurry here. And on top of that, I&#39;m still kinda pissed.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You might be too, if you&#39;d just had one of your strongest blows laughed off as a practice swing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not ashamed to run away, but I&#39;ve got my pride as a swordsman, and that really sucked!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not gonna try to contain my anger,or listen to anything you might have to say!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right now, I&#39;m as angry and annoyed as you are. Don&#39;t expect me to hold back while I cut my way through!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Umm, ahh...okay, we&#39;re almost at Grandpa&#39;s hermitage!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Just turn right ahead, then go straight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to get there before he catches up to us.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. Okay then, let&#39;s run for it! Here, I&#39;ll carry Onui and Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry for holding you back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No worries. You&#39;ve been a huge help. If you hadn&#39;t been here, I&#39;d have lost it and paid dearly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll run as fast as I can too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know it&#39;s hard, but hang in there. It&#39;ll just be a little longer now!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, let&#39;s get a move on!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>The village is right over there! You should see it after we cross that slope!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We made it!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I wonder if everyone&#39;s sleeping,since it&#39;s already nighttime...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh, but should we tell them scary things have showed up? Or maybe we shouldn&#39;t wake them up right now?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hopefully, whatever it is that keeps the evil spirits away from villages will work on Lord Inshun too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But it might not. In which case, we should probably have everyone evacuate in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The way Lord Inshun is now,I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t hesitate to\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to warn the people here either way!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...No, wait. We&#39;re too late!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I should have known that a Servant could outpace a normal human! Damn it all! Quick, get in that haystack! We have to hide!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry, but please stay quiet. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be able to hide from him, but we have to try.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...Hmph. I know I saw someone here just a moment ago.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>They must have hidden themselves in that hay, where they tremble with fright even now! Haha, hahahahaha! So you&#39;ve turned coward, have you, Shinmen Musashi!?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>No matter!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Even though I have only just been reborn as a swordmaster, I cannot abide the stench of life! This place positively reeks of it!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>......A village, huh?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I see it will be a trifle difficult to pass through the entrance, but that&#39;s hardly cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>It may stop the dark weaklings, but for us Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, it may as well not exist at all. Now then...Musashi! Are you listening!?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>If you won&#39;t come out, then I&#39;m afraid I have no choice...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was then that the sounds began.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>At first, there was only Inshun&#39;s howls of rage,as though he were cursing life itself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Soon after came the sounds of something being demolished.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Then the sounds of tearing, piercing, and slicing rang out...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Musashi covered Onui&#39;s ears, unsure whether she would understand what was happening.</p><p><strong>Village Man:</strong></p><p>W-what&#39;s going on!? Who are you!? Wh-wh-why would a monk attack us?</p><p><strong>Village Man:</strong></p><p>...Gh-ghk, urk...! M-my arm!</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Honey! Honey!!! Aieee! N-no, please! Please!!!</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong></p><p>H-his head! Oh god, what happened to his head!?</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Ah...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...There were no survivors.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The voices of men. Women. All sorts and all kinds. Every one of them, screaming.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>One. Two. Three. Four. Five...I knew I would never forget the number of people I heard screaming.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>After the fifty-fourth scream...</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Oh well, nothing to be done now. If Musashi and the other humans refuse to serve as my quarry, these villagers will just have to serve in their place!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Hahaha! What a grand, lovely feeling!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>If you and Fujimaru are hearing this,Musashi, then remember it well!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Thanks to your decision to hide, my spear has grown so delightfully drenched! I never knew that blood was such an effective lubricant!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Now my spear has become sharper than ever! Hehe, heh haha, hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>You have my thanks! Not only do I already possess an invincible body, but now an invincible spear as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] held back [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] urge to scream with all [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] might. Instead, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] ground [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] teeth until [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] gums started to bleed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Finally...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m so sorry. That must have been so hard for you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know you wish you could have gone out there and helped. It must have been excruciating, not being able to do anything for them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, there really was nothing we could do. Please understand.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t stop Lord Inshun. There&#39;s no way to defeat a demon who doesn&#39;t blink at getting his head cut off.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even if I were to try and fight him, I have no weapons\u2013no blade capable of killing him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So once he caught up...this was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Not that that makes any of this easier to swallow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I AM sad and angry I couldn&#39;t help them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But above all, I don&#39;t want anyone else to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m with you there. So we&#39;ll just have to do whatever we can.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hm? Are you done plugging my ears now?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hey, what sort of game is this? Uh, I mean, I guess we shouldn&#39;t wake everyone up after all, should we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Never mind that now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry to your grandfather&#39;s hermitage, Onui.</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yes. Come on, let&#39;s hurry over there. Even if I have to carry you all myself...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;ll make sure you, Tasuke, and your grandfather stay safe! Now let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...There! That must be it!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>We&#39;re here! Wow, that was so fast!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t have to carry us anymore. Tasuke and me must be really heavy, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nah. You&#39;re both still featherlight. I could carry you all the time without breaking a sweat.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There we go. Thank you again for carrying us, Ms. Samurai.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Would you carry me again sometime?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sure! I&#39;d be glad to carry you again if I have to, or even if you&#39;d just like me to.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wow, Ms. Samurai, you&#39;re so strong! Much stronger than any man I&#39;ve ever met!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehehe...Uh, I mean, no I&#39;m not. I&#39;m actually just an ordinary girl like you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why both Fujimaru and I are at our limits. Onui, think you could ask your grandfather for some water?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still...catching...breath...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just one glass of water would be plenty.</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Sure! Oh, and I still have some water in my bamboo flask too! I guess Mr. Monk didn&#39;t drink it all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. Of course Lord Inshun would do that. We may not have known each other long, but I could tell that&#39;s the sort of person he was.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Here&#39;s some water, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ahhh, that hit the spot!</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hey, you look a lot better now! Before you were really pale, but now you look normal!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga goo.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She&#39;s right, Fujimaru. You DO look a lot better. I wonder if this hermitage has anything to do with that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...It&#39;s hard to explain, but I feel a strange power here...one that&#39;s nothing like that evil aura.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It could also be a powerful barrier at work.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I bet it could have been this hermitage that was keeping monsters away from the village all along. Not that I have any evidence.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, this one might just be strong enough to even keep Lord Inshun out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now that you mention it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I can sense some magical energy here too.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AMasculine Youth&#39;s Voice:</strong></p><p>Feh. Absurd. The only thing here is my smithy.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>None of the village folk come by either. Outta all the things making a racket outside my window, never in my years would&#39;ve thought they&#39;d be a lady samurai and a [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] in strange garb.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>You travelers, I take it? The hell brings you two here?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hi, Grandpa! We&#39;re back!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Tch, so you&#39;re Onui&#39;s guests. Shoulda just said so. Could&#39;ve saved me a lot of trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Grandpa?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look oddly familiar somehow...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait. Huh? Aren&#39;t you awfully young to be anyone&#39;s grandfather? You barely look older than me!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And then there&#39;s that bare katana in your hand...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I don&#39;t have an eye for judging the craftsmanship of swords, but even I can tell that&#39;s something special! )</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t give me your lip. Think I don&#39;t know I look young?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I was born with this face y&#39;know. And of course I have a katana. I&#39;m a swordsmith.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Take a look around. There&#39;s a bunch of them lying all over the place.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>N-now that you mention it. Wait, you&#39;re just leaving them out like this!?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re failures. But never you mind that. Onui, you and Tasuke head inside.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>What about Ms. Samurai and the nice [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I need to talk to them first. Now get.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay! Come in soon, Ms. Samurai! You too, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga goo!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Hmph, nothing ever gets them down.... Thanks for saving &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>When I saw the sky turn dark in the middle of the day, and the moon shining bloodred, I was afraid for their safety.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Thanks for saving them and bringing them back to me. I&#39;d like to invite you in right now...</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>But first, you need to tell me about yourself and your clan. That&#39;s the condition for letting you inside.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I wish I could.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry. It looks like I made a bad call.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean...not that. I was just hoping against hope that he wouldn&#39;t follow us to the village.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But he did. And now...he&#39;s caught up to us again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Houzouin Inshun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lancer of Purgatorio!</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1ALancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! Here you are! I knew I smelled your stench!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ALancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Living creatures positively reek! But at last I can now distinguish your stench from all others, Musashi!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>So...</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>You decided to run HERE!? Hahahahahaha, so there WAS another besides us!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>But no matter, no matter! My jumonji spear is more than capable of felling any being that is not a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh no! Grandpa, get out of here!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>One strike is all it will take!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Who&#39;re you calling \u201CGrandpa\u201D?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Die!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Shaddup!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(At a glance, it looked like he swung his sword the way an old man would wave a cane around...and yet, his speed and power were incredible. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Just dodging Lord Inshun&#39;s thrust was an amazing feat in itself, but then the blow he struck afterwards destroyed his entire upper body! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(He doesn&#39;t seem like a swordsman. In fact, I&#39;m certain he&#39;s a smith. So then, how did he pull that off like it was nothing? )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru, am I seeing things,or did that actually just happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...But now his sword is falling apart.</p><hr><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Didn&#39;t expect much anyway. It was just another experimental blade.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Dammit, another failure. I&#39;ve gone and wasted another sword.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So you were just testing it? But, a sword that breaks after just one blow is\u2013</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Shaddup. They&#39;re not defective;that&#39;s just how I made them!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Forget it. Look! That fellow&#39;s still no worse for wear!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>It is no use...</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Our body is not flesh and blood, but merely a means to an end. There is no gruesome technique, no Mystic blade, that can hope to reach our Spirit Core.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Is that so!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...It is no use. None whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...This fellow&#39;s like somethin&#39; out of a bad dream. Would be my luck the kids had to bring an immortal monster back with &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Maybe I shoulda just stayed inside. This fellow&#39;s even worse news than he looks.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>You have nothing to be sorry for, smith. Your blades were useless to begin with.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Human blades could never hope to stop us. Human power cannot hope to contain us.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>For example, I killed everyone in the two villages lying west and north of here before I came to this hermitage. It was all too easy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you say TWO villages?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I killed men...women...every person that breathed. Old, young, male, female...it made no difference.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I did spare the dogs and livestock, though. Haha, who knows? Perhaps they&#39;ll enjoy feasting on their former owners&#39; remains.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Y&#39;know...right, never mind whether that&#39;s true or not.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>You ain&#39;t right in the head, especially for a monk. Not even the monks who took part in the wars would lay their hands on common folk.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Or is that getup just some sort of bad joke?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Heh.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hahahaha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I am now nothing less than Purgatorio itself!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I have no mercy for the living, and have lost any interest in pursuing ascetic practices in order to improve my Soujutsu. Every fiber of this body, every drop of its blood, has become one with the Curse of Annihilation!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s enough. Just shut up, Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Houzouin Inshun is already gone. You don&#39;t get to use his body anymore. You don&#39;t get to spew those vile words in his voice anymore.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Oho. At last, you&#39;re using my Cursed Name!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>But what you say rings true, for I am no longer human nor monk. Now that I am a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, I have no need of this body&#39;s former name.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>All I want is your lives. Nothing more.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did this happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...I know not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did they do something to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...I know not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Can you go back to being the old Inshun again?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...No, I cannot.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Musashi is correct; Houzouin Inshun is dead. All that remains here is his body, a puppet animated by karma.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>The only way to stop me is to kill me! To destroy me! To leave not a speck of me behind! Leave but an arm, a finger, and I shall return to slay all living things!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Hmph, big talk.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi, will you help me again?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Sure thing. Make sure you back me up, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We have just one opponent: a monster wearing Houzouin Inshun&#39;s skin! There may not be any money or fame to be gained from this duel...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll hold anything back. I won&#39;t sheathe my blades until he&#39;s good and dead!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Usually I try to take it as easy as I can. Duels are such a hassle that I try to avoid them as much as possible...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But in this case, there&#39;s clearly no other option.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not only is our opponent incredibly strong, he&#39;s also a monster out to kill us, one who doesn&#39;t bat an eye at having his head cut clean off, no less.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So all right. I give in. If it&#39;s a fight he wants, it&#39;s a fight he&#39;ll get!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If he means to risk his life by standing before me, I&#39;ll do everything in my power to cut down the monstrosity wearing his skin!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grandpa! I&#39;m going to borrow this sword you made!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I can feel it tingling with a divine aura! I knew it. This sword is on a whole other level! )</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Wait. Stop! Trust me, leave that one alone! It&#39;s one of my worst failures!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>It&#39;ll cut through stone, armor, even diamond effortlessly. But you can&#39;t use it on people!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I admit, in some ways it&#39;s some of my best work! But it&#39;s too terrible to use on any decent folk!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I fear I went overboard,and pushed it into the realm of demons!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a twisted thing that I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to get rid of!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Really? You don&#39;t say...In that case,I&#39;d say that just makes it better for this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m a flesh-and-blood person going up against a monster. I have to get a little reckless if I&#39;m gonna beat him.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Hah! It matters not what manner of weapon you may have procured. No blade exists that can slay the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Care to find out for yourself, Musashi?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>My body will regenerate from any wound, as many times as it needs! Will you still attempt to cut it down with your Niten Ichiryu!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course. Truth be told...I&#39;ve been waiting for this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I do usually try to avoid fighting when there&#39;s nothing in it for me, but only when it comes to fighting for fun. If there&#39;s some real purpose behind the fight, well, that&#39;s another matter.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Why do I train? Why do I wield a blade? Why do I slice, or sever, or at times stop in my tracks?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s all to reach the apex of mastery. I could never hope to reach the void alone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I wanted to fight you. A no-holds-barred battle between two experienced swordsmen is a treasure that outshines even gold.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I shall gain more knowledge from this duel than I would from a thousand meditations, or ten thousand battles.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...My only regret is that my opponent is no longer human. That the great Houzouin, with his incredible divine aura, has fallen to darkness!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You may still be a foe I could not hope to surpass,but that is also where the key to my victory lies!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Face me, monster! I shall use my Fifth Force to smash your spear to splinters!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s the spirit! Very well then! In the name of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, we shall do battle!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(This feels like that thing Lady Kannon does, but it&#39;s also different somehow! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is like powerful magecraft!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It almost feels like a Reality Marble!</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Come forth, my blood-soaked frontier! This mound of bodies and river of blood shall serve as the stage, and consume the loser&#39;s soul upon their defeat!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>My blade&#39;s Cursed Name is Lancer of Purgatorio! My vessel&#39;s True Name: Houzouin Inshun!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Prepare yourself, Shinmen Musashi! Our final battle is upon us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I was sure I felt this katana cut through something...sever it, as smoothly as if it had cut the shadow of the moon reflected in a pool of water.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was not a heart, nor a soul. It was something nebulous, yet still essential for the world of humans.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...It was fate. This katana cut through something like fate itself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Still, I didn&#39;t want to defeat him. I didn&#39;t want to fight him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This was neither the place, nor the manner,in which I wanted to duel Houzouin Inshun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I had fallen in love with his Soujutsu at first sight. It was but a fleeting moment, but I still saw the purest representation of a warrior&#39;s spirit within it; enough to nearly bring me to tears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Lord Inshun&#39;s Soujutsu was the culmination of endless refinement. It was the technique of one who sought and reached a different destination than I.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, I would have no hope of defeating him. But, that Soujutsu was already gone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His beautiful form had been covered up beyond all hope of recognition. As such, I now had any number of ways with which to claim victory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...What a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No monstrous strength, no immortal body could ever surpass the pristine beauty of that spear.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...Well done. Truly, well done.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I attempted to pierce you with my spear&#39;s essence,but it seems you too wield free-flowing techniques.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Or perhaps...Had you already come up with a strategy to defeat me, after we had crossed blades but once?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Did you already have a plan for how to evade my Soujutsu? For how you could kill me?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......Not exactly.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s true, in my mind&#39;s eye I faced you in a no-holds-barred duel over and over, and thought about what I could do to defeat you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Out of the thirty-two duels I imagined,I died in thirty-one of them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You were strong, without a doubt. But I could still see a way to win. All I had to do was choose it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The will of the heavens. The laws of this world. Fujimaru&#39;s help.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And the final decisive factor: this sword you laughed off as worthless.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>Khh...A final trump card, eh. That sword is most impressive.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>I never thought there would be a blade that could reach my Spirit Core in the ether.</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>So, my body truly was nothing but a dead vessel...Hmm...</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>This experience has been invaluable. I am fortunate to have fought you at your most serious.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>What are you doing, woman? That thing is still moving.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Remember what he said earlier? If you leave even one finger moving, he won&#39;t hesitate to cut you down.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Kill him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I already have.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Oh?</p><p><strong>Lancer of Purgatorio:</strong></p><p>...You have my thanks, Lady Musashi. Farewell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Inshun...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to find out how this happened.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Yeah, we do.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Farewell for good this time, Lord Inshun. I swear that someday I will reach the same heights you did.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Until then, I hope you can rest in peace. In one hell or another, we shall continue this someday...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, this feels like morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Remember how it got dark during the day?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe enough time passed that it&#39;s morning now?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What a weird feeling. Also, someone in one of the worlds I visited said that sleeping during the day and being awake at night was terrible for your skin!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m hoping you can lend us a place to sleep so we can get some rest. But first, I really need to stuff my belly.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve never heard anyone&#39;s gut growl so loud before. How many days have you gone without food, anyway?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Well, all right. I confess, that was fairly impressive.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>The least I can do is feed you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hooray! I was hoping you would agree, but this is even better than I could&#39;ve wished for! I&#39;m so grateful!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But before that, I have to ask you about this katana! It really DOES cut through anything!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s so light, too. No, that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s real hefty and substantial, but it feels as light as a feather when you swing it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Um, you ARE Onui and Tasuke&#39;s grandpa, right? This katana is amazing. I can&#39;t believe how good it feels in my hand.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I usually don&#39;t like to carry around more than four katana, but I could easily make an exception for this!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Good grief. One minute you&#39;re all weepy-eyed, the next you&#39;re laughing and smiling. Makes my head spin.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Go on then, take it. It&#39;s all yours.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I needed to thank you for bringing Onui and Tasuke back anyway. If you&#39;re happy with a katana no one else can use, that sure makes things easy on me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh? You&#39;re really giving this to me?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Ears, open. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Like I said earlier, that thing&#39;s a failure. An evil blade that ended up reaching the demonic realm.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>The ultimate blade I seek isn&#39;t one that cuts flesh and bone.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Any sharp, metal thing can do that. An axe or knife works just as well as a sword.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>A person who dedicates their life to the forge shouldn&#39;t be satisfied with something like that.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>The sort of katana I seek is one that can terminate enmity...One that severs bonds, certainty, karma.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>After all, if I couldn&#39;t make a katana like that, what right would I have to call myself a swordsmith?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A sword that severs bonds, certainty, and karma...Now I see. That&#39;s what freed Lord Inshun from his karma.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now that I think of it, he and those shadowy people even said something to that effect.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well then, it&#39;s no coincidence this sword helped me defeat him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You may think it&#39;s a failure, but it succeeded at cutting the karma of someone who had been taken by the Curse of Annihilation, or whatever they called it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, I definitely couldn&#39;t have beaten him all on my own! It was thanks to this sword!</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Huh. So victory was all thanks to that katana, you say? Then maybe you get it.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Never you mind what I said earlier. Not only will I feed you, I&#39;ll give you a place to sleep.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Go get some shut-eye once you&#39;ve eaten up. You too, kid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (This guy&#39;s a lot nicer than he lets on. )</p><hr><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>That said, doesn&#39;t change that the sword&#39;s a failure. You can&#39;t cut bonds or certainty with a katana alone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, this one still seemed to work for karma. Don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>I suppose it did. Guess it just goes to show how good its wielder was.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Damn straight. So, does this katana have a name?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Tch. If I had to choose one,I&#39;d call it Myoujingiri Muramasa.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Myoujingiri...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Muramasa?</p><hr><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>\u201CMyoujingiri\u201D means it can cut things that are beyond human. Means it&#39;s a god cutter!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Muramasa...</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Yeah?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Muramasa?</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>Yeah. What?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then, you wouldn&#39;t happen to be...</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>...Tch.</p><p><strong>Masculine Youth:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Name&#39;s Senji Muramasa, a Saber. A Servant, just like that monk from earlier.</p><h2 id="section-4-seconda-cantica-inferno-beginning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-seconda-cantica-inferno-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Seconda Cantica: Inferno (Beginning)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I can hear the hawk again this morning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Here in Mt.

It seems I&#39;ve lived to see another sunrise.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I ponder death every time I drift off to sleep.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Will this be the last time I open my eyes? Will I ever see anything again?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Go ahead, laugh if it is funny to you. It certainly is to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I mean, I&#39;m Musashi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>THE Shinmen Musashi. I first killed when I was but eleven. I&#39;ve defeated many other swordsmen in duels, and I&#39;ve also wielded my blades in war.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t use the word \u201Ccountless,\u201D but I will say I&#39;ve killed a fair number of men in my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So many that even I can&#39;t count them any longer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If I&#39;m being perfectly honest, I stopped counting after the tenth one or so.

(Cough, hack)...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ugh, curse this body. Why must it trouble me with a coughing fit now? What a perverse joke it would be for the last of my strength to allow me only to laugh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I suppose, though, that such would be a fitting end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have cut down many men,and cast them aside just as quickly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I sought neither to mend others&#39; lives, nor to spare them. If anything, I paid them not heed at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My strategies were all crafted with the intent to kill. What would be the point of letting my emotions get in the way of that!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I kill without pity. I kill without remorse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I kill without sorrow. I kill without anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is who I am. I am Shinmen Musashi, founder of the Niten Ichiryu.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An old swordsman who has spent his entire life killing with all the calm of a smooth pond&#39;s surface, absent so much as a single ripple.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>A swordsman, huh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Come to think of it, can I still hold a sword? Can these old hands still grasp a hilt?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I think that they can, but let&#39;s see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I thought I might have a chance to find out at Shimabara last year, but that rebellion ended without me so much as touching a sword.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A great shame, now that I think about it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Perhaps I should have fought on the Christians&#39; side, rather than following orders from Kokura&#39;s commanders?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Had I done that, I would have had a chance to wield swords again. I could have made use of my blades.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I could even have ended my own life, rather than tarrying around, hoping for fate to catch up to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...No. I couldn&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have none of the fire and passion that the Christians at Shimabara possessed. It is beyond me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My strategies have no need of emotions, vengeance, regret.

Muramasa. Heard the name before, Onui? The bane of Tokugawa?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Muramasa is a legendary swordsmith from Kuwana, in Ise Province. He&#39;s famous for forging cursed katanas that have wreaked devastation on the Tokugawa family.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s said to have forged the katana that slew Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather, the one used to assist Ieyasu&#39;s eldest son, Nobuyasu, in performing seppuku, and even a shoto that injured Ieyasu himself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Basically, any sword bearing the name Muramasa is feared far and wide for the threat it poses to the Tokugawa family!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Legendary katana...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The name \u201CMuramasa\u201D DOES sound kind of familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Specifically, they refer to katana that have been forged by the Muramasa school of swordsmithing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Since you call yourself Senji Muramasa, you must be a disciple of that school...Or maybe even its founder.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Founder?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yup. Is that the case, Grandpa?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...That was a good meal. If it means I still get to enjoy the taste of rice, miso soup, and pickled vegetables even after I die, I guess this Heroic Spirit nonsense ain&#39;t too bad after all.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, I know it don&#39;t do diddly squat to nourish this body, but hell if I care. Long as I look human, I&#39;ll keep right on eating.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Onui, I know you&#39;re excited to have Musashi here, but make sure to eat your breakfast. Don&#39;t just spend the whole meal feeding Tasuke his rice porridge.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay.... (Chew chew)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m already done myself. That was delicious, Onui! Sorry I spent the whole meal going on!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...(Gulp) Don&#39;t be! Grandpa practically never talks about himself...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>It was great to hear some of your stories. They were really fun, too! Can you tell me another one?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sure, after you finish your own breakfast. In the meantime, I want to talk to your grandpa.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I always go to my smithy after I eat. If you want to tag along, I won&#39;t stop you. Ah, you&#39;re all finished up too, huh, kid?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you for feeding us.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You come with us then. Onui, make sure you chew your food properly.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I will.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, hmm. So this is the forge of a legendary swordsmith, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Swords that can kill immortal monsters are made here every day, so there must be something special about it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s just a smithy. I suppose there may be a couple special bits here and there.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>After all, I&#39;m a Servant. I ain&#39;t got the least notion of whether this idea even belonged to the original Muramasa or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The original Muramasa?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just a swordsmith. I never did nothin&#39;to make me worthy of becoming a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well, I will say that my smithing skills are on par with the gods. But the problem is my accomplishments.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I never slew a hundred men,never saved a nation, yadda yadda.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So I never quite made the cut for getting a Spirit Origin worthy of being a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That I somehow ended up in some damn situation where some fool needed my help anyway must mean the gods saw fit to give me a chance.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>This body, this mind, even his fated path must have been similar to Muramasa&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>This me might be someone who lived a similar life, who lost his name.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Maybe he&#39;s a smith associated with the Muramasa school, hell maybe he&#39;s one of my descendants or somethin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You think the two of you were so similar, huh? Well, we know for sure that your katana are the real deal!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Long as you&#39;re clear on that, that&#39;s all that matters.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That said, I still don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m a damned Saber. I make swords, not use &#39;em! I ain&#39;t no Saber!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Ugh, what a damn pain. If I&#39;m a Saber, then why&#39;d I end up here in this workshop with these skills? Don&#39;t make a lick of sense!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder if this is a magecraft workshop then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s acting as a kind of barrier?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s just a smithy. A place for a smith to swing his hammer. Even if it does have something extra stuck to it, at base that&#39;s all it is.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>At any rate, my name is Muramasa. Senji Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m a Rogue Servant, with no summoner. I&#39;m sure you know what that means, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hang on. If you don&#39;t have a summoner,doesn&#39;t that make you just like Lord Inshun?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. Just so we&#39;re clear, I got nothin&#39; to do with that group of monsters. Not a damn thing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I was called here by the gods, not humans. That much, I&#39;m sure about.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>When I first came to about a month or so ago,I was already here in Shimousa, all alone.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And no sooner had I woken up than I saw a group of those dark spirit creatures not far off. I take it you&#39;ve seen them by now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe they&#39;re dark warrior spirits or something?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I have heard things like that have been showing up as of late. Back in my time, ghosts were more of a regular occurrence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe they&#39;re dark ghosts or something?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Attaboy /\u2640 Attagirl]. Got it in one.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I materialized during the day, in the middle of a rice field not too far from here. There were a number of people out working in the field when I got there...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...but those creatures had already killed about half of them. Including Onui and Tasuke&#39;s parents.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>One thing led to another, and I wound up looking after them. Call it the fickle whim of an old man.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So that&#39;s how you ended up here. I thought you&#39;d been living here for years now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hardly. I&#39;m just another visitor. We Heroic Spirits are still technically dead; I ain&#39;t about to get hip deep into other folk&#39;s problems.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I see...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I just thought you&#39;d been here a long time because you get along so well with Onui and Tasuke, and you seem like you&#39;re very at home.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That goes for this smithy too. It feels like it&#39;s a part of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I agree.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You think so too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You definitely seem right at home here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>See? Fujimaru thinks so too.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I took over this hermitage from the people in the village west of here. They told me another blacksmith used to live here long ago.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I used a hoe and a spade to fix this place up as best I could.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But then it went and got destroyed in a single night, like some sort of sick joke. This sort of thing shouldn&#39;t be happening now that the age of war is over.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Are there any other villages around here?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Some. You can find a few just a bit south of here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Guess I&#39;d better have someone come give the poor saps from the northern and western villages a proper burial.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Anyway, let&#39;s get back to it while the little ones are still eating. No reason for them to hear about this sorta stuff.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>First of all, those shadow creatures.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You two still got yourselves set on facing off against whatever&#39;s causing all the trouble here in Shimousa?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hmph. Good answer, but only if you mean it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just you wait. We WILL get to the bottom of this.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>There you go, kid. Go for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In that case, I need to tell you about those dark creatures. About who you&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>First of all, I&#39;ve heard those things started appearing in Shimousa right around the time I materialized here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So, a month ago?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Clean the wax outta your ears, girl. I said two months ago.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, uh, right. Of course. It&#39;s just, you were kind of unclear when you mentioned that before, so...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Sorry, guess my memory&#39;s starting to go. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I might look young, but I sure don&#39;t feel young. Even though I&#39;ve materialized in the real world, it feels like I&#39;m in some sort of dream.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...(He doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s lying...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Lord Muramasa might have been like this when he was alive, or maybe he&#39;s bewitched or something...Either way, I guess it&#39;s too soon to say for sure. )</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now, where was I...Oh yeah, the creatures.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think Onui said they don&#39;t come to villages?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now I see.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I can understand why she&#39;d think that. Not quite right, though. They avoid the temples and shrines, not villages.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So they avoid places of worship, huh...How well-mannered of them. Though I guess that makes sense when you think about it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That don&#39;t apply to their bosses, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bosses?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Like that monk you two faced off against.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What was it they called themselves...The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters? Bull. There&#39;s no need for swordmasters in a peaceful world, and they&#39;ve got no business calling themselves heroic nothin&#39;.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Attaboy /\u2640 Attagirl]. Got it in one.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No way. You knew about them, Grandpa?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Only stories about how they&#39;re the ones behind those dark creatures. Heard a few rumors about them walking around with those things at their beck and call.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Heard there&#39;s more than one of &#39;em, too,not counting the one you killed last night.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yes, that&#39;s right. Six others.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I see...So there&#39;s even more than I thought now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>More?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Not long after the creatures first showed up, peddlers were full to bursting with rumors of them, and soon enough just about everyone had heard about the new threat.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>They said a suspicious-looking man was practicing dark Jesuit sorcery on the grounds of Katori Shrine.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That his mysticism turned day to night in an instant, and six powerful knights clawed their way up from the depths of hell to serve him.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>These knights are called the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and they are monsters hell-bent on laying waste to the world of man...or so the rumors go.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Sounded like a buncha hogwash to me. At first, anyway. Now I get that they&#39;re real, and wreaking havoc and destruction in all manner of places.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve even heard that they razed the Hitachi Province so completely that nobody can bear to look at it now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s the province north of Shimousa. What exactly did they do to Hitachi?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m told they burned everything there to the ground.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew I&#39;d have to do something about them!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I figured you&#39;d say that. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be right there with you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t make you fight this battle alone. Besides, I still have to make good on my promise to pay Lord Inshun back with interest.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I&#39;ll do that by finding a way to resolve this crisis threatening Shimousa! It&#39;s the best parting gift I can offer to everyone they&#39;ve killed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But, we still don&#39;t have enough info to act on!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re being more levelheaded about this than I thought you would be. It&#39;s true; you can never have too much information before going to battle.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course, that was one more thing that made Lord Inshun so impressive; his ability to fight even without knowing who he was up against...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, in our case, we need to find out as much as we can ahead of time. Both about the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and about these monsters wandering around Shimosa.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Hmph. I can see you&#39;re more than ready to face whatever dangers lie ahead of you.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In that case, you should pay a visit to the town. There&#39;s a lot more people there than there are in any backwater around here, so you might be able to learn something useful from one of them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Town? You mean...?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The town outside Toke Castle. I remembered it being abandoned in Kazusa...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...but here, it looks like it&#39;s part of the lord of Shimousa&#39;s domain. Odd, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right? I KNEW there was something strange about that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This place may be a Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe someone used a Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The Holy Grail, huh. I&#39;d probably get in trouble if I filled it with udon, wouldn&#39;t I...I mean, uh, nothing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Strange as it is that Toke Castle is intact and nearby...it does sound like its town is worth visiting!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>A cas-tle, a cas-tle\u266AWe get to go to Toke Castle town\u266A</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, a cas-tle, a cas-tle\u266AI can&#39;t wait\u266A</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehe, I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re enjoying yourself, Onui. You&#39;ve been to Toke Castle town before; what&#39;s it like?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Well, there&#39;s lots and lots of people there. Way, way more than in the village!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I see. Lots of people, huh!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Lots!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Er, we&#39;re bringing Onui and Tasuke with us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grandpa Muramasa told us to take them,so it should be okay. I think.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And they&#39;re both clearly excited about going there...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, given everything that happened, I imagine he wanted them far away for a while, so he could see to the villagers without the kids having to see.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Admittedly, I&#39;m kinda worried about running into more monsters, though...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm. Still, we should get there well before nighttime, and he did say those dark clouds don&#39;t usually show up during the day.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I think we can take him at his word.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, the more the merrier when it comes to traveling! Two is better than one, and four is better than two!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I think so too!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo. Ga!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Also, I&#39;ve got the Myoujingiri Muramasa now. Even if one or two Heroic Spirit Swordmasters do show up...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I know I can cut them clean in two with this sword. That might even be enough to pay Lord Inshun back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, just look around! The sun is shining, it&#39;s a beautiful day, and\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like the look of that sky...</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Huh? The sky&#39;s gone pitch-black...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Waaah! Sorrysorrysorry! I should&#39;ve kept my big mouth shut! I went and jinxed us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still! The nerve of these clouds! Didn&#39;t anyone ever teach them any manners!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, I guess they&#39;re clouds,so who&#39;d even teach them manners anyway?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Aah! Bandits! And so many of them! They must&#39;ve come out now that it&#39;s dark!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess the fact that so many of these things keep cropping up just goes to show there&#39;s something really wrong happening here in Shimosa.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Either way, now that they&#39;ve shown up again,I&#39;m not about to go easy on them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We&#39;re heading to Toke Castle, whether these things like it or not! If they want to try and stop us...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...then they don&#39;t get to complain as I cut my way through them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, the sky&#39;s all back to normal now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I guess we got off easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess the Heroic Spirit Swordmastersonly appear during bloodmoons?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks that way. Too bad; I would&#39;ve liked to take another one of them down.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We should probably be grateful that&#39;s all there was to it this time. I&#39;d rather keep the life-and-death battles to a minimum, especially with Onui and Tasuke around.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s just be glad we all made it through without a scratch.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now come on. Toke Castle town awaits!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yay!

That I would one day meet the person of my dreams, destined to sweep me off my feet and away from the castle!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AElegant Princess:</strong></p><p>And now, I&#39;ve finally met you!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AElegant Princess:</strong></p><p>I love you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Um...what?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Huh!? What do you think you&#39;re doing, saying something like that in the middle of the street!?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>H-huh?</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>L-Lady Kiyohime! You mustn&#39;t leave the castle,let alone go around saying things like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lady Kiyohime?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She ran away from the castle?</p><hr><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>D-damn it, I shouldn&#39;t have said that either,but yes, she did! Don&#39;t you know who she is!?</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>This is Lady Kiyohime, the daughter of Lord Matsudaira Shimousa-no-Kami himself! Ordinarily I would have you prostrate yourself to apologize, but that would draw too much attention. Consider yourself lucky!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I am delighted to make your acquaintance,person of my dreams. I am Kiyohime.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Lady Kiyohime!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re a real princess!?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Huh? You&#39;re a princess? Really?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re not the Kiyohime from Chaldea at all!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sh-she&#39;s a lot like Chaldea&#39;s Kiyohime...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Please stop getting in my way! I may be princess of the Matsudaira clan, but I&#39;m a woman first and foremost!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve been searching for the person of my dreams for a long time. Now that I&#39;ve finally found you, I implore you. Please, take me away!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Princess, you mustn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Please, person of my dreams! Abduct me, and take me away to Edo! From there, we can go to Osaka, or to Kyoto, or even leave for another land altogether through Nagasaki!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Just a minute there, princess. I don&#39;t care WHOSE daughter you are, you&#39;re not getting in the way of MY business!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s just a LITTLE RUDE for you to try and poach this nice, rich customer from me?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Come now, prin\u2013No, you know what,no way would a princess be out here on the streets.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know which samurai family you hail from,but you can at least wait until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Ulp...! It WOULD look terrible if word got out that the princess was seen here in the streets.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>It could lead to all sorts of trouble for the Matsudaira family...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Wh-wh-wha...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>What is the matter with you, fox woman!? Why must you impede me from being with the person of my dreams!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I have been cooped up in the castle staring at the sky, dreaming of this day for months, YEARS even. Now it&#39;s finally here, and you&#39;re trying to stop it!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Very well then. If that&#39;s how you wish to handle this...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t be able to hold myself back any longer! I mean it, you know...</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>No. Stop. Don&#39;t. Whatever are you going to dooo? Kon kon kon.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Grrr! I-I mean it! I&#39;m really not going to hold myself back!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll have you know that I carry dangerous flammable water, imported from foreign lands, with me at all times. You won&#39;t get away unscathed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Flammable water...Oil...It all fits...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fire, huh...I knew it. Where&#39;s the dragon?</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Hohohohohoho. You have no idea who you&#39;re dealing with, do you? We geisha from Edo deal with fire all the time!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Go ahead, try your little trick! Fire, lightning, it doesn&#39;t matter! Kon kon, I&#39;ll blow out whatever you throw at me with my fan!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>P-Princess, I beg of you, you mustn&#39;t! We&#39;re in the middle of the street!</p><p>But if you truly do mean to go ahead with it, please, at least make sure you&#39;re not wearing flammable clothing!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Are you fighting? Grandpa always says you shouldn&#39;t fight.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, this is turning into a serious pain, huh? So, rich customer-slash-person of her dreams, how do you want to handle this?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Shall we stay out of it, or do something about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh, I guess we don&#39;t have any choice now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to stop them both and help them cool down!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Got it. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll use my swordsman aura to make sure everyone gets out of this without a scratch!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ms. Geisha, please calm down!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Well, I suppose there isn&#39;t much to be gained from prolonging this any further.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Princess, please calm down!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...All right. If you insist.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>It seems I got a bit carried away. I&#39;m very sorry you had to see that.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>A geisha shouldn&#39;t show off her dance moves in the streets, so I think I&#39;ll retire to my establishment.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I hope this hasn&#39;t put you off from visiting me there sometime.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Nnnnnn. What a graceful way to bow out.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I suppose I lost myself, too. I hope this hasn&#39;t soured me in your eyes, person of my dreams.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>As loathe as I am to say so, I will give up for today. However, I am certain that you and I will\u2013</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Come now, princess, this way. We must hurry back to the castle.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>You there, the woman with the katana, and the [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] in strange dress. That was a truly splendid mediation. I am grateful for your assistance.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Now, come along, princess. We really must hurry back.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Yes, yes. Fine. Farewell, person of my dreams! I count the days until we meet again!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sheesh. Thank goodness that&#39;s over with. I never knew you were so prone to lady trouble, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I do wish I could have tried the food at that geisha lady&#39;s place. Guess I&#39;ll just have to give up on that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, let&#39;s ask around a little more and see what else we can find out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad we were able to calm things down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad things didn&#39;t get too out of hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>For sure. Still, it&#39;s kind of strange. You know the saying \u201CFights and fires are Edo&#39;s flowers\u201D?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now that things are peaceful in Japan, I would have thought something out of the ordinary like that brawl would have drawn a lot of attention...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...but it seems like nobody really noticed. They all just kept going about their business.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Indeed.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>No matter the time or place, people never change. Hah. Change simply doesn&#39;t come that easily.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Onlookers, curious bystanders, New York rubberneckers...No matter what you call them, you can be sure they&#39;ll show up to make trouble whenever there&#39;s a disturbance.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Even if not everything they see...is necessarily real.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMan in Western Clothing:</strong></p><p>...Are you talking to me?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMan in Western Clothing:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just a missionary. A Christian visiting from foreign lands.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>O-oh my gosh. Your hair is so white! You&#39;re very tall, too. Are you a tengu?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMan in Western Clothing:</strong></p><p>A tengu? That is a sort of demon here in the East, yes? No matter. Call me whatever you like.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s an awfully roundabout way of putting things,Mr. Foreigner. It&#39;s pretty strange for someone like you to be in Edo right now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At this point in time, the only foreigners permitted to stay in Japan were restricted to Dejima in Nagasaki.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Oh, that? A trivial matter. It&#39;s the same reason no one paid attention to that tussle.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Sometimes, one happens to see perfect strangers who bear strong resemblance to an acquaintance; other times, one may see something out of the ordinary, and brush it off as unworthy of concern.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>In the end, there truly is little difference between the real world and the world of dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Count of Monte Cristo? Is that you?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know who that is. I told you, I&#39;m just a missionary.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Do you know what&#39;s going on here?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>You mean the reason for your little scuffle? Haha, that hardly seems relevant now.</p><hr><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>At any rate.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>You there, young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]. If there is something you wish to confess, then tell me. Just this once, I shall listen to what you have to say.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Confess?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...I am simply encouraging you to share whatever it is you wish to discuss.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>I make no promises to give you answers, but I will lend an ear. Call it Christian hospitality.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, you say?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Purgatorio, Inferno, Limbo, K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell,Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell, Para\xEDso, and Empireo, hmm?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>So, they consider the Empireo and Para\xEDso to be separate things! Indeed, there seems to be too much here for them to just be modeled after Dante.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Whoever came up with these names is either a great fool...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...or an incredibly profane blasphemer.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh? What does that all mean?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry mister, but it&#39;s really hard for me to get what you&#39;re talking about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try that one more time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What ARE you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>There is little I can say. I have no intimate knowledge of the rumors regarding these creatures.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Or at least, I know nothing beyond the rumors currently circulating around town. You have no doubt heard anything I might have to say on the subject.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>All I know for sure is that Shimousa is starting to become twisted.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>For the moment, I advise you to peek in that alleyway. You should see someone you would do well to meet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did he just flourish his cloak and walk away!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> H-hey! You still haven&#39;t told us anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He did say we should peek in that alleyway. Well, let&#39;s take a look.... All I see are a few footpaths and a basin.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hm?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hey, look, behind the basin! Somebody&#39;s there! Huh, it looks like he&#39;s sleeping.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. He&#39;s collapsed in the street! What&#39;s going on? I thought this country was supposed to be peaceful now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then again, maybe he&#39;s got some kind of chronic disease? But, uh, given how young he is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> C-come on, wake up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s help him onto his feet!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, can you hear me? Why were you lying down here?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Oh, Master...it&#39;s you. Thank...goodness...you&#39;re all right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re from Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fuuma Kotarou!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Uh oh, he passed out...Are you all right!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry...for the trouble...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I...came here...to bring you back...Master...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You&#39;ve been sleeping...and you refuse...to wake up...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>None of...the other Servants...made it...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I was...the only one...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to tell me everything at once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Take it easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>No, Master...I must...tell you everything...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Da Vinci...and Holmes...thought it might be...a problem with fated bonds...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t...really understand it myself...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master...you have fallen into a dream...a dream you cannot wake from...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I will...I must...help...you...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He just conked out again. He looks pretty pale, too. Are you sure we shouldn&#39;t take him to a doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctors can&#39;t cure him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He looks like he&#39;s low on magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Magical energy, huh? So, that means he&#39;s a Servant too? And unlike the ones you summon during battles...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...he came here from Chaldea in your world to try and save you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So then, what makes him different from the ones you normally summon? Wait. Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly why.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There shouldn&#39;t be any difference.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You have...been summoning...during battles? Then, perhaps...that means...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...you have been...borrowing...the shadows of...their Spirit Origins...tempo...rarily...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hey, stop that, mister! You shouldn&#39;t be sitting up! Just lie down and stay under the blanket.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo ga!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You have my thanks...Okay, Master...I&#39;ll just rest up...for a little bit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Make sure you get plenty of rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sure to forge a magical energy pathway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Okay...Thank...you...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There you go. It&#39;s okay. Just relax and go to sleep.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Zzz...Zzz...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...(Snore)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s a ninja for you. It took him no time at all to fall asleep. So, he&#39;s THE Fuuma Kotarou, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The fifth head of the Fuuma ninja clan, huh...So close! If only he were a little younger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Haha, I don&#39;t mean that seriously. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s good to appreciate handsome young men whenever you come across one.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, given how exhausted Kotarou is, he must have been prepared to risk his life to make it here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know ninja are expected to lay down their lives in service, but that&#39;s still a lot easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Maybe you&#39;re in a much more precarious state than we thought if he&#39;s had to resort to such extreme measures.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He said he came here in order to bring you back from an endless sleep, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess that means you really did come here in a dream. Well, either that, or I wandered into yours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, the reason I&#39;m seeing so many people I know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is all because of a dream I&#39;m having?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not sure. Based on my own experiences...it might not be JUST a dream...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whenever I cross into another world through a dream,it&#39;s like I&#39;m not actually seeing it with my eyes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s kind of like seeing it directly with my mind, but indistinctly? And since you aren&#39;t seeing it with your eyes, you can make strange connections based on what you see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you tend to hallucinate?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like seeing the faces of people you know on strangers?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All I can say is that that sort of thing is known to happen sometimes. Sorry I can&#39;t be clearer about it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hard to be clear when it comes to dreams. I mean, you usually forget pretty fast after you wake up, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I don&#39;t have many clear memories of mine. Hmm, I wonder if I can remember some.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s all well and good...</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>But why did you end up coming to my room? Yes, I know I invited you to visit me sometime...</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>But I never imagined you&#39;d come barging into my inn and ask to borrow my bed so you could put up a red-haired boy you didn&#39;t have with you before.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I just want to be sure: You didn&#39;t kidnap him, did you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Definitely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Boy, you really helped us out. You, the princess, and that strange foreigner we met are the only people in town whose names we know!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I have to say though, I&#39;m impressed you&#39;re so well-known here that all we had to do was mention your name to get easy directions to your inn.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you&#39;re still staying at an inn after six months,I guess you didn&#39;t outright move here from Edo?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>No, I didn&#39;t. I&#39;m here for pleasure as much as for business. For some reason, I was suddenly overcome with an urge to stay in Shimousa for a\u2013</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Hold it. Don&#39;t try to change the subject.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>So, now it&#39;s you two, the two children,and a red-haired boy...</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re all planning on staying the night here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for putting us up!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahahaha. We didn&#39;t exactly plan on it,but I guess it just worked out that way. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Thank you, pretty lady!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>My, what a sweet, honest girl you are. Have a candy! ...Did you really think it would be that easy?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>The nerve you all have! Inviting yourselves to spend the night with nary a hint of shame!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Well, I suppose I have enough room to spare that it&#39;s not COMPLETELY out of the question. (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Just promise me you&#39;ll leave tomorrow, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll leave as soon as Kotarou is better.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Well, I suppose you can&#39;t help that you&#39;ve got an injured friend to care for now. And fortunately, I&#39;m not hard-pressed for money.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I guess this can just be my good deed for the day. Looks like I&#39;ll be making an extra-large portion of my special set menu tonight.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s right. Purgatorio has vanished.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Please accept my humblest apologies. This unfortunate accident is the result of my ritual being incomplete.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>However, I am pleased to say that as the seventh and final sacrifice, Purgatorio was successful in fulfilling his role.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t give us that nonsense, Caster.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>How could you possibly claim he fulfilled his role? His jumonji spear did not even claim a hundred lives.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>No matter. He shall still serve as an excellent cornerstone for Onriedo.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be so hasty, Empireo. And Limbo, this system is hardly different from the Holy Grail War you told me of.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>The souls of all Heroic Spirit Swordmasters who meet their end shall simply come to reside within the foundations of my Onriedo.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>You are absolutely correct, Lord Sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Nonetheless...Lord Empireo is also correct. It WOULD be to our advantage to have more sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The souls of a few mere Heroic Spirits will not be sufficient for Onriedo to completely manifest.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>And we cannot have that. Thus, the more we kill...the better.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The more we kill, the more it shall grow. Resentment of the killer...Envy of the survivors...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Grief at the thought of losing your own life,and the lives of those you love...Mmm...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The more souls there are drenched in bitterness,envy, and grief, the better it will be for us!</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>That is why we have the Curse of Annihilation. That is why we have the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Ordinary Heroic Spirits will not suffice. Ordinary knights will not suffice.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>But now that they harbor the Curse of Annihilation thanks to my secret technique and your own power, they shall slaughter all living things.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>They shall kill, and kill, and kill, right up until they wear themselves out and die off.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>They shall offer up many, many sacrifices, as they work to finally bring the world of humans to an end.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Hm. I see your taste in d\xE9cor is as grim as your choice in discussion topics. I&#39;ve heard of dark and dingy, but this is something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Naturally. We&#39;re all imbued with masses of pure evil aura writhing around inside us, after all. Tell me,Lord Sorcerer, who is this man?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>You don&#39;t seem to be a Heroic Spirit,and you stink of dirt something fierce.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>And what&#39;s with that long katana of yours? Doesn&#39;t it get in the way when you&#39;re planting rice?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You certainly don&#39;t mince words, do you. You&#39;re also very perceptive.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re right, little oni. I&#39;m just a hermit who lives up in the mountains, subsisting on grass and plants, while you all seem to be nobles and samurai.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Believe me, I know all too well how much I don&#39;t belong here. I feel very out of place.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>You do seem to be fairly skilled, but you are a far cry from us Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. Above all, you still reek of life.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, settle down, everyone. This man is nothing less than the Lord Sorcerer&#39;s handpicked bodyguard.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) Is that so. Oh well, spineless nice guys bore me anyway.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>No need to concern yourselves with my guest. I ran into this vagabond in the mountains of Hitachi and brought him back with me on a whim.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>You all have your own roles to play. While I don&#39;t require protection, I have decided it would be a good idea to keep a meat shield around, just in case.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Yes. I may be a vegetarian, but I&#39;ve still got strong bones and muscles. My body should at least suffice to stop a spear thrust.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) What a joke. Do you really think you could stop the spear of a Heroic Spirit with your body alone?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Peace, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell. Sheathe your claws. Ignore him. Pretend he is not even here.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Now, no more idle chatter. You will set about fulfilling your assignments at once.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Go forth and kill, my Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. As the dawning sun brings an end to the night, you shall bring an end to this world of false peace.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>I shall now prepare for the arrival of Onriedo. The rest is in your hands now.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Understood. It will be my pleasure.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>I see, I see. So the Lord Sorcerer has no interest in Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Regrettably, no. He must believe she poses no threat to us. Hmm, what shall we do about this?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Well, if it were up to me...If we can kill her,I would like to do so and get her out of the way...</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Man, you all sure care a lot about this Musashi lady.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Is she really all that strong?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t know why, but everything about you rubs me the wrong way.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Now that the Lord Sorcerer has gone off on his own, maybe I&#39;ll take this opportunity to squish you like a bug.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Oh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea. It&#39;d be a waste of your precious time to take up your weapon against a hapless hermit like me.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You would be far better off ignoring me. I&#39;d hate to ruin your shiny black hair with my blood.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...Well, all right. In that case, I won&#39;t give you another thought.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Getting back to Musashi; I don&#39;t care about her myself, but it sounds like you&#39;re concerned about her, Caster?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>As I said, if we can kill her, I would like to do so. I may be a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, but at heart I am still a coward.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>If you are willing to entrust me with this matter...I already have a plan in mind.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Are you certain you are up to this, Caster of Limbo? Though he may have only just transformed at the time, she was still able to kill Purgatorio.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>True, it remains to be seen if my newly-formed techniques are up to the task. Let&#39;s see now...Danzo? Are you there?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I am here, my master.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I shall always be by your side, as certain as my name is Katou Danzo. Give me an order to hunt, and I shall see that it is done no matter who they may be.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>If you like, I can ensure that tonight is the last night Shinmen Musashi and the Master of Chaldea draw breath.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Do not bother! You are not a Heroic Spirit. You are merely a puppet, and could never hope to be a match for her. If that was an attempt at humor, it was poor indeed.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>My humblest apolo\u2013</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Heh, no need to torment her like that, Lord Empireo. Even mechanical dolls have their uses. Come, Danzo. I have new orders for you.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Fetch the Archer of Inferno,and set her upon Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, my Master. Order input confirmed. It shall be done.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Oh, and there is one more important thing I should tell you. Very soon, a group of samurai from the Edo shogunate will arrive at Toke.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Once that happens, be sure to stay close to them. Tell them you are on a secret mission from the shogunate.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I shall see that everything is in place myself. Once that is done, you shall bring Lady Inferno and Lady Musashi together...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...and bear witness to everything that happens next.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Understood.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...? (How strange. That girl didn&#39;t have a heartbeat. )</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>...Hmph. Of all the times to play with dolls.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It is no idle playtime, I assure you. Soon, you shall see the results for yourself.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>At any rate, death shall soon spread over these lands. After all, Lady Inferno&#39;s fire proves to be too hot even for me...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...It happened late at night.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>For some reason, I was already awake. I don&#39;t think it was because I heard anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>All I know is that I saw fire flickering before my eyes right before I opened them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>They were the reddest flames I had ever seen...almost ugly in their transience.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Did I wake you? Sorry about that. But it&#39;s probably good you&#39;re up, &#39;cause it looks like it&#39;s our turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Our turn?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, you don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s get out of here. Make sure not to wake up Onui or Tasuke. We should let Kotarou sleep, too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s not involve the nice geisha putting us up either. We handle this alone, just you and me. Okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course. Let&#39;s sneak out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. Okay, easy does it. Try not to make a sound.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And here I thought these things didn&#39;t show up in towns. If they&#39;ve come all this way...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...that must mean they came here looking for us. And I don&#39;t think they&#39;re just trying to keep us from getting a good night&#39;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m betting you&#39;re all here to get revenge for the one we killed. Am I wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess these monsters don&#39;t have much to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like they&#39;re not much for conversation.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nope. I&#39;m starting to think of them more like weeds that keep popping up no matter how many times you pluck them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Or like those little bugs that show up around watering holes on really hot days. At least these monsters don&#39;t show up indoors.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, not much choice in the matter. We gotta deal with them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Since everyone else in town is fast asleep, let&#39;s take them out as quickly as possible so we can catch a few winks ourselves.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I was hoping that would be the end of it...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...but I guess that was too much to ask for. Hey, c&#39;mon out and show yourself! I already know you led those spirits here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve heard that Servants have a unique aura about them, but I doubt that&#39;s what I&#39;m picking up from you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You still stink of villainy just like before! Except now it&#39;s a stench of burning scum instead of blood.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Either way, you should have the decency not to go out in public smelling that horrible!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you gotta smell like something burning,how about you try incense?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Is that really how I smell to you?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>What a strange creature you are, Shinmen Musashi. I&#39;d never have thought to look for advice from someone I was about to kill.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Very well then. Thank you for your suggestion.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I shall take that into consideration, and attempt to light incense whenever I go out from now on.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Especially when I have slaughtered people in droves.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh, you&#39;re quite pretty. What a waste.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Thank you.... My Cursed Name is the Archer of Inferno.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I must thank you for all your help the other day. Have you been keeping well since then? I&#39;ve come here today to slaughter you all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Good day, and goodbye.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heroic Spirit Swordmaster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What is it you all want?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Huh? Where did that come from?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Well, speaking for myself, I would say I want to burn all things. Lives. People. Sworn enemies.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Burning things is what I do. I only love killing. People. Japan. Everything to do with Tokugawa society.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I shall burn, and burn, and burn, until there is nothing left. I cannot speak for the others...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...but all that matters to me is scorching this land until nothing at all remains.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Burning...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Burning.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>After all, I loathe this world. I hate it so much I can barely stand it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>The Lord Sorcerer said that this world was hell. In which case...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I shall provide the flames, using my body as kindling and my skills as flint.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Tell me, are there any truly good people in this world? Is there anyone you care for with all your heart?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Children, perhaps? Or relatives? Might there be one or two like that somewhere out there?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Good question. Let&#39;s say there were one or two people like that right here. What would you do then?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Oh, well...if there were...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Burning.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Yes, that would be lovely! I could show you their charred and blackened bodies after they had been roasted alive!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Hope, feelings, bonds...My flames shall burn them all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fire!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If that fire starts spreading here, then!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know. And I don&#39;t see a peaceful solution to this. We&#39;ll just have to settle things the old-fashioned way!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If she wants to fight us with fire,I&#39;ll just have to extinguish it!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Fine with me. See for yourself whether my flames will go out.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>As long as this world is hell...As long as humans make this world hell...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>My flames shall never go out! My hatred shall consume you, and everything else, with its fiery blaze!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She keeps firing at us from so far away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t get close enough to hit her!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(She&#39;s ridiculously strong, too! I can only imagine beating her in one out of ten scenarios! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Well, guess that&#39;s better than with Lord Inshun. I had to imagine thirty scenarios to figure out how to beat him. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, it&#39;s tough going up against an archer when all you&#39;ve got is katana! Especially one as skilled as she is!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sometimes she&#39;ll wreathe her arms in fire and try to punch me, but she mainly sticks to keeping her distance. It just isn&#39;t fair!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Save your whining for after I actually manage to hit you. It&#39;s so aggravating how you keep deflecting my arrows at the last instant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thanks! That&#39;s what my Niten Ichiryu is all about; snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, even if I&#39;m outnumbered or outmatched!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Still, it&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You haven&#39;t used a weird barrier on me like Purgatorio did. Are you holding back or something?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m impressed you realized. While I could easily kill many if I were to unleash my flame more freely...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...I have been told I must not do that, so I am indeed holding back. Forgive me, Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Ahh, how could I be so foolish...I was so eager to get started that I wasn&#39;t thinking straight.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I must use all of my power to set a fire to you, and I desire that greatly. Yet that is not my purpose.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t kill you here. I can&#39;t burn you alive just yet.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...(Sigh) If only I&#39;d done as I was told.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Now I&#39;ve even gone and forgotten the message I was supposed to give you. I just can&#39;t seem to keep my thoughts ordered...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, what&#39;s the matter? You sound like you&#39;re about to turn tail and run away.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Indeed, that&#39;s just what I&#39;ll do. The next time we meet, I will be sure to burn you down to your marrow.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>But I must take my leave, Shinmen Musashi. Farewell to you too, O precious Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s gone!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She&#39;s completely vanished. Strange.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe it was an NP or some kind of skill?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I wonder if it was some kind of sorcery. It definitely didn&#39;t seem like she was physically running away.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Phew. At least it&#39;s over for now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d hoped to take her down and cut their number from six to five, but I&#39;m afraid it didn&#39;t work out that way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And since we don&#39;t know where she ran off to,I guess this is as far as our duel goes tonight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We still need to keep our guard up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We should also rest up while we can.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. The next time we meet,I&#39;ll make sure to finish the job.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...I&#39;ll need a way to defend against her flames. I sure can&#39;t just power through them. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You know, I&#39;m so used to dealing with stuff all on my own, I keep forgetting we can put our heads together! Fujimaru, make sure you think of a way I can avoid getting burned!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In the meantime, let&#39;s head back to Otama&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The most important thing for us now is to get some sleep while we still can. You can&#39;t defeat demons if you&#39;re too tired to fight, after all.</p><h2 id="section-6-seconda-cantica-inferno-ending" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-seconda-cantica-inferno-ending" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Seconda Cantica: Inferno (Ending)</h2><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lady Inferno!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lady Inferno! Please, wait for me! Where are you going!?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Do you mean to go to the southern edge of Shimousa!? If you continue in this direction, you&#39;ll pass through Kazusa and end up in the ocean!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Oh, how foolish of me. I didn&#39;t realize I was running as fast as I could.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Apologies, Lady Danzo. Please forgive me. I promise I wasn&#39;t trying to leave you behind.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Not at all, my lady. Please, do not concern yourself with me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I can easily keep pace with the fastest steed. But I worry you were running too fast, Lady Inferno.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Anyone but me would have fallen behind long ago. Please, do try to restrain yourself.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>You are one of the rare Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. You must not exhaust your Spirit Origin so carelessly.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Furthermore, I need not remind you that your temperament is fire. Again, do please try to restrain yourself.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>No need to remind me. I know that very well. I shall be sure not to bring shame to the name of Inferno.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Do not worry about me. My fire is\u2013</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Hmm, what is that floating over there? Why, it looks like fire, and not my fire...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>It is a lantern. It must belong to villagers living nearby.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(...What a terrible stroke of luck for these people. Inferno loathes everyone, and these people are directly in her path. )</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(But, I suppose it shall all be over soon, at least. )</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Well that simply will not do. Do they not realize it&#39;s dangerous to be out this late at night?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...What was that, my lady?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>No one should be out and about at this late hour. Especially not here in Shimousa, where monsters roam free.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand, Lady Inferno.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Oh, the lantern is coming this way. We must greet whoever&#39;s carrying it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Hello there. Where are you two off to so late this evening?</p><p><strong>Elder Village Man:</strong></p><p>Oh, hello. I could ask the same of you. It&#39;s so dark I can&#39;t see you very well, but you sound like a young woman of good breeding.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Man:</strong></p><p>Are you perhaps the daughter of a samurai? You&#39;re so kind to concern yourself with a couple of shriveled up old prunes like us, but don&#39;t worry, our house is just ahead.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>There was a meeting in the village tonight, and grandfather here had a little too much to drink, so we&#39;re only just getting home now.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Go on, my lady, tell him he&#39;s too old to drink like he did when he was young.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Now I see. Hehe, she&#39;s right, sir. You shouldn&#39;t go making trouble for this lovely lady.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Oh my...Me, a lady? I&#39;m just an old crone, but that&#39;s very kind of you...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m told that there are many monsters prowling about at night these days. It&#39;s dangerous to be out right now.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>So make sure you don&#39;t go out again tonight once you get home. Is that clear?</p><p><strong>Elder Village Man:</strong></p><p>Well, if the daughter of a noble samurai says we should go home and stay put, I guess we&#39;d better do just that.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right, dear. You know we&#39;re too poor to be out drinking at dinnertime.... By the way, my lady, I can&#39;t help but notice you and your companion are all alone.</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Are you lost? Do you have a room for the night? Perhaps at an inn somewhere?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>No, we don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>Well, if you have nowhere else to go, you are very welcome to stay with us in our humble home.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>No, thank you. I am grateful for your kindness,truly, but I am afraid we still have much to do.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>As such, we cannot afford to sleep just yet. Have a lovely evening, you two. Oh, and...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...a good couple should make sure to get along every day, okay?</p><p><strong>Elder Village Woman:</strong></p><p>How right you are. Thank you again, and do be careful.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(First she had an amicable conversation with them, and now she&#39;s seeing them off...Is the Curse of Annihilation no longer having an effect on her? )</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Lady Danzo, let me ask you something.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Of course, my lady.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Am I correct in presuming that there is a village in the direction that old couple came from?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, my lady. It matches the location on my map data. It appears to be a fairly large village for this area.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I see.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>In that case, Lady Danzo, Shinmen Musashi can wait. I shall massacre this village.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Since the village just held a meeting,there may yet be people remaining.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>In which case, I can burn the lot of them to ash at once.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Family, relatives, friends, acquaintances, parents, siblings, wives, children, grandchildren...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Ahh, this world truly is hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Katou Danzo log entry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The Curse of Annihilation has successfully overwritten her Spirit Origin exactly as my master intended, producing the desired effect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Archer of Inferno kills, and kills, and kills, in order to turn this world into hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Naturally, that was part of the design. However, the karma mechanism guiding the Curse is working TOO well on her.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Her flames...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Her flames first consumed an entire fishing village. They literally burned it to the ground. Naturally, there was not a single survivor.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That is all well and good. It is exactly in line with our lord&#39;s expectations. If we are to bring an end to the world of humans, then all humans must die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>However, the Archer of Inferno did not complete her massacre. Quite unexpectedly, she did not kill the elderly couple we had met earlier!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>What are you saying, Lady Danzo? We exchanged pleasantries and expressed concern for one another.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Whyever would we want to hurt them? You ninja certainly say the oddest things.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>If I did something that cruel,I would be condemned to hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It worked TOO well!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>By the time I realized that, it was too late. The Archer of Inferno had gone mad, and begun wreathing herself in hellfire.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She failed to respond to anything I said, and simply proceeded to advance forward while shouting nonsense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was a horrid, red and black march, with the Archer of Inferno leading a procession of black ghosts, spreading fire and death everywhere they went.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She continued to burn down village after village, but her madness would not stop. The monsters she commanded followed her example. None of them would stop.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No trace remained of the kind woman she had been merely half an hour earlier.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>AH, AH, AH, AAAHHH...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>AAH, AAH, AAAAAAHHHHHH! I DETEST EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I detest it. I DETEST IT. DETEST. DETEST. DETEST. I hate it. I HATE IT. HATE. HATE. HATE.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>GENJI, PEOPLE, JAPAN, THE WORLD...I DETEST EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>WHERE? WHERE DID YOU GO...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AArcher of Inferno:</strong></p><p>LORD YOSHINAKAAA!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She was on a wild rampage,having forgotten even her mission.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There was no longer anything anyone could do to control her. She is wildfire, neither person nor beast, but fire mimicking human form.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In time, the Archer of Inferno will even burn herself up. Perhaps we should not have used \u25A0\u25A0 for one of the seven knights after all?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But that is for my master to decide. I am merely here to observe, record, and convey all that transpires.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Still, if I were to offer my own thoughts...I would say that if nothing is done, it is only a matter of time before Shimousa becomes the next Hitachi!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(...This is bad. It&#39;s happening too soon. )</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(It would be one thing were this simply a large-scale massacre, but I do not understand why Lady Inferno insists on heading northward! )</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>(Toke Castle is an invaluable strategic point for both my master and Lord Sorcerer, which is why Lady Inferno had to cease her duel with Musashi. So why is she heading there now? )</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lady Inferno, if you will no longer listen to me,then I am left with no other choice.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I shall use my secret Karakuri Genpou to\u2013</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Wait, Danzo. Hahaha, do not be too hasty.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I have received your report. You say that Lady Inferno has been reduced to hellfire from which there is no return...?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, master. She no longer responds to anything I say...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehe. Hahaha, how wonderful! Then she has finally freed her chronic disease from its restraints!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>So heartwarming it makes me want to nuzzle her. So spiteful it makes me want to strangle her.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Ahh, even with the Curse of Annihilation embedded within her, she still ended up facing the darkness in her own soul. Mmm, how beautiful.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>But, nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>That is neither here nor there.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Your concerns are warranted, Danzo. It would set us back considerably were she to incinerate Onriedo&#39;s foundations again, like she did in Hitachi.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>So naturally, we must get rid of her,along with those irritating interlopers.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...I must say, women certainly are fragile, aren&#39;t they.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahh, what a lovely day!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yes! It&#39;s so nice and sunny out!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It sure is, Onui.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just glad nothing else eventful happened during the night. I slept great once we got back!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wh-what? \u201CGot back\u201D? \u201CSlept great\u201D?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo goo?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nothing you two need to worry about. Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right. Glad there wasn&#39;t a second wave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No news is good news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t able to help. I wish I could have fought alongside you, Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m grateful that you stopped my magical energy loss, but unfortunately my Spirit Origin isn&#39;t stable yet, so I am not strong enough to fight.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Nevertheless, if the time comes when I am needed,I will fight, even if it kills me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t push yourself too hard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not your fault if you&#39;re not feeling well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thank you, Master...To think I came here in order to help you, and so far, you&#39;re the one who has been helping me...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I understand how you feel, but Fujimaru is right. You shouldn&#39;t overdo it, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, it&#39;s amazing you&#39;re up and walking after being that out of it. You Heroic Spirits are something else.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Or does that have more to do with you being the head of the Fuuma clan?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know much about Heroic Spirits, but in human terms, you were basically on the brink of death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou&#39;s always healed up amazingly quickly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Kotarou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You are too kind.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I only wish there was more I could tell you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Didn&#39;t you say Fujimaru&#39;s body was still in a coma in Chaldea, and showing no signs of waking...or something?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Also that you don&#39;t know if [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] mind has gone off to a Singularity, or if all of Shimousa is just part of a dream [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] having, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>ALSO also that it&#39;s clear dreams are involved in some way, but it&#39;s not clear how.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I guess you pretty much told us all you knew when you were delirious yesterday, huh?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry I couldn&#39;t be of more help...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh no, I&#39;m not blaming you. I just wish we had a little more info on the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters is all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(After all, every single one of them is stronger than I am. Grasping at straws is about all I&#39;ve got here...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, you have nothing to worry about, Kotarou. You did admirably.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And now you&#39;re here just when your Master needs you. So go on, hold your head high!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, and try not to hide your eyes, either! How&#39;s anyone supposed to see your handsome face under all that hair!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I think you&#39;re really cool, Mr. Red Hair!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>N-not at all. I am merely a ninja...I appreciate your compliments, but my appearance does not affect my job.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ninjas are always cool!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed how quickly you heal, Kotarou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You too, Master? Th-thank you. By the way,is there a festival of some sort taking place today?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There is quite a commotion down the street. I wouldn&#39;t normally expect to see crowds in a place like this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, I&#39;m not sure. I didn&#39;t THINK there was anything special about today...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t think so either. Then again, history here is slightly different from what we know.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>From what I know, I&#39;m pretty sure neither Toke Castle nor its town were ever this prosperous during the Edo period.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It could also just be that something unexpected happened. Something noteworthy enough to draw a huge crowd this early in the morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go check it out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know I&#39;M getting curious.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Me too. In that case, let&#39;s go take a look! Here Onui, hold my hand. I don&#39;t want you getting lost.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I shall lead the way. Even in my weakened state, I can still manage to slip through a crowd. Come, Master.</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Where the hell did all these people come from!? How&#39;m I supposed to get to my construction job like this!?</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s so many in the way I can&#39;t get anywhere! Hey, you! What&#39;s all this about? Some new festival or what!?</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>Festival? You mean you don&#39;t know? Samurai have come all the way from Edo to vanquish the monsters!</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>I heard there are over five hundred of them. You can see them all marching along in perfect synchronization.</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Huh, is that so? Samurai from Edo, eh? Hmm, I see, I see. It does have a different feel to it from the usual daimyo procession.</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>All the same, I never thought I&#39;d ever see so many Edo samurai all in one place like this!</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>...Oh yeah, since this isn&#39;t a daimyo procession,we shouldn&#39;t have to bow our heads, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Phew, we finally made it through that crowd! I also heard all this is because there&#39;s a big group of samurai here.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Really? There&#39;s lots of samurai here? ?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo, ga!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Five hundred samurai is a large group indeed. I wonder if they are part of the shogun&#39;s retinue? I believe the Shimabara Rebellion ended last year, so...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, they might be samurai who have seen real action then. If so, then they should have something as simple as defending a town pretty well covered.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In fact, this town probably couldn&#39;t ask for any better protection. I wonder who&#39;s leading them? Whoever it is must be a famous warrior in his own right.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not so sure. As far as I can tell...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...the samurai in the procession are all of fairly low standing.... What&#39;s more, they&#39;re armed to the teeth, rather than the usual simple armor.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait. There&#39;s someone riding a horse coming up from the rear.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...He may well be a samurai of high standing. What&#39;s more, the aura surrounding him is incredible.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAged Warrior:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAged Warrior:</strong></p><p>I see the people of this town have come to view the proceedings. This may be a good time then. Stop the procession, Sakon.</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Yes, sir. Everyone, haaalt!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>People of Toke, listen well! Lord Tajima-no-Kami has come all the way from Edo, and he wishes to speak!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Quiet down, and pay attention!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Tajima-no-Kami! )</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>(Who&#39;s that? Is he someone important? )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Tajima-no-Kami is the title for the ruler of Tajima Province, up in the mountains. But in this time period,I believe he was\u2013)</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I am Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami Munenori,chief inspector for the shogunate.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I understand that a procession this large headed for the castle is bound to draw attention. But there is no need for concern.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>We five hundred samurai have come here on an official mission from the shogunate.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>No doubt some of you have heard reports of an army of monsters attacking innocents in southern Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Hmph, monsters. What a joke.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Rest assured, all of you. These so-called monsters are no different from burglars and bandits! I shall soon be setting out with the Lord of Toke Castle, Matsudaira Shimousa-no-Kami himself, to bring them to justice!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>My retinue consists entirely of veterans of the battle of Shimabara who have proven themselves in combat, and who have spread the glory of the shogunate to the south!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>As such, I ask you all to wait patiently for good news.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Very soon, I, Tajima-no-Kami, shall put an end to the rumored monsters terrorizing Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>We will not repeat the mistakes of Shimabara. Not with me here to ensure our success.</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Yagyu...Did I hear that right? Is he really THE Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami!?</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>His swordsmanship is supposed to be unparalleled. They say there are none in all of Edo who can defeat him.</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>As I understand it he&#39;s a prodigy who spends his time tutoring the shogun in swordsmanship. I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s here in Shimousa!</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Are the monsters really that big of a threat? Oh, I hope everything is all right in the south.</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s probably just someone mistaking bandits for monsters. Some people have overactive imaginations!</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Lord Tajima ought to have no problem with them. In fact, this is great news! Now Lord Matsudaira will be able to rest easy!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I knew it! That WAS Tajima-no-Kami! I never thought I would see a legendary figure like him here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi, Kotarou, do you know who that is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I do. He is the son of Yagyu Sekishuusai and the father of Yagyu Jubei; a famous swordsman who left his mark on history.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>He was a genius with the sword, and the strongest swordsman of his time in Edo. The third shogun is said to have said he was invincible.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>He is also a strategic genius. He saw the threat posed by the Shimabara Rebellion long before anyone else.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Some even think that if the shogunate had sent him to Shimabara right away, he would have brought the rebellion to an end much sooner.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>One of his most famous deeds was when he was protecting the second shogun, Hidetada, during the Siege of Osaka...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...when he is said to have cut down seven fully armored warriors in an instant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Seven fully armored warriors, in an instant? ...Man, that&#39;s kind of insane.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ugh, why&#39;d a scary old man like that have to accept the fight I picked with him? I could have ended up dead.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now he&#39;s here acting all stiff and formal and stuff, giving speeches in public like it&#39;s no big deal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi, that kind of sounds...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Have you met him before?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Well, kind of.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I might have got a taste of him when we faced off just a little bit some time ago?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you say \u201Ctaste\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...How did the fight end?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I swear, all I did was rattle my katana a tiiiny bit! Just a bit! I wasn&#39;t REALLY trying to cut him down or anything!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, I was the only one who ended up worse for wear afterwards.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, that can&#39;t have been here in this world,since I never visit the same place twice.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So strictly speaking, the Tajima-no-Kami I met must have been different from\u2013</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>You there, woman. I know that face.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>The last I saw of you, you vanished to who knows where with some sort of sorcery. What are you doing here in Shimousa?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Huh!? D-don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s the same one!? )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know. What do you think I&#39;m doing here?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I see you dress as unusually as ever. It has been six months since we fought; have you thought of a better name than Shinmen Musashi in that time?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahaha. Well, it IS my name, even if it is kind of confusing. You kinda don&#39;t have any room to talk when it comes to confusing names, though, y&#39;know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So, I guess from your perspective,it&#39;s been six months since our duel, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sorry about that. I should have known better than to rattle my sword on a whim like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, but for the record, I don&#39;t use sorcery or curses, okay? The only reason I wander around like this is thanks to Lady Kannon&#39;s protection.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Weird. I thought I never visited the same place twice.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(And yet, here I am in the same place AND time as then. On top of that, it looks like it&#39;s all part of a dream that Fujimaru&#39;s having too. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Has this sort of thing ever happened before? )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...No, it hasn&#39;t. Not once. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, this is really strange.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Still...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Since Fujimaru is also involved with this place somehow...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...Maybe it&#39;s not so strange that normally impossible stuff is happening. )</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I see your penchant for gab remains as strong as ever.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>It also seems you have new consorts now. And ones that are as eccentric as you at that.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All he did was look at me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Can&#39;t...move...a muscle...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Please try to breathe, Master. Good, now exhale.... It&#39;s okay, you were just overwhelmed by the energy of his gaze.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s no fault of yours. His sword ki is incredible. Even as a Servant, it was enough to make my hair stand on end.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That was uncalled for, Tajima-no-Kami. Just because I acted rudely to you before is no reason to take it out on [\u2642 him /\u2640 her].</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re a big shot on an important mission now, right? You were pretty classy during your speech earlier; don&#39;t mess that up now.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Please?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hah. It&#39;s gratifying to see the vagrant who provoked me into a duel like an animal learning to act human.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Very well then, woman. I shall see for myself what it is you are up to now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And just what do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Uh, hey, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]!? There are big birds flying towards us. Do you think they&#39;re crows or something?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re so high up...they&#39;ve got to be crows, right? Or maybe black kites?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid not. I believe those are flying monsters, and coming from the south. Could they have a connection to the monster army that brought the samurai here!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re fast! And coming straight towards us! Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep Onui and Tasuke safe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi, take care of them!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You don&#39;t have to tell me!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Whoa!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You slew such swift flying monsters with a single sweep of your blade! So that&#39;s your Niten Ichiryu!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Thanks. But that&#39;s all I did.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You realized it too, right, Kotarou? Tajima&#39;s aura stopped them in their tracks before my blade even reached them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What was that, Nikaidou-Heihou!? Why didn&#39;t he do something more in line with his Yagyu Shinkageryu!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>His sword ki is impressive even when he&#39;s not doing anything. I never thought a non-Servant, flesh-and-blood human could possess an aura like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What he does with that gaze of his...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like paralyzing me with one look.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I bet. That old man definitely likes to blast you with his aura.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same sort of aura that Heroic Spirits...that Servants have.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s just a man whose sword reaches the gods. If a human can manage to truly master something, they can become a god unto themselves.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But some merciful god you turned out to be, Tajima-no-Kami! How can you still keep your katana sheathed at a time like this!?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I told you: my techniques are only to be passed on to those of the ruling class. Otomeryu is not meant for the eyes of the common folk.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah yeah, I see how it is! Good thing a vagrant like me can show off her stuff all she wants then, huh!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master, there&#39;s a second wave coming, this time with greater numbers! They definitely seem to be coming from the south!</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong></p><p>What are those birds!? Maybe sea eagles or giant black kites!? I can see something flying this way. What the hell IS that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Geh. I thought everyone would be gone after Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s speech, but we&#39;ve still got a big crowd hanging around. We can&#39;t fight those things off here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And we definitely can&#39;t fight them in the air!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get to choose our venue.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Sakon, get these people out of here. Tell them to remain indoors for the next thirty minutes. Hurry!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Yes, sir! All of you, listen up! I have an announcement from Lord Tajima-no-Kami!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Well well. So you&#39;re going to help us fight them off?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. YOU will be helping ME. Do try to impress me with your ability to follow my orders, and keep up, if you can.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah yeah, I&#39;ll get right on that. Sadly, I&#39;m not really much for following orders, especially from old men, AND I hate flying enemies. Oh, well. Let&#39;s make some lemonade.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, Fujimaru. I&#39;m counting on you for backup!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>This must have been a scouting party. Sakon, tell Lord Matsudaira that he must hurry and deploy archers.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>The castle&#39;s defenses can make do with a bare minimum of soldiers. Concentrate our forces on the southern region and stop any earthbound monsters dead. Do not let even a single rat through your ranks.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Position four-hundred of our men at the front line. Each one has proven his skill in Shimabara; they should be able to hold their own against these monsters.</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Understood! I shall ride to Lord Matsudaira at once!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hurry. Time is of the essence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Man, samurai really are something else...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t even blink at those monsters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It seems their minds are on the battlefield at all times. They must have been planning their next orders even while you were fighting, Master.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>The samurai are moving around so quickly! Oh, where are they going with the horses?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I wonder where they&#39;re going. Is the parade over?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga ga.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess they&#39;re all off to their duties. Impressive how they kept cool while they let us do all the fighting.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I must say, their confidence is amazing. Perhaps a truly skilled samurai knows he has nothing to fear from monsters, demonic beasts, or ghosts.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Especially if he carries a katana that grows closer to a Mystic as they age.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I bet they&#39;ve got that part pretty well covered. Right, Tajima?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Who do you think you&#39;re talking to? The shogunate rules this country completely. Of course they are prepared to deal with monsters and the like.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>However, I will say that it is highly unusual for monsters to band together like this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s because they&#39;re not just wandering around aimlessly. There&#39;s someone leading them. I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to see them come at us with even greater numbers next time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit Swordmaster...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder if the Archer of Inferno is behind this.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Oho. It sounds like you know more than you&#39;ve let on. Perhaps you are the masterminds behind this attack?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...No, I suppose that is out of the question. Nonetheless, time is of the essence. Tell me everything you know.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I see. So these Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are the disgraced remains of dead souls.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily I would cut you down for spouting nonsense, but it would seem that things here in Shimousa are no longer so simple.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Based on your account, this Archer of Inferno woman is the leader of these monster attacks.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think so,but I&#39;m not entirely certain.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That said, she did attack us yesterday evening, so the timing makes sense if the trouble in the south started last night.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But if she IS responsible for that, then something doesn&#39;t add up. I might just be imagining things, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I remember too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She said she couldn&#39;t let loose here in town.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>One cannot expect a dead soul to act with integrity. It is no surprise that this one may have gone mad.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(He certainly doesn&#39;t mince words. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I&#39;m sorry, it would just take too long to explain to him exactly what Heroic Spirits are. But it&#39;s not like all normal Servants are crazy, right? )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(No, normal Servants go crazy too. In fact, insanity is more or less the hallmark of the entire Berserker class. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Huh, I didn&#39;t know that. )</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hmm. In that case...Woman, I have orders for you and your companions, not including the young children.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>A hundred of my finest men are about to depart from this town in order to track down the monsters&#39; leader.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I will not tell you to go with them. They are nothing more than a diversion, a detached force.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Instead, your party will be the one to infiltrate the heart of the enemy&#39;s operations and kill their leader, this Archer of Inferno.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait, what? Did I get that right? Because I THOUGHT I heard you telling us to go out on a monster hunt.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Aha, ahahahaha. No, that can&#39;t be right. A great, noble samurai, asking for MY help?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hmph. I am not telling you to face their legions head-on. You would do well to circle around them from the mountains, and ambush on their leader from behind.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>This is not a request, woman. It is a command. Remember, I speak with the shogunate&#39;s voice. My commands are their commands.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wh-What!?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Huh? What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not sure but I think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So we don&#39;t get to refuse?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hold it, hold it! No fair, abusing your position like that!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not to mention, how are we supposed to take out Inferno if we don&#39;t even know for sure that she&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be a fool. Do you think we came here in response to reports from just last night?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Shogunate spies have long been in place throughout Shimousa to verify the rumors of monsters in the area.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>According to these spies, a woman who appeared to be commanding these monsters was spotted among their ranks a short while ago.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>It all lines up with what you told me.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>And so...I am giving you another chance to battle this Archer of Inferno.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>N-no fair! Who do you think you are, squeezing us for everything we know, keeping us in the dark, then calling all the shots!?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Simple. I am a samurai, and you are a mere vagrant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grr...You&#39;re a nasty old man, is what you are! You&#39;re even worse than udon after it gets all soggy!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Why udon...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Udon is the gods&#39; gift to mankind! It&#39;s one of my favorite foods! But if it gets soggy, it is RUINED!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I understand, Ms. Samurai. I can&#39;t stand when a bowl of delicious udon gets soggy, either.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga goo ga.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>See! Onui and Tasuke get it! Right!? But still...What are we going to do now...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Citizens of this country can&#39;t refuse an order from the shogunate, but what is your take on this,Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Those samurai aren&#39;t any match for Heroic Spirits...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Against a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s true. I&#39;m not sure even I could have defeated Purgatorio if I hadn&#39;t borrowed this katana.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Samurai are only human, after all. And in the Swordmasters&#39; case, even a normal Heroic Spirit would have a hard time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So if it really is Inferno leading these monsters...I guess we have no choice but to go.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I may not be of much use in battle...but I will do what I can to help you cross the mountain pass!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Mountain pass? Are we going mountain climbing now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You and Tasuke stay here, Onui.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait for us in Otama&#39;s room.</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Aww. But...okay...I like Otama&#39;s room. It smells like incense!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) A march over the mountains, huh. It&#39;s going to be a long and exhausting walk, so I&#39;ll have to prepare lunch boxes, otherwise we might starve to death.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hmm, that&#39;s true. One cannot fight on an empty stomach. I shall have rice balls prepared for you to take along.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Now let&#39;s see...Are you there, Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am here, Lord Tajima-no-Kami.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wh-whoa! That lady just came out of the shadows! That&#39;s amazing! How did she do that!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Wow, she&#39;s cute! I have to give old man Tajima this: he&#39;s got good taste! )</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>This is the spy who saw the woman leading the monsters. She will serve as your guide. Is that clear, Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>As you wish, my lord.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So you&#39;re a lady ninja. I guess that makes you a kunoichi? There probably aren&#39;t many of you out there, huh? You must be amazing if you&#39;re acting as a scout for the shogunate!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, it&#39;s nice to meet you. Danzo, was it? That name sounds vaguely familiar...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, my name is Danzo. I shall take you where you need to go, as my lord commands.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You seem a little shocked.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>No, it&#39;s nothing. She just bears a strong resemblance to someone I know.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a coincidence. I apologize for my rudeness.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Really? She does?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, she does. Again, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Now then, Lady Musashi, Master, we should hurry! We must cross the mountain pass and take out the Archer of Inferno!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Not bad. I like your spirit. Very well then,I am trusting you to handle the monsters&#39; leader.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>With no one to lead them, the monsters will pose no more threat than shadows and mist. My samurai will then be able to handle them with ease.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Now, go forth and defeat this woman before she puts all Shimousa to the torch! I expect good news when you return!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>These monsters are fairly slow moving, with the exception of the flying beasts. Consequently, they are still quite some distance from Toke.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>If we hurry, we should be able to reach them before nightfall, even with a detour.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So we&#39;re splitting up from this group of elite samurai, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If they&#39;re here to take out those monsters too,shouldn&#39;t they have come with us?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Not to worry. They should arrive before us,as they are meeting the enemy head-on.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Once they have engaged the enemy in battle,we will approach their leader from behind.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Now I see. So he&#39;d already thought that far ahead when he gave us our orders.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ugh, with skills and smarts like his,it&#39;s no wonder that old man&#39;s such a big shot.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Man, I wish I had a cushy government job with cuties waiting on me hand and foot.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou, was it? Is something wrong? Surely I am not the first kunoichi you have ever met.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Or perhaps...is it because you have doubts about my name?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I can only tell you that I am indeed Katou Danzo. I apologize if I am not what you expect.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But unfortunately, there is nothing I can do in that regard.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>N-no, it&#39;s not that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m the one who should apologize. I don&#39;t doubt what you say at all, Lady Danzo.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You must know the stories too, right? Katou Danzo is the most famous ninja from the age of war!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know much about the ninja world, but even I&#39;ve heard of the flying Katou and his exploits as master of puppets!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What about you, Fujimaru? Do you know her name?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I feel like I&#39;ve heard it somewhere.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...That is really rather embarrassing for a ninja. I never intended to stand out like this, so it feels rather odd.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course! I&#39;ve heard it lots of times before.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, really? I guess that&#39;s what happens when you experience so much history firsthand!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still...the age of war was quite some time ago, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I also hadn&#39;t heard that you were still working as a spy for Lord Iemitsu. Plus, you seem awfully young...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If she&#39;s been alive this long...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe she&#39;s a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re...a puppet, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Yes, I am. I had no idea you knew. I can only presume you must have heard the truth of Katou Danzo somewhere.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I hesitated to share this fact myself because it is usually such a difficult thing to explain, but if there is no need to hide it, I would be glad to do so.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, I am indeed a puppet, animated by machinery. I am over one hundred years old.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So she&#39;s a mechanical doll?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Think of her as a kind of magecraft. It&#39;s certainly rare to see something like her in this time, but she is on par with the magecraft used in the modern day.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I believe there are a few puppet masters that exist in your time as well, aren&#39;t there, Master?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>In fact, there is a long history of mages controlling puppets with magecraft, although it isn&#39;t usually called \u201Cmagecraft\u201D in this era.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, she is a homunculus or golem made with magecraft?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She is indeed. I knew you would understand, Master. It&#39;s certainly rare to see something like her in this time, but comparable magecraft exists in the modern day.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It is basically the same process used to make homunculi or golems appear human.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>While I am sure the differences would be apparent to an expert, I still know very little about magecraft and sorcery, so I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s my best explanation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Just so we&#39;re clear, Master, I can assure you that if nothing else, she is not a Servant. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(I sense nothing to suggest she is. As such, I believe she truly is a person\u2013er, puppet, from this time. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, a mechanical kunoichi! I&#39;ve seen machines and ninja before, but never a MACHINE NINJA like this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>On top of that, this combination turned out to be Katou Danzo, a ninja so famous even I&#39;ve heard about her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And on top of all that, she&#39;s suuuper cute! That&#39;s what really matters.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re so slim, with such slender legs. I bet other people tell you you&#39;d look good in anything all the time, huh?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>N-no, I can&#39;t say that they do...Please don&#39;t tease me, Lady Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Kotarou reacted the same way. Do ninja just not care about being cute or something?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>No, we don&#39;t. And I am NOT cute!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Ah, so you are a ninja too, Lord Kotarou. I suspected as much from your demeanor.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, that&#39;s right. My full name is...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>On second thought, my True Name would be confusing. You can just call me Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I am from the Fuu\u2013I mean, the Sagami Province.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I see. That&#39;s quite a coincidence. Some of my installed ninjutsu are from the Sagami clan as well.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...You don&#39;t remember me, do you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Pardon? What did you say?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Never mind. Just forget I said that. Besides, I&#39;m sensing something strange up ahead.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, now that&#39;s a Servant for you! Even though you&#39;re not fully recovered, your instincts are still dead on!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sensing one...two...three...No, there are even more than that. They must have wandered off from their pack; they&#39;re clearly not acting as a unit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have any time to waste!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to take them out as quickly as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. Danzo, I hate to ask, but would you mind helping? I don&#39;t know much about ninjutsu, but I&#39;m sure you can hold your own in a fight, right?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Part of my job is to ensure that you reach your destination safely.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Katou Danzo, activating Combat Mode. Objective: destroy hostile entities and resume expedition.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Initiating battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I knew it. This world is truly hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Lord Yoshinaka fought for the people. He stood up against the Taira&#39;s arrogance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He thought he was doing what was right. He was trying to create a peaceful world, even if he had to take others&#39; lives to do so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Kiso Yoshinaka was my beloved hero, a peerless warrior. He fought alongside the Genji to free them from the tyranny of the Taira.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He fought, and fought, and fought...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, even after the Taira had been defeated, this new world hated Lord Yoshinaka.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The very instant the Genji were in power in Kyoto, they betrayed him! Even after he had fought by their side, they said he was evil!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>How dare they. How dare they. How dare they! Now, Lord Yoshinaka is dead. Murdered at the hands of the Genji!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I shall never forgive them. I detest, I detest, I detest, I detest, I detest...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest. I hate. I hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I detest the Genji clan for betraying Lord Yoshinaka. I loathe the people of Japan for not accepting him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I detest everything about this world! I am overcome with loathing. It shall never go away!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is truly hell. There is no other word for it! Contemptible worms grow in number and size, while good people are nowhere to be found!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And why would there be? This world has always been hell!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I detest it. I loathe it. I despise it. Nothing has changed since then. I still burn with anger and hate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...No. Wait. Something...Something is different.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I too must have died, and made a mark on humanity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have materialized in this world as a shadow of my former self.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But then...why do I still fester with hatred? When I was alive, I hid myself away and lived out the rest of my days in peace once the war came to an end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So why do I now burn so fiercely? Is it because I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit? Is it the way I&#39;ve materialized? No, no no no, it&#39;s something else!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why? Why! Why!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why was it not enough for me to shed tears over losing the one I loved? What is this urge I have to use myself as firewood!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Detestation. Anger. The Curse of Annihilation inside me drives me wildly mad. With the fire growing unchecked, now is the time to turn things around!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ahh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have finally disgraced myself to the point where I can fall no further.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I have become a demon. My illness has advanced to the point where I can no longer be around others.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>These flames...! I sense magical energy at work. It could be magecraft, or a Servant&#39;s ability!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And then there&#39;s the sky. It should still be midday, but our surroundings are as dark as night!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right, Kotarou hasn&#39;t seen it yet. This is how it always goes. The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters can make that blood-soaked moon appear in the sky.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then again, this wasn&#39;t the case last night. Maybe they only make the moon come out if they feel like it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Or...when they&#39;re about to get serious.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>We have successfully made our way behind enemy lines. But stay alert. There is no telling when they may attack us.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Right now they are simply moving north, but if their leader were to notice us\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think we&#39;ll be okay there. It looks like the old man really does know his strategy.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Those are Lord Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s hundred samurai! They will keep the monsters busy so we can slip through unnoticed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So far, everything&#39;s going according to his plan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now we just have to find the Archer of Inferno!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s only one Servant aura nearby, about two-hundred meters ahead!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Honestly, what are they thinking?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just doing as my Curse of Annihilation tells me to do, and they see fit to send fifty...no, a hundred coarse warriors my way.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s excessive for dealing with a lone woman like me. Perhaps they simply fear these monsters romping around?</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>There you are, wicked creature! Are you the one who has been leading these creatures and terrorizing Shimousa!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Yes. Something like that.</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>It is too late to turn yourself in. We shall not leave this battlefield without your head! We defeated the Christians that threatened our country. Now you shall witness our might for yourself!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Oh my...How scary...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Scary...Yes, that is scary. It&#39;s dreadful and loathsome. If this world is hell, you must be the devils that torment those of us who are trapped here.</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>What rubbish. We are the keepers of the peace in this world! In one swift stroke, we shall cut down wicked creatures like yourself who threaten our safety!</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>We fear not the sorcery you use to control these foul beasts. We all carry famed katana that have proven their worth in battle. Your defeat is all but certain!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>My...How impressive...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>But, I doubt any of your blades are on par with the Myoujingiri Muramasa that defeated Purgatorio. As such, they cannot hope to kill me.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I am nothing but firewood now.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I have used my soul, my Spirit Origin, and my body to stoke the fires of fury, and become flame itself. No ordinary human stands a chance against me.</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>Th-the flames are getting hotter!</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>If she uses her sorcery, just cut right through it, push forward and kill her!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I am loathing. I am anger. I am hatred and fury! Behold how brightly I burn!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I shall descend upon all of you...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>You, your parents, your brothers, your sisters, your wives, your children...Everyone...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Everyone, everyone, everyone...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I shall melt your eyes, sear your hearts, and char every bone in your body until only ash remains!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>NOW BURN!!!</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>A-aaagh! I&#39;m on fire...I&#39;m on fire! It won&#39;t go out!? P-please, stop! I can&#39;t breathe! It burns, it burns!</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>Aaaggghhh! H-heeelp!</p><p><strong>Tajima Samurai:</strong></p><p>AAARRRGGGHHH!!!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ha!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks like I made it just in time! I&#39;ve never cut fire before, but there&#39;s a first time for everything!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re still breathing! Lady Danzo, please take the injured to safety, and give the others instructions!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They may be able to hold their own against these monsters, but it&#39;s impossible for humans to fight a Servant!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Understood. I will take care of the injured and instruct the other samurai.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...What a surprise to see you here.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Wait, who are you again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t seen you since last night.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, it was just last night. So kind of you to remember us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve already forgotten us?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah. You don&#39;t usually forget people you met just yesterday.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, I suppose I should announce myself anyway, since we&#39;re about to face off.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>My name is Musashi. Miyamoto Musashi! Though you Swordmasters seem to prefer calling me Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You may have forgotten us, but I haven&#39;t forgotten you, Archer of Inferno. Is our last fight already in your distant past or something?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know who you are. But, if you&#39;re people who live in this world...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...I will have to burn you all the same. That is simple. Very simple. I would like you to die now, please.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>And do stay out of my way. You see those thirty\u2013no, hundred men over there?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I have to burn them all up. After all, I&#39;m firewood, right? And you need fire if you&#39;re going to roast sinners in hell, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It looks like the Archer of Inferno is even...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s a lot crazier than last time.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Inferno.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t like the way you fight or kill. Burning everything does not eliminate the root of conflict.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Left unchecked, that root only grows into the next war. One with nothing to gain, and everything to lose.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What can you possibly gain from this? This isn&#39;t even your time; nothing happening now should affect you personally.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And I doubt burning everything in sight is going to make someone want to give you something like the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So why kill all these people when there&#39;s nothing in it for you? Why fight at all?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t hope to understand if you won&#39;t talk to me! At least tell me why you&#39;re doing all of this!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>There is nothing to understand. I am firewood. Firewood does not speak, or think, or\u2013</p><p><strong>Inferno:</strong></p><p>...How dare you attack me while I&#39;m still talking, you coward!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t talk to me about cowardice when you literally spread fire as easily as breathing! I know full well you&#39;re stronger than me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In which case, you better believe I&#39;m going to try and lop off an arm or two before you get serious!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Here I thought this conversation would continue, but instead, you lash out at me in fury...I see. So that is the sort of cowardice you prefer.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>In that case...why don&#39;t we take this elsewhere. A plane where there&#39;s no strategy or technique at all!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Raaahhh!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>RrrrrrAAAAAA! Gngh, GRAAAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>This strange magical energy...! Lady Musashi, I believe this Servant is likely\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...An oni!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess those horns on her helmet weren&#39;t just for show!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHH! Ghh...AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>HOW...DARE YOU! I DETEST YOU...I CAN&#39;T STAND IT!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>LORD YOSHINAKA...! LORD YOSHINAKA...!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>AAAAAAHHHHHH!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yoshinaka!? Did I just hear her right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yoshinaka...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The only Yoshinaka I can think of off the top of my head is Kiso Yoshinaka, one of the greatest generals from hundreds of years ago!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Kiso Yoshinaka was a shogun in the Kamakura period!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You really know your stuff, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So if she had ties to Yoshinaka...I see. Makes sense. I can understand why she would hate all of Japan.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All the more so now that things are peaceful in the Tokugawa reign, since the Tokugawa family is supposed to be descended from the Seiwa Genji.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Kiso Yoshinaka was a general who helped Minamoto Yoritomo overthrow the Taira regime. He was once lauded as a great general, but ended up being persecuted by Yoritomo after he had outlived his usefulness.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve heard his name before. As well as his beloved wife&#39;s, who was always by his side.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...R, Rr, RRR...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She was a courageous woman, and an incredibly skilled warrior. An armor-clad battle maiden who fought better than any man.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The daughter of Nakahara Kaneto, and the younger sister of Higuchi Kanemitsu and Imai Kanehira.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The one who always fought by Yoshinaka&#39;s side, yet couldn&#39;t bear witness to his death.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s who you are, isn&#39;t it? A woman who burns with hatred and detestation...Tomoe Gozen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She defended Uruk at the Demonic Front!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why is she doing all this now?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It must be the karma implanted by that Curse thing. Her soul has been dead for a long time, just like Lord Inshun.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The thing in front of us now is nothing more than a husk\u2013the vestiges of what Tomoe Gozen the Servant used to be. At least, that&#39;s how I see it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But no matter how tragic her story is, or how justified her anger may be, I&#39;m not going to hold back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...That&#39;s right. I won&#39;t hold back at all. I can&#39;t afford to against her, anyway. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I refuse to take pity on her. But, can I still defeat her? This katana may be up to the task, but my skills sure aren&#39;t. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(It&#39;s not her soul I need to cut...it&#39;s her karma. I have to sever her grudge itself. And my skills haven&#39;t reached a point where I can do that! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But so what! I should be thrilled I get to go up against Tomoe Gozen!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is a once in a lifetime chance to prove myself against an unrivaled master! If I back down now, it would bring shame to my Niten Ichiryu style!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The only thing I need to worry about doing to this flame in human clothing is to cut it down with my crossed blades!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad I brought you with me, Myoujingiri Muramasa! Now come on, Inferno! It&#39;s time we settled this!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>RR, RRRRRR...AAAAAAHHH!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>MY...NAME...IS...TOMOE...NO...NO, IT&#39;S NOT...!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I...AM...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>THE ARCHER OF INFERNO...! THE ONE WHO SHALL BURN THIS WORLD TO CINDERS!!!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Come forth, my blood-soaked frontier! This mountain of bodies and river of blood shall serve as our stage, and consume the loser&#39;s soul upon their defeat!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>My blade&#39;s Cursed Name is Archer of Inferno! My vessel&#39;s True Name: Tomoe-Gozen!</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Prepare yourself, Shinmen Musashi! Our final battle is upon us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>I cannot overlook the Taira clan&#39;s tyranny. I doubt they will stop at ravaging the city.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>If they are not stopped, they will ruin all of Japan. Someone must stand up to them. Someone must fight.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>I will not fight for the Genji&#39;s sake. I will fight so that all who live in this world can do so in peace.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s so selfless of you, Lord Yoshinaka.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>It is, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>...Hahaha, as well it should be. I was trying to say something selfless, after all.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>If anyone were to ask me why I do this,that shall be my answer.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong></p><p>Lord Yoshinaka...?</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>But I will be completely honest with you, Tomoe. The real reason I will fight the Taira clan...</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>...is to make a brighter future for us. That is all.</p><p><strong>Kiso Yoshinaka:</strong></p><p>I fight, Tomoe, so that one day, the fires of war will no longer burn...and we can be together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why did I ever forget this? I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I know that he gave me something precious. Not just hatred, or anger, or detestation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I managed to survive. Back then, when Yoshitsune came for Lord Yoshinaka on Yorimoto&#39;s orders...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Lord Yoshinaka asked me to stay far away from the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Because of how he cared for me, my life was spared.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In time, I went on to give birth to our son, Yoshihide. Afterward I became a nun, and grew old while continuing to pray that Lord Yoshinaka would rest in peace.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Yes...I could have sworn I died peacefully, while praying.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So then, why...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Why did I...How could I ever forget seeing Lord Yoshinaka smile at the sunset like this...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Lord...Yoshinaka...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I remember now...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>You smiled at me so bashfully, Lord Yoshinaka.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I loved that smile of yours. I would never forget it. At least, I thought I never would.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Resentment, hatred, anger...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>I thought I had let all of it go. I never thought they would flare up and drive me to such madness.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>How mortifying...But...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>It seems that too is over now. Thank goodness...</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>Now, I no longer need be firewood.</p><p><strong>Archer of Inferno:</strong></p><p>...Thank goodness.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sleep well, Tomoe Gozen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never forget how you fought for Uruk.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...According to legend, Tomoe Gozen could fell a hawk with her bow, or split a large tree with her sword.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They were right. I could never have beaten her without the Myoujingiri Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Rest in peace, Lady Inferno.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...The enemy ranks have collapsed.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You did it. The monsters are scattering. The samurai should be able to deal with them before nightfall now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Tomoe Gozen was a truly fearsome foe...but I knew that you and Master would be able to defeat her, Lady Musashi. How sharp your techniques were.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess so, huh. In fact, they were pretty great, if I do say so myself! I deflected her arrows, and wove between every strike of her sword!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t have a plan for dealing with her flames,but aside from that, I&#39;d say I more than held my own!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, all that&#39;s left now is the cleanup. Let&#39;s go help Danzo and the samurai! Oh, but not you,Fujimaru. You get some rest!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You too, Tomoe Gozen. I only hope my sword was able to free you from your karma.</p><h2 id="section-7-terza-cantica-paraiso-beginning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-terza-cantica-paraiso-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Terza Cantica: Para\xEDso (Beginning)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...A hawk is crying out in the distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Here in Mt.

I know I&#39;m going to die. I&#39;m sick and tired of waiting around for it to happen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Indeed. I, Shinmen Musashi, will die here...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No manner of villain or sorcery will work on me now. My body has long been pushed beyond its limits, to the point where I am practically a corpse already.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My decrepit old body will no longer even move. I can feel my life growing shorter whenever I stand and walk.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I have grown old. Very, very old.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Boredom, joy, sadness...Such things are little more than bags under my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No doubt Iori would laugh if he saw me now. He would say that after all my harsh scolding, my own mind has still failed to reach emptiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But he would be wrong. I have reached it. I&#39;ve done so by killing and killing, over and over and over.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...And now, I am alone. Through the void, I have attained emptiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Say, I&#39;m doing well this morning. I was able to speak without my throat screaming for mercy or doubling over in a fit of coughing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Well, fate, what are you waiting for? It&#39;s now or never. Not only am I still alive, I&#39;m in the best shape I&#39;ve been in a long time!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Hmm, can&#39;t believe I got angry like that. Niten Ichiryu is supposed to be all about keeping one&#39;s mind clear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Alas, it seems I can&#39;t stop my own immaturity from bubbling up to the surface! That is how a boy is supposed to behave, not an old man at the end of his life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Now that I think of it...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My father used to do much the same thing. I suppose I really am Munisai&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My father was strong, both with the jitte and the sword. He was unquestionably a true master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, he was never satisfied. He was as stubborn as any fool. I recall it gave me no end of trouble.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Does that mean that my own impatience here on death&#39;s door is a curse I inherited from him?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Unsatisfied with my fame. Unsatisfied at my death.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Perhaps it is my name. Perhaps I should never have inherited \u201CShinmen\u201D from Munisai? Perhaps going by Miyamoto Musashi better suited me?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>No. No...This is...my...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No. This is my failure and my failure alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I think of death whenever I close my eyes. I think of it whenever I open them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even in this decrepitude, I cannot fully resign myself. After a lifetime of never encountering my fate, I grow tired of waiting for it to arrive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Come on, fate! Where are you? Show me what you have in store for my final moments.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...My life is more fragile now than a candle being in the wind. I cannot take it anymore. Please!

It will surely lose sight of me down in the bowels of hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If that is impossible, then...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Ahh, if only this world were itself a living hell.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oof, I&#39;m exhausted. I&#39;m so tired I can&#39;t even take one more step.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Phew. Hey, Tasuke, can I vent to you a bit? You don&#39;t gotta say anything, just listen. Cool? Cool.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You wouldn&#39;t believe what a jerk old man Tajima is! Instead of rewarding me for my hard work, he just stuck me with another job!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As if taking down Inferno wasn&#39;t enough, now he wants me to go around checking all of Shimousa to make sure those monsters that scattered aren&#39;t causing any trouble.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At least he lent me a horse so I don&#39;t have to do it all on foot, but that&#39;s not the point, you know?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I took down a major baddie. He should be giving me a medal or something!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, I know I&#39;m just a vagrant who&#39;s not tied down to anything, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a lot easier to use me up than an officer.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ugh, I&#39;m exhausted. There&#39;s not a single monster to be found anywhere.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All that riding around Shimousa,and all I have to show for it is a sore back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Maybe monster hunting is one of those things where you only find what you&#39;re looking for once you stop looking for it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, this should finally take care of the second job he gave me...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then again, I can&#39;t say this was a complete waste of time. It&#39;s all part of my training to reach the void.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve been to all sorts of places and fought all sorts of opponents, but I still haven&#39;t been able to reach it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The void is really different from fire and water. It&#39;s all about clearing your mind, counting your blessings, and how you live your life.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They have the same idea in the Shinkageryu, although there, they call it \u201CSuigetsu. \u201D Basically, the idea is that nothing is something, and vice-versa.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyone can cut something with shape and form.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But the void that I&#39;m trying to reach...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...is about being able to use your blade to cut the formless, the shapeless.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...The word \u201CMuni\u201D in my father&#39;s name means\u201Csecond to none. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Munisai was truly number one when it came to the sword. Now, I&#39;m trying to achieve a sword of nothingness, of zero, that surpasses him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever get there. (Sigh)...I bet even Lady Kannon must be pretty fed up by now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve wandered across all sorts of different time periods and places...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...faced more opponents and overcome more trials than any other swordmaster, and I still can&#39;t reach it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still...This might be my best, my FINAL chance...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. Servants. Purgatorio. Inferno.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, I&#39;d never be able to handle them all on my own. If I can face off against those demons and survive...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...that&#39;s when I&#39;ll find out what fate has in store for me. The point when I&#39;ll find out who I am, and who I&#39;ll be when I meet my end...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>However it turns out, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, hey Musashi. I see you got here before me.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Welcome back, Fujimaru. Bleargh! I&#39;m so exhausted! I&#39;ve been all over Shimousa and back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I couldn&#39;t find any of the monsters that disappeared after the battle with Inferno, but I also didn&#39;t hear about them attacking anyone. Or about the other Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, for that matter.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, it&#39;s good to be back. I was just looking up at the sky while I reported to Tasuke.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Otama&#39;s out at work, and Onui&#39;s in the lavatory. She should be back pretty soon, I think?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m back\u266A</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, there you are, Onui. Here, you can have Tasuke back now.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AOnui:</strong></p><p>Welcome back, Ms. Samurai, and sorry to have kept you waiting, Tasuke! Oh, you too, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AOnui:</strong></p><p>I wish I could have gone on your walk with you, Ms. Samurai. Oh, but I guess it wasn&#39;t really a walk, was it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru&#39;s the one who went walking around town. I was out on horseback riding all over Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Horseback!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d be happy to give you a ride sometime, Onui. Well, assuming old man Tajima lets me borrow the horse again.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay! I can&#39;t wait\u266A</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A Goo\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you were looking at the empty sky again, huh Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sure do love blue skies, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yes, I do.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master, I gave the inn staff the dried fish souvenir you asked me to. They were very happy with it.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They said it would go great with their dinner drinks. Oh, hello, Lady Musashi. I see you&#39;re back too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I sure am. Thanks, Kotarou. I was really tired,but I feel a lot better after seeing all your faces.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You look a lot better too. Just last night you seemed like you were barely managing to keep from collapsing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But today, you&#39;re full of energy. Is that because you&#39;ve been with Fujimaru all day?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not certain, but I think it has to do with my Spirit Origin adjusting to this world.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m still not fully recovered, but I should at least be able to take part in combat now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Although ninja primarily specialize in espionage, I&#39;m still a Servant. I may not be one of the knight classes, but I can still hold my own.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll be glad to help Master out in any way I can.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Knight, huh? Odd word, but it somehow speaks to me. Where&#39;d you pick up a word like that?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, it&#39;s nothing special. Servants gain some knowledge automatically, since our Master is from the 21st century.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>As far as I know, that&#39;s true for most Chaldean Servants.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm, so Servants all have knowledge of the time period they&#39;re summoned to, but don&#39;t have to be people who lived in that time?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t really get it, but, basically,you&#39;re all better now, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In that case, let&#39;s go for a test run, right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Test run?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Heh. How could I not be interested in seeing the Fuuma ninja arts firsthand!? I&#39;m a master swordsman and strategist, remember?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now come on, Kotarou,let&#39;s go out front and do this thing!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait. Huh? What&#39;s this about?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Are you going to play with the red-headed ninja,Ms. Samurai? I want to play too!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sorry Onui, I want you and Tasuke to watch from up here. Me and the redhead are going to put on a great show!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yay, a show!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga ga\u266A Goo goo\u266A</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Um, Lady Musashi? If this is a joke, I think it&#39;s gone far enough...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I mean, this is a public street, right? I admit, your sword ki seems very fired up...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...but surely you&#39;re not serious, are you? It&#39;s not that I mind fighting so soon after recovering, but...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I just don&#39;t see what reason we have to fight,Lady Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s true. In general, I never fight battles I don&#39;t stand to gain from. I&#39;d hate to get injured with no money or fame to show for it, after all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Right!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But you&#39;re the fifth head of the Fuuma ninja clan, right, Kotarou? So there&#39;s plenty to gain from dueling with you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s no better way to train, no better learning experience, than facing off against another skilled opponent!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So, to reward me for all that horseback riding...show me what you&#39;ve got, Fuuma Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Hey, did she say Fuuma? That&#39;s the name of an old ninja clan, isn&#39;t it? Are you gonna put on a show for us, youngsters!?</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>Oh, that sounds lovely! There have been so many ghastly rumors and things about lately. It would be wonderful to see something fun!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>See? Can&#39;t back out now that we got an audience! Now get those kunai and let&#39;s BATTLE, Fuuma Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>My ki already has my sword rattling in its scabbard! I can hardly keep it in there!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Are you sure you don&#39;t want to draw your kunai yet? You may want to hurry up, before I get in striking distance.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Err...What should I do, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think Musashi&#39;s kind of stressed right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would you mind humoring her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Very well, Master, if that is your wish. All right, Lady Musashi. Or should I say Shinmen Musashi, of the Niten Ichiryu style.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I am indeed Fuuma Kotarou,the fifth head of the Fuuma ninja clan!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I am not accustomed to engaging in fair fights like this, but I shall do my best to serve as your opponent!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now you&#39;re talking! I knew the head of a ninja clan wouldn&#39;t let me down!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Her footwork is nothing like a samurai! On the surface she&#39;s very calm and composed, but beneath that, she&#39;s more like some hooligan. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(She&#39;s fast, skilled, and sly! What&#39;s more,those two sides of her are in perfect harmony. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(So this is the skill of the legendary swordsman...Shinmen Musashi! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Gotcha!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, that looked like Utsusemi-no-Jutsu! Body replacement! It was, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, I&#39;ve never seen such beautiful ninjutsu before! That move where you guys substitute a log for your body doesn&#39;t even compare!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Ah, you mean Mokuton-no-Jutsu. We use that to switch a puppet in for ourselves to make the enemy think they&#39;ve killed us, so that they let down their guard.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t think it would work on you,so I didn&#39;t bother with that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess you had plenty of stamina to spare. Completely recovered then, huh? It looked to me like you were trying out all sorts of different things.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, I was. Once I accepted that we were really doing this, I thought I would take advantage of it to test out all of my techniques. But that was only true for the first round. I held nothing back on the second.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Samurai who have devoted themselves to the politics of the imperial court and have come to neglect their training are no match for us.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But ninja techniques have no effect on those who live by the sword, those who continue to train day in and day out even in times of peace.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t care for samurai, but I also know all too well how fearsome a true samurai can be.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The reason we refer to them as hooligans isn&#39;t because we despise them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s because compared to a swordsman, ninja are no better than the bales of straw they use for practice.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If we were to try one of our illusions on someone who had truly reached the pinnacle of sword mastery, they would see right through it immediately.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s true. I&#39;d say old man Tajima is just one step away from reaching that pinnacle himself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm...Now that I&#39;ve said that out loud, it seems strange. His skills should more than put him at the pinnacle...so why does he still seem like he&#39;s one step away from it?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Your skills are nothing to scoff at either, Lady Musashi. There is no doubt that you are a true swordmaster yourself. I will never forget what it was like to face the fearsome Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And thank you for not holding back on that last strike.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You helped me to shake off the last vestiges of the fog that had been hanging over my mind! For but a moment, I thought it was curtains for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did great, Kotarou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for obliging her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Anything for you, Master! For my part, I learned a lot from this as well!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahaha, no need to exaggerate, Kotarou. I never stopped holding back during our fight. I wasn&#39;t actually trying to kill you, after all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Um...what? Are you sure...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Absolutely. I&#39;m real sure. Now come on, I finally got paid for all my hard work, even if it was just chump change! We need some drinks. DRINKS!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then again, we can&#39;t go out and leave Onui and Tasuke on their own...Never mind the drinks. Let&#39;s just buy an ichimai-zuri and head back to Otama&#39;s room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ichimai-zuri...The tile block things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Edo newspapers! Super-retro newspapers!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s an ichimai-zuri seller just over there. He&#39;s drawing quite a crowd.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So that&#39;s where our audience disappeared to. It&#39;s one thing to see ichimai-zuri in Edo or Osaka, but I&#39;m surprised to see it being sold here in Toke.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>This version of Toke&#39;s castle town is like a second Edo. It was never this prosperous in our timeline.</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>Emergency! The monsters that terrorized all of Shimousa are back and threatening villages everywhere!</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>As you all know, Lord Matsudaira resides in Toke Castle! What&#39;s more, he is now joined by Lord Tajima-no-Kami, a great samurai who hails from Edo!</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>And yet, this morning, the castle received a shocking letter!</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>None could have guessed at its grim contents!</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>...Someone is coming to murder Lord Matsudaira&#39;s beloved daughter, Lady Kiyohime!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...What?</p><p><strong>Ichimai-Zuri Seller:</strong></p><p>Would YOU like to know more? It&#39;s all here in this ichimai-zuri! Now now, no jostling! First come, first served!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t Kiyohime that strange princess we ran into the other day?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The one who was head over heels for Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Does this mean someone is threatening to assassinate Lady Kiyohime at Toke Castle, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is terrible news.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For now, we should head to Toke Castle ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Agreed. We may not know for sure that the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are involved with this, but we also don&#39;t know for sure that they&#39;re not.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, they&#39;d never let us into the castle...but if old man Tajima is there, maybe he&#39;ll be willing to fill us in.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, let&#39;s get going. Right after we buy an ichimai-zuri, of course!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...I have delivered the letter warning them of our plans to assassinate Matsudaira&#39;s daughter.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>By now, ten of Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s samurai should be guarding her, and rumors should be circulating throughout the town.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Everything is as you commanded. I shall see that the next steps are carried out to your liking as well, Lord Sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I will only follow my lord&#39;s orders. Even if I become a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster with a Curse of Annihilation, that will never change.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That is what it means to be a ninja. That is what it means to be me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>However. However...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Something deep within this etheric body of mine gives me pause.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I must be wavering. Am I truly myself...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In one sense, that&#39;s no different than when I was alive. Back then, I would always ask myself who I was.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In that case, there is no need for concern. I am already a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster. Whether as a human or as a Heroic Spirit, I am nothing more than a husk; a blade to be wielded.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I slash, I sever, and I kill. That is all I am.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Good. Sow chaos in the humans&#39; minds.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Inferno&#39;s efforts have planted the seeds of unease in Shimousa. No matter how much Shinmen Musashi or the one from Chaldea swing their blades...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>No matter how many dogs Edo sends...they will not easily be able to rid the populace of their fears.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Now, we shall nurture those seeds. Make sure the populace knows you intend to kill their princess, let the panic spread, and then assassinate her. Do that, and the fear will take hold of them all.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>They will quail with fright, and stare helplessly at their impending deaths. Once they do, their souls will become even better sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Become fear itself, Para\xEDso. All you need do is stay true to the serpent within.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>As you wish.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Then go, and see that it is done.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...Looks like the Lord Sorcerer is gone now.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>So, Lady Para\xEDso. As I have no understanding of sorcery, could I ask you to explain something to me?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>What did he mean by \u201Cthe serpent within\u201D? You certainly do not look as if there is a snake within you.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>As far as these eyes can see, you are but a fair maiden with beautiful black hair. There is no serpent here.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>It is none of your business, bodyguard. All you need worry about is keeping the Lord Sorcerer safe.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>My my, you&#39;re no fun either, are you? If I must, I will get out of your hair.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>If you happen to have a message to pass along to Lord Sorcerer, I&#39;d be happy to give it to him.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I do not. Now go.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Understood. Farewell, Lady Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Oh, one last thing. It is said if a snake peers too long at something lustrous, it will put its eyes out.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>So take heed to avoid that which gleams. I would hate for something to happen to your elegant countenance.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hehehehehehehe. \u201CNow go,\u201D huh. How adorable. Here&#39;s a tip: the next time a cutie talks to you, all you have to do is smile.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I wonder what&#39;s got your panties all in a twist. What&#39;s going on in that too-cool head of yours?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Something about how a proper ninja should conduct herself? Or maybe how a proper Heroic Spirit should behave?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m close. I can tell. Ahh, what a joke. You&#39;re a descendant of Saburou, who the god of Ooe cursed, right?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Why are you even thinking about this?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t waste time agonizing over it, just kill them all. Consume them all. All you have to do is murder everyone.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>After all, this whole world&#39;s nothing but a dream. In that case, why not go ahead and do whatever you feel like?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Be silent, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Oh no, I said that out loud. This is bad. What am I doing? She&#39;s nothing but an illusion!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. An illusion. All the real Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell is doing is standing next to me, smiling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>She hasn&#39;t spoken a single word to me...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ahh, not again. Just looking at Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell makes the curse inside me bubble up to the surface!</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s the matter, Para\xEDso? Hehe, I didn&#39;t say anything, you know?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh, right, it must be that curse of yours again. Sorry, there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t have the faintest idea what it is you&#39;re seeing or hearing. Okay? I didn&#39;t say a thing.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not trying to be mean here, you know? I hope you understand that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I understand. I do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I understand everything. That&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I seek it. Even though my soul has been violated by karma, I still seek it.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...I only included the princess&#39;s name in the letter I delivered to the castle.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>But I will not settle for just her.

However...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>I respectfully ask that you understand your place, and not take what she says at face value.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t worry about that one bit.</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>I must say though, I&#39;m surprised to see people so young were responsible for slaying that monster.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>Lord Matsudaira said you must have trained very hard indeed, especially given that the world is at peace.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, I wouldn&#39;t go that far! I mean, I guess I am a bit stronger than most people you come across?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But trust me, there are plenty of swordsmen out there who are waaay stronger.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course, there are also people like Kotarou and Fujimaru, who have a different sort of strength to them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But if we&#39;re strictly talking about martial arts,then I&#39;d say old man Tajima is easily stronger than me.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>Well, of course he is. He&#39;s the invincible Yagyu Munenori.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>If we&#39;re discussing who the greatest swordmasters under the sun are, there are two names that come to mind.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>The first is Miyamoto Musashi, the master of dual-wielding. And the second is Edo&#39;s own Yagyuu Tajima.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I-is that so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I, uh, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So Musashi is famous even in the Edo period.</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>Edo period? If you mean the city of Edo, yes, I understand they talk about Miyamoto quite a bit there.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>Even now that the age of war is over, our lords still love to discuss who would win if Musashi and Yagyuu Tajima were ever to cross swords.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahahaha...Y-you don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Hey, does that line up with your history? &#39;Cause this is seriously the first I&#39;ve ever heard of this! )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Yes, it does. There are records that date back to the early Edo period that describe your popularity. I believe you were the most popular among the people, Lady Musashi. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Huh. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t root for the home guy. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Miyamoto Musashi has always been popular. You have appeared in countless stories well beyond the Edo period. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Oh, I guess that part does kind of sound like me. I do end up wandering into all sorts of times and places. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(That isn&#39;t what I meant...)</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ACastle Staff:</strong></p><p>All right, I shall go and fetch the princess. Please wait here until I return.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, don&#39;t worry about us. We&#39;re happy to wait.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Phew. This is kind of nerve-wracking, isn&#39;t it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to believe they let us into the castle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wish we could have brought Onui and Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know...but we were already overstaying our welcome. Grandpa was pretty upset, and who can blame him?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We were supposed to bring them back later that same day, and we ended up disappearing for two days without a word.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What were you thinking!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I come all this way to the castle town myself after you never came back, and what do I find?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You and the kids spent not just one, but TWO nights in a geisha&#39;s room!? Why didn&#39;t you call me!? Thinkin&#39; I wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve enjoyed a geisha&#39;s company too!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Uh, I mean, that&#39;s a part of it, but that&#39;s not the point! &#39;Sides, I ain&#39;t got time to spend with women right now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>First I hear you went down to the south to fight a monster, and then I get here to find out you just LEFT Onui and Tasuke to fend for themselves?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought they would be safe with Otama...</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right, Mr. Muramasa! You tell them!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Not only did they not leave when they said they would, they started treating my room like they owned the place.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Granted, it WAS a little lonely staying in such a large room all by myself...</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>So I thought a little company might not be so bad. But still! It&#39;s the principle of the thing.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>If nothing else, the men could&#39;ve been considerate enough to stay in a nearby room!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hm? Oh, yes. Good point.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you made this much trouble for a lady you&#39;d never met before. Anyway, things may have worked out this time...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But don&#39;t go making a habit of this. Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes sir!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Y-yes sir. I&#39;m sorry, Grandpa!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Better. All right, I&#39;m taking Onui and Tasuke back to the hermitage with me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You can keep staying at this fancy inn of yours if you want, or go and get work at the castle.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You can even come back to my hermitage if you like.... The kids&#39;ll probably miss you if you don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d be glad to go back with you after we finish our business at the castle. Are you okay with that, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know I feel a lot more at ease inside its barrier,and I bet Kotarou will feel much the same way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides...If worse comes to worst again,there won&#39;t be any innocents getting killed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all go back once we&#39;ve been to the castle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait a moment. Back when Inferno attacked, didn&#39;t she say she couldn&#39;t involve the town in your battle?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If that&#39;s right, wouldn&#39;t it also be safe to remain here? I just thought it was worth asking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Restraint hasn&#39;t really been their thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If we&#39;re wrong, the people here will pay the price.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Understood. To be honest, Master, I knew you would choose to avoid the town, so that its people wouldn&#39;t suffer.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hey. Redhead.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t recognize your face,but I can tell you&#39;re a Servant. Who are you?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s been one honor after another, getting to meet Lady Musashi and Senji Muramasa. I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s a Servant!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Of course, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a Heroic Spirit that was summoned to this world for some reason, not a Chaldean Servant.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And yet, he&#39;s neither a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster,nor a candidate to become one.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>At least, Purgatorio\u2013Houzouin Inshun never said anything to that effect.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So the only possibilities I can think of are a chain summon, or...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How were things here while I was out all day? Did you and Danzo get to know each other better?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I...Huh? Where did that come from!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come to think of it, Kotarou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know, you seemed pretty into Danzo...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not you too, Master. Please don&#39;t tease me like that. Whatever it is you think I have to feel guilty about,I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Besides, I haven&#39;t seen her all day. I believe she went back to Lord Tajima.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>At any rate, there&#39;s nothing to be gained from teasing me. Serving you is the most important\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Hehe, you all sound like you&#39;re having so much fun!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Please tell me what you were discussing,[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>My lady, you are standing much too close to your guest. I implore you to give [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] some space!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Hmph. And why should I?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Princess. Try not to make too much trouble for your retainers.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh...all right. You&#39;re so strict, Lord Tajima-no-Kami. But, I suppose a lady does need to behave modestly.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It is a pleasure to see you and your retainers again, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru. Oh, I see you have another in your retinue now.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a shame you didn&#39;t bring those darling children with you as well. I do love children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t seen you in two whole days, princess.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I know! Each day felt like a year!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I guess she really isn&#39;t the Kiyohime I know...)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Her resemblance to the Kiyohime we know is uncanny! It&#39;s just like Otama and Tamamo-no-Mae! )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(But, this Kiyohime isn&#39;t a Servant. I can&#39;t sense anything like that from her. She is definitely human. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(And even putting her affection for Master aside, her personality seems a bit different from the Kiyohime we know. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Does this mean Shimousa really is a Singularity, or something like it? ...No, that doesn&#39;t quite feel right...)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Holy Grails distort the history of the period where they appear. But I haven&#39;t seen anything like that here...)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(It feels more like...something is different about the fundamental premise of this world...)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, are you discussing secrets amongst yourselves? I guess men do like to do that, no matter how old they are.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t have many secrets myself. Though I suppose others might not see it that way.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>In fact, I can talk to snakes! My retainers don&#39;t believe me, but it&#39;s true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Snakes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh, snakes? Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They even have that in common! N-no, wait. The Kiyohime we know doesn&#39;t converse with animals...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But it&#39;s still an uncanny coincidence that she would have some connection to snakes!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She has snakes in common with someone? Who are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Hmm, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not quite sure what you mean. Are you referring to me, or someone else?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Princess, might I suggest that we focus on the matter at hand?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, yes. Sorry, Lord Tajima. Distinguished guests, thank you all again for coming here.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I am told that you were instrumental in the battle against the monsters that attacked Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>On behalf of my father, Matsudaira Shimousa-no-Kami,I commend you for your achievement.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I shall ensure that you are well rewarded. Please be sure to see my retainer about that later.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I would also like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, not as a princess, but as a citizen of Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I cannot tell you how happy we all were to hear the news. I have no doubt that everyone in Shimousa feels the same.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>You are far too kind to these commoners, my lady. Don&#39;t let it go to your heads, you rabble.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Pfft. Verily, thy praise doth instilleth great...eth joy in our hearts, milady!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What she said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what he said.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Haha, no need to be so formal! Class need never come between us, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite welcome.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>How insolent.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s fine, Lord Tajima. [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru can say whatever [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] likes to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Well then, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru! Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let&#39;s move on to more urgent matters!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I believe you have all heard the rumors concerning me?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We have. They said you&#39;d received a letter. And judging by your expression, I&#39;m guessing it wasn&#39;t a very nice one.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...No, it wasn&#39;t. Indeed, it was the most painful letter I have ever received.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>And with so many lives lost when it was delivered,I doubt it is merely an ill-considered prank.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>No, I&#39;m afraid that there truly is someone out there who means to end my life.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I have many warriors serving me here. And we also have Lord Tajima and his five-hundred-odd elite samurai, all of whom took part in the Shimabara Rebellion.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Perhaps it isn&#39;t proper for me to say this,but...even so, I am frightened out of my wits...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>They are all doing their best to keep me safe,so I feel terrible that I&#39;m still so ill at ease...</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Princess...I do not blame you for feeling that way at all, what with such an awful letter arriving so soon after this monster business.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Still, I will say this nonetheless! [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Please, I beg of you: protect me from this vile villain who threatens my life!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I see. The princess has entrusted these commoners with her protection without considering the consequences.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Indeed, my lord, there is no other way to put it! I understand that the princess is fond of them, but they are still commoners!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>It would be one thing if they were all masterless samurai, but some of them are not even that!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Even letting them into the castle is madness! Why,this could even affect the clan&#39;s very existence!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I see. So you say that these people are a threat to the clan. You may be right...if this were a time of peace.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>However, times are anything but peaceful now. These monsters pose a threat we cannot ignore. If there are skilled warriors willing to aid us in defeating them, their station in life is no longer relevant.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>And I can personally attest to their combat prowess.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>They put an end to the monster that attacked us. Indeed, many of my own men who were present at that battle are still singing their praises even now.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Or do you doubt my judgment?</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>N-no, my lord. I-I would never dream of it.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Hahahaha, I was merely joking! Yes, I may have referred to them as untrustworthy strangers, but, uh...haha.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>With the princess personally requesting their protection, and your endorsement of their skill, I have no objections!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Hahahahaha! Wh-why, it is most reassuring to have such upstanding young warriors helping us!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>All right everyone, make sure you all take good care of the princess!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Very well then, you WILL see that the princess&#39;s safety is assured. Fail, and your heads will roll.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>W-well...Uh...What do we do now, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t ignore this threat.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Same. I figured you would say as much, and you didn&#39;t disappoint. I wonder why you turned out like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We&#39;ve both been to all sorts of places, so what is it that makes us so different in that regard?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I agree with you. If we don&#39;t do something,the princess will definitely end up dead.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit Swordmaster must be behind this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. It seems very unlikely that this is a wholly new threat. It must be one of the remaining five.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And given that this is imperial land that&#39;s fairly close to Edo, I doubt it&#39;s politically motivated.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So yeah, there&#39;s no way we can ignore this. It&#39;s lucky they&#39;re letting us stay in the castle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll go along with whatever you decide, Master.... I knew you would want to help.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Mmm. Mmmmmmm. I don&#39;t know if I care for how this matter seems to have been settled without me. Shouldn&#39;t I get a say in it too?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh well, it worked out how I wanted while I was off fretting, so I guess it&#39;s all right. Hooray!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ll be protecting me personally,[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru...I&#39;m so happy I could die...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Our job is to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Hehe. I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m just so happy, I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>By the way, Lady Swordfighter? I&#39;m told you were the one who defeated the monsters&#39; leader.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Is that true?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s just that if it is true, you deserve the highest of accolades.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh yes, it&#39;s all true. I sliced her clean in half.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Though I couldn&#39;t have done it without your beloved Fujimaru&#39;s help, or this expertly crafted sword.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh my, that&#39;s amazing! I guess it just goes to show how strong women can truly be!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I knew you were someone special from the moment I saw your sword ki in town.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>As a woman myself, I couldn&#39;t be happier. You&#39;ve truly inspired me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Inspired you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait. You don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>In fact, hehe, I&#39;m actually something of a martial artist myself! As the daughter of a samurai family, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time training!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Believe me, I still remember</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did help cause all that trouble in town...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I...I promise you, I&#39;m not a burden. I will gladly accept your protection, of course, but I assure you that I won&#39;t be a burden.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>And to prove it, I would like to ask for you to spar with me, Lady Swordfighter. Would you be so kind?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Me? I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t go around fighting unless there&#39;s something to be gained from it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, there&#39;s no need to worry about that. How many ryou will it take to satisfy you? Ten? Twenty?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I have thought about it carefully, and nothing would honor me greater than to spar with you, princess! For thirty ryou, I&#39;ll even show you my secret techniques!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi, your face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have never seen you so excited...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahaha, oh come on, sure you have. Anyway, will you be sparring alone, princess?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course I&#39;ll go easy on you, but I still wouldn&#39;t recommend facing me all by yourself.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Very well, then I shall add to my numbers. Danzo!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, my lady. I am here.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>This nice swordfighter will be joining me for a training session, and I would request your assistance.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>As you wish, my lady. Lord Tajima-no-Kami has ordered me to obey your instructions, so that is what I shall do.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Oh, if it isn&#39;t Lord Kotarou and Lady Musashi. I see you are here too, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Thank you all again for your cooperation with the monster hunt the other day.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Now, since we do not have anything to catch up on...let us proceed with the princess&#39;s training.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re very straightforward, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Indeed. That is how we puppets are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> O-okay.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Good.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Very well then, Lady Swordfighter and [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru! I shall demonstrate the flammable water I imported from foreign lands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait a second...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re talking about oil</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Now, let us begin! ...Um, right after I change into my training outfit!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tiger:</strong></p><p>GRAAAW! (Flump)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Th-this battle is ours! The tiger(? ) the princess summoned has rolled over and shown its belly!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...My apologies, princess. I simply wasn&#39;t strong enough.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>(Sniff) You win! I can&#39;t believe you tamed my imported tiger so easily!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>But I am tremendously impressed by your skill, Lady Swordfighter and [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru. You are both equally wonderful!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahaha, thanks. It&#39;s a little embarrassing to be praised THAT highly.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, uh, you haven&#39;t forgotten about our financial agreement, right...?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, come to think of it, Lady Swordfighter...earlier,I heard you addressed as Musashi...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Did you...perhaps name yourself after the famous swordmaster, Miyamoto Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Uh...G-good question. Ahahaha. I don&#39;t really remember where my name comes from.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>You MUST be as strong as the real Musashi! In fact, I&#39;m sure of it! That&#39;s amazing!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>May I ask what sort of training you underwent in order to become so strong?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>W-well, uh, I don&#39;t think my regimen will be of much help to anyone besides me, but...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Basically, I travel around visiting different countries looking for opportunities to train, I guess? Huh, when I put it like that, it actually sounds kind of normal.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>So you travel to distant lands,training wherever you go!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you travel around like that by yourself...I&#39;d love to hear more about it!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, but first, we should have supper.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Then we can take a bath and throw pillows at each other, then you can tell me all about your exploits! It&#39;ll be a wonderful sleepover!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait, huh? We&#39;re going to throw pillows at each other?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Now come, right this way. Supper should be ready by now! Quickly, quickly!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>H-huh? Hey, stop pulling my\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What a heartwarming scene. Though I&#39;m afraid it looks like you&#39;ve been dumped, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m honestly glad they&#39;re enjoying themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I see. I&#39;m glad to hear that, Master.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Very well then, I shall be taking my leave. Lord Kotarou, I was most impressed with your ninjutsu.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Not at all. I was more impressed by yours.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh my, so you really have been to countries outside of Japan!? That must have been a terribly difficult journey.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Being in a strange land, where you can neither speak nor read the language? And all by yourself, no less!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t imagine being in a place like that all by myself, with almost nothing familiar nearby...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>The thought terrifies me...But, for some reason,it also sounds kind of wonderful...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I could never do something like that...But, part of me would love to try!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;d be surprised how well you can get by, even with a language barrier. Some people will help you learn to speak, and you can also get pretty far with gestures.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>People are basically the same no matter where you go,and scary things are scary no matter where you are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I&#39;d say the scary stuff and fun stuff balance each other out.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sure, there are times when I&#39;m suddenly overcome with an urge to go back home...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But on the whole, it&#39;s a lot of fun to meet so many new people.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I see. That sounds lovely.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>The only unusual thing that has ever happened to me is rescuing a baby snake out in the castle garden.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Ever since then, I&#39;ve gotten along well with snakes. I can even tell what they&#39;re thinking.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So you have a telepathic bond with them! That&#39;s awesome!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But you know, princess, Shimousa is pretty diverse. There&#39;s all sorts of people to meet right outside the castle doors.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You met that snake here, after all, and you met Fujimaru, Kotarou, and me here too.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh, that&#39;s a good point. Hehe, you&#39;ve got me there. Come to think of it, Lady Musashi...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Did you know [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru before you met [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] here?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, I first met [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] on an island not too long ago. That was a pretty rough time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At first, my memories were so fuzzy that I didn&#39;t even know who I was or where I was from.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh my, that sounds dreadful! What sort of island was it!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, it was a small island,but it had a surprisingly steep mountain...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, Kotarou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re, um...kind of in my personal space?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>My apologies, Master. However, I must stand near you. I have to keep you safe.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>With the assassin&#39;s threat hanging over us, danger could strike at any moment.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We must remain vigilant,even in our sleeping quarters.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters know you are a Master of Chaldea, right? Then we can&#39;t take any chances.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get that. But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t fall asleep if you&#39;re that close...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I-I&#39;m so sorry, Master. However, I am the only Chaldean Servant who has been able to properly materialize here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>As such, it falls to me to ensure your safety. So I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And since Lady Musashi is staying with the princess, it is my job to guard you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So, you may not like it, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, I can sense them. They&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Go on men, get her! This villain has had the gall to infiltrate the castle. See to it that she never leaves!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>How courageous. Indeed, you samurai certainly do talk a good game.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Come to think of it, there was another one yapping up a storm earlier. At first I thought it was a guard dog, but it seems he was actually one of your comrades.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Here, maybe you can tell me who he was. I just happen to have a souvenir here with me.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>A severed head! You&#39;re a monster...It looks like it was removed with one clean cut.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>You may be our enemy, but I can see that you are terribly skilled. As such, we will not hesitate to attack you five...no, ten at a time!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...How terribly dull. This is why I don&#39;t enjoy fighting you little knife-wielders. You&#39;re so used to killing and being killed.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>No doubt that holds true even in this newly peaceful world. And of course, there are still those of you who survived Osaka and Shimabara.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Still...even the most battle-hardened samurai collapses into a quivering mess as his entire body is twisted apart.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Grrr! You impudent little ninja!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Good, they&#39;re here. Listen up! We have no fewer than twenty men on our side! You were arrogant to come here all on your own!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Well well, look at you all scurrying around like cockroaches...How idiotic. Indeed, this is the very height of stupidity.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Enough! Give yourself up, or die!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Ordinarily, I would be glad to indulge your idiocy.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>But alas, it seems the Master of Chaldea and [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] pet ninja have arrived sooner than I expected.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Men of Matsudaira! Leave this monster to us!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Y-you&#39;re the ones who were entrusted with the princess! Fret not. She can&#39;t overcome so many of us!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid you are mistaken. Remember what happened during the monster hunt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Humans are no match for a Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please trust us. Monsters are our specialty.</p><hr><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>H-hmm...I suppose you have a point. Even some of Lord Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s men said they were helpless against that monster...</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>I cannot tell if this ninja is one of their ilk as well, but...!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Oh, very well! I will let you lot deal with this...thing! But should you lose, we will not hesitate to step in!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Of course.... Master, may I ask for your assistance?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Hmm...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Well? Are you done chattering with each other? Which of you will be the first to die?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What is it, Master of Chaldea? Something not to your liking?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Hmph, what is that pitiable gleam in your eyes?

Heh. Hahahahaha! It seems you are not only a Master of Chaldea, but a master of comedy too!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Of all the things I thought you might say,I never expected that.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I haven&#39;t laughed so hard in ages.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>That said...You may make an imposing figure, but you clearly still have the mind of a child.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Is the female form such a rare sight for you? /\u2640 As a woman yourself, I fail to see what shocks you so much. ]</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>In that case, I should have snuck into your bedroom and killed you in your sleep in order to spare you the shock. Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s enough, Heroic Spirit Swordmaster! You will cease mocking my Master at once!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were one of the Servants we met in bamboo forest!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Assassin of Para\xEDso!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Indeed, my Cursed Name is Assassin of Para\xEDso,one of the embodiments of the Curse of Annihilation.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>And you are the Master of Chaldea,along with one of your Servants.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Good, good. It is unfortunate that Shinmen Musashi is not here, but I suppose I cannot wait any longer.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Here is our message, direct from our master! Make no mistake: this is a declaration of war!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>The Lord Sorcerer will wield the power of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, against Shimousa, using it as a sacrifice to bring about the end of the world of men!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A sorcerer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s who your master is!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>This world created by the Tokugawa clan shall end once the Lord Sorcerer&#39;s ambitions are realized!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Rejoice! Rejoice, and die while you are in the throes of joy! Shimousa shall be the first to fall; a sacrifice made so our master&#39;s wish will come true!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Therefore, I must dispose of the next in line to rule this land. Of course, I am referring to Matsudaira Shimousa-no-Kami&#39;s beloved daughter.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>News of her death will devastate Shimousa&#39;s people, and their despair will make this land so easy to destroy.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So making the people despair is all part of your plan...and killing the princess will accomplish that?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Hehe, correct. My orders are clear. I have been told to be sure that the people know of our plan before I carry it out. Truly, the life of a ninja devoted to her master is one of endless difficulty.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Now then, Master of Chaldea! I will of course be taking your life as well!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>It seems that the princess is very fond of you. I wonder how horrified she will be when I toss your head into her lap!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ll never find out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My head&#39;s staying right where it is!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We shall see about that.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>In fact, let me show you just how easy it will be to take it.</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>What the...!? A snake? I can&#39;t get it off! G-gaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>U-urk! G-gaaaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...There we go. Did you see how easy that was?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I just took all twenty of these men&#39;s heads. If I include the ones earlier at the rear gate, and from when I delivered the letter...that makes forty dead.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Human life is a fleeting, fragile thing. Almost too fleeting, in fact.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>As you can see...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Once my snake-charm techniques swallow them up, their heads are the least of their worries.

I&#39;ll make sure to stop you.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>You are free to do whatever you like. I shall do the same. Come forth, my dark minions!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We must break through to Para\xEDso and take her out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Eeeeeek! M-monsters...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Their distorted voices drip with malice...S-so these are the monsters terrorizing Shimousa...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>L-Lady Musashi, I...I&#39;m so ashamed. I&#39;m so scared I can&#39;t even stand.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, that scared the hell out of me! Not to mention the shock of sensing their evil ki! Where do they get off popping up in our bedroom like that right after we put out the lights!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Who do they think they are, the bat monster I fought in Himeji Castle!? Princess, get behind me!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m going to make these shameless creatures wish they&#39;d never surprised me and interrupted our sleepover!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The battle is over. We&#39;ve defeated all the hostiles!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You fought well, Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Think nothing of it. Those creatures were no match for me. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s grateful for your assistance, Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thanks to you, we completely dominated the enemy despite their greater numbers. Now then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, you kind of sounded like Mash there!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, I suppose I did. I guess that&#39;s because I&#39;m now in the same position of keeping you safe, just like she used to!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I must have unwittingly modeled myself after her! Now then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I have a question for you, Assassin of Para\xEDso. Do you harbor a Curse of Annihilation as well?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Are you certain you aren&#39;t going against your own\u2013your original Heroic Spirit&#39;s wishes by acting like this?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What sort of question is that? Who do you think we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We are the shadows of figures who have made their mark on humanity. We are neither ghosts, nor evil spirits, nor vengeful specters.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>And of course, we are not Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We Heroic Spirit Swordmasters carry blades created to slash this world to pieces. Storms of power given form.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We kill men. We kill women. We kill the old and the young. Not even infants escape our grasp...That is what Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We skewer with spears, burn with fire, and twist off heads. Our means of cleansing this world are endless.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Doesn&#39;t doing those things eat away at your soul?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>My soul? What a strange question.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Soul...My soul, hmm? What a sentimental Heroic Spirit you are.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What about your Holy Grail War rituals, where many of you Heroic Spirits come together to kill one another?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Would you rattle on with the same nonsense during one of those? How does your soul feel when you kill other Heroic Spirits to grant your lord&#39;s wish?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t make me laugh.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t ask you that because I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit. I asked you as a fellow ninja.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So once again, tell me: Doesn&#39;t doing those things eat away at your soul?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>It seems that sincerity can devolve into obstinacy, or even madness, if left unchecked. It pains me to see what an immature whelp you are.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m stronger than you are.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve defeated every monster you&#39;ve thrown at us. You can&#39;t stop me with creatures so weak.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Surrender, Assassin of Para\xEDso!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>You little brat!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>A mere Fuuma boy like you is in no position to make demands of me!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll twist your head off and feed it to my snakes! Let&#39;s see if your righteous soul makes you taste any better!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I am no boy. I am the fifth head of the Fuuma ninja clan...My True Name is Fuuma Kotarou!

I&#39;m counting on your help!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m proud of you for trying to talk to her!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I was actually just copying you, Master! Besides, many other Heroic Spirits have done the same thing!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not to mention that I was obligated to say something, given my position!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...At any rate, it seems there is nothing left to do now but fight!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>How!? How is this possible!? You are just an ordinary Heroic Spirit, and I possess the power of a warped Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>This...cannot be happening.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...No matter how incredibly strong you may be,even you still have moments of vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You should be ashamed of yourself, Heroic Spirit Swordmaster. You refuse to face the terrible truth of what it means to become nothing more than a blade.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>A ninja without a soul is nothing more than a hollow blade. In forgetting that, you proved your immaturity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m sorry for getting so sentimental, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait! The Swordmasters&#39; Spirit Cores aren&#39;t normal!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I know. Lady Musashi told me about them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Go on, why don&#39;t you pick yourself up now? I know you&#39;re not really dead.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What a boring little boy you are. You could at least act surprised when I come back to life.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAssassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Indeed, decapitation will not kill us. Surely you know as much from what happened with Purgatorio?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>There, you see? No matter how sharp your techniques may be, they have no effect on us.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>And so, I&#39;m afraid all your boasting from your earlier \u201Cvictory\u201D amounts to nothing.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>We are neither heroes that once lived, nor their Heroic Spirits. We are merely their vessels!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>More than that, we have been strengthened beyond belief! We are invincible! No one can kill us!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(I knew it.

And without Lady Musashi&#39;s Myoujingiri Muramasa, there&#39;s nothing I can do!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Here ya go!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Huh!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Sh-she threw her Muramasa!? A one of a kind masterpiece of a sword!? What a waste! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Damn, I missed! Nice catch, Kotarou! Let me have that back now!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Of course! Here you are, Lady Musashi!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I never thought you would try to strike me down from behind! I am an Assassin. How did you sneak up on me?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Now I see. You didn&#39;t sneak up on me; you simply threw your sword at me from a distance! What a poor excuse for a swordsman you are, Shinmen Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Oh my, that was truly incredible! I&#39;m amazed you were able to strike at her with such accuracy from so far away, Lady Musashi!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a shame that this villain was quick enough to evade it. I&#39;m afraid my own naginata and flammable water won&#39;t be of much use here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lady Kiyohime!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing!? This assassin is here for YOU!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>M-Master is right, Lady Musashi! You should have at least left her with Lord Tajima!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What were you thinking, bringing the princess here!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know, I know! I didn&#39;t CHOOSE to bring her here! She just sorta...tagged along!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...How fortunate.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Huh?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m disappointed in you, Para\xEDso. Resorting to kunai at this point? Did you really think Lady Musashi and I wouldn&#39;t notice?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Hardly. If anything, I was certain you would.... Even I am no match for Fuuma Kotarou and Shinmen Musashi together.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Spoken like someone getting ready to slither away. Do you really think we&#39;ll let you escape?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Of course not. I know very well you would never let me go. Which is why I already made arrangements.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Hrn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A phantom...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When did she swap places with it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The sky...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Huh? Was that an illusion? A clone? Did that assassin just up and disappear!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks that way. Ugh, I hate dealing with ninja. They always have some trick up their sleeve!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m, uh...I&#39;m sorry, Lady Musashi...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We ninja aren&#39;t used to fair fights\u2013or at least, it isn&#39;t something we usually plan for\u2013so we tend to resort to tricks without really thinking...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, I&#39;m not blaming you. Come on, chin up. The fact that I find you tough to fight is a compliment more than anything.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You ninja sure are strong. You plan ahead for all sorts of situations, so you manage to survive even when it&#39;s one against many.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Take that kunoichi we just fought, for example. Um...What was her name again? We saw her in the bamboo forest too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s the Assassin of Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This might be my first time fighting a kunoichi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So, this Assassin of Para\xEDso woman is the third Heroic Spirit Swordmaster you and Master have fought.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There aren&#39;t many kunoichi who are adept at combat,and even fewer opportunities to meet them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Uh, what I mean is...we may be able to figure out her True Name!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>After all, there just aren&#39;t that many famous kunoichi in history!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure her sex will be a huge help here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s not a huge number of known ninja in general...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Oh. G-good point. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? Why&#39;re you looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>N-no reason. We just happen to know a lot of examples where historical figures who were thought to be men turned out to be women.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So I was just thinking about how history is much deeper than we usually think it is. Oh, and I&#39;m sure there are examples of the opposite as well.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Feels like you swept all that under the rug a little quickly...But, I guess it&#39;s okay. Right, Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I am here. My apologies;I did not wish to interrupt your conversation.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Tajima has called for every samurai under his command to assemble at once. He will be here momentarily.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>As long as Lady Musashi and [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru are here with me, I don&#39;t really need anyone else...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>By the way, what happened to the castle&#39;s retainers? I would have thought they&#39;d be here long ago...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Twenty of them died valiantly in battle.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I...I see...So, they perished at that villain&#39;s hands...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Then, even though there&#39;s no trace of their bodies, this blood here must be...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whoa, that was close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice catch, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess this IS a lot for her to take in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Poor princess...You can&#39;t blame her for being in shock.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>She must have passed out from sheer anguish. Not to worry, I shall attend to her with the utmost care and precision.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou, I see that you too are injured. Allow me to treat your wounds as well.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Th-thank you, but I&#39;m all right. I can&#39;t be treated by ordinary means, since I&#39;m not huma\u2013</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait, did you not hear about me from Lord Tajima?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>N-never mind. It&#39;s fine if you haven&#39;t. My point is, I&#39;m all right, so please just look after the princess.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Understood.</p><h2 id="section-9-terza-cantica-paraiso-ending" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-terza-cantica-paraiso-ending" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Terza Cantica: Para\xEDso (Ending)</h2><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...Everything is going exactly as we planned.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Our two ninja are the key. Para\xEDso and Danzo have both done their jobs well.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The groundwork for Onriedo is now as good as laid. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Soon, the glory of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, will be known far and wide, and Onriedo will stand tall upon this ground!</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Not only is fear spreading throughout Shimousa...but the great pentagram being drawn in secret via Jesuit sorcery is about to be completed as well.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Correct. The Lord Sorcerer has treaded the path of chaos and carnage to attain these secret mystical arts.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It is through these arts that Heroic Spirits and karma were fused together to produce the Curse of Annihilation.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>We Heroic Spirit Swordmasters kill and slaughter. We will consume the world itself.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>If I could speak without fear of being misunderstood, I would say that we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are beings designed expressly for the destruction of humanity.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>We sow death merely by existing. With a single breath, we spread curses.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>This means Lord Satan himself has seen fit to bestow his protection upon us! Now, it is only a matter of time until our Lord Sorcerer&#39;s wish is granted!</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>What a hassle. Why do we not simply cut them all down at once?</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>There is little difference between humans and straw. All that sets them apart is that humans bundle themselves together of their own accord and call it society.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Now now, Saber of Empireo, patience. There are no shortcuts to success.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Much like a curse, our goal must be realized as though we are slowly choking our enemy with a silk cord.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Slowly, painstakingly, without mercy. Roughly, brutally, without mercy.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I see you lot are once again focused on truly morbid topics. I have been here several nights now, and yet I still cannot stomach your favored subjects.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Not a single one of you appreciates this beautiful moon. Unfathomable. I cannot see how the Lord Sorcerer&#39;s supposed to relax like this.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>What do you want, cretin?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hmm...</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Grant me a bit of leeway, I am merely making conversation. I also brought the Lord Sorcerer with me.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Indeed.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Go forth and kill, my Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. As the dawning sun brings an end to the night, you shall bring an end to this world of false peace.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Vengeful souls of those you have killed and harvested...Souls dripping with magical energy upon your own deaths...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>They are all valuable. They will all serve as the foundations for my ambition, and help create Onriedo in Shimousa so very soon.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Para\xEDso has done an excellent job. The humans&#39; hearts have been tainted with fear and dread, and have gained a hue fitting for their final days.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Now, forty-odd samurai have been slaughtered within the castle...There may not be many dead, but they will still serve to terrorize the populace.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It is as you desired.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>All that remains...is to grant Para\xEDso a leave of absence.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>A leave? May I ask why?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>There is nothing more to say than what I have already said.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I knew to be wary of Musashi and the Master of Chaldea, but I didn&#39;t expect that little whelp to be so strong.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What a careless blunder on my part.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Hmm...Blunder does not begin to cover it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Not only did I fail to kill the princess, I even let that Chaldean escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Still, I may have come out empty-handed in battle, but I did fulfill my true objective by seeing to our preparations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I made sure to leave the designated patterns all throughout the castle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And thanks to the cursed seals the Caster of Limbo entrusted to me, they will be so well hidden that no one will find them.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Ngh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>At any rate, I&#39;ve used far too much magical energy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I haven&#39;t been so exhausted since I first materialized. I suppose I should have expected as much after battling a Servant.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Stupid brat, thinking he knows better than me. I&#39;ll make sure to kill him next time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s another reason why I need to hurry back to base. There&#39;s no guarantee they won&#39;t come after me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>First, I need to restore my magical energy. Then, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>My my. Running away in defeat? Pitiful.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. And yes, it&#39;s really me, not a hallucination. So there&#39;s no need to be so scared.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I&#39;ve never been scared of you. I am Para\xEDso. I am a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, the Assassin of Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I use my blades to cut, sever, and rob people of their lives. I am the hollow vessel of a Heroic Spirit who has long since ceased to think for herself.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>My sword is might, and my might a sword. That is why I am a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster despite being a ninja.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Surely it is no different for you, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell,since you are an oni who has in turn become a blade.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, you&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>But in your case, you just can&#39;t seem to make the hard decisions, can you?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m sorry I have to do this.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...! Wh-what are you doing!?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>A Heroic Spirit Swordmaster&#39;s Spirit Core isn&#39;t connected to either heart or brain, right? That much is clear.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>But, our brains and hearts still play important roles, even for our ether bodies.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>So I&#39;m going to try connecting yours...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...to the power of the god from Mt.

So why?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My distant ancestor, Saburou, committed a crime, and was cursed by the manifestation of a mountain god. It was so long ago I don&#39;t even know what he looks like.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not even descended from his primary bloodline. I&#39;ve long since changed my family name. I went to a far-off land, and married there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet, the curse won&#39;t spare me. It follows me wherever I go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even after my human life ended and I became a Heroic Spirit after making a mark on humanity, it still finds me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Something is moving within me, with no sign of stopping. It&#39;s hot, and it burns, and it drives me past the brink of insanity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>What did I ever do wrong?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Somebody, please. Help me! Forgive me!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This snake, this great serpent, wraps itself around my body, worms its way inside, swallows my heart, and plants its fangs in my brain.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Aaah.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I really am sorry. I didn&#39;t want to do things this way.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>But the Lord Sorcerer said that Shinmen Musashi and the [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] from Chaldea keep getting in our way, and they need to be taken care of immediately.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, see you later. I&#39;ll apologize to you in hell.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Keep your eyes peeled at all times. Do not let your guard down even for an instant! Remember, this villain could strike again even in the light of day!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Yes sir! You hear that, men!? Keep your eyes peeled, and stay alert!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They sure do like to keep busy, don&#39;t they. It&#39;s been less than a day since Para\xEDso came here; I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be back again that soon.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh well, I guess there&#39;s no harm in keeping security tight. That might help put the princess at ease too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Honestly, not really any good memories of defending a besieged castle. I mean, those battles kinda wear on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now now. I get it, but lets try to stay positive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t know where their base is.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wouldn&#39;t it be great if they were just all, \u201CI shall await you at &#39;insert secret base location here&#39;! MWA HA HA! \u201D and then we could just find them!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be back.... At least, I feel like she will be.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She&#39;s a ninja. Even if she has transformed into a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, she will still do whatever it takes to carry out her master&#39;s commands.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And she hasn&#39;t done that yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean Kiyohime.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Exactly. Para\xEDso will do whatever it takes to try and kill her...I can feel it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s make sure we keep her safe.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Hmm, I&#39;m glad to see you are all taking this seriously. With one exception.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, stuff it. If there&#39;s a problem here, it&#39;s more how you&#39;re trying to save face with the guards, jerk!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Last night your samurai were all so bewildered by the assassin&#39;s snake techniques that they never even showed.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Though to be fair, I ended up getting here late after running into some trouble myself.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>True, I underestimated the threat.... A grave error on my part.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>While we were slow to act given how large our numbers were, keeping our numbers small would be an invitation for the monsters to quickly adapt their strategy.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>In which case, we must be able to respond in turn,until we get a better sense of the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whatever you say.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a good plan, stationing chains of command near Lady Kiyohime and keeping them safe.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...However, even the old guy didn&#39;t consider for a moment how the princess would react to losing her retainers.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Indeed. Having her sleep out here in this wide-open space, and making sure it&#39;s heavily guarded...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It may be an airtight plan as far as strategies go, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I feel sorry for her.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>As do I. I suppose it&#39;s all right now that she&#39;s asleep, but how will she feel when she wakes up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s overly rational, that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess so, since there isn&#39;t much they can do if that Heroic Spirit Swordmaster does show up again.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The only ones who can handle her are probably me,Kotarou, Fujimaru, and old man Tajima.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course, who knows if he&#39;s still got the guts to use his Otomeryu and that sword of his.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yes? Did you hear what I said, old man?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>This is no time for nonsense. Can you not feel that evil aura? ...The villain has returned.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh? ...Oh, man, you&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You really are a top-notch swordmaster, sensing that before I did! Fujimaru, stay by the princess!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Well well. Here we are again.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I see you&#39;ve arranged quite the welcome for me. I must have made an impression.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Are you using the princess as bait to lure me out? Hmm, no, you must have chosen this place to keep her safe.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>How very rational. Even I wouldn&#39;t have thought that far ahead.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>If I were in your place, I would have dragged her into the bowels of the castle and called it a day.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>But you, you chose to drag a sleeping woman out of her quarters and place her under heavy guard right out in the open. Well done. Truly, well done.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I commend you!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I commend you all. You&#39;ve done well to band together in order to kill a single woman born to a ninja family.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>This will make it even easier to kill you all at once! Hehe, heh heh, heehee, heeheeheeheeheehee!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Ahem, pardon me. I am the Assassin of Para\xEDso,and I have returned to finish our fight.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Now come, and I shall bite off all of your heads!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I can sense her sword ki...no, her magical energy growing at an explosive rate! I&#39;m not sure, but it looks as though her Spirit Origin has gone berserk!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Is this sort of physical and mental transformation innate to all Heroic Spirit Swordmasters or...could it be...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kiyohime is right behind us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to stop her here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t suppose we can go and hide her somewhere deep inside the castle now, can we!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Afraid not. Part of me would love to do the same thing, but the fact is, she&#39;s safest if she stays with us!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...There is no longer anywhere safe for you to hide from me. You will die here, terrified and filled with regret.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Come forth! You who has borne a grudge against my bloodline, and haunted me all my life. Come forth, and devour all without mercy!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s distorting the air itself!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What the hell is that snake? It&#39;s so giant it looks like it could swallow a horse whole! What&#39;re you thinking, summoning a creature that huge indoors!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>This is Orochi...the kin of my curse!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>It may be a pale imitation of the original, as it is created from the power of but one head, but it is still a fragment of a great god!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Go ahead! Just try to defeat it!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You can bet I will! All I need is one good strike! Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.

Once this is all over, I&#39;ll have to treat you to a tasty bowl of udon!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Here they come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Its attacks may be frighteningly strong...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But they also leave it wide-open!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Now&#39;s our chance! Everyone, you&#39;re up! Bring hell to this world...Immortal Chaos Brigade!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>So, you have vanquished the serpent. I daresay it took you long enough.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not one damn word! Not like you lifted a finger to help!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Granted, you did do an excellent job of leading your men against the other monsters!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time you got serious and actually CONTRIBUTED!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>High and mighty Otomeryu or not, the fact that you&#39;re STILL refusing to draw your sword is GETTING OLD!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Do not lower your guard. This isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I haven&#39;t lowered anything!

I can&#39;t look away from Para\xEDso to check!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m fine. My Spirit Core is intact...I can still stand...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Never mind me! We have to snap Lady Kiyohime out of whatever this is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Kiyohime, she...I don\u2019t understand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She...she just started acting oddly and attacked!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Can I...tell you all...a story...?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Some time ago, I...I destroyed a serpent&#39;s nest...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t mean to. I knew serpents were living creatures...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>And yet...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I still completely destroyed their nest...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...They were just eggs. Such tiny things,just struggling to be born. And I...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Why did I ever do such a horrible thing? I...I have regretted it ever since...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>And yet, they have never forgiven me. The serpents...they keep coming towards my body...Look! Look...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Even now...they come...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The giant snake just came back to life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But how!? It was burned to a crisp!</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re kidding me! It came back to life after being reduced to ash!? Is that a Saigyou revival technique!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Hehehe. A good strategy is always at least two steps ahead of the opposition, Shinmen Musashi!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Now, go on, princess. The snakes still have yet to forgive you. Just look at how many of their children are here.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>You have no choice! Kill all these people! Kill them all! Only then will the snakes forgive you!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Then, I will kill you myself, so you can finally be at peace. Now go, and lay waste to everything with your fire!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Yes. That...sounds good...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kiyohime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Para\xEDso controlling her!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Those two kunai Para\xEDso threw at her last night...What if they were a feint, and her real objective was...!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You mean she put Kiyohime under a spell!? Ugh, I hate magic duels. I have no knowledge of it whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Ah, good job! You figured it out! Now come, Kiyohime, and atone for your sins!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Yes...I will atone...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We&#39;ve defeated the monster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kiyohime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come back to us, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Ahh, the poor serpent has died.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I knew it; I will never be forgiven. It&#39;s all my fault for venturing into that mountain.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I wish I&#39;d never gone to Mt. Ibuki. Even if I was in a hurry...even if I had a good reason to be there...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I should never have intruded upon a mountain that belonged to a god...I broke a law that should never be broken...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Huh? ...Um.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Did I really do something like that?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve never been to Mt. Ibuki. And yet, I remember it as though I had. Also the snakes. I...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I see. So that&#39;s how it is...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It wasn&#39;t me that did this. It was a distant ancestor...And his sin...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>His sin was...engraved...in my blood...Yes, my blood. It&#39;s all my blood&#39;s fault!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>My ancestor&#39;s curse has tainted my blood!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s consuming me...violating me...melting me into a pile of sludge!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...I won&#39;t ask for your forgiveness...nor for your pity.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>All I want from you...The only thing I ask...is for you to lay down your lives!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I have to kill you! I have to! I need to do whatever it takes...for the gods to forgive me...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...Once you are all dead...they&#39;ll finally let me go free!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What are you saying...!? Master, she&#39;s still not herself!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to talk her out of this. We have to knock her out with a blow to a vital point!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait. Hold it, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s Kiyohime talking...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. She would never say something like that. Just yesterday, she told me about how well she got along with snakes. How she saved one once.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re doing it, Para\xEDso...but you&#39;re connected to her somehow.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why you&#39;re putting those words in her mouth! They aren&#39;t Kiyohime&#39;s words!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re yours...Mochizuki Chiyome!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Ah...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Princess! ...She&#39;s still breathing. Did she just pass out...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve heard of the curse of Kouga Saburou. He was a man born in Oumi Kouga who went on to become its lord.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>One day, his wife went hunting on Mt. Ibuki, and she never returned.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So Saburou went to the mountain and descended into the depths of the earth to search for her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After a long journey wandering the underworld realms, he finally returned to the surface...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...transformed into a snake.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I know that legend too. Indeed, Mt. Ibuki is famous for its great and terrible god...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yamata-no-Orochi, or Ooe Daimyojin. The most famous serpent god in all of Japan.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>With Saburou wandering around his territory for days on end, it would have been easy for Orochi to curse him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course, the legend also says that Saburou was healed by a wandering monk, and lived happily ever after.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, you&#39;re a woman. And I highly doubt you&#39;re Saburou himself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After all, this country isn&#39;t yet enlightened enough to have a woman be the founder of one of its prominent clans.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, there&#39;s one Kouga ninja clan that&#39;s said to still carry Saburou&#39;s blood.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And as I recall that clan, the Kouga Mochizuki family...produced one famous female ninja.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then...that&#39;s her identity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit that became Assassin of Para\xEDso!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Mochizuki Chiyome. The woman who served the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen, during the Warring States period as a spy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I had heard you were either a kunoichi or a shrine maiden, but I had no idea you also carried Kouga Saburou&#39;s curse!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Heh, hehe. So, you&#39;ve seen right through me! Indeed, I am Chiyome, of the Kouga Mochizuki clan!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>What will you do now, Shinmen Musashi!? My cursed blood has manifested Orochi himself! You cannot hope to defeat him!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Indeed, there is nothing more you can even say!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>You can&#39;t do anything about it. I couldn&#39;t do anything about it! Not even becoming a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, let alone a Heroic Spirit, was enough...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>The curse still haunts me. It refuses to let me go!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Curse of Annihilation? All well and good. Onriedo? All well and good.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>All that matters to me is to see my lord&#39;s command done. That is what it means to be a ninja...to be a Kouga.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...And yet, it still won&#39;t let me go.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Even as a woman, or a wife, or a ninja, or a Heroic Spirit, or as a curse made flesh...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Nobody will forgive me...No, not even that!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Not a single person will punish me!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>This curse is proof of my sin! The serpent is my sin made manifest!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>And yet...neither my father, nor my husband, nor Lord Takeda, nor the Lord Sorcerer...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>None of them will punish me! What am I supposed to do!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I thought I could escape if I devoted myself to the way of the ninja! But I couldn&#39;t escape it. I had to live with this curse right up to the day I died!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Then I thought I could escape if I gave myself over to karma! But, I still can&#39;t get away...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Tell me! ...What else can I possibly do...!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what to tell you. I have no idea what sort of pain you&#39;ve been through.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All I can do is answer you with my blade.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Heh. I see. I suppose you&#39;re right. My whole body is a blade. Even as a ninja, I was a blade without a heart!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Shinmen Musashi! In the name of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, we shall do battle!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Come forth, my blood-soaked frontier! This mountain of bodies and river of blood shall serve as the stage for our battle, and consume the loser&#39;s soul upon their defeat!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>My blade&#39;s Cursed Name is Assassin of Para\xEDso! The True Name of my vessel: Mochizuki Chiyome!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>Prepare yourself, Shinmen Musashi! Our final battle is upon us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>...Ahh. At last...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Para\xEDso:</strong></p><p>I can be...at peace...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If we meet again, somewhere else...maybe we can have a nice long talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope we can meet again under different circumstances.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I win, Assassin of Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Farewell. I hope that in your next life, you will meet someone who will persuade you that your doubt, and all your tears, are punishment enough.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I see the night&#39;s returning to normal. And that bloodred moon has gone away again.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Well done, Master. I have word from the castle doctor that the princess is safe and well.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She was so exhausted both mentally and physically that she quickly fell asleep, but she should have no issue waking up tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did great too, Kotarou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Hey, aren&#39;t those kunai you&#39;ve got there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, these? Yes, they&#39;re the kunai that Para\xEDso used.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I think she must have procured them here in Shimousa. They stayed around even after she disappeared.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I wouldn&#39;t exactly call them a trophy...I just found myself compelled to take them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t see the harm in that. We can give them back once we find that evil sorcerer guy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Para\xEDso said something about Onriedo, right? I think in Buddhism, that word means\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Distancing yourself from this impure world and its earthly desires, as I recall.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That actually sounds kind of nice in theory, but I definitely don&#39;t like the way they handle it in practice.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And I really don&#39;t like how they just went around villages, either...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And as long as we&#39;re on the subject, I&#39;m seriously pissed off about how they&#39;re using Heroic Spirits as hollow vessels and trampling all over their pride.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As if Lord Inshun wasn&#39;t bad enough, they did the same thing to Tomoe Gozen and Mochizuki Chiyome.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t say we have to avenge them, but I think it&#39;s at least worth returning those kunai to the sorcerer in a way he can&#39;t possibly enjoy. Say, shoving them where the sun don&#39;t shine, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...What do you say, Kotarou? Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We could even put a literal bow on them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Agreed!</p><h2 id="section-10-quarta-cantica-kalasutra-hell-beginning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-quarta-cantica-kalasutra-hell-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: Quarta Cantica: K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell (Beginning)</h2><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Mmm, another beautiful blue sky. I love this weather!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad it&#39;s such a nice day out for our trip back. If it was raining, my kimono would get all filthy!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I paid good money for this outfit, so I want it to look nice for as long as possible!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right on.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I may only be able to make a living with my katana thanks to my lousy old man, but I still like to look good.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In fact, I had a skilled tailor custom-make both this obi and kimono just for me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think you cared about that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course I do. I enjoy looking good, you know. Though I do forget all about it when it comes time to fight a duel!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I may run around doing whatever I feel like now, but back where I grew up...I was lucky to know lots of good people.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Both this obi and kimono are proof of that. Hell, I wouldn&#39;t even have had the money for my swords without help from the various people I&#39;ve met.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Anyway, at the rate we&#39;re going, we should be back at Grandpa Muramasa&#39;s hermitage in an hour or so.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s hustle. I bet he&#39;ll have piping hot white rice ready and waiting for us. Maybe even enough for seconds!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t say anything about white rice or seconds, but yes, I would love to meet another friendly Servant.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It seems that the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters didn&#39;t expect Master to be here in Shimousa...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And we now know that they see [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] as a threat. The more allies we have on our side, the better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I am worried about Kiyohime, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Same here. Now that we know they can manipulate her mind, they may go after her again.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, old man Tajima said he has a plan in place, and that we&#39;d only get in the way if we stuck around.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So we couldn&#39;t stay in the castle any longer anyway.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not if it meant I would have to fight him to do so.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Indeed, we have no choice but to entrust Lord Tajima with the princess&#39;s care. Besides, I believe he would finally draw his sword if the time came to protect her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I hope so, but...that old man seems like he cares about other people&#39;s lives even less than I do...)</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lord Tajima-no-Kami is a master of the Yagyu Shinkageryu, and one of the greatest swordmasters under the sun.

I shall enter that into my database.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I just mean you could&#39;ve jumped in around then too, y&#39;know? We&#39;re here walking the same path together and all.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Understood. Same path. I shall enter that into my database.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...I didn&#39;t even notice you were here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s very robotic, isn&#39;t she...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not a robot, Master.

It&#39;s not like we&#39;re in a hurry, right?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Correct. I have not been assigned a specific deadline by which this mission must be completed.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>My new orders from Lord Tajima are to gather information around Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>And...to ensure that all of you arrive safely at your destination.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, nothing in your orders precludes you from enjoying this walk. So, should be fine for you to join us for a bit of conversation!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>\u201CPrecludes\u201D...What a fancy word. You must have learned a lot in your travels, Lady Musashi!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Y-yes, Lady Danzo? What is it? Something on my face? If you&#39;re trying to hide yourself right now, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not working...at all...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>My apologies. I was simply observing you out in the open, as I had determined I did not need to hide.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So that was intentional then...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>At any rate, Lord Kotarou, may I ask you a question? ...Are you sure you are uninjured?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>During your battle, Lord Tajima-no-Kami ordered me to leave the princess and go outside the castle...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But you stayed behind and fought the villain to keep the princess safe.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Not only that, you suffered a terrible injury when you shielded that young [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] from a surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>And yet...you are still so sprightly...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>O-oh, now I see. So you found that strange, huh?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Since you are a ninja, at first I thought it may be due to some sort of ninjutsu.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I recall you telling me you were a Sagami ninja before, after all.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But I searched my database, and was unable to find any ninjutsu that would explain your rapid recovery...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I-I see. Thank you for your concern,but I&#39;m quite all right.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>My body is quite different from an ordinary person&#39;s,but it is not because of any ninjutsu.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But, I know you are not a machine like I am.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>While I have not had the sensation myself, I am aware that living creatures experience pain when they are wounded.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am unable to feel such things as humans do, but I have also heard that pain can be unbearable to them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Well, uh...There are certainly some wounds that can&#39;t be healed, but don&#39;t worry; mine weren&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s more, I&#39;m still the head of a ninja clan, even if I may not look like it. Pain is nothing new to me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I see. Understood.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh, seemed like you two were having a nice talk, then it just kinda...stopped. Is she walking faster now, too?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I wonder if I did something to offend her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t think so. If anything, I think it&#39;s the opposite. Hehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think so too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right? Right? My finely tuned feminine intuition is telling me she&#39;s into him!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I may be clueless when it comes to my own relationships, but I&#39;m always dead-on when it comes to other people&#39;s!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I think Kotarou may be right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehehe. I hate to say it, Fujimaru,but you&#39;re dead wrong in this case.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Danzo&#39;s definitely into him. What a lovely puppet!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So buck up, Kotarou. She only said those things to you in the first place because she cares about you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...If you say so. I don&#39;t know what to think myself.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...What am I doing...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>He is just an enemy. Nothing more. There is no need for me to concern myself with his well-being...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Then again, a ninjutsu that can instantly heal wounds could be a significant threat. My duty is to learn as much as possible about the enemy, after all.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>At least...that is what I believed...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>What is going on? Could some part of me be broken...?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Or could it be that...I am feeling the effects of that evil aura from last night...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...Go on, lap it all up. Don&#39;t leave a single drop behind.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>My bottle isn&#39;t just for pouring. It can also lap up suffering, regret, and hate...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...and turn them into the finest wine imaginable. Fufu. Sure you don&#39;t want some? It&#39;s delicious, you know.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Please, hurry. Before someone from the castle sees you.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t mind you collecting the remains of the great serpent that Lady Para\xEDso summoned. But please, be quick.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I know. Sorry for the trouble. I promise I&#39;ll soon be aaall done.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...At any rate, Danzo? O lovely Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re working as a spy under Caster&#39;s orders, right? You&#39;re not developing a soft spot for your marks, are you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Surely you jest. I am here only to fulfill my master&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Your master&#39;s orders, huh. You mean like Chiyome? Boy, you ninja sure have it tough.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Doesn&#39;t being your master&#39;s obedient little puppet get ooold? It would for me. I don&#39;t think I could last a day like that! Fufufu.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I know exactly what you&#39;re thinking.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>All the time you were hiding up near the ceiling, you couldn&#39;t take your eyes off that redheaded boy, could you? You must really like him, huh.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>What was it he said? Oh, that&#39;s right. Something about how a ninja without a heart is no more than a blade?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Nice words from a cute boy. I could easily see someone falling for his charm.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s not quite my type anymore, but if I were still alive, I&#39;d have been on him like white on rice. Fufu.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......Surely you jest.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s how you want to play this? Are you sure? Okay, if that&#39;s what you want. Doesn&#39;t make any difference to me.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Okay, that&#39;s all of it. All the cursed remains of the great god of Ooe are mine to use as I like.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Guess I&#39;ll head back to Arakawa now then.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>All right. Please hurry.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Always the responsible one, aren&#39;t you. So what if you&#39;re just a mechanical puppet?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Come on, be straight with me.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>What is it you REALLY want to do?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In the deep of night...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>At an old, forgotten battlefield lay on the eastern shore of the Arakawa, the river that keeps Edo safe...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An unthinkable sight was unfolding in an empty, untilled field.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A great army, ten-thousand strong, with cavalry,foot soldiers, archers, and gunners, was gathering.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was an army of the shogunate, assembled quickly and in secret under the orders of Tajima-no-Kami, with the sole purpose of wiping out every monster in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Each troop was led by proud, experienced warriors from the Shimabara Rebellion and the Siege of Osaka.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This army might well have been the last one ever assembled whose soldiers remembered the age of war.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Following their commander&#39;s orders,the army descended upon Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whether they faced monsters, the Toyotomi, or Christians, they were keen blade created expressly to cut down any force threatening the society the Tokugawa created.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>They were just about to leave this field in order to rendezvous with their commander, Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Or at least, that was the plan.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...The Seiwa Genji...bah. The Shogun...bah.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>What a deplorable state of affairs. Whatever happened to honor on the battlefield?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Are there any truly brave men among you? If there are, then I might be willing to face you one-on-one.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Lady Inferno didn&#39;t seem especially concerned, but I am. After all, your army is official, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I see you number at least ten thousand. Some of you no doubt hail from upstanding families. And yet...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>If you are willing to resort to any means necessary to hunt down monsters, then you are no better than I.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...It is terribly vexing. You remind me of myself far too much for my liking.</p><p><strong>Hatamoto:</strong></p><p>Where did you come from, woman!? I find you,and your presence here, very suspicious...</p><p><strong>Hatamoto:</strong></p><p>I was told that a woman led the army of monsters against Shimousa recently, and I think you&#39;re one of her ilk! Stay right where you are, and don&#39;t move a muscle!</p><p><strong>Hatamoto:</strong></p><p>Archers, advan\u2013</p><p><strong>Infantrymen:</strong></p><p>Wh-what the...!? Lord Shimada just...disappeared! He was just on his horse...and now he&#39;s gone!</p><p><strong>Infantrymen:</strong></p><p>Hm? What&#39;s this? ...A-aaah! It&#39;s Lord Shimada&#39;s torso...j-just his torso! What&#39;s it doing here!?</p><p><strong>Infantrymen:</strong></p><p>It must have flown for over twenty paces! That&#39;s impossible! This...this must be sorcery!</p><p><strong>Infantrymen:</strong></p><p>And look! That woman is still standing over ten paces away from his horse...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh, shut up! Just shut up!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve never heard anything so pathetic. It&#39;s unbearable. The Seiwa Genji would be rolling in their graves if they could hear you so-called warriors now.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>All your insignificant buzzing, not a word to be heard. You&#39;re no better than insects.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Insects are such disgusting creatures. Best to squash them. Quickly.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Since I&#39;m already here, I may as well take the opportunity to exterminate this horrid infestation.</p><p><strong>Infantrymen:</strong></p><p>...!!! L-look out! Here she comes!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Too slow. Far too slow.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...It was, in every sense of the word, a bloodbath.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This was no battle. It was wholesale slaughter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Fully armored cavalry, foot soldiers, archers, gunners...Each and every one was mowed down indiscriminately.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Under the blood-soaked light of the crimson moon,all ten thousand men were sacrificed for Onriedo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s be more precise. In total, there were ten-thousand two-hundred and forty-five soldiers gathered there on the east bank of the Arakawa River that night.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No less than ten-thousand two-hundred and forty-four of them were cut down. The sole survivor was a young foot soldier.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He was a youthful hatamoto who had never once been on a battlefield. After listening to his older compatriots share their tales of battle, he volunteered for the Shimousa army of his own accord.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Sadly, the bright and eager expression he had worn on his face merely half an hour earlier was now gone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The light was gone from his eyes, and all he could do now was stare up at the cloudy night sky, mumbling as saliva dribbled down his chin and tears rolled down his cheeks.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) What&#39;s all this? Why&#39;d you have to go and slaughter all of them?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>And why&#39;d you leave this shell-shocked idiot alive!?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Why bother killing him? He is so broken that he is all but dead in spirit.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>A fool like that would make a poor sacrifice. I refuse to wet my blade when there is nothing to be gained from it.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Didn&#39;t your parents ever teach you it was rude not to finish what&#39;s on your plate?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, whatever. I&#39;m a Berserker,so I can&#39;t really be bothered.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Anyway, nice job tonight, K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell. As for me, I went ahead and lapped up every bit of suffering, regret, and hate I could find.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>What a little sneak...If I weren&#39;t a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, you would have been the first I killed.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>How terribly irritating.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Ahaha, sorry about that. By the way, K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell,I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d like to try something out?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>You see, my Noble Phantasm&#39;s all filled up now. In fact, it&#39;s a little too full.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d like to go ahead and pour it all out...but if I did that, it might end up melting a whole province or two. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>That is what you wish to do? Commit a pointless atrocity when Onriedo is nearly upon us?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...Oh, very well.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>In that case, why don&#39;t we venture over to the neighboring province of Sagami? I&#39;ve always wanted to see the Ashigara region for myself.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Sagami, eh. What about Edo then? Shall I eat everyone there while I&#39;m at it?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh yes, Edo. A city where people from all walks of life come together.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>It reminds me of an anthill more than anything. In my time, the eastern lands were never so populated.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>So? What do you say?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...I say no. The Lord Sorcerer has his own sights set on Edo. We should leave it alone.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Then Sagami it is.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Agreed. Let us dye its ocean bloodred. I do have some attachment to the Kamakura shogunate, but Sagami was the home of the loathesome Houjou clan.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I thought the Houjou didn&#39;t matter anymore in this period. Well, whatever.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Danzo. I know you&#39;re about. Tell the others we&#39;re going to Sagami for a spell.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Wait, Lady K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell, Lady Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell! Neither Lord Limbo, nor Lord Empireo, nor the Lord Sorcerer told you to destroy Sagami.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Please, I ask that you reconsider!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Come on, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell. What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Apologies, Danzo, that&#39;s just how it is. Hold the fort for us while we&#39;re away.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Both of you, wait...!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So you lot decided to come back, huh? And here I thought you&#39;d gotten used to the cushy castle life.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well, Servant or swordsman, a guest&#39;s a guest. You&#39;re probably tired after all that walking.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Onui, get some tea for our guests. Make sure it&#39;s hot.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay! Is it someone from the village? Like Ms. Gohei, or Mr. Numazou?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Oh, it&#39;s the nice [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady] and Ms. Samurai! Along with Mr. Redheaded Ninja and...a lady I don&#39;t recognize!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga ga\u266A Goo goo\u266A</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m home, Onui, Tasuke! I&#39;m so glad I get to see you two again!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Me too! Hey, what was it like inside the castle? Was it amazing?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It was so wide and spacious! We saw the girl we met in town there too. She was a real princess after all!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wow, really!? I can&#39;t believe it!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>A baby...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You there, new girl. You&#39;re a ninja, ain&#39;tcha? I guess modern ninja don&#39;t even try to hide who they are anymore.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Indeed. As of late there are so many unusual characters running around that this outfit does not stand out much.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Apologies for a belated introduction. I am Danzo. I am to escort [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru and Lady Musashi to this hermitage, and see that they return safely.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Now that my task has been completed,I shall take my leave.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>If you&#39;re not in any rush, you should stay and rest up. From the looks of you, I&#39;d wager you&#39;re part of Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s Edo group.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And since you were able to slip right through the bounded field I&#39;ve been reinforcing over the last few days, I doubt you&#39;re one of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, take a break with us.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Very well then. If you insist as well, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, it would be rude of me to refuse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Muramasa acts grumpy, but he&#39;s actually really nice.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Eh? What&#39;re you gettin&#39; at? Remember, I&#39;m technically a merchant.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>If I want anyone buyin&#39; my katana, I can&#39;t go &#39;round being all rude to my own damn customers.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I may be blunt, but I at least try to be hospitable &#39;bout running my business.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>At any rate. Fujimaru, the fact that you&#39;re here means you have more to discuss, right?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I also expect Musashi there to tell me how she&#39;s been treating my Myoujingiri. Come on, then, out with it.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...If you insist.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I do. Besides, just got a bit of interesting gossip myself. We can all share what we know.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Does that mean...there&#39;s been another incident in Shimousa?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I heard those monsters we thought we ran off have started showing up again in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But the big story I heard about didn&#39;t happen in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Apparently, in a field near the Arakawa River, right on the edge of Edo. An army of ten thousand\u2013</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>An army of ten thousand? Is that what that traveling merchant was telling you about before?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t get to hear all of it that time because you made me go outside! What else did he have to say!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Never you mind. Let&#39;s have supper first.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Aww, no fair, Grandpa! I wanna hear too.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo, goo.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>And so does Tasuke! Come on, please?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hang on, Onui. Don&#39;t you also want to talk to me and Danzo and Kotarou and Fujimaru while we prepare dinner?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you want to know what the princess&#39;s sleeping chambers were like, I can tell you all about them.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wow, really!? I can&#39;t wait to hear about that! Okay, I&#39;ll go get dinner ready!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thanks, Onui. Here, let me help. How about you, Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I-I, uh...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Thanks. I didn&#39;t want the kids to hear about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;ll tell us after we&#39;ve eaten.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I will. In my smithy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Food comes first! Let&#39;s eat!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, not so fast. You&#39;re going to help us make it too, just as soon as you&#39;ve finished your tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll help too, of course. If you like, I can contribute some of my best hyourougan.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hyourougan! What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hyourougan...Isn&#39;t that a kind of highly nourishing ninja ration? I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s shaped like a ball...and also that it tastes absolutely terrible?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>D-don&#39;t be ridiculous, Lady Musashi! The Fuu\u2013my clan&#39;s hyourougan is Warring States cuisine at its finest!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Is that true? I am not equipped with taste sensors, but I am still interested. May I see one of these hyourougan for future reference?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Uh, w-well...I-I might be able to show you one at some point!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yay, I can&#39;t wait\u266A</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Sheesh. Usually it&#39;s just me and the kids here. I can&#39;t remember the last time my hermitage was so rowdy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you not like it when things are rowdy?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Not really. But I&#39;m used to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re unhappy about it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Maybe I am, maybe I&#39;m not.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Anyway, let&#39;s get dinner ready. Might not be no fancy castle banquet, but I&#39;ll still feed you good tonight. You&#39;d better be grateful.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve got plenty of sweetfish I caught in the river out back. Onui, go get the tub I left outside.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Kaaay\u266A</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grilled and salted sweetfish!? White rice and pickled veggies!? That sounds like the greatest meal ever! I don&#39;t think anything could beat it!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What are you talking about? Food is no competition.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>At any rate, I heard a lot happened at the castle, so eat up and get your strength back. We&#39;ll talk then.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yay! Sweetfish!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi, you&#39;re drooling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never seen you look so happy!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, well of course I am. What could be better than this!? Oh, by the way, Grandpa, I&#39;d love to have some udon for a midnight snack.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t push your luck. Now didn&#39;t you say you were going to help? Hurry up and get to work.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah yeah, I know. Okay, let&#39;s take care of this one last job before we eat!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thank you for the meal. It was delicious.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not only were the sweetfish fresh, they were salted and grilled to perfection. Is the river out back where you caught them famous for being a good spot?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahh, that was great! There&#39;s nothing like a yummy meal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you for feeding us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t eat another bite.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I was unable to partake of the food myself, but I sense that its presentation was lovely.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Flattery will get you nowhere. Besides, Onui handled the seasoning, though I did do the actual cooking.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Kunoichi, you sure okay with just water? I&#39;ve heard about unusual ninja before, bu\u2013</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am, thank you. Your kindness is greatly appreciated,but please don&#39;t concern yourself with me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Got it.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>So full...Getting...sleepy...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Zzz...Zzz...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Aww, Tasuke already fell asleep. That&#39;s so cute. You look pretty sleepy too, Onui.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>But...I want to hear the story...Nnn, so sleepy...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>You can still hear what happened after you wake up. None of us are going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Really...? Then...maybe I&#39;ll just close my eyes...for a little bit.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s it. You need a good night&#39;s sleep. Lord Muramasa, may I take Lady Onui and Lord Tasuke to the inner room?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;d be great. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Very well then. Come along Lady Onui, Lord Tasuke. Please watch your step.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay...(Yaaawn)</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Zzz...Zzz...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, Danzo&#39;s so good with children. Her voice is so calming; just like a mother, or a big sister.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Y-yeah, I guess so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is everything okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, everything&#39;s fine. Now, I think this is an appropriate time to discuss what we all know.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Arakawa is far west of here, on the eastern edge of Edo. What happened there last night?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Listen up.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The powers that be realized how serious things have gotten in Shimousa, and finally decided to do something about it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And there was that incident in Hitachi as well. That, coupled with Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s messenger telling those bigwigs about our problems...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...must have been the kick that they needed to get the ball rolling.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>After all, they ended up sending a real army.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So, the shogunate finally made a move...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>An army of ten thousand, to be exact. I was told it was assembled after Hitachi was burned to the ground.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ten thousand!? I&#39;m impressed they managed to even find that many samurai in peacetime!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Last year, the shogunate just barely managed to assemble twelve thousand for Shimabara, and only with help from the neighboring clans!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So when will this ten thousand strong army reach Shimousa? Are they already on their way?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid not. Word is that last night...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The army was killed to a man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...No one survived...?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No. &#39;Fraid not. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s something that concerns you directly.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Looks like. There was one young samurai who survived the massacre. He crossed the river by himself and was able to relay what had happened, but he died soon afterwards.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>According to him, it was two women who perpetrated the massacre. And two beautiful ones at that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Women? As I recall, of the four remaining Heroic Spirit Swordmasters...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Two were women, one was a man...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m actually not sure about the fourth...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Two of them were women. That much I&#39;m sure about.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>A warrior able to kill a thousand is bad, but ten thousand? That&#39;s somethin&#39; else. There&#39;s more, too.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Later that night...before the sun could rise...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The entire province of Sagami was destroyed.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, when you say \u201Cdestroyed\u201D...?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I meant what I said. It&#39;s completely gone.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Entire towns were either burnt to the ground, or looked like they&#39;d been turned into molten glass.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Maybe you&#39;ve heard how the mountains near Hakone were stripped bare to collect wood for Edo?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Word has it that Sagami now looks just like those mountains. It was like lightning and fire broke out all over the province.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But that sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen by accident. It&#39;s clear that the same two Heroic Spirit Swordmasters who slaughtered the army at Arakawa destroyed Sagami as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sagami is where modern-day Kanagawa is, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that your hometown, Kotarou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I-I&#39;m okay, Master. No need to worry about me. I&#39;m a Servant, after all...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s no one from my time still alive now anyway...Although, if I&#39;m being truly honest...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Well, I&#39;d be a liar if I said it wasn&#39;t at all upsetting. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m still so immature...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not immature at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No one could blame you for being upset.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I overheard everything from the other side of the sliding door. This is all news to me too. I had no idea what happened to Sagami...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou. I am...sorry for your loss.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thank you, but, I&#39;m okay. Really.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So where are those two now, Lord Muramasa? Are they still in Sagami?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No. I heard they went on a rampage killing anyone and everyone in reach until high noon, and then they just vanished like smoke in a breeze.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Thanks to that, some smaller villages managed to survive.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately...the same can&#39;t be said for bigger areas, like Kamakura or the Odawara Castle town.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a lot more dead than there are survivors. All of Edo&#39;s in an uproar about it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;ve gone up against those monsters myself, and I still find this all hard to believe.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru, are Servants really capable of that sort of thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Some Heroic Spirits are, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You bet. Some Servants are stronger than others, and some are better suited to certain situations than others.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Some are overwhelmingly powerful when it comes to fighting one-on-one, while others excel at taking on large groups.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I imagine these two are the latter. Of course, the worst kind to face are the ones who excel at both.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So they wiped out an army of ten thousand...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They destroyed all of Sagami...</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t tell what they&#39;re after. If we take Para\xEDso at her word, the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are planning to use Shimousa as the stage for some sort of plot.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But in that case, why would they need to wipe out an army, let alone all of Sagami!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s almost as if...they enjoy killing for killing&#39;s sake...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That may actually be why.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think one of those women was a Berserker.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It does seem like the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters were all originally Heroic Spirits whose Spirit Origins have been twisted into something monstrous.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So then, if a Servant who had Mental Corruption, or who possessed Madness Enhancement, were to transform into a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They might just be capable of something this horrific.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what those are, but it seems clear that these two are monsters in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Indeed. They may even be more deranged than the other Heroic Spirit Swordmasters we&#39;ve faced.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And we still don&#39;t know when they&#39;re coming back to Shimousa. Hell, they could already be there and plotting something.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But I guess there&#39;s no point fretting about that. Now it&#39;s your turn. Tell me everything you know.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Have you figured out where their home base is yet?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Umm...Well...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You see...uh...We were very busy fending off the Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we still don&#39;t know where their base is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We did hear about something called Onriedo though.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well, if they were that easy to track down, they wouldn&#39;t be such a threat. So how many did you manage to defeat?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Actually, don&#39;t answer that. Just let me see the Myoujingiri Muramasa&#39;s blade. That&#39;ll tell me all I need to know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Really? Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well now, you&#39;ve put it through the wringer, haven&#39;t you? It looks like you&#39;ve slain three of them so far.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Fire and poison, eh.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I remember you slew one of them here, so that makes two others. It all adds up.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But why has it come loose at the hilt here? ...You threw it like a knife, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You should have gone with a wakizashi if you wanted to toss the damn thing like a street performer. Tch.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>How&#39;s a great swordsman like you not even carry a damn pocketknife!? I&#39;ll say this for your dual-wielding style: it&#39;s a lot flashier than your male counterpart&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Ugh. If I had the time I&#39;d lend you another blade, but I&#39;m just too busy right now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But, I guess it&#39;s okay. You may be treating it roughly, but at least you&#39;re not losing. That counts for a lot.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So the leader of the monsters in southern Shimousa was a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, eh. Was the other one the villain that tried to assassinate Matsudaira&#39;s daughter?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You got it! Not bad, even for the legendary Senji Muramasa!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...It&#39;s so dark outside. It&#39;s kind of scary...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>But, not a lot scary, okay? Just a little.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Zzz...Zzz...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>No fair, Tasuke.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I just changed your diaper, so you&#39;re all set. But I can&#39;t wait until the morning to go to the lavatory...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Come on, Onui, you&#39;ll be okay...It&#39;s right over there.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be scared. You&#39;re a big sister, remember?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Ahhh, I really wish one of the grown-ups would take me...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>But they look like they&#39;re talking about something really important. I don&#39;t want to bother them.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...It&#39;s creepy out here. But, I&#39;m not scared.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Aah!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Was that the wind? Were those just some leaves being blown around?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Sorry, no leaves here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>So, you decided to go out to the lavatory aaall by yourself, even though you were afraid, mm? What a brave little girl you are.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>But you really should&#39;ve asked a grown-up to come with you, you know? Haven&#39;t they told you it&#39;s dangerous to walk around alone at night?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>Do you know what happens to children who don&#39;t do what they&#39;re told?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>...They get eaten by oni.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Ah.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOnui&#39;s Voice:</strong></p><p>AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Did you hear that!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui!? Oh no!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hurry! Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whoa, she&#39;s already gone! That was fast!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa has already headed outside as well! You stay with me, Master!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll come too.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thank you!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Onui! Tasuke!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Onui! Tasuke! Are you all right!?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>G-Grandpa...! Ms. Samurai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Onui!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The moon is bloodred again!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, it&#39;s the same as when the other Heroic Spirit Swordmasters appeared! One of the remaining four must have made their way past the barrier!</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Please save me, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>My Cursed Name is Berserker Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell.

We won&#39;t let them get away with this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Hehehehehe, you all kill so well! It&#39;s breathtaking!</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Shinmen Musashi, the ninja boy,and the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s such a treat watching you cut down our wispy little monsters!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re at least somewhat proficient in battle. What a disappointment it would be if you weren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>We have been stretching our legs and visiting some far-off places, but it&#39;s the same letdown everywhere we go.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s so dreadfully boring. I don&#39;t expect you to be on par with the Great Tsuchigumo, but at the very least...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...I hope you could put up as much of a fight as an oni.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Otherwise, you won&#39;t even be worth the rust you might make on my beloved blade.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Rust? I&#39;m surprised to see a glorified street thug caring about her sword.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(So Lord Muramasa came out too...Though I guess that&#39;s no surprise, considering what&#39;s at stake. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a good thing, though. He may be strong, but his is the kind of strength you get by not worrying about protecting yourself. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(If he faces off against a Swordmaster, it&#39;ll end up a draw. And I&#39;ve got my hands full with my own defense...)</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh, look what we have here.... I see. You must be the Rogue Serva\u2013</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Shut up. Raikou, was it? Which blade do you have on you right now, Yasutsuna, or your Kumogiri?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, if you&#39;d like to find out that badly,you could always try to make me draw it.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>After you cross swords with me, you&#39;d only have that little oni over there to deal with. Who knows? You might even be able to rescue these children.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let her get to you, Muramasa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to play it safe!</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You think I don&#39;t know that? That&#39;s why I&#39;m just letting them ramble on and not doing a damn thing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Still, you&#39;re right. I can&#39;t save the kids on my own.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Please. Get them back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course we will! That said...Now that they&#39;ve got hostages, we can&#39;t really go all-out.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not going to be quick or straightforward, Lord Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(Master. I can conceal my presence and make my way around behind them. )</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>(While you keep them busy, I&#39;ll go and\u2013)</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Wait, Lord Kotarou. They appear to be plotting something.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Heh. It seems your ideas aren&#39;t always completely worthless after all, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell. They seem very flustered indeed.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>This does differ slightly from the Lord Sorcerer&#39;s plans, but that&#39;s just what happens when we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are involved.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Now, let&#39;s begin. Perhaps this way we can have a bit of fun.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Right? Oh, they&#39;re getting all warmed up now. The meat&#39;s getting nice and juicy...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay to eat them.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah. Hey, you there. Can you take this kid off my hands?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>She&#39;s shaking so badly she can barely move. Oh, but don&#39;t go eating them, got it?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So they&#39;re keeping the children out of our reach by handing them off to one of their pet monsters. I hate to say it, but that&#39;s smart.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Maybe, but it&#39;s also incredibly tacky. Even if they&#39;ve got us backed into a corner, let&#39;s still call it out for the cowardly move it is.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t get you Heroic Spirit Swordmasters at all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Having a chat while innocent children suffer as your hostages? You&#39;re a disgrace to beautiful women everywhere!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ugh, what a waste. You&#39;re both as pretty as Otama,but I can hardly stand to LOOK at you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...What a WASTE!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(...! )</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...Yikes. That one nearly took my head off.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>(Impressive. She didn&#39;t give herself away in the slightest. Musashi is pretty good when she tries. )</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>(Musashi&#39;s only flaw is her overly erratic sword ki. Still...this opponent is bad news. )</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>(She must be the real Minamoto-no-Raikou...I can&#39;t believe she deflected Musashi&#39;s strike with just a flick of her wrist...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What just happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t see a thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Thanks, K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell. It&#39;s a lot better having you and your sword on my side than against me!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be silly. I keep telling you, I did nothing special.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I simply swung this sword as I saw fit. I daresay my Yasutsuna handling is far more impressive.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>If I strike my sword here, the enemy&#39;s blade will shatter. If I swing it here, the enemy&#39;s head will fly eight paces.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Anyone defending their home from their enemies would do the same.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Easier said than done. What&#39;s scary is...you really seem to believe it.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>So, what will you do now?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll cut down the monsters behind you before they can try anything. If you two get in my way, I&#39;ll cut you down too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If two katana aren&#39;t enough, I&#39;ll use three. If three aren&#39;t enough, I&#39;ll use four.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And if four still aren&#39;t enough...I&#39;ll sacrifice myself and bite through your neck with my own damn teeth!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh my, how brave. How adorable. You really believe that throwing your life away will make a difference?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s just not how it works. On the battlefield, fortune favors the strong.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>A few buzzing insects like you have no hope of victory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We WILL save Onui and Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone, I&#39;m counting on you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master! I will do everything in my power to assist you!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I may not be of much help, but I too will do what I can. My database says that one should always repay one&#39;s host for their hospitality.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Go ahead then. I won&#39;t stop you. In fact, I won&#39;t be stopping any of you.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll simply swing my sword and call down thunder and lightning. Well? Go on then.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Yeah, let&#39;s do this thing! Ahahahahaha! But just so you know, we really are strong, so at least TRY to stay alive!</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>My blade is the sword of execution. My authority is absolute.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Now, have at you. Let&#39;s see what sort of fight you put up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Ghh, so heavy! Each of her strikes has tremendous force behind it! It must be the difference in our bodyweight! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Thank goodness for Lord Muramasa&#39;s sword. I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep pace with her without the Myoujingiri! )</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Both of their attacks are so strong that I am unable to measure them...and yet, they are still only fighting with a fraction of their power!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We can&#39;t even touch them! Whenever we get close,they always work together to deflect our moves!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...It&#39;s all we can do just to scratch them!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We might be able to handle one at a time,but together, we&#39;re completely outclassed.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(But, if I can make up the difference with my sword, we might still have a chance. They may both be monsters, but they&#39;re not equally skilled! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can see that you&#39;re both terrifically strong. And that you&#39;re not much for playing around.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Did your sorcerer master send the two of you together because he&#39;s finally getting serious after seeing three of you defeated when they came after us alone?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, I don&#39;t know about that. K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell and I have always been great friends.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Touch me again and I&#39;ll squash you like the insect you are.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Yikes, that was scary! No fair, all of you ganging up on poor little me.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Well, I guess this is it for now then. See you around.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>! Hold it! Give me back my grand\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Rrrgh, not again! Get out of my way!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Now&#39;s our chance!</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Ahahahahahaha! You really think so!? Come on then, catch us with a game of Stella Ella...Oni?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Onui! Tasuke!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Grandpa...! Everyone...I&#39;m so sorry!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s all because I went outside on my own...If I hadn&#39;t, these oni would never have\u2013!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t do anything wrong, Onui!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll rescue you in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Misteeer /\u2640 Miiiss]!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Onui.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>She&#39;d only just learned how to hold her tears back, and you go and make her cry all over again. What the hell&#39;s wrong with you two?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Ooh, how scary. There&#39;s nothing worse than a stern talking-to from an old man. I guess that&#39;s our cue to leave.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Agreed. Very well then Master of Chaldea, Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>We will be waiting for you on the peak of the nearby mountain. If you wish to save these children, you will come to see us before daybre\u2013</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>...No, on second thought, we will wait for you there until high noon.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t even tell you two to come alone. Feel free to bring all your little friends with you.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>The more there are to kill,the merrier your deaths will be.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Ah...They vanished...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That was like the skill we use to conceal our presence...I can&#39;t figure out the particulars, but it must be a skill that&#39;s unique to the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>They didn&#39;t even leave a scent behind.

Get a hold of yourself, Grandpa!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We don&#39;t have time for the whole\u201Cso blinded by rage you&#39;ve lost sight of reality\u201D thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Muramasaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please, stop! Just stop for a moment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I-I&#39;m sorry, Master. Lord Muramasa said he was going to get ready, but as soon as he came back to the hermitage, he lit a fire in his forge...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>So Lord Muramasa is a graduate of the Muramasa school of smithing...That is why he forges like a man possessed...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s a Servant who\u2013I-I mean, never mind!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>All of you, shut up and get ready to leave. I ain&#39;t senile, dammit. I know exactly what I&#39;m doing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m doing this to keep a level head.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now quit gawking and go get ready. Don&#39;t make me say it again.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Once you&#39;re all ready to go, we&#39;ll be leaving right away. Got that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> G-got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is the mountain easy to climb?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, it&#39;s fairly tall, but we should still be able to reach the top in two hours.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, once we get there,we&#39;ll be facing off against those two again.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Can you handle that,Fujimaru and Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you don&#39;t think you can fight them because they look like people you know, then you should stay behind. I can deal with them on my own if I have to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I know they&#39;re not our friends.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I see...That&#39;s good to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to keep the promise I made to Onui.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then, would you mind if I said something? I don&#39;t know how much consolation it&#39;ll be, but I have some thoughts I&#39;d like to share.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t think we should think of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters as their actual Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know we haven&#39;t taken the time to make sure we&#39;re on the same page about this, so I want to be clear: they&#39;re nothing more than walking corpses.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I was convinced of that when we fought Lord Inshun. I think you should accept that too, if you can.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Especially now that you&#39;re going up against ones you know personally.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Of course, I know that&#39;s easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>True...They do look and sound just like the Heroic Spirits we know...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But they&#39;re still completely different people. Master, I believe Lady Musashi is right.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Besides, Heroic Spirits are essentially different people every time they are summoned as Servants anyway.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Even if they retain their memories of the other times they&#39;ve been summoned.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There is no Heroic Spirit who is exactly the same person every time they are summoned. Rather, they&#39;re the same person, but one who is as different as possible.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Maybe it would be more accurate to say that they are a completely different person who very closely resembles them each time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah. The Heroic Spirits in Singularities...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s spirits are nothing like these, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The dead don&#39;t come back to life. And they shouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters...Well, as Lady Musashi said, they are corpses. In essence, they ARE the dead come back to life.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They are beings born from dead Servants. From what I&#39;ve been told about Lord Houzouin Inshun...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...it sounds like becoming a Swordmaster changes everything about them, not just their personalities.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So it is not like the principle that makes every Heroic Spirit essentially a different version of the same person.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They may be close to the Servants you saw in Shinjuku, at least in the sense that their Spirit Origins differ from their natural state...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But that was a phenomenon specific to Shinjuku, so...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lady Onui, Lord Tasuke, I...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? Did you say something, Danzo?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, no, I&#39;m sorry. This would be difficult for you to understand. Please, pay that no mind.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway...I know it&#39;s hard. But we can&#39;t give up now.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>R-right. I will help too.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Tajima-no-Kami told me to assist you should the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters appear.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>So I shall push my performance limiters to their maximum...because I wish to protect those two children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Danzo.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>N-not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By the way...is there something on your mind?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>No...it&#39;s nothing. Please don&#39;t concern yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...All right. Both my iron and me have cooled down. You all talk too much.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now quit wasting time and go get ready! The sun will be up before you know it!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You were right, Lord Muramasa. By my estimation, cutting through this bamboo forest should make for a good shortcut.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Please try to make do just a little longer, Master. If you like, I could carry you on my back.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t bother. Have you even managed to peek through that mop of hair of yours and LOOK at your Master?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The kid&#39;s lower body&#39;s got plenty of muscle to spare.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You must&#39;ve done a lot of walking. Not for exercise...but for survival.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, I wouldn&#39;t go that far...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, I guess I HAVE walked quite a bit...</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. Understand your capabilities. Times like these, you want your companions to be full of confidence.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Good point. I don&#39;t know just how much [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] been walking, but the fact that [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] crossed an entire continent means [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] is definitely no slouch.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course, I&#39;m not half bad either,since I&#39;m a pretty seasoned traveler!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Shut up, cow-legs. I wasn&#39;t talking to you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wha...!? Where&#39;d that come from, Grandpa!? Come on, can&#39;t you be nice and treat me like one of your grandkids too?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve got my hands plenty full with two grandkids already. I need a third like I need a hole in my head.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...I see you&#39;re back.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I went on to scout ahead.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I detected a small number of monsters ahead. We could go around them, but that would cost us a great deal of time.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I see. Then we have no choice but to go through them. Lord Muramasa, Lady Musashi, I\u2013Huh? They&#39;re both already gone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s catch up and break through!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Got it, Master. Come, Lady Danzo, you too!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Understood!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...The obstacles have been eliminated. Let&#39;s keep going; we should reach the mountain pass soon.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I know this place like the back of my hand. I&#39;ll lead the way.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Everyone, there is something I would like to discuss.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What is it? Can you tell us while we walk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, but be sure to watch your step.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Tajima has told me a few things about Servants,but I still do not know much about them. However...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>They sound as though they are dead people returned to life. So then, what is the difference between Heroic Spirit Swordmasters and Heroic Spirits?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>According to what you have said,it sounds as though they are both more than that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Heroic Spirits are heroes who left a significant mark on human history, and Servants are their shadows.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>These Servants far exceed the capabilities of ordinary people, and many are exceptionally powerful warriors.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>For example, a single Servant joining a battle could lead anyone to victory against an entire army.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>A whole army...That sounds just like the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters who burned down Hitachi and wiped out Sagami.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>True. That&#39;s because the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are Servants that have been twisted to do evil.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I...see...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I-in fact, I&#39;m a Servant myself. Oh, but I&#39;m not a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I see.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Y-yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I see...I did not know that...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I-I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t tell you sooner. I couldn&#39;t think of a good way to broach the subject, so...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Whoa, look at those two having a moment! This is hardly the time or the place, but I can&#39;t take my eyes off them! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (You&#39;re staring. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Give them some privacy, Musashi. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>As for Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell and K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell...They&#39;re Servants who ended up becoming Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>They may once have been Shuten-Douji and Minamoto-no-Raikou, but whatever they were in life, they are now Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and have become the vicious creatures we saw for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>At least, that&#39;s my best guess based on everything we know so far.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>However, in their particular case,there is something else. It&#39;s...um...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I hesitate to bring this up, but I think it&#39;s important that we all be aware of it. That goes for you too, Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Before Shuten-Douji and Minamoto-no-Raikou were Heroic Spirits, they were oni.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shuten-Douji is, like, the queen oni.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Raikou has Ushi-Gozen...an oni side to her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Right. Shuten-Douji may be more overtly oni than Raikou, but oni blood still runs through both of their veins.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And we can&#39;t deny the possibility that this may be affecting how they are as Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Oni...you say?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And as for me\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Come to think of it, Tomoe Gozen seemed like she was using some oni power as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She WAS really strong.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll say. I&#39;ve never seen anyone use a bow like that before. It was downright terrifying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If we ever get to meet her again, then...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah. I&#39;d love to meet her again some day,without any animosity between us.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, oni, huh...I&#39;ve had run-ins with oni before too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There were a bunch around when Fujimaru and I first met, of course, but that was far from the only time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I&#39;ve got a few thoughts of my own based on my experiences, if you&#39;d like to hear them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Basically...there are many different types of oni.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>First: creatures outside the domain of humans,the uncivilized and untamable.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Second: the descendants of abominations that possess power outside of what is categorically within human capacity.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And third: beings whose hatred of this world was so intense that it gave them corporeal form and could never be pacified.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Some were even born like that because of how they were portrayed in stories.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So there are oni that live outside humans&#39; domain, oni that possess supernatural power, and oni that come from stories.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. Now, let&#39;s go back to the Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It may not mean much, but I happened to notice something they have in common. I guess you can think of this as a kind of thought experiment?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Something they have in common?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>By definition, Heroic Spirits are heroes, right? And it&#39;s not like just any samurai who made a name for himself on the battlefield can become one, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Some of them are people who, say, rebelled against a cruel feudal lord to save others, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Spartacus would be an example of the latter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess that kinda fits Boudica.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s more, they can do a lot more than any human. It may not be true for all of them, but most Heroic Spirits are really strong, right?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Right. Just the fact that their bodies aren&#39;t harmed by ordinary attacks makes them exceptionally dangerous.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In which case, the first two kinds of oni I mentioned above half-apply to Heroic Spirits too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Some Heroic Spirits are unbound by human mores,and some far exceed human capabilities.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As for the third kind...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I see what you mean. You&#39;re right; that might not be too different either.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Some Heroic Spirits are born from concepts and stories...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And some are summoned as Servants who have been transformed into monsters by the effects of those concepts and stories.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. And isn&#39;t that kind of what this current situation feels like?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Um...I&#39;m afraid I no longer follow you...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Are you saying that oni and Heroic Spirits are the same thing, Lady Musashi?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not the same, Lady Danzo. Lady Musashi is simply saying that there are similarities.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Similarities...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. They&#39;re very similar, but only at a superficial level. At their heart, they&#39;re fundamentally different.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The major difference between heroes and oni is the fact that oni-kind can never coexist with humans.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At heart, oni are twisted, warped creatures. They could smile one moment, and devour someone they love the next.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Everything about them can change in an instant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A complete and total inversion...like it was nothing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Sorry to interrupt you, Musashi,but that third kind of oni has shown up.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Take a look. It&#39;s almost like you invited the thing here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Is that a great dark oni!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s the third kind of oni!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s an oni born from malice and hatred!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Th-this is just one of those \u201Cspeak of the devil\u201Dthings, okay? I didn&#39;t invite it here!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Musashi ran off ahead! I&#39;m going to join her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll back you both up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to get through here quickly.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Understood. Then I shall help you to slaughter this oni as well.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Hostile eliminated! ...Phew. It was tough, but we managed.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Does this mean that the heroes have won, and defeated the oni? I&#39;m afraid I still don&#39;t fully understand.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, sorry if I confused you. I was just saying whatever came to mind. Don&#39;t dwell on it too much.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Still, in the end: it doesn&#39;t really matter if you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit or an oni!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a hell of a thing to say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. I may have plenty of opinions to share, but I still don&#39;t even know who I am!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve been to many different worlds, fought opponents with the same name countless times...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...and written something called the Book of Five Rings. But for all of that, I don&#39;t even know my own hometown.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...If I&#39;m being perfectly honest, I died back when I first wandered into a different world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not the same person I was back then...I may even just be a ghost claiming to be Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But even if I don&#39;t know who I am, there&#39;s one thing I can say for sure: at the very least, I&#39;m no oni!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s just as true for oni, too. Even if they don&#39;t know who they are, they can say this much for sure:</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>\u201CI am an oni. I&#39;m a beast and I live my life accordingly. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As long as you know that about yourself, that&#39;s all that matters. Even if you don&#39;t know who you really are...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...or even if you&#39;ve long since forgotten who you once were.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As long as I decide how I want to live,and act accordingly, then I&#39;m me!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And I won&#39;t let anyone criticize me for that! Or, well,at least I&#39;m not gonna criticize me for it right now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is: right now, I&#39;m someone who&#39;s here to fight bad guys with all of you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I want to save Onui and Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m here for them.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You got it. It doesn&#39;t matter who your family was, or where you came from. All that matters is what you want to do, and what you actually do!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So cheer up, Kotarou! Be honest: you felt bad for a moment earlier because you thought you were an oni just like them, didn&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Ulp.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Is that true, Lord Kotarou...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As far as Fujimaru and I are concerned, Kotarou, the fact that you&#39;re trying to save Onui and Tasuke makes you awesome.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re like a hero of justice straight out of a fairy tale. I&#39;ve got a big soft spot for people like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Me, I&#39;m an underhanded coward who will do whatever it takes to win.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t stand people who go around preaching justice, but I love people who try their best to do the right thing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So hold your head high, Lord Kotarou. As long as you want to help others, I&#39;ll want to help you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>A-ahh...Well, if Lady Musashi, one of the greatest heroes of all time, thinks that highly of me...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I suppose I have no choice but to rally myself and fight!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait. Really? Is that how I went down in your history books!?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>What you want to do, and what you actually do...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>In that case...what am I?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>What...AM I...?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...A ninja without a soul is nothing more than a hollow blade....</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Good, we finally made it to the trail.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>From here, we could reach the peak in an hour if we hurry without stopping, but then we would be too tired to fight, so we won&#39;t be doing that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So we hurry, but we also take breaks when we need to. No pushing ourselves too hard, and no getting exhausted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can push myself a little bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to get there as soon as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>As they say, even heaps of dust make a mountain in time. We need to hurry, but push yourself too much, and all of a sudden, you can go no further.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And if that ends up taking you out of commission just when it really counts, you&#39;d never be able to forgive yourself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So if you start to get so tired that you feel it in your knees, take a break. We still have a long way ahead of us.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>In that case, why don&#39;t I carry [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]? I may not look like it, but I am capable of carrying almost a ton.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That much...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I mean, that&#39;s amazing,but I&#39;m afraid it would be too risky.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you happened to drop [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] for any reason while we were running at our top speed, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] could be seriously injured, or worse. Especially since this isn&#39;t exactly the safest path.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Indeed. There&#39;s no telling when we might run into more monsters, so we need to proceed with caution.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Then it&#39;s settled. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re a weird, motley bunch, that&#39;s for sure. I guess the age of war really is over...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I know there ain&#39;t a ton of people living decent lives out there, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s somethin&#39; about you that&#39;s more than just passing strange, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do I remind you of your grandchildren or...?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t remember what my grandkids looked like anymore.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It was a terrible time to be alive back then. For most people, it took everything they had just to stay alive.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>All the samurai cared about was conquering other provinces, so there was no end of war on this tiny island.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Every now and then we&#39;d get a great leader, but they&#39;d always die well before their time, and there was no guarantee that their successor would worth a damn.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And if a powerful province came and invaded us,our feudal lords inevitably proved all but useless.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In order to fight a war, you need money, food, and manpower. It wasn&#39;t enough that our lords would demand we hand over our money. They also demanded our lives.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Working the rice fields was hard enough, but they came in and drafted all the young farmers for the army...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...then all of the fields were neglected. In the worst case, those farmers would even get killed in battle.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>On top of that, whenever a battle broke out near a village, soldiers would invade it and take everything from food to women.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>For most people in times of war...life is hell.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s true. Japan&#39;s Warring States period was a truly horrifying time to be alive.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>There was no god or Buddha to be found then. Maybe there was something worth caring about if you looked hard enough, but I never found it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Nor did I ever see any god or Buddha feeding starving children after a war came to an end.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Put another way, the blades of that time were too strong. They offered neither salvation nor forgiveness.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Back then, it seemed like the fires of war would rage on forever...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Even if some feudal lord managed to claim the empire for himself, and we enjoyed a time of peace for a while...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It was always just a matter of time before another war would break out.... At least, that&#39;s what I used to think.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why&#39;re you looking at me?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I can see it in your eyes. You&#39;ve been through a lot, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You grew up in privilege.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Yours are the eyes of someone who&#39;s never gone hungry, or lived in fear of war, or had to sleep out in the cold.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And you don&#39;t come from nobility either, do you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m just an ordinary [\u2642 guy /\u2640 girl].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think my family&#39;s anything special.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It may not be a straight line from Iemitsu&#39;s reign to your time, but eventually...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now I know this land will be home to kids with gentle eyes like yours. Even if people like you seem strange to me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Truth be told, it&#39;s hard for me to imagine a time filled with oddballs like you, but if this so-called peaceful world gets us there eventually, I guess it&#39;s not all bad.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grandpa...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hmph.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That was so cheesy!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Shut it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Aww, you&#39;re blushing, Grandpa. Cuuute! Oh, and for the record, I don&#39;t think the age of war was all bad either.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Oh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After all, you were there during it. So was I, and so was Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Danzo, I know you&#39;re active now, but you were around during the age of war too, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes, I was.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So we&#39;ve all got something in common then. We&#39;re willing to risk our lives to save children that are total strangers to us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That makes us all oddballs, as Grandpa Muramasa put it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Bah, give it a rest.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lord Muramasa, I have a question for you as well.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Earlier, when you said you don&#39;t remember what your grandchildren looked like...was that a figure of speech?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No. I honestly don&#39;t remember.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Thinking back on it now...I devoted every day of my life to forging swords, and nothing else.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Where blades are concerned, as long as you make them as you were taught, they can cut through most anything.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But that just wasn&#39;t enough for me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>A sword forged by a true master should,I thought, be able to cut through anything.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I was born and raised to make swords and nothing else.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Even as everyone else around me starved to death,my work as a smith kept putting food on my table.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I thought my swords had to be able to cut anything, or else there&#39;d be no point to my life.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So I set out to make the ultimate sword. I ended up forging so many blades...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But only because if I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d never be able to make one that was truly peerless.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I decided that sword should be capable of cutting through bonds, certainty, and even karma.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And just so you know, the Myoujingiri I lent Musashi isn&#39;t that. That one&#39;s just an evil super-blade that ended up reaching the demonic realm.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That sounds more than powerful enough, but I guess it&#39;s still not the sort of blade you were seeking, is it?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No, it&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m probably not making much sense to you, but that&#39;s okay. No one else can understand what it is I&#39;m seeking.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s barely one step removed from madness. Or maybe I went mad a long time ago and never realized it...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I barely remember my kids&#39; or grandkids&#39; faces. I have some recollection of the disciples who carried on my smithing techniques, but that&#39;s all...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I never did anything fatherly or grandfatherly for my family. And yet, here I am...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t give a damn whether this place is a dream, an illusion, or reality. This is where I ended up. I don&#39;t know who summoned me or why, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Then...you&#39;re a Servant too! Just like Lord Kotarou...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. I&#39;m not good for anything besides making swords, but for some reason, I showed up here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I know I haven&#39;t exactly come back to life,but even so, I made a decision.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now that I&#39;ve found myself with a new life here,I&#39;m going to make the most of it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;d make me real happy to see Onui get married, or travel wherever the wind takes her, just like Musashi.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Same for Tasuke. I&#39;d be happy to see the little guy grow up and become a merchant, or a military officer, or he could even travel as well.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So I&#39;m doing everything I can to make that happen. I forged spades, hoes, even pots, so I could save up money.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>When I dematerialize...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I want them to choose their own futures and do what makes them happy. To grow up in a peaceful world, never knowing what it&#39;s like to be hungry.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So I won&#39;t have any damn thing get in my way! Not a giant snake! Nothing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...! I&#39;m sensing an evil aura! A really big one!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That roar and that giant body, big enough to reach the heavens...It&#39;s exactly the same kind of great serpent the Assassin of Para\xEDso controlled!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s it doing here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought that was Para\xEDso&#39;s Noble Phantasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait. Of course! The oni of Mt. Ooe! There are some stories that say Shuten-Douji is the daughter of the god of Ooe...which would make her one of Yamata-no-Orochi&#39;s descendants!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>In which case, it&#39;s entirely possible that Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell could make use of the same power behind Para\xEDso&#39;s curse!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How is that possible!? Besides, no one should be going around summoning ancient serpents in the first place!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s using its whole body to block our path, huh. It knows we&#39;re in a hurry. Well, if that&#39;s how it wants to play, I won&#39;t show it any mercy!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not gonna hold back! I&#39;m goin&#39; all out to take this monster down!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know who this snake is descended from and I don&#39;t give a crap! If it insists on getting in our way...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll chop it up into bite-sized pieces! Not that I&#39;ll actually eat any of them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master, please stand back! We&#39;ve mortally wounded it...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...but it&#39;s too strong to just die right away. If you stay too close, it could hurt you as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Kotarou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not backing off.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru, I don&#39;t understand. Can&#39;t you give orders and provide support from farther back just as well?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You see...for most Servants summoned at Chaldea,the closer we can be to Master, the better.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Essentially, staying close by significantly enhances our power. That&#39;s why Master always stays by our side.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But in this case, it&#39;s just too dangerous for you to be here, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which is exactly why I have to stay nearby!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! This is how I always fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be so stubborn, kid. You should listen to the redheaded ninja once in a\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Dammit, the serpent went after Master with the last of its strength! Hang on, Master! I can see you rolling down the slope!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m coming to get you,so stay where yoYou&#39;re still rolling!?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a new enemy coming in from the front! It&#39;s another black serpent identical to the one we just fought!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Another one!? Now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay over here...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll catch up with you all later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Master!!!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru...!

We&#39;ll head out again once you&#39;ve gotten some rest.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Like Kotarou said, it looks like you lost a whole lot of blood, so I don&#39;t think you can stand up just yet anyway. You need get some rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Honestly, I wish we could just let you stay here,but we can&#39;t. We need you to fight with us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So rest up until the last possible moment,and then we&#39;ll head back out.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa and Lady Danzo are keeping watch outside.

You got here a lot sooner than I thought you would.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>We gave you until sunrise, which I think was more than enough time. I was looking forward to watching you all cowering in fear.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>But it&#39;s only just past daybreak. Barely even morning.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I know the moon is still out, but that&#39;s just what happens whenever we get serious. Sorry about that.

She&#39;s the only one I can do something about. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta likes to play around, so we should be able to handle her if we rush her all at once, but that definitely won&#39;t work on K\u0101las\u016Btra. )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(The only way to defeat her is to best her in a head-on test of skill...But, am I really good enough for that? )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hiii there, pretty oni! Thanks for sticking to your word and waiting for us at the peak like you said you would.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Must&#39;ve been hard, as much as you two seem to hate each other&#39;s guts! I&#39;m guessing you had some major differences of opinion, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not that I give a damn.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now come on, we held up our end of the deal. Give us back the kids.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where are Onui and Tasuke?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Give them back.</p><hr><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Oh, the kids?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I already ate them. It had been so long since I had children, so I was sure to savor them. I ate every. Last. Bite.

Where are the kids?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I told you, I ate them. What&#39;s your deal? Oni are many things, but we aren&#39;t liars.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Even for a lie, that was in extremely poor taste, Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell. If you&#39;d done that, you wouldn&#39;t have bothered taking them hostage in the first place.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Saying you killed them doesn&#39;t help you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Not knowing if they&#39;re alive or dead keeps us at a disadvantage. We have to act on the assumption that they&#39;re still alive.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If you were just going to throw away that advantage anyway, you wouldn&#39;t have needed to kidnap them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Then again, they could have just used them as bait to lure us out here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How about it, Hells? Did you really eat them?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Heh.</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hehehehehe...</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Ahh, what a joke. I thought you were smarter than that! Did you not realize you are dealing with two oni!?</p><p><strong>Rider of K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell:</strong></p><p>Do you really think we oni care about right or reason!?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>I mean, we care at least a little. Now that you&#39;ve fought all those big oni and giant serpents on the way here...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>...and now that your Master&#39;s had [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] insides all stirred up, and lost sooo much blood, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] must be exhausted.</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>And arguing over whether we ate the kids or not is only going to make that worse, won&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>So now that [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] so thoroughly tired out,I bet [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] meat must be nice and tender now...</p><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s about time to have a snack anyway.

Are you just trying to tough it out?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Are you seriously trying to make sure I don&#39;t worry about you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Or do you feel like you can&#39;t afford to let a little pain stop you when we still have two Swordmasters and their ringleader to fight?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...&#39;Course, I guess it could be all of the above, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In fact, I&#39;d bet that&#39;s what it is. Even when all the odds are against you, you never back down.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And it&#39;s not because you know you can always find a way to escape. It&#39;s because you never give up on life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;ll take your silence as a yes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, I&#39;m not about to back out either.

I&#39;m glad she said it after our duel was over.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She wasn&#39;t the first cool and collected oni I&#39;ve met, but...she was definitely the first to own up to her own failings like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I wonder how she must have felt...what made her feel the way she did to call herself \u201Cbroken. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If by \u201Cbroken\u201D she meant \u201Cincomplete,\u201Dthen I&#39;m in the same boat as her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even though I was born a woman, I never planned to get married, or even carry on my own family&#39;s legacy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That sort of thing might fly in Fujimaru&#39;s time, but not in the age of war.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If someone were to point out to me that I&#39;m fundamentally flawed, all I&#39;d really be able to do is agree with them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As far as I can tell,I&#39;m the only one living her life like this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even the other swordsmen I&#39;ve met have all been able to settle down to some degree.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But not me. I just can&#39;t seem to stay put.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m always traveling, and I never really look back. That must be why I keep wandering into other worlds.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No matter where I go, no matter what I do, I never leave any lasting impression on that world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why I keep popping up in all sorts of different places. It&#39;s like every world is telling me, \u201COh, sure, you can come in, since you don&#39;t matter. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And then, \u201CAll done? Right, out then. I couldn&#39;t care less about you. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Truth be told, I&#39;m more of a ghost than a person.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I know all sorts of things most people don&#39;t, and I&#39;m constantly meeting new people and leaving them behind when I get kicked out to the next world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But if you were to ask me why I&#39;m doing all this, all I could say is that I&#39;m trying to surpass my dad.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) When you get right down to it,I&#39;m really just petty.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I love money and honor and all that stuff, but the one thing I can&#39;t budge on is my silly childish pride.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh well, nothing I can do about that! When you get right down to it, I&#39;m a fool who only knows how to live for the moment!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As long as I&#39;m striving to reach the void,I&#39;ll be a wandering warrior. As for my future...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>When the god Tenjin comes to reside within my blade...When it reaches the pinnacle of Tenman Daijizai Tenjin, or even just Ishana-Ten...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...that&#39;s when I&#39;ll accept my fate.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In the void lies virtue, and no evil. Wisdom exists, principle exists, the Way exists, spirit does not.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A state of being second to none. The domain of mastery beyond mastery.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As much as I talked about that sort of thing, I never thought I would ever actually go down that path...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Haha, I guess it was worth spending so much time learning about martial arts!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s hard to believe, but I really got the hang of it during my duel with Lady Raikou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Which means the big problem still lies ahead. Pretty soon, my Niten Ichiryu will be complete.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Once it is, I will have lost the only purpose I had in life. I don&#39;t know how to get home, and I have no one to settle down with.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Once my sword is truly invincible,I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> C&#39;mon! Time for breakfast!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, morning, Fujimaru. I was just out watching the sky and talking to Tasuke.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Just so we&#39;re clear, I wasn&#39;t trying to get out of helping with meal prep or anything, okay?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Besides, Onui was so busy taking care of breakfast that I didn&#39;t want her to have to watch Tasuke too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Speaking of which, here you go, Onui. You can have Tasuke back now.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Thanks for watching him, Ms. Samurai! Breakfast is all ready now!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga ga\u266A</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Great, I&#39;ll be right there. Mmm, I can smell the miso soup already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were looking at the sky again?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course. It&#39;s so pretty. I was watching the clouds go by while I played upsy-daisy with Tasuke.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Another beautiful day, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It really is! ...Come to think of it, what&#39;s the difference between a beautiful day, and one that&#39;s just nice?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a difference, but I can&#39;t think of how to describe it. Can you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay, that&#39;s enough chitchat! We should eat soon, or Grandpa might get upset!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>...The time has come.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>At last, what I have sought for so long, Onriedo, will materialize. This is where the dark Jesuit sorcery bestowed upon me by Satan will bear fruit.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>The lone obstacles standing in our way were the Master of Chaldea and Shinmen Musashi, and neither of them are near Toke Castle now.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell and K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell did their job well. This is the perfect opportunity for Onriedo to take form.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Lower the veil of night, Caster of Limbo. This world no longer needs a proper sun.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>As you wish.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Sun! Sun! Hear me, sun! You bring the blessing of light to all living things! Now, I command you to set!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Set! Set! I command you to set! Close your eyes,and sleep! Slumber in death like unto night!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Perish, sun! Now is the time for we demons to awaken!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Come, darkness, and kill all living creatures!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Come, souls bearing the power of the Five Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, who died with hate and regret! Come, souls of the people they killed till their final moments!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>The sacrifices tinged with suffering, regret, and hate offered up to Lucifer, the great Satan himself, are now complete!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Show yourself, my Holy Grail! My Onriedo!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>The time has come to reveal your True Name. The grandest of monuments ever to guide a mountain of bodies and river of blood: Onriedo Castle!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was then that the abnormality in Shimousa revealed its true nature. A gross abomination stood in place of the second Edo itself, Toke Castle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This demonic castle appeared in the blink of an eye, as though the warring age&#39;s legend of the One-Night Castle had come to life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Not one person witnessed the castle&#39;s transformation. Before anyone knew what has happening, Toke Castle was gone, replaced by this new monstrosity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>According to Heian military journals, the leader of the rebels made his base in Shimousa. Does this then mean this castle is born of a grudge against all of Japan...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No. No, for this was not truly Shimousa,but the land of Kazusa given the name \u201CShimousa. \u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This castle is a bastion of demons,one that threatens to desecrate the entire world!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Its name: Onriedo Castle!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In a flash, the true sun vanished,and the world was thrown into darkness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In its place hung a crimson moon, glistening the color of freshly spilled blood. As of now, all of Shimousa is shrouded in its angry red glow.</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Wh-what the hell are these things!? H-hey, let go of me...! What&#39;s going on!? I thought the monsters had all been defeated...AHHHH...!</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Wh-why are there so many of these dark monsters here!?</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>I know! Lord Tajima! He&#39;s still in the castle, he&#39;ll...Rr, rrr...</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>H-hey...why&#39;s your head swelling up like that...?</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Aaah! M-my wife just turned into a monster!</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>S-stop it! Don&#39;t you recognize me!? I&#39;m your husband! C-cut it out! D-don&#39;t you bare your teeth at me! Stay back!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Hell erupted all around. Strange sounds reverberated around Toke Castle town as it was a powerful magical energy seeped into its very fabric.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Under the black sky lit only by the bloody moon, people were transformed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Resistance was futile. Screams fell on deaf ears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No one knew what was happening, no one could fight back. This is one of Caster of Limbo&#39;s most evil of arts!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The ultimate wickedness, it twists and distorts living things beyond recognition!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It crushes the will of its victims. Once cast,it twists humans in its range into monsters!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>However, it does not transform every human it finds. There is a chance for some to remain unaffected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It transforms at random. In an instant, one person can find herself beset by monstrous neighbors. A man could find that his wife had become an oni. A mother, that her children had become beasts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Those unfortunates with no magical resistance are simply altered, human norms switched with beastly urges, and they begin devouring humans around them.</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Aaaaaahhh! S-somebody! Anybody! H-help me...! Th-there are oni here...!</p><p><strong>Castle of Townspeople:</strong></p><p>Oh god...what happened to my child? Come here, Mommy&#39;s here...Ah!!!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Dammit! I was so preoccupied with the sudden change to Toke Castle that I didn&#39;t notice what was happening in town. This is so awful, I can hardly bear to look...!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>I must inform Lord Tajima at once! We must save as many of these townspeople as we\u2013</p><p><strong>Castle Town Child:</strong></p><p>Mister...Hey, mister...?</p><p><strong>Castle Town Child:</strong></p><p>Please, help...! M-my mom was just attacked by a giant monster...!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Ahh, thank goodness you&#39;re still alive, child! Where is your mother? I&#39;ll go help her right away!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Ghk...!</p><p><strong>Castle Town Child:</strong></p><p>Help me, mister...The monster that attacked her...? It was me!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>Hngh...Gaaah!</p><p><strong>Sakon:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry. That must have been a nightmare for you...I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t notice sooner...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Look at you now, Tokugawa lapdog.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>You meet your end so pitifully? The great Sakon,who committed such atrocities in Shimabara?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Aren&#39;t you the one who killed over thirty-eight thousand of my comrades? The one who mercilessly killed women, children, the elderly, without a moment&#39;s hesitation?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>What was that you said about this town? So awful you can hardly bear to look?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Bah, you, of all people, say that? You, who were responsible for scenes just like this hardly a year ago?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>You filthy curs of the Tokugawa were killing Christians left and right, insisting we weren&#39;t human!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Haha, hahahahahahahahaha! Just look at the great hero who destroyed Shimabara now!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Now that the sun has been reversed, all reason shall disappear from this world! Tonight is the night that all of you will be slaughtered like dogs!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>Well done, Caster of Limbo! Your Noble Phantasm shall usher in a new, evil world order!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>This darkness marks the end of this world! The fall of the Tokugawa regime! I have never before seen such a beautiful sight!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p><p>You are to be commended! Satan will be most pleased!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The grotesque moon cast its bloodred light upon the Sorcerer. His form proved to be identical to a certain Spirit Origin registered within Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...the Heroic Spirit Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Indeed, his name was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, and he did greatly resemble the historical figure connected to the tragedy of Shimabara.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But he was not the Heroic Spirit who made his mark on humanity. This man was from a history quite different from the one we know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He was a human without a Spirit Origin; the sole survivor of the hellscape that was Shimabara...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...and a man gone mad with rage and fury.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>With his name never going down in history, this separate version of Amakusa Shirou from a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon traveled across many worlds unbeknownst to us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>As he traveled across these many mysterious worlds...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...his grudge grew and evolved until he had become the living embodiment of hate. He accumulated power, and before he knew it, he had moved beyond mankind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Then, following the call of something that had reached out to him, he passed through the final door and arrived in this world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Just like Shinmen Musashi, the swordsman who came here along with Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAmakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>This world has gladly accepted the Tokugawa regime! It has forgotten the hell of Shimabara!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAmakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>How dare you...The rest of you may have forgotten,but I do not forget, and I do not forgive!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAmakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Now I, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, shall avenge the atrocities of Shimabara through the glory of Onriedo Castle!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAmakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Haha, hahaha, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>The sky&#39;s gone dark...! What happened!? I thought it was morning!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>W-w-waaah!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>There, there, Tasuke. Don&#39;t cry...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>A bloodred moon! Every time the sky looks like this, one of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters appears! But, I don&#39;t sense any Servants nearby.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stay alert.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Another Swordmaster could show up at any moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, at least we got to finish breakfast before all this! But...aww, I have a feeling I&#39;m gonna miss lunch now...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is the WORST! We&#39;ve had dinner AND breakfast at Grandpa&#39;s hermitage before, but we STILL haven&#39;t gotten to have lunch here!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The damn sun just vanished from the damn sky in the middle of the damn morning and THAT&#39;S what you&#39;re worried about?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Guess I can understand how you feel a bit. We&#39;ve seen this happen a fair few times, now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In fact, I kind of admire that unflappable nature of yours. If you weren&#39;t a swordsman, I&#39;d have taken you in as my apprentice.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>At any rate, does this mean one of those Heroic Spirit Swordmasters is showing up?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Kotarou, you said this only happens before they appear, right?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. I&#39;m not sure exactly how it works...but that&#39;s how it&#39;s been almost every time so far...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Allow me to handle this. I shall send up a flying observational device.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wow! Th-that was amazing! Was that a firework!?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>My apologies, Lady Onui. It was not a firework.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A rocket...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did the Edo period even have rockets?</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>\u201CRocket\u201D? I am not familiar with that word, but this device allows me to see great distances from high up in the sky.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>A moment, please. I shall have the results for you soon.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I have visual confirmation. Toke Castle has been radically transformed.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh!? The whole castle transformed!?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Yes. It is difficult to describe...Simply put,it has taken on an exceptionally evil appearance.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Evil...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Given the sky&#39;s current state, it&#39;s safe to say that the remaining Swordmasters and the sorcerer are behind this.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Since they&#39;re not trying to attack us this time,their target must be Toke Castle now...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now that you mention it, I think Inferno said she wasn&#39;t allowed to cut loose near the castle...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...and that it was an important part of their plans, or something to that effect. Maybe they&#39;re planning to use it to establish a new land of demons?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let them get away with whatever this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on. We need to go, now.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Slow down, kid. I get you&#39;re upset about this, but don&#39;t forget, someone just ripped a hole through your guts.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Your wound hasn&#39;t healed, and it&#39;s half a day&#39;s walk to the castle from here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That may be, Grandpa, but we still haven&#39;t kept our promise to Lord Inshun.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>On top of that, the pretty oni from before asked us to save Shimousa too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If Onui and Tasuke are going to grow up happy here, we can&#39;t leave things like this. Not even with lunch on the line.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t betray their trust.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You two done? Can I finish now? ...I ain&#39;t saying you shouldn&#39;t go.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...When I buried the villagers, there were some horses left behind after the battle. I shared a few of them with the people from other villages that came to help, but I kept several for myself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re tied up in the stable &#39;round the back. Take them. Ride to the castle. Just don&#39;t touch the chestnut one. He&#39;s mine.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You had horses here in these villages...? I didn&#39;t think the Edo period used horses for agriculture...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, of course! They must have belonged to the shogunate! Shimousa is famous for its horses, after all!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You got it. These horses belong to the Matsudaira, or basically Lord Tokugawa himself, but that don&#39;t mean a whole hell of a lot at this point, does it?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>All right, I haven&#39;t ridden a horse at full gallop in a while. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re coming too, Grandpa? On a horse?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>These monsters came after the kids. If their boss is there, I&#39;m going to make him pay for that.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Wow, I wish I could ride a horse too...Do Tasuke and I have to stay and watch the hermitage?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>No, you two are coming with me. With everything going on right now, there could be monsters here, too.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Speak of the devil.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Evil auras! There&#39;s several of them headed this way...They must be traveling in a pack!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have detected numerous heat sources as well. I believe it is a group of monsters, numbering approximately twelve.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a lot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get through them and head for the stable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master. I&#39;ll make quick work of them!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ugh, there really are more of them than usual! I wonder if this sky gives them energy or something?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whatever the case, I&#39;m ready for them!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Lunch or no lunch, I won&#39;t hold back. My stomach may be empty, but my spirit is as strong as ever. I&#39;ll make sure to finish this in one go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Somebody&#39;s fired up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You really are ready for this, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess I am! Like I told you before...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Here they come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>All hostiles defeated!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I can confirm there are no surviving enemies. Exiting combat mode.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hurry up and get the horses. Onui, go make rice balls with the rice left over from breakfast.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Okay! We cooked heaps so I can make a bunch! Yummy\u266A</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga-ga ga\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see them in such good spirits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Me too. Their smiles are so warm and bright they almost make up for the sun being gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess monsters don&#39;t scare them anymore.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really a good thing,but I don&#39;t think we can do much about it right now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hopefully, when they&#39;re older...they&#39;ll look back on all this as just a weird dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, let&#39;s go get the horses! Oh, if there&#39;s a white one, I call dibs!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to try riding a white horse at least once!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What are you, an idiot? There&#39;s no damn white horse! Just go get the horses already!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There you are, Lady Danzo. I&#39;ve been looking for you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The horses are all saddled up, so we&#39;ll be heading out now. What are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I...I was just thinking about that.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I see.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Danzo, I know this is rude of me,but can I ask you something personal?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Are you concerned about this situation as an agent of the shogunate? As a lone ninja?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Or is there something else that&#39;s weighing on your mind?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Personally, I&#39;d rather you remain here. Things are bound to be more dangerous than ever at Toke Castle.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa and myself are Servants. In my case, I can assure you that I&#39;m much tougher than when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I can fight without fear of dying from a stray bullet or a katana wound.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But you can&#39;t. You belong to this world.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I am nothing more than a mechanical puppet. There is no need to worry about me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Besides, I...I have already been given orders,so...if possible, I would like to join you...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Right, your orders from Lord Tajima. If Lady Musashi ends up fighting a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, you are to accompany her, was it?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s too risky, Lady Danzo.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We could easily end up fighting one who is even more deadly than Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell or K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We ninja don&#39;t specialize in head-to-head combat. All the more so when we&#39;re up against such dangerous monsters.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And I&#39;m sure Lord Tajima wouldn&#39;t want to send one of his best subordinates to an early grave.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I greatly appreciate your concern, Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Still...Yes...Thank you for telling me how you feel. You have helped me to make up my mind.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I will accompany you after all. Forgive me. I promise I will be of use.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I see...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Very well. If you insist on coming along, I won&#39;t stop you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>In that case, we&#39;d better get going, before Lord Muramasa yells at us for taking too long.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s true. This is a matter of grave importance, so I will do my best to hurry.</p><h2 id="section-14-ultima-cantica-the-stage-of-carnage-onriedo-middle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-ultima-cantica-the-stage-of-carnage-onriedo-middle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 14: Ultima Cantica: The Stage of Carnage, Onriedo (Middle)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>To tell the truth...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t remember how I came to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There is nothing in my records detailing exactly when that happened. All I know is that I was left lying around, broken, after the end of the age of war.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Kashin Koji, a peerless sorcerer, essentially gave birth to me by creating my body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My second father figure, the first Fuuma Kotarou, installed all manner of ninjutsu he created into my memory banks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Precious few people know how valuable this body of mine truly is. As far as most people are concerned, I am just another ninja.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If my body were to break, I would essentially be dead. I suppose it is my fate to be abandoned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In the end, I am just a machine made of flesh, iron, and wood. A monster not unlike the homunculi produced by Western alchemy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>How long did I spend as an unmoving, human-shaped machine?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Perhaps it was even longer than the time I have spent operating as a ninja.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Despite operating for many, many years...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...once I was broken, most of my records were damaged,and I could no longer play them back properly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I was simply left to decay...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...as my records...my thoughts, slipped away...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In time, my mind was emptied out completely,and my body would no longer move at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It simply groaned, and creaked, and cracked...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Then one day, a man found me. He repaired me, and gave me purpose as my new master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That man was summoned to the province of Shimousa as a Caster-class Servant. His name is Caster of Limbo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>From the moment he repaired me, I regained my consciousness. Or at the very least, I was conscious from that point onwards.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whether this consciousness was newly formed, or the one I had lost during the years I was shut down, I can&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But either way, I didn&#39;t care. Why?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Because I was created to be a ninja. That was my purpose then, and it is my purpose now. As such, all I need do is carry out my master&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>As long as I have my master, there is nothing to doubt. As long as I have my master, all I need to do is carry out my mission.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whoever the Caster of Limbo turns out to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Indeed, I don&#39;t know who he really is. He may be a Heroic Spirit, or a hero, or a human...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Perhaps he is even an oni. Or something else altogether...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>At any rate, it doesn&#39;t matter. It didn&#39;t matter. All I had to do was obey my new parental figure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I must not doubt him, no matter what. And yet...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Lord Kotarou. You have been checking in with me so often.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>For some reason,I feel as though I already know you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even though my records\u2013my equivalent of a normal human&#39;s memories\u2013have nearly all been lost.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I should have no records remaining, save the ones containing the ninjutsu I require for my missions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou. Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Did I ever meet you...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...before I was broken...?</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>Come on, hurry! There&#39;s no time to waste! We need to get out of here while the samurai are keeping those monsters busy!</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Close the wooden shutters! Yes, those! There&#39;s a bunch of those things trying to come out! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>The grounds south of the castle should be safe! Ugh, how long does it take to close a simple shutter!?</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>Oh my, you&#39;re so strong, Mr. Samurai! ...Er, I mean, come on, you lot! Hurry it up!</p><p><strong>Town Woman:</strong></p><p>You heard the man! We need to head south! All you big, strong men, carry the kids and the elderly! Go on!</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Aaah! Forget the ones who&#39;ve turned into monsters; there&#39;s nothing we can do for them! Discretion is the better part of valor and all that!</p><p><strong>Castle Warrior:</strong></p><p>Just think of them as a big fire and run away as fast as you can! Got that? You&#39;re running for your lives from a fire, not monsters!</p><p><strong>Town Man:</strong></p><p>Some fire this is! Dammit,I&#39;m gonna survive this if it&#39;s the last thing I do!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No sooner do we set foot in town than we&#39;re hit with a bunch of monsters! There are too many of them! Don&#39;t tell me this is\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve just finished scouting out the town. As we suspected, Toke Castle appears to be at the heart of this phenomenon!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Whatever happened there, it not only caused a great number of monsters to appear, it also transformed many of the people into monsters as well.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Fortunately, this area seems relatively unscathed, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So you&#39;re telling me those howls I hear off in the distance...are from monsters who used to be human?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Monsters that used to be human...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope there&#39;s a way to avoid fighting them.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>The eastern area appears to have been completely wiped out. Not a single person managed to escape.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. I&#39;ve heard that people can change, but this is ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The east has the keep, right? Maybe that means you&#39;re more likely to transform the closer you are to the castle?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That could be it. I believe Master should be okay thanks to [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] Mystic Codes, and you should be fine as well, Lady Musashi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I have seen you shrug off countless magical attacks with no adverse effects.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s as though you have some sort of innate resistance to magical energy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait. Was that a compliment?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Uh, yes, it was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s people close to the castle who transform...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope Kiyohime is okay.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>As far as I can tell, the samurai are maintaining their chain of command. Otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t be able to help the townspeople escape.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I would imagine they made sure the royal family got out safely first and foremost. At least, I hope so.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So people transform if they get near the castle, eh. In that case...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I should never have brought Onui and Tasuke here. I thought they would be safer with us, but that clearly backfired.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Fujimaru, make sure you keep the kids close by so they don&#39;t get lost.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t let go of Onui&#39;s hand.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Hehe, your hand is so warm, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss].</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga ga\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I just wish I could cover their eyes, too.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not scared with everyone else around. I know Grandpa and Ms. Samurai will beat the monsters!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Are you scared of them, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]? Is that why you&#39;re holding my hand?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo ga ga\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Can we ride the horse again? That was so much fun!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We left the horses tied up outside town,so I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to walk from here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d like to leave you two somewhere safe if we can, though...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m okay. As long as you and everyone else is around, I won&#39;t be scared. Same with Tasuke.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Goo goo goo\u266A</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Haha, so I see. You&#39;re excited about this, huh, Tasuke! You&#39;re such a brave girl, Onui. But all the same...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t\u2013Hm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, Fujimaru, see that lady over there leading people away from the town?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Haven&#39;t we seen her before? Didn&#39;t she help us out a lot the last time we were here?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Okay everyone, line up nice and orderly now! Hurry up, or the monsters might come and eat you!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Remember, children and the elderly go first. No pushing! No shoving!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Try not to look at the castle! We can&#39;t have people feeling ill and slowing everyone else down.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Besides, there are some samurai or something over there who look to be doing a good job slaying the monsters.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>So now&#39;s our chance to escape to the outskirts! Come on, hurry along!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re helping out like this, Otama.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed how calm and collected you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Well, of course. I didn&#39;t become known as the top courtesan in Yoshiwara for nothing.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>\u201CFights and fires are Edo&#39;s flowers\u201D after all. Of course we know what to do in a time of crisis.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Wait. You&#39;re those freeloaders!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nice to see you again, Otama! We were just slaying monsters over there when we caught sight of you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I hope you don&#39;t mind, but we have another favor to ask of you. You&#39;re going to stay here and keep helping people evacuate, right?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>More or less. As you can see, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right now. What about it? You might have a hard time finding another free room at a time like this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, well, uh...This is kind of hard to say, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hurry it up, Musashi! Some of the creatures from near the castle just wandered over here!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Heat sources detected. They are approaching us at incredible speed. I&#39;m afraid combat is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou has already gone on ahead to try and hold them back, but\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s pick this up later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Kotarou needs backup.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You heard the [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady], Otama! We&#39;ll come back after we&#39;ve taken care of those creatures!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Huh!? Look, I&#39;m just a geisha. Once I finish helping these people evacuate, I was going to run away with them!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Ugh, you people never listen!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Huh, you guys are pretty good at this. Are you all famous swordsmen or something?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>You took care of those monsters so quickly. That should give everyone more time to escape.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I&#39;d better be on my way now. Thanks again for helping us, and take care.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, you&#39;re not leaving us just yet. Didn&#39;t I tell you we had a favor to ask?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Ugh, what&#39;s this about? Is this REALLY the time to be asking for MORE favors!?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Besides, it&#39;s been an hour since this started. Most of the survivors have already escaped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s great to hear!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>If there&#39;s a silver lining to this mess, that would be it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder just how many managed to get out in time.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Good question, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Luckily, Yagyu something or other&#39;s samurai kept the monsters distracted long enough for us to get away.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh, is that so...? I see...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So how come you didn&#39;t escape already, Otama? We&#39;re pretty far away from your room here, after all.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...Well, you know.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I just happened to notice there were a lot of children and elderly here, so I came to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you rescued the people left behind, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew you were great, Otama.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I-it&#39;s nothing like that...I just figured we all have to do our part in times of need.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Oh, right, I just remembered. Do you know where Lady Kiyohime is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why do you ask...?</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I heard her servants screaming bloody murder earlier, though I couldn&#39;t make out what they were saying.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Then I saw them running off seeking refuge at the town&#39;s outskirts.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>In fact, I was just about to head that way myself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Good. Now I see why Musashi thought to entrust you with this.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Oh? Who&#39;s this strapping young\u2013Wait,I recognize you!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Thanks again for taking care of my grandkids the other day. Now I&#39;d like to ask you to watch them again. Come here, Onui.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>&#39;Kaaay. Oh, hi, Otama!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga\u266A</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Well, well, so you two are here too. Let&#39;s see, Onui and Tasuke, was it?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t think there was anywhere I could leave them, but I can tell they&#39;ll be safe with you. You seem like you can handle yourself in a fight.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Hope you don&#39;t mind watching them a second time.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Huh? Hang on!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>We have to go to the castle and find the mastermind behind all this. It&#39;s too dangerous for the kids to come along.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Sorry for the trouble, but I know you&#39;ll keep them safe.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Wait. Huh? You&#39;re kidding me, right? You&#39;re actually going to the castle? Now?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yep! That&#39;s what we needed, Otama. Thanks for watching them!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...See you later, Onui.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Be a good girl and wait for us with Tasuke until we get back. Make sure to listen to Otama, okay?</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I will! See you later, Ms. Samurai! See you later, Grandpa! Bye, Mr. Kotarou! Bye, Ms. Danzo!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Be careful out there, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 miss]!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you so much for doing this, Otama.</p><hr><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...You really are serious about this castle business, huh? Ugh, it&#39;s just one thing after another with you people.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>All right, you win. I promise I&#39;ll take good care of them, so go do what you have to.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>And make sure you all finally pay a visit to my establishment when you get back!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s get a move on. We can&#39;t have the nice geisha looking after Onui and Tasuke forever.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, is that how it is?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey, Grandpa, you really took a liking to Otama,didn&#39;t you? Is she your type or something?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Nothing to do with type, girl. What&#39;s not to love about a woman of principle? Or are you still too young to understand that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wait...are you saying I&#39;m NOT a woman of principle?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In your case, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d call it principle.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>If anything, I&#39;d say you&#39;re more like...a giant flower, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Otama&#39;s a flower too, but in your case, there&#39;s no stem. You&#39;re just all flower.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s that supposed to mean!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s a good thing. You&#39;re the kind of flower that stands out just by being there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Wow, so you&#39;re saying I&#39;m a flower blooming in a sea of grass!? That&#39;s beautiful! I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d be good at compliments after all the years you&#39;ve had to practice!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I never said you&#39;d bloomed yet...But never mind. It looks like we&#39;ve got more foes to face.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have confirmed it is another Orochi! No, wait...There is a second one!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ve gotten the hang of fighting these now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Look out! Large hostiles incoming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Got it!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>We defeated the Orochi! Nicely done, Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Those Orochi were exceptionally strong, weren&#39;t they? I wonder if it has anything to do with us getting closer to the castle?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve still got plenty of fight left in me.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m relieved to hear that. I may not be able to help as much as I would like, but I&#39;ll still do everything I can!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess I haven&#39;t got the hang of this after all...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If we are to take Para\xEDso and Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell at their word, these serpents are kin to Yamata-no-Orochi, who is said to be a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>So it&#39;s not surprising that they would be such a challenge. I&#39;ll have to redouble my efforts as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Good, you&#39;ve finished. Then let&#39;s hurry.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Wait, Lord Muramasa. Just a moment. May I ask who you are?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...Heh.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Surely there is no need for introductions now. I am just a passing missionary.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The missionary guy!</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. I see you remembered me, Fujimaru. I&#39;m also surprised to see you heading straight for the heart of this disturbance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Count of Monte Cristo!</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know who that is. I&#39;m nothing more than a missionary. Not every dream you have is connected.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>But, feel free to call me whatever you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You Christians are something else. You were fighting one of those giant serpents off by yourself, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve never seen black fire before.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Hardly anything special, I assure you. Just some burning water imported from foreign lands. I&#39;m told there&#39;s plenty of it to be found further west of Tianzhu.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So you&#39;re knowledgeable and talkative, eh. I guess you really are a missionary!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Um, would you happen to be from Chalde\u2013</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Now, it looks to me like you&#39;re headed for Toke Castle. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>That ominous aura surrounding it is a curse designed expressly to keep people away. The fact that you are advancing toward it despite that tells me that you are all either hopelessly dim-witted...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...or that there is something giving you the strength to endure its fury and malice. Either way, you made the right choice, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>There is no need for you to cease your advance. Continue on your way.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>A sorcerer is using the keep at Toke Castle...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...or rather, Onriedo Castle, as it ought to be known now, to perform a ritual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Onriedo Castle!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Onriedo...Para\xEDso mentioned that. So, that&#39;s what this castle is called...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry, did you say Edo Castle?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Onriedo...Para\xEDso mentioned that. I suppose the last part DOES rhyme with \u201CEdo Castle\u201D...I wonder if that was intentional?</p><hr><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>If that name doesn&#39;t betray his true intentions, I can&#39;t imagine what would! Indeed, that name is undoubtedly meant to be a play on words.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>It is not merely the embodiment of rage, regret, and agony. It is a curse. Or, perhaps, anger towards a god who has yet to provide salvation.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>The deeper the depths of one&#39;s love,the easier it is for them to fall prey to hate.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Though he is certainly not the only one to blame for this, he has also grown well past the bounds of any one person.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>It is up to you to stop him, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh? What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s saying the mastermind is in that castle. I figured as much, but it&#39;s good to know for sure.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Although, how do you know so much? Are you in league with this sorcerer person?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Depending on your answer\u2013</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Hmm...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>I am not connected to the mastermind at all...but I do have a small connection to a different man who looks exactly like him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>But no matter. Hehe, hahahahaha! Let me just say that as a fellow Christian, I can understand how he feels!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s THAT supposed to mean!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t answer anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>At any rate, you must hurry, Fujimaru. The sorcerer is not the only one in Onriedo&#39;s keep.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Matsudaira&#39;s daughter is sure to be held captive there as well. What was her name again? If your memory serves\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kiyohime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s being held in the castle!?</p><hr><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Driven by revenge, the sorcerer means to cast a far-ranging, multilayered curse on the entire Tokugawa regime! His curse is so powerful that it will threaten the stability of many parallel worlds!</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>And since his aim is to curse every possibility of a Tokugawa regime, Matsudaira&#39;s daughter would make for the perfect catalyst, given her Tokugawa heritage!</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Her blood may be a bit lacking compared to someone from the immediate Tokugawa family, but it should still serve for his plans.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>I mean, given that Iemitsu is only the third shogun, her blood is still more than strong enough.... Aha, I see.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Perhaps he had been looking for a parallel world where Matsudaira&#39;s daughter was living near Edo soon after the Shimabara Rebellion.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Then it all makes sense. Hah. Fascinating!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, so, what exactly does that all mean!?</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Well, once Kiyohime&#39;s soul is sacrificed, Onriedo Castle will be complete, and this world, along with many others, will be destroyed. Now hurry!</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Well? What are you waiting for? Go on, go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you! I promise we&#39;ll save Kiyohime...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We will protect this time period AND this Shimousa!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Er, um...There&#39;s a lot I&#39;d like to say,but I&#39;m afraid it will have to wait until later!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I must be going too.</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>Heh. Run, Fujimaru! I may not be able to guide you on your way...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>But I can tell you this with absolute certainty! The keep of Onriedo Castle...</p><p><strong>Missionary:</strong></p><p>...will be the stage of your final duel to the death!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...This is the same castle we were at before, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Look at how much it&#39;s changed. If there was ever a castle made just for monsters, this would be it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Danzo was right about this place. I can&#39;t even imagine how much evil stuff you&#39;d have to mix together to get something like this.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can see why that missionary guy had a lot to say about it. No wonder there&#39;s no one else around.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Do you hear that, Fujimaru? Is it just me, or does it sound like the castle has a heartbeat...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just you. It&#39;s like a living creature.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this is where the sorcerer and Kiyohime are...</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Sheesh. They&#39;re not even trying to be subtle, are they?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And here I was wondering where our enemy had hidden their base of operations...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I guess they deserve some credit since we didn&#39;t find their hideout before this happened. Now they&#39;ve got us on the defensive.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But, that all ends tonight. Are you guys ready for this?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Of course. I won&#39;t back down now. Not after having come this far.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I may not be fully recovered, and Master&#39;s wound may not yet be healed. But, as long as we&#39;re all together, I can&#39;t imagine us losing.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s go. It&#39;s time to settle this once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be facing the sorcerer, and two Swordmasters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They could be a gauntlet, or a battle royale.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>True, and we don&#39;t know which it&#39;ll end up being. But the important thing is that we&#39;re ready for anything. Now, we just need to figure out how to get inside this creepy-looking castle\u2013</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Heat sources detected. A large number of monsters are materializing inside the castle grounds and walls. Preparing for combat now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks like this is the opening act: a pack of monsters, and a man-eating monstrosity!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>No more grumbling. Let&#39;s cut our way through these things and make our way inside!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Hostiles eliminated! We now have a clear path forward into the castle!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>This way. My enhanced vision confirms that this castle&#39;s interior is identical to Toke Castle.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>We shall take the shortest path available to the keep. Please, hurry.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Phew. Okay, let&#39;s get going then! After all our walking and horseback riding, this is the last leg of our journey!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That sure is a tall keep, isn&#39;t it? This last leg could be especially hard for an old man like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll carry you myself if I have to.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I&#39;m the one who&#39;ll be carrying you if you get tuckered out. I may be old, but I&#39;m still in my prime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s what I like to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All right, everyone...in we go!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Well, at least this place looks familiar.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think this is where we first met with Kiyohime inside the castle, and where we fought Para\xEDso.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I believe it is. It may look a lot creepier than it did back then, but the castle&#39;s layout appears identical.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>As such, it seems safe to assume this is the same area. That aside, I wonder why we haven&#39;t run into anyone yet...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It works out well for us in that we neither have to fight nor rescue anyone, but I can&#39;t help but find it unsettling.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Much as I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s because everyone in the castle managed to escape, I doubt they were that lucky.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Just listen to that heartbeat. If you told me this castle suddenly grew a mouth and ate up everyone inside it,I&#39;d believe you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is clearly no place for humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry and find Kiyohime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to stay here any longer than we have to.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I agree. Still, it&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I figured we&#39;d run into more monsters in here. It&#39;s almost like they weren&#39;t expecting any intruders.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Beats me. Now come on, let&#39;s keep going. Tell us where we need to go next, guide.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Danzo?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have something I need to tell you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? Is it about the castle?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>No...No, it is not about the castle, or our route. But if I miss this chance, I may never be able to say this.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>As such, I believe would be best to do so now,when there are no monsters around.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Although, when it comes to making decisions...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...my ability to judge matters correctly is severely diminished right now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Is that how it feels to you, Danzo? I certainly don&#39;t get that impression.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re here helping us out, after all. I don&#39;t think you need to say anything you&#39;re not comfortable with.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But, I...I...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...(Sigh) You just can&#39;t let this go, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>In that case, let me guess what it is you want to say:</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;ve actually been on the sorcerer&#39;s side all along. Am I right?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But, how...? I never mentioned anything of the sort...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>In fact, I am certain I never gave away any information about my circumstances or loyalties!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>How did you\u2013No. I should ask: When did you first suspect me?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hmm...Pretty much from the start, I think? It was less that I had an actual suspicion than just a...feeling.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Is that true for all of you? ...Even you, Lord Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Well, I didn&#39;t catch on as quickly as Lady Musashi did, but we ninja are trained to always be vigilant of others and their motives.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>After we fought Para\xEDso, my suspicions that you were hiding something were confirmed.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>And since there&#39;s only one thing a ninja could be hiding...that confirmed you were working for our enemy.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Yeah. Why do you think I invited you into my hermitage?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d rather have you gathering intel where I could see you than sneaking around behind my back.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Th-then...did you know too,[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I did think you were acting suspiciously.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I-is that so...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I see...Then, all of you knew...who I really was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I realized after the children were abducted.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, good point. Danzo was seriously flustered when that happened, wasn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>So you knew about me all along, Lady Musashi. Then Lord Kotarou figured it out soon after...as did [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>And Lord Muramasa saw through me right from the start.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Then...why?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Why didn&#39;t you kill me...?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>With your skills, you could have done so easily.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Why would I do that? Everyone&#39;s got their own troubles to deal with, and it&#39;s not like you attacked us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whatever your job might be, you still risked your life to help us. That&#39;s more than enough for me to trust you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I didn&#39;t know that...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Even if you had been secretly planning an attempt on Master&#39;s life, I was prepared to keep [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] safe.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I have both the ability and the confidence to pull that off.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If I didn&#39;t, I could never have let an enemy ninja accompany us. Besides...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>This sort of thing happens all the time during an age of war, Lady Danzo.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Also, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you started to wrestle with something along the way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone else, but personally...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I wanted to wait and see what answer you arrived at.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Why...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Because you&#39;re beautiful, of course! Erm...kidding, kidding! I was just...trying to lighten the mood!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What I meant was, you&#39;re not a bad girl at heart.... Oh, right, you&#39;re older than me. So...not a bad woman at heart?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, that&#39;s what I thought,and it looks like I was right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After all, the reason you decided to speak up now is because you felt you couldn&#39;t wait any longer to say something, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m glad I was right about you, Lady Katou Danzo.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I-I...As a ninja, I cannot fail my mission...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Thus, I was planning to kill all of you. Although Lord Empireo told me to assist you when you fought against the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lord Limbo also told me to kill you if the chance presented itself...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But...back then, when Lady Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell and Lady K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell abducted Lady Onui and Lord Tasuke...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I was surprised to find myself feeling a great pain weighing on my chest.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>From then on, I...I was no longer sure what I should do...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What, you think the kids were abducted because you did something to my barrier?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t be an idiot. I&#39;m a Servant. There&#39;s no way any flesh-and-blood ninja could get through it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You didn&#39;t do anything to my barrier. It just wasn&#39;t good enough to keep those two oni out.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Besides, I don&#39;t have any great military strategy. I&#39;m just a swordsmith.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>If I had it to do all over again, I would.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Huh...?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>So...you do not blame me for placing your grandchildren in danger?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Why would I? That wasn&#39;t your fault. If I blame anyone...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I blame Musashi and Fujimaru! All they did was eat my food and use my hermitage as a hideout!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lord Muramasaaa...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean...you&#39;re not wrong, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>So, every one of you knew all along...and you were still kind enough to keep me by your side.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I never would have guessed it. I was the only one who didn&#39;t realize what was going on.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am well and truly broken...No, perhaps it is more accurate to say that I was never fixed.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am a machine whose only purpose is to carry out its master&#39;s orders. In that sense, I am no different from a sword, or a spear, or a matchlock, or a wheel.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am...a tool. A thing whose only purpose is to be used by another.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>According to my records, you told Para\xEDso that a ninja without a soul is nothing more than a hollow blade.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...I agree with that completely,and that&#39;s what I tried to be.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But, I couldn&#39;t. As I am now, I am neither a proper ninja, nor a hollow blade.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>At some point, I gained a soul.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...And so, there is something I wish to tell you all...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Please believe me when I tell you that I am here now of my own accord.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have led you to Onriedo Castle of my own volition,in the hope that you will prevent its activation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Activation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean this still isn&#39;t its final form...?</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>No. That missionary we ran into was correct. Once Lady Kiyohime is sacrificed, and this castle takes her soul...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Onriedo Castle will activate its curse,and fully take root here in this world&#39;s Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>We must stop the sorcerer before that happens, or the darkness will destroy this and many other peaceful worlds...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...and then flow into yours,[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So then...this whole abnormality can actually cross into different worlds!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...Haha, hahahaha. What a joke.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Your own volition? A motive to rebel?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Did you really think a broken-down puppet like yourself would be permitted such things? Haha, how absurd.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Free will? An automaton, becoming conscious!? How utterly absurd, laughable, even. Never in all my life have I heard anything so preposterous.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Admittedly, I am enjoying watching you squirm and agonize over all this. At the very least, it serves to alleviate my boredom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of the Swordmasters we met in the bamboo forest!</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Caster of Limbo! Dammit, I thought you would still be with the sorcerer!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Please be careful, everyone! His sorcery is tremendously powerful! If it hits you directly, not even you will escape unscathed!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Even after you betray us, that is the best advice you can offer them? What an utter joke. I must make sure to do a better job repairing you next time.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Or perhaps, I should have broken you more thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Up until now I was only breaking you a bit at a time, simply because it was so comical to see you flailing about in a state of disrepair.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Maybe I should have fixed you properly after all. Hehe, yes, that&#39;s it. Next time, I shall crush about seventy percent of your brain.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>What...? What did you say...!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I said that I broke you. What about it?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>When I found you, your limbs and exterior were severely damaged.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I suppose you had shut down due to a lack of magical energy. So I broke you.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I mixed up your mental records,turning you into a broken-down puppet.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Oh, but I did fix your damaged body, of course! Hehe, I do hope you appreciate that!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t like your voice. You&#39;re the kind who wields words like weapons, using them to batter your opponents.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m the kind of person who will do anything to win too, but there are three things I just won&#39;t abide.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>First: one-sided slaughter;the killing of unarmed people.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Second: toying with other people&#39;s pride and beliefs for your own amusement.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Third: stealing food from someone who&#39;s hungry!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And you&#39;re already two out of three.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let me guess: you&#39;re sticking to the shadows because you&#39;re just too damn ugly, right? Stop hiding, you deviant! Show yourself!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Very well then...I shall comply with your request, Lady Shinmen Musashi. I believe this is the second time we have met in person, yes?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I believe the last time was back in the bamboo forest? How good of you to come all this way to our Onriedo Castle.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Wh-whoa, he&#39;s actually really handsome! I-I mean, he&#39;s not my type or anything, but, whoa! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi. Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Be careful, okay? Please?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh!? D-don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine! That was just a reflex!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Anyway, just pretend that didn&#39;t happen. So, you&#39;ve finally shown yourself, villain.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Your voice may be ugly, but I admit the rest isn&#39;t bad. You do strike me as the beautiful predator type, though.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>An accurate appraisal, thank you. Now that we have properly met, I would ask that you call me...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...Abe-no-Seimei.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Abe-no-Seimei!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Heian period&#39;s legendary onmyouji!?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Seimei? YOU&#39;RE Seimei?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve heard that name! I think...he&#39;s supposed to be fairly well-known in the Caster community.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Abe-no-Seimei. Guardian of Kyoto, and a genius among the onmyouji.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>He was a legend. The highest rank of astrologers and a master of yin and yang techniques. It&#39;s said he even knew secret spells that could bring the dead back to life.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s also said that a man with that True Name defeated the white-faced nine-tailed fox, one of the three great monsters that threatened all of Japan.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Some stories say he was a superhuman born to a fox, who went on to live an exceptionally long life. It makes sense that a person like that would leave his mark on humanity as a Heroic Spirit, but...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You sure don&#39;t look like a guardian of anything to me. If anything, I&#39;d have to say...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...you have the face of an irredeemable villain.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hehehehehe. You&#39;ve got me there!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahahaha. It&#39;s nice to see you&#39;ve got a sense of humor! In that case, maybe we can find a way to resolve this without\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>A barrier!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Indeed!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Musashi, look out!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I see you went after Lady Musashi from behind, Lady Danzo.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I-I didn&#39;t mean...! Oh no. I can&#39;t stop. I can&#39;t stop myself! Lord Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I am so sorry...It seems that I was actually playing into the Caster of Limbo&#39;s hands all along...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I thought that I had brought you here of my own accord, in order to stop the sorcerer!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I really believed that I was acting of my own free will...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>That is truly how it felt to me!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>But, in fact, I...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>It seems I was nothing more than a foolish puppet. Lord Kotarou, everyone, I must kill you now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I believe you, Lady Danzo. And, I thought that something like this might happen.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehe. Hehehehe, hahahahahaha, wonderful! I&#39;m so glad you turned out to be kindhearted souls willing to play along with my little farce!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Then come, and dance with my puppet! Of course, I doubt a broken-down doll will be enough to satisfy you...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...so I&#39;ve also prepared a smorgasbord of monsters to go with her! Oh! Also, allow me to explain why you have yet to come across any monsters within this castle so far!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve been holding them back for this very moment,so I could witness your deaths for myself.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Since the world is coming to an end anyway,you may as well put on a good show for me!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Dream on, heretic.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you get away with this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You said it. No chance in hell I&#39;d let a creep like you walk away from this! I&#39;m gonna wipe that smirk right off your face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Danzo...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Goodbye, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru. One way or another, this is where we part ways!</p><hr><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Oh yes, Danzo&#39;s stronger than you might think, so be careful not to drop your guard! You see, I&#39;ve imbued her with a special form of my sorcery.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>One that recreates the Curse of Annihilation&#39;s karma through machinary! It is one of my greatest techniques, easily capable of destroying even a Servant!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I do hope you enjoy it, Master of Chaldea! Shinmen Musashi!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...So fast!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>No, you are just too slow, Lady Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Damn, she&#39;s keeping pace with Musashi. Guess Seimei wasn&#39;t bluffing about that karma nonsense.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Before I go, let me say: thank you. Thank you for treating this foolish puppet like a real person.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>And, forgive me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lady Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Danzo!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Farewell.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That sound...She just activated something inside herself! Lady Musashi, get back!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nnn...ghh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She self-destructed...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That one hurt...I&#39;m sorry, Danzo. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t stop you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi, your eye...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m okay. Never mind me. Danzo&#39;s...!</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Ko...ta...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>Lord Kotarou...Lord Kotarou...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I cannot see. Where are you...? I must have gotten separated from them...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>All of you, please...Hurry, and stop the sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s my fault those two children...endured such a nightmare...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have to...make amends...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...Oh, that&#39;s right. Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>I have...met you...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong></p><p>...somewhere before...haven&#39;t I...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Mother...!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...There. Now I&#39;m good to go!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thanks, Fujimaru. It&#39;s lucky for me you&#39;re so good with your hands.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This isn&#39;t so bad as wounds go. It&#39;s a mark of Danzo&#39;s feelings.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wish we could have saved her.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah. Me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want to believe she was telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Yeah. I do too.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>She said she wanted to protect the world. Even after that bastard destroyed her insides...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...That was what she wished for. Right to the very end.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Maybe she thought her death was dishonorable. Maybe she thought it was all for nothing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But we won&#39;t let it turn out that way. We can&#39;t let her go out as just another tragic figure.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then in that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I thought you would say that. In that case...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thanks for holding down the fort, Grandpa Muramasa! Sorry we left you to fight on your own for a while!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t have to do anything. He&#39;s just been sizing me up while you were gone.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Why&#39;re you wearing that eyepatch? What happened to Fujimaru&#39;s Mystic Code?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid it didn&#39;t work this time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I thought Fujimaru would be able to heal me with [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] Mystic Code like [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] always does, too...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...but this wound on my right eye just refuses to close up. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] did manage to stop the bleeding, though.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve heard of wounds that refuse to close before. Swords that reach the demonic realm sometimes have curses like that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So, given that this villain is calling himself Abe-no-Seimei...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...I bet he knows about all sorts of curses. You must&#39;ve imparted something really nasty upon Danzo, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...I did indeed. You are most perceptive, distinguished elder.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I must say though, I&#39;m surprised to see you crawling back to the fight with that unseemly eyepatch, Lady Musashi! Hehe, how embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>(That was a brilliant slash. It should have taken his head clean off. )</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>(But he stopped it easily! )</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehehehe. Hahahahahaha! Is that the best you and your Niten Ichiryu can do, Shinmen Musashi!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>And after you&#39;ve gone to the trouble of applying such a hideous eyepatch, no less!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>This won&#39;t do at all! I haven&#39;t had nearly enough fun yet!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Great, now there&#39;s even more of them!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...In the end, I never managed to call you \u201CMother. \u201DNot even once.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I am a Servant, and above all, a ninja.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I must fight according to my Master&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I would be lying if I said I have no regrets,but, I do like fighting by my Master&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I really do. And fighting to save the world isn&#39;t bad either.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It really isn&#39;t, Mother. I can see why you pushed yourself so hard to do the same.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Fighting for what&#39;s right feels very different from struggling to survive in an age of war.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s why\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What is this...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I can feel magical energy coursing through me. It&#39;s the same type as mine...My mother&#39;s Fuuma energy...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I remember...she said there were two people who created her. Kashin Koji...and the first Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That means...this is the magical energy the first Fuuma embedded into her!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve lost count of them! They just keep coming...It&#39;s getting hard just to breathe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t fall back now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to get through them and take out Caster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting so long, Master. As the fifth Fuuma Kotarou, I ask that you let me handle this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Kotarou!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well look at you, all grown-up and handsome now. I take it you&#39;re done saying your goodbyes, Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Danzo entrusted me with the magical energy left to her by the first Fuuma. Every cell of my Fuuma blood is crying out!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>A ninja without a soul is nothing more than a hollow blade...and a soulless, cackling human is nothing more than a demon!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>A ninja&#39;s path is not one of justice and righteousness. And yet, my mother tried to walk it anyway.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If I don&#39;t try to follow in her footsteps...I&#39;ll never be able to give her the farewell gift she deserves!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Mm. Mmm.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Mmm...? Hehehe. And just what do you think you can accomplish all on your own, ninja boy?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I can see you giving off some unusual form of magical energy, but now that Onriedo Castle is on the verge of activating\u2013</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not on my own. Lady Danzo is with me now! Prepare to die, Caster of Limbo!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>No, no, no, sorry, I&#39;ll not be making any such preparations. After all, you&#39;ll never get close enough to even try!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll help you, Kotarou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Go fight your way through them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...Useless, fruitless, pointless, meaningless!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Even if you do have more magical energy than most Servants, there is nothing you can do to me while Onriedo Castle enjoys Satan&#39;s protection!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>It is impossible for the likes of you to take my head! Hahahaha, hehe, hehehehehehe!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Are you sure about that? We have destroyed ninety percent of the monsters shielding you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Soon I&#39;ll finish off the few that remain and cut you down where you stand!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Mmm? It seems that Fuuma boy is going on about something. Well, it&#39;s nothing that concerns me.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The redhead clearly doesn&#39;t understand. They are not the ones making their way to me.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I am the one making my way to them. Now, I think it&#39;s time to end this...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...Master of Chaldea. Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hahahahahahaha, go ahead and pray to your Buddha all you want! Go on, my little pentagram, eat up their light!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Huh...!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t move...! This must be one of his curses...!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Now let&#39;s see...The Curse of Annihilation...I think I&#39;ll imbue you with a special one!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hahahahaha, I see it! I see your soul! You seem to have some doubts, just like the Lord Sorcerer, but you cannot hide anything from me!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hehe, this takes me back. Inshun, the others...they all displayed the most wonderful expressions of shock and agony during their transformations.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re doing your best to fight it, but it&#39;s pointless! There is nothing at all you can do!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Dammit...!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Hahahahahahaha! I shall remake your soul,your will...everything about you!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Goodbye, Shinmen Musashi! Hello to our newest Heroic Spirit Swordmaster!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>What a delicious joke, turning you into a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster while you are still alive! Indeed, you deserve nothing less than a hell of\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t underestimate Chaldea...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mystic Code: Rain of Isis!</p><hr><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>What!!!???What is this!!!???</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks like we&#39;re the ones who made our way to you, Caster of Limbo.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...!!! ...???</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Th-this cannot be happening...How could a mere human dispel my sorcery!? How dare you mock the protection endowed by Satan, by Lucifer himself!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>And...is this a wound...? How could you break my multilayered barrier. My defense should be impenetrable...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;ve seen through your karma. I could never have done it without fighting against K\u0101las\u016Btra Hell and her lightning-quick techniques.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I have taken my first steps into the void. I may still be immature, but understand that by reaching emptiness, my sword has become invincible.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Curse you...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Curse you, Musashi!!!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>I shall obliterate your very soul! In the name of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, we shall do battle!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Come forth, my blood-soaked frontier! This mountain of bodies and river of blood shall serve as the stage for our battle, and consume the loser&#39;s soul upon their defeat!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>The Cursed Name of my blade is Caster of Limbo! The True Name of my vessel is not worthy to mention!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ACaster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Come forth, great spirit of the Shimousa Souma clan! I have found you an opponent who has defeated several Heroic Spirits already!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ACaster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>You are more than worthy to serve as my champion in this duel to the death!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ACaster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Prepare yourself, Shinmen Musashi! Our final battle is upon us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Impossible...! There is no way you could have cut through my great spirit...my talisman...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course I could have. Thanks to this, I now have a good idea of how to fight while wearing an eyepatch.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Impossible...!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>No blade other than the accursed Muramasa&#39;s sword should be capable of wounding us Heroic Spirit Swordmasters...Of wounding me...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Are you sure about that? Now that my mother&#39;s protection is with me...?</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Are you telling me such insignificant things as her prayers, her wishes, her feelings...</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>...gave you the power to wound me!? The Caster who commands limbo itself!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...Long ago, there was a woman who raised me.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She wasn&#39;t a living creature, but a machine. She&#39;s the one who taught me the Fuuma clan&#39;s ninja arts.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She was a bit broken down, and forgot things constantly.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>She would often smile sadly,and say she might even forget me someday.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But she was the kindest person I had ever met.

Whenever we Christians stand up for ourselves at Shimabara, you always come to slaughter us mercilessly!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>If I am insane, then you and your family are hateful, cruel, and inhuman!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...So I will show you no mercy. Even if this place is cut off from history...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Even if this is no more than a parallel world...I shall show you exactly the mercy you showed us: none!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>I shall kill every last one of you!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, hahahahahaha! HAHAHAHAHAAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>(His fury is staggering! He mentioned Shimabara...Who is this man? )</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I bet even God in heaven heard that laugh,Lord Sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>So what is the next step in your plan? You have taken over this castle and kidnapped the princess. I&#39;m guessing that brings us near to its conclusion.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Indeed.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You must grow tired of carrying that sword on your back for nothing. Rejoice! Your time has finally come.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Shinmen Musashi has come to the castle. You will kill her.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>From the moment I met you in the mountains of Shimousa, I could tell that that is the sole reason you exist.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>She may wield the Myoujingiri Muramasa, but she is still merely human. She has not yet reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...But you have, nameless man.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Though I burn with loathing for this world and everything in it, I still have some respect for your skill.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>There is no demonic sword in the entire human realm that surpasses yours. And so, with you at my side, I have nothing to fear from Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...I hope it works out that way. I do want to pay you back for your hospitality.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>But I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;ll get a turn. Lord Empireo is here too, and his swordsmanship is truly terrifying.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Once he draws his sword, his opponent&#39;s soul isn&#39;t long for this world, whoever they might be.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...But then again, you never know. The only thing you can ever be certain of is that nothing is ever certain.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Indeed. Nothing is certain except the destruction of this world, thanks to my Onriedo Castle!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hahaha, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Perish, perish, perish! HEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>This is the Chaldea Command Room! Do you read me? Do you read\u2013Senpai...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Thank goodness I finally got through! Da Vinci! Our connection to Master has been reestablished!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Good, good. I&#39;m glad to see my peerless genius has come through once again. This makes all the late nights I spent working on this problem worth it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>But I guess now&#39;s not the time for chitchat. Good job hanging in there, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Let me fill you in on everything we know. First of all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>After you fell into a coma, something intervened in the dream you were having and brought your consciousness somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We already had data on hand from the time you fell asleep like this for seven days, so we surmised what had happened fairly quickly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>But even though we knew what was happening, nothing we tried could reach you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>For some reason, the only thing that eventually worked was Rayshifting Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Although, I&#39;m guessing from the looks on your faces that you have a good idea why that worked?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...It must have been because Katou Danzo,someone I was very close to, was here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m the only one who was able to Rayshift here because she existed in this world.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I believe the spell I brought with me finally activated when I temporarily absorbed her magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Ah yes, the special spell I prepared to reboot the comms on the Mystic Code Fujimaru always carries with [\u2642 him /\u2640 her].</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Phew. It was rough going not being able to get in touch with you, but at least we got through now!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it will last very long,since it looks like you&#39;re outside proper history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>For that part, uh...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d like to keep telling you what&#39;s going on myself, but Holmes has been insisting that he have a turn. Go ahead, great detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Pardon. My apologies for the intrusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m quite impressed that you&#39;ve managed to restore both Fuuma Kotarou&#39;s magical energy and your own magical circuits, Master.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I had deduced that the trouble with our communications most likely lay with you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>To begin, your mind was able to attain something similar to a physical body after being transported in a manner not unlike a Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>However, that body is very much a temporary construct. Your real one is still asleep here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Therefore, as long as your new body was able to adjust to that world, there shouldn&#39;t have been any issue...but had it not, it is entirely possible that your magical circuits wouldn&#39;t function properly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>After all, the comms device you always use is as much a kind of Mystic Code as it is a machine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Which means, if the magical circuits within your body were unable to acquire energy, your comms device would fail to function as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come to think of it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When I first got here, I couldn&#39;t summon anyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>As I suspected. Then either you adjusted to this world at some point...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>...or perhaps, someone helped you to adjust through some special means?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Helping me adjust...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Some special means...</p><hr><p><strong>Berserker of Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell:</strong></p><p>Believe it or not...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, is that why Shuten-Douji did that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did she know what was going on...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You think that Shuten-Douji&#39;s Spirit Origin...may have shared memories with the version of her in Chaldea...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I suppose it&#39;s not impossible, but it&#39;s still just that, a possibility. Besides, apart from that, she didn&#39;t seem to be linked to the Shuten-Douji we know in any way.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...But does that mean it was just a coincidence that she did what she did to Master&#39;s body? The chances seem vanishingly slim. Then again\u2013</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but remember, the karma implanted by the Curse of Annihilation destroys its vessels&#39; pride and honor...along with everything else.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In which case, it shouldn&#39;t be much of a mystery.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Come to think of it, she did say this world was hell anyway.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Hell, hm. Fascinating. That would mean you have indeed found yourself in a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru has wandered into the rift between dreams and reality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>That is, I believe, the most likely explanation for our current predicament.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>A rift?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Correct. Ms. Da Vinci gave a brief rundown before,but to be more precise...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>The medical data from the last incident and [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru&#39;s condition during that nightmare [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] saw...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>...matched the data for [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] current condition very closely. Whether [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] remembers it or not, everything was carefully recorded in Chaldea&#39;s library.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>The medical team who monitored [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru during the last incident did an excellent job.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>At any rate, given the overlap between the two data sets, the answer is clear. Once again\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My dream got connected to somewhere else.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Precisely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>This place where you now find yourself is neither a prior point in history, nor a Singularity that threatens humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>It is either a closed-off subspace not unlike a Reality Marble, a separate timeline, or an alternate world. Whichever it is, it has no effect on humanity at large.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>It is a special world does indeed exist, but is part of your dream at the same time. In other words\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>In other words...that&#39;s the rift between dreams and reality?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Correct.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>And it is here that the woman peeking out from behind you becomes very important, Ms. Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, uh, hi, I&#39;m Musashi. Nice to meet you. I wasn&#39;t hiding or anything, this is just a little strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Oh, nice to meet you! I&#39;m so sorry I didn&#39;t introduce myself before. I&#39;m\u2013</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Is this really the time for that nonsense? Our world is on the brink of disaster, you know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>O-oh, right. Sorry about that, Grandpa...I guess the other introductions will have to wait. Sorry about that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>N-not at all. I&#39;m the one who should be apologizing!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I have to say though, awful handy to talk to someone over a distance. I can only imagine what things would&#39;ve been like in the age of war if we could&#39;ve done this back then.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey! Weren&#39;t you the one who was just telling us to knock off the small talk!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re all in good spirits. Now, let us proceed. Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Given what Ms. Kyrielight has told me about her, I have devised a hypothesis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>She is a traveler. A world-crosser. A one of a kind being best described as a mobile Singularity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>And currently she is with [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>And so...nothing more need be said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh...mind saying it anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Holmes, that explained nothing at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>...I try not to make a habit of overexplaining things, as I generally find doing so to be rather lacking in tact, but very well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I described Ms. Musashi as a mobile Singularity precisely because of the many connotations such a term implies.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>While one of those connotations is certainly that anything and everything becomes possible, there is more to it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Despite her unusual nature, she alone would not cause this sort of inter-dream phenomenon to occur.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>For example, the prior seven-day incident would never have arisen had the King of Mages not served as both an external and internal trigger.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>In other words...there is another factor at work here besides Ms. Miyamoto.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Go on, give it some thought. I imagine you must have some idea of who that could be.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>...You really do love to treat your theories like truth, don&#39;t you, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, this is not how I would prefer to go about it either. But, circumstances being what they are,I felt I had no choice.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Hmm. Who else could it be...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t bother wracking your brains when you don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grandpa...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>For example...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Say there were multiple mobile Singularities in the same world. Such a phenomenon would certainly be unprecedented.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>It could result in any number of abnormalities or other unusual phenomena. Thinking about it in those terms, is there no one who comes to mind?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Multiple mobile something or other...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>In other words...there could be someone else here besides Lady Musashi who moves between worlds?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, now I get\u2013Wait, there&#39;s someone else like me here!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Aha. Now it all makes sense. When you put it that way, the answer&#39;s easy.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s only so many people here who don&#39;t belong. Servants. Fujimaru. And...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The sorcerer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters&#39; master!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;ve arrived at the same conclusion that I did.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>True, that does line up with everything we&#39;ve seen so far. Even before Onriedo Castle showed up...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...monsters began appearing throughout Shimousa at the same time that the sorcerer and the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters were first seen.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Furthermore, the Swordmasters always had monsters accompanying them...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...and many more appeared in the castle town right when Onriedo Castle showed up.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I had thought that was just a natural phenomenon...So that sorcerer was actually summoning them here all along!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Do these monsters act in ways that further this sorcerer&#39;s interests?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think so. They definitely obey the Swordmasters&#39; commands.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Then we can safely assume that this person is the source of every abnormality occurring in that world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>...Presumably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not totally sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>In my original hypothesis, I surmised that Ms. Musashi should be able to control these monsters in the same way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>But that does not appear to be the case. Therefore, I expect the difference is most likely a matter of output.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>This sorcerer most likely has a stronger mobile Singularity temperament than Ms. Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So...you mean he&#39;s the same as me,but a more experienced traveler?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Precisely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I must admit that I dislike piling hypotheses one atop another like this...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I would prefer to keep my silence, given the number of lingering doubts I still have.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Nonetheless, as we discussed earlier, this situation simply does not allow for such luxuries.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>It would be one thing if Professor had a hand in this, but to think I would have to explain a case where my deductions were still incomplete...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I, uh...Well, I don\u2019t know what to say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for helping us, Holmes!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Ah yes, just to be clear, the things I have told you here are NOT the full extent of my thoughts on this matter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I have chosen to withhold some facts and estimates for the time being, so as not to unduly color your preconceptions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>I trust you can understand that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>...We geniuses can be a real pain in the ass, can&#39;t we...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>...So, let me make sure I&#39;ve got this straight.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Once this Onriedo Castle place fully activates, it might pose a threat to our world as well?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>And right now, you&#39;re inside the castle,trying to find and stop the mastermind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Hmm. That does sound dire and all, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Could something that happens in a dream really have an effect on our own world?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>If it did, it would be an unprecedented threat that we&#39;ve never experienced before...Oh well, never mind that now!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s get serious and go over what you need to know as concisely as possible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We have your coordinates now and we&#39;ve verified your existence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We&#39;ll also move ahead with preparations to bring Kotarou back along with you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, our connection is still unstable, so I&#39;m not sure when we&#39;ll next have audio and visual...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>...but don&#39;t worry. Now that we have a lock on your coordinates, we won&#39;t lose sight of you. I promise.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>Nevertheless...the dream world you find yourself in right now is still quite real.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong></p><p>If you die there, you will die here as well. So make absolutely sure you return to Chaldea alive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Ugh, Holmes, in all your investigations did you never find even a little bit of tact?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Even I know better than to be as blunt as that,and this is ME we&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>And Mash, if you have something to say,why don&#39;t you say it instead of muttering to yourself?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I-I wasn&#39;t muttering. I was just thinking that if we ended the call before I got a chance to talk to Senpai, I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;d miss [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], is all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be back soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be back as soon as we save Shimousa.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Thank you, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll be waiting for you here, so please...make sure you come back to Chaldea safely!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>We made it to the keep! Now we just have to get to the top as fast as possible!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Boy, I haven&#39;t climbed a keep like this in forever! Fujimaru, do you know about the castle in Himeji?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve been inside a number of castles before,but the only other keep I&#39;ve climbed is Himeji&#39;s.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Himeji Castle is pretty famous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don\u2019t think there are many its size left!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You mean the tale of Osakabehime? I do remember a character thought to be Miyamoto Musashi appearing in it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s the one. It was a huge and beautiful castle. I think it was almost as big as this one...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Although, that&#39;s strange. It just doesn&#39;t make sense that Toke Castle would be this big, especially during the Tokugawa reign.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That Holmes guy said this was a separate timeline,I think? I guess that explains it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what it is. Let&#39;s just hurry to the top and kill this sorcerer person.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I want to get back to Onui and Tasuke, after all. I know we can trust that woman, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...with all these monsters around everywhere you look,I can&#39;t help but worry about them.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Hm? Hang on. If we stop this sorcerer,will that solve the monster problem too?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I believe so.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Then it&#39;s simple. We head up there and take him down. Though we still have to hurry, of course.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Agreed. This should be our final battle in Shimousa\u2013a place in the rift between dreams and reality.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Now, I&#39;m seeing signs of monsters ahead of us. Let&#39;s get through them quickly, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go through the middle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take them down and keep going!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>These things are still showing up!? Fujimaru, I&#39;m counting on you to watch my back again!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You monsters just can&#39;t stop glaring at us living folks, can you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what hardships you suffered when you were alive, but I think it&#39;s time you shuffled off for good!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I challenge you to a fair fight! No more howling in rage for you. I&#39;ll send you back to the afterlife myself!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...So far, so good. Although...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m surprised this floor doesn&#39;t look too different from the lower ones. I mean, we&#39;re almost at the top, right?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. This is the fourth floor,so the only one left is the fifth and final floor.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Since we haven&#39;t seen any sign of the sorcerer so far,it is safe to assume he is waiting up above.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Stairs, huh...I guess that goes for keeps too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it, Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something about these stairs bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I was just wondering how long it had been since I climbed a flight of stairs, and what world it might&#39;ve been.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...But I guess that doesn&#39;t matter now. Not when there&#39;s another evil aura close by.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>How about you, Fujimaru? Are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine. This is nothing.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m glad to see your special resistance still works here in Shimousa, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just a little trouble breathing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hey! Why didn&#39;t you say something sooner!? That can have a big effect on how we fight and how fast we can move!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, don&#39;t worry, Master is resistant to poison. I believe [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] when [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] says it&#39;s just a little trouble.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m guessing [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] didn&#39;t even realize anything was off until we got this far.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Oh yeah, I guess you&#39;re right. Sorry about that, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Make sure you catch your breath. We don&#39;t want to find ourselves stuck between high and low ground.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Stairs are best traversed in one fell swoop. Tell us when you&#39;re good to go, and we&#39;ll hurry on to the next floor.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>For a self-proclaimed old man, your legs sure are in good shape. On top of that, you&#39;re not even breathing hard.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s because I train myself properly. I don&#39;t know about other smiths, but I always forge while holding my breath. Really toughens up the lungs.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Is that so? Sounds a lot like swinging a sword. Oh, not that I know all there is to know about every other style of swordsmanship, of course.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? Kotarou?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kotarou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I...didn&#39;t know Danzo was your mother.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Oh, please don&#39;t worry about me. I was just thinking about the enemies we&#39;re facing.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>The last Heroic Spirit Swordmaster is the Saber of Empireo. Should we assume he&#39;s waiting for us here too?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I would. Can&#39;t imagine these people would be anywhere else. Otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t have run into that Caster.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>He was a true monster, the type to bide his time and enjoy watching his prey struggle until the last moment.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And he still came at us with a bunch of small fries in tow. So I&#39;m thinking this is the safest place here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d agree with that. Still, there&#39;s nothing he can do now that he&#39;s dead.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So I say we forget all about him, and move on to this keep&#39;s final\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Behind you!</p><hr><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Musashiii!!!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(He erased his presence so completely I had no idea he was right behind me...! )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(How can he still be alive!? )</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(It&#39;s just a matter of luck now. I need to turn around, draw my sword, and cut him down in a single slash, all in one motion! )</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>What...? What&#39;s...the meaning of...?</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Revolting.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>I can barely stand to look at you. This pretty facade you wrap yourself in is nothing more than an illusion to hide your true, ugly nature.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Begone, filth.</p><p><strong>Caster of Limbo:</strong></p><p>Urk...ghh...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You slew one of your own comrades?</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Comrade?</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>I have no need for such outside interference. I never once considered that thing a comrade.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>At any rate, you certainly took your time getting here.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>For a while, I was not sure you would even get here before the world ended, Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...How did Sa\u1E43gh\u0101ta Hell put it again? \u201CA soul who is truly gifted at cutting human bodies apart in the most cold and efficient way possible. \u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I presume you were the one she most had in mind, Saber of Empireo.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>Hmph, what an amusing description. Indeed, I do excel at cutting apart human bodies in an efficient way.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>The path I walk leads not towards the Buddha. I am but a single blade that can be swung effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>In other words...my sole purpose is killing.</p><p><strong>Saber of Empireo:</strong></p><p>My name is Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami Munenori. I am the final Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, Empireo: the one who looks down from the highest point of all the heavens.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You were supposed to protect Shimousa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Is this some sort of sick joke?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not surprised. I have no trouble believing you&#39;d be capable of something like this, old man Tajima.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s only one thing I don&#39;t get. Every Servant has a distinct aura to them. How did you hide yours?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Simple. I am human, through and through.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Though I may have been given the title of Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, and lead armies of monstrous creatures,I am the same person I always was: still the same Yagyu Tajima.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That explains it. A human wouldn&#39;t have a Spirit Origin that could go berserk...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But, how is that possible...? Not even Servants can withstand the transformation that comes from having the Curse&#39;s karma implanted in them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>There should be no way you can still be human. Unless, you&#39;ve already come back to life...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I have not.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I am not a spirit returned from the dead. I am me. I have the same body, the same life as I have always had.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I have merely ventured off the righteous path.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Heh. For that matter, collecting karma is trivial. I have gathered all 108 Buddhist defilements.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>And here I thought you might be worthy of respect after you cut down that Limbo guy. Turns out you&#39;re no better.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You can try to hide it with talismans or spells,but you still stink of blood and guts.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Yes, that is what happens when one spends time around monsters. Although you are the first to notice.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Indeed, the irony that I was praised for protecting the people of Shimousa when my true goal was exactly the opposite is not lost on me.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Nevertheless, the charade did wear;I am no actor.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Leading the procession of samurai to Toke Castle was an especially difficult challenge.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Heh. It seems I now have no choice but to create my mountain of bodies and river of blood here.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>It was all I could do to suppress my urge to draw my blade. But in the end, you made your way here none the wiser.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Shinmen Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Let me start by offering you my thanks.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>And not for humiliating myself by pretending to be an actor at my age.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>No, my thanks are entirely for you, Musashi. You helped me see who I really am.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Six months ago, our paths crossed by chance, followed by our blades.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>It was the briefest of moments...but in that short span, every bit of artifice I had built up was stripped away.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>In a flash, my loyalty to Lord Iemitsu, the life I had devoted to my family&#39;s Shinkageryu...all of it was gone.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>In other words, the man I once was had vanished...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...and all that remained was a single, monstrous swordsman.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I did this...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Then, if I hadn&#39;t taunted you into drawing your sword back then...you wouldn&#39;t have ended up this way?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Am I the one who pushed you into going mad?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I have done nothing of the sort. I was merely stripped of one layer of artifice.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I could not be more grateful. That is why I just showed you my own blade in return.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>You helped me see that my father passed on our outdated Shinkageryu to me precisely because I had never enjoyed studying the sword.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>This is why I was able to push it to evolve into the Yagyu Shinkageryu.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I was content with that. I believed that, in the end, the way of the sword is the way of killing, no matter how you dress it up.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>That there was no special meaning to be found in it...and thus, no value to be sought in life.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>But I was wrong. It was only at this age,after dueling you, that I realized the truth.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>The mystique of the duel. The feeling of life and death intertwining in a single moment. The time when your mind and your opponent&#39;s mind occupy the same space.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>And I realized...the way of the sword is actually quite fun.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>All of it existed to fight you, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>A sorcerer appeared in the darkness and told me a woman calling herself Musashi would arrive in this world again.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>In which case...I had no choice but to face you once again.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...I have been waiting for you, Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I may have been regarded as the strongest swordsman in Edo, but only in a time of peace...In the end, such a title is utterly meaningless.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>As Edo Yagyu, my Otomeryu can only be passed down to the ruling class.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I did not pay much mind to my life before...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>But now, Musashi, I am extremely interested in what comes next!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I was born again as a demon to answer a single question: Which of our swords is stronger!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s your reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you let all those other people die!?</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>It is.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Right. In the end, that&#39;s all it comes down to.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And yet...I think out of everyone here, I&#39;m the only one who can&#39;t blame old man Tajima for this. No matter how awful the things he&#39;s done may be.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lady Musashi...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course I&#39;m angry about it. I don&#39;t intend on showing him any mercy. That kind of evil wouldn&#39;t have flown even in the age of war.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I hate what he&#39;s done, too. Leading monsters to slaughter innocent people...trampling on others&#39; pride and beliefs, like with Lord Inshun...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And all to satisfy his own selfish desire? There&#39;s no excuse for that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, even so...I can&#39;t bring myself to blame him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...After all, I&#39;m a swordsman too. I&#39;ve also pushed myself to the very limit.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I too want to fight strong opponents, and push myself further by dueling with them! To someday reach a peak I can&#39;t achieve on my own!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even if I never attain ultimate mastery, I at least want to go out triumphant over the foes that are right in front of me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru. I know how messed up that is. And it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll let Tajima get away.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But...I can&#39;t help but understand how he feels. I&#39;m sorry. I just had to get that off my chest.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You must be pretty disappointed with me now, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d never be disappointed by you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Thanks, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just surprised is all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I see.... I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Indeed. I could not have understood before my rebirth, but now, I understand very well.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>You are exactly right. That is why I broke the taboo, and drew my blade.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>No matter how I may try to remain calm and unattached, my body cries out to battle you, right here and now.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Though I must say, I could not believe what I saw at first.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hm? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>I never thought you would face me with only one eye. It reminds me of Mitsuyoshi more than anything.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yagyu-Jubei Shichirou-Mitsuyoshi? ...I guess I can see that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m sorry to spring this on all of you so suddenly, but...would you guys go on without me?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I have to face this old man, right here and now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even if the world is ending, and there is no end of people crying, suffering, and dying...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This duel to the death still comes first for me. When you live your life swinging a big knife and cutting down other people, your pride comes before anything else.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So go on...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Go!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...We&#39;re leaving, Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand how you feel,Lady Musashi, but...I wish you luck.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You too, Fujimaru. Go on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t leave you behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Huh...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You can&#39;t leave me behind?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Ahahaha. And here I thought I&#39;d proven a little more trustworthy by now.... No, you&#39;re right. He&#39;s strong. Exceptionally strong.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami&#39;s swordsmanship has reached a godlike level. He&#39;s seen things I don&#39;t even understand.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I almost certainly can&#39;t beat him on my own, especially since I&#39;ve only just gotten used to fighting with one eye. If I tried, I&#39;d be dead in an instant.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I really can&#39;t put anything past you, can I,Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll fight with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got your back.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t handle him on my own. But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here with me!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Come, Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You bet. Let&#39;s see if your fabled Yagyu Shinkageryu can stand up to my cross blades!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s it. We shall never get the chance to do battle again. How fortunate that fate has brought us together.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Come forth, my blood-soaked frontier! This mountain of bodies and river of blood shall serve as the stage for our battle, and consume the loser&#39;s soul upon their defeat!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Saber of Empireo is the Cursed Name of my blade! The True Name of my soul: Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami Munenori!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Show me your sword, Shinmen Musashi! Our final battle is upon us!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...It was useless. Any attempt in trying to read your next move was completely futile.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>The essence of my Niten Ichiryu lies in adapting to hundreds...thousands of possibilities. But if my opponent stays one step ahead of all of them, there is nothing it can do.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>To defeat your Suigetsu, I had to enter the realm of the gods myself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I had to find the one right answer that lay beyond every possibility.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...In other words, I had to slash through the unbreakable heavens themselves. I call it Kengou Battou: Ishana-Daitenshou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I am indebted to you, Tajima-no-Kami. Thanks to you, I awakened my ultimate technique.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Heh. Is this you showing mercy to your opponent?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Regretfully, it seems my skill was insufficient to reach you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Not at all. I couldn&#39;t have beaten you alone. Your swordsmanship was divine in the truest sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I doubt you&#39;ll end up going to paradise, but just in case you do...give Lord Inshun my regards.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>...Very well.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Ahh, I feel much better. Hehehe...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Cursed Mitsuyoshi. So this is how you felt whenever you swung your sword.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>No wonder you improved at such an incredible rate. How infuriating...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>You may not wish to hear this from me,but I&#39;m afraid I shall say it anyway.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami:</strong></p><p>Shinmen Musashi. Master of Chaldea. This was the most enjoyable duel...I have ever experienced...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I win, Saber of Empireo.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>The time is at hand. In a few minutes, Toke Castle will become a castle of Edo; a manifestation of the impure land, ready to curse all that the Tokugawa hold dear.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Even the Master of Chaldea that Lord Satan was so afraid of has turned out to be no threat at all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Now then. Are you ready to die, Kiyohime?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Hm? Who are you people?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What a great view. If the weather was nicer,I bet I could see all the way to Mt. Fuji from here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa, the princess is safe!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>A-are you two with Lady Musashi and[\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Yes, we are. Everything will be okay now, princess.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Why are you here, you cretins?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You mean you can&#39;t figure it out? We&#39;re here to take down the mastermind behind this whole mess.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>By the way, we&#39;ve never met before, have we?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Of course not.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s your name, mastermind? I like to know who I&#39;m going to kill before I get to killing them.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...I believe this man&#39;s name is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Huh?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Oho, so you know my face, Fuuma Kotarou. Then you must have seen Amakusa Shirou&#39;s Heroic Spirit in the correct history.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>No, on second thought, there&#39;s no sense asking.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>If my Heroic Spirit would stand with humanity,he and I are nothing alike!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>To think that he would meekly sidle into his spot in the Throne of Heroes instead of burning with fury after undergoing the hell that was Shimabara...What a joke.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...If you think that&#39;s funny, laugh all you like. You&#39;re far from the only Heroic Spirit who burns with fury.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Surely you know that from the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters you led. But then, I guess you could never understand.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now I see...So that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing here.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Er, I&#39;m sorry. What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I finally figured out why I was summoned to this version of Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s all your fault, Amakusa. You&#39;ve got so much baggage that you ended up becoming a world-crosser, or a mobile Singularity, or whatever they called it.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hmm...?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Now you pose a threat to the entire world. So either the world itself, or the Counter Force, or...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Ugh, this is such a pain! I still don&#39;t really get it myself!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>For one thing, I thought the Counter Force, or a Heroic Spirit chosen as a Guardian or whatever, wasn&#39;t supposed to have a personality, unlike a Servant.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know much about alternate timelines, or parallel worlds, so I&#39;ll leave that stuff for later.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Amakusa, I&#39;m here to cut you down.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>So, at last you realize your role to play, Senji Muramasa! Hehehe, indeed, the Counter Force does reach this far, even though this world is not a Singularity!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>That is why you are the one the world chose to summon here.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>If you&#39;d remained at your hermitage, wasting your life in peace, I would have left you alone until this world ended.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>What a fool you are to come this far just to throw your life away!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>My body has long since surpassed the limits of humanity. It is now the equal of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters! If you think that pathetic little knife you&#39;ve got there can cut me down, Muramasa, you are sorely mistaken!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I already knew you were no longer human. But I don&#39;t care whether you&#39;re alive or undead.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The only thing you&#39;ve got inside you now is suffering and anger. You&#39;re just a vengeful ghost in human form.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You threaten the whole world just by being here. You give that Caster a good run for his money.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Onui and Tasuke are going to grow up in this world. It&#39;s not yours to play around with!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, hahahahahahahaha! Oh, but I will play with it. And I will destroy every Tokugawa in every world in existence!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>The Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon! Proper humanity! The correct human history! Once I have destroyed this world, I will swallow them up, and the rest of your worlds too!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Satan calls to me...He guides me!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>No more talk!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>It is no use.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Looks that way!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>It is no use. None whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hmm, now what&#39;s going on here? I&#39;m disappointed in you, Senji Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Since the Counter Force summoned you, I would have thought you had the means to defeat me.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>But it seems I overestimated you! Wonderful! Now I truly have nothing to fear!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You two second-rate Heroic Spirits are all that stand in my way. Be honored, for I shall bury you my\u2013What!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I believe you meant two first-rate Heroic Spirits,one first-class Master, and one certified swordsman!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So you&#39;re the sorcerer I&#39;ve heard so much about! It&#39;s about time we met face-to-face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry to have kept you waiting, guys!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> is on the scene!</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...I see. So Empireo has fallen.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>That fool. He would never have lost if he had truly embraced Lucifer, the great Satan himself, and devoted himself fully to serving him.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>I suppose there is only so far a man of Edo can go. In the end, he was nothing more than a philistine not even fit to join the rest of the rabble.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Philistine? You think a man with swordsmanship like his was a philistine?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So that&#39;s how you really feel, huh? I guess a snake who crawls in the gutters can never understand how it feels for a bird to soar.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even though he chose to side with stagnation, he never let it sully him, or lost what was truly precious.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even though he chose to become an evil oni, his pride for his swordsmanship never wavered. Calling him a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster says far more about you than it does about him.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He was a TRUE master of the sword. He achieved a level that even surpassed my father!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So shut your mouth, you damned ghost! You can&#39;t even hope to understand how great Lord Yagyu was!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If you truly hated this world, you would just be killing people instead of transforming them into monsters!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s not an act of anger. It&#39;s envy! You have no right to speak of things like that anywhere, let alone in a keep built for governing people!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hmph. You certainly do yap a lot for someone who disgraced himself at Shimabara. But then, I suppose that was a different Musashi.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Shinmen Musashi. I see you are every bit the swordsman I heard you were.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Most who dedicate themselves to the sword are fools who cast aside everything else to master it. But not you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>No ordinary stick-waving swordsman could speak of heaven and earth. Only one who has achieved everything can speak a single ultimate truth.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You have learned much over your quest to master every martial art and deadly sword stroke.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Heh...You may be my enemy, but I commend you nonetheless. How truly admirable.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Why are you smiling about that? Don&#39;t tell me you actually pity me?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>I do. You could never have faced me if you were aware of what you have done.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You called me a ghost, Musashi? I could say exactly the same of you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>I have indeed crossed between many worlds seeking my revenge, and lost my humanity even as I remained human.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>But the same is true of you. I do not know why you began traveling across worlds, nor do I care.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>The fact remains that you have lost your humanity as well. You are nothing more than a monster who no longer has the right to call herself human.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Surely, even you must have realized that no one truly has need of you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Of course not. You are merely a drifter. An unwanted outsider in every world you visit.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>I can see from your expression that you hope to return to your own world someday, but that will never happen.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>But not because you lost sight of your way home, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, those like us who fall into another world are sent back to our own through each world&#39;s innate restorative power.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>But in your case, you simply fell into yet another world. That can only mean one thing.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You did not lose sight of the way home. Your world as you knew it is gone.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>You have no home there; no one who remembers you. Your very existence has been erased.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>That is your true identity, Shinmen Musashi. Like me, you are a ghost reviled by the world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thank you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Musashi...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I see. Well, that&#39;s okay. I had a feeling that was the case.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now that you mention it, I guess you and I ARE like two peas in a pod.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re right, it is strange. You can&#39;t travel across worlds and still call yourself human.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>What are you saying, Lady Musashi...!? That&#39;s not true. That&#39;s not true at all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re the one who said all that matters is who you choose to be! That&#39;s still true whether or not you have a home to return to!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You bet it is! That&#39;s why this isn&#39;t bothering me! Doesn&#39;t matter one damn bit to me!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Doesn&#39;t matter, you say?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Nope. You may have gone around crossing worlds out of hate, but I do it out of a desire to be free.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I do still look for a way back home, but it&#39;s not that important. I can stop whenever I want.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, I guess I&#39;d be lying if I said it didn&#39;t really hurt to hear my way back is gone, but that doesn&#39;t matter now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even if the world does see us the same way, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m about to let you get away with this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Sorry to go on for so long,Lord Muramasa! Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m always in good spirits! So let&#39;s just focus on giving this guy what&#39;s coming to him!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>All the world crossing you&#39;ve done, and the best you can do is an act of evil built upon your grudge and resentment! There&#39;s not a trace of honor in that!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is going to be our last grand battle! I WILL cut you down and stop you! Lord Kotarou, Lord Muramasa, and...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Fujimaru, my trusted partner from a far-off world!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This is the last swordmaster duel we&#39;ll have to fight! Would you do the honors!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let this final swordmaster duel...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...begin!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Ghh...! You foolish little girl. Can you not see that this is meaningless!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Very well. No more games.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily I would not use this spell on the likes of you, but you have pushed my patience to its limits.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...You said my plan is an act of envy? Of resentment?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Let me show you firsthand what sort of hell gave birth to that resentment!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa! Lady Musashi! [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru! Get back!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Too slow. Too slow by half, you scoundrels! Far too slow for a would-be Guardian or an assassin!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Now you shall experience my anguish for yourselves! Reality Marble: The Hell of Shimabara!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What is this place!?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What is this...?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s so dim I can barely see anything...Everywhere I look it&#39;s nothing but haze and fire...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>This must be a Reality Marble...an enclosed space the sorcerer created himself!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I can&#39;t see any of you, but I can sense your presence! Please, stay where you are!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>This air is highly poisonous. If you aren&#39;t careful,a mere breath could burn your lungs to ash!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Dammit. There&#39;s nothing here for me to cut...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Lady Kannon&#39;s protection won&#39;t help me here. This world is completely closed off. Or rather...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...this is that sorcerer&#39;s original world...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I may have lost mine, but he must have engraved his world in his soul this whole time...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...So that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing a picture scroll of the hell that was Shimabara, eh. I thought this looked familiar.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>So this was your own hell on earth. Shimabara...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Indeed! I trust you can hear me, Senji Muramasa!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>This domain is the very heart of my fury! It does not suffer any living person to survive...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s more, my Reality Marble has no exit! It is naught but wave upon wave of hellish suffering and resentment!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Now dash yourselves upon its shores like so much foam! Apologize to those of us who suffered here before you break upon its waves!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Rejoice, and hear the gospel that has appeared before my eyes! Onriedo Castle is now fully powered and ready to receive its sacrifice!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Ahh, I can see the sky melting down. It is greater than I could ever have imagined!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Beautiful. So this is the end of the world...the gift Lord Satan has bestowed upon me!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, I have waited so long for this moment! At last, my endless wandering has been rewarded!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>It is a miracle that this scenery has finally spread to reality! No one can stop this now! No one!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...So your castle&#39;s pretty much done, huh. You should&#39;ve kept that to yourself, sorcerer.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Grandpa...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Muramasa...?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t have any idea where any of you are, so just keep your traps shut for a moment. At long last...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...it&#39;s time to do what I was brought here to do in the first place.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You think there&#39;s nothing any of us can do to stop this now? You&#39;re a fool. Of course there is.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Though I am not Jubei, the invincible swordmaster. Though I am not Hanzo, the great spymaster.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Though I am not Abe-no-Seimei, like your so-called Caster. Though I am nothing more than a swordsmith, why was it I that was summoned?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>You could never figure it out, and so you have lost.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I once sought to forge the ultimate blade. Not one that cuts through flesh, bone, or the living.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I sought a blade that terminates enmity...A blade that severs bonds, severs certainty, severs karma.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>That is to say, to be free of one&#39;s fate.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Uncountable years of toil to reach this place. Forging thousands of swords to create a barrow of blades.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Many paths, converge here. Enduring desires, flow here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Unjust deaths, gather here. My whole life has been for this single swing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>The heart of the blade is here! Accept this blow from my Tsumukari Muramasa!!!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Tsumu...kari...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>The sword that emerged from the tail of Yamata-no-Orochi...in the ancient Age of Gods...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Now I see. Mochizuki Chiyome...Shuten-Douji...! Haha. Ha, ha, hahahahaHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>So my Jesuit sorcery was always fated to end this way...Khh...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>But, how? How did your sword reach me from within my Reality Marble?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Because your Onriedo Castle shares part of its name with Edo Castle.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Haven&#39;t you heard? The demon blade Muramasa is said to be the Tokugawa&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>In the end, your own plot doomed itself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>If you hadn&#39;t rhymed your own castle&#39;s name with theirs, you might&#39;ve succeeded.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...Ha. Haha, hahaha\u2013</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>...What is this? How could a mere metal blade...pierce my heart...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a kunai. A souvenir from Para\xEDso. You&#39;re going to disappear, along with all the hate and suffering of everyone you turned into a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...You may look like the Amakusa Shirou Tokisada I know, but you are twisted beyond recognition.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s time for you to die,and apologize to everyone you wronged.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Arr...ghh...I cannot believe I die...that my great work ends...at the hands of a little ninja boy...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong></p><p>Arrrggghhh!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>RETRIBUTION!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...So the whole place is on fire now, huh. I guess the castle started to fall apart after it died.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Where are Fujimaru and Musashi? ...They must be on the other side of the keep.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>They&#39;ll just have to escape on their own, then. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll manage with Musashi around.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Kotarou, get the princess and jump clear of the castle, down to street level.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>She&#39;ll breathe in too much smoke if you take the stairs. Maybe you can handle it, but a human sure can&#39;t. Hurry!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Right away. Come on, Lord Muramasa, you need to hurry too!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I know.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I guess this wraps everything up. Hopefully the others manage to get away...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>Well, looks like my time has come.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Lord Muramasa, that light...Don&#39;t tell me your ether is collapsing!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I used the Tsumukari in a body that isn&#39;t divine. &#39;Course I&#39;m gonna fall apart.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>But I did what I was put here to do. There shouldn&#39;t be a problem with me checking out a little early, right?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>...Can&#39;t say I&#39;m going out with no regrets, though.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>I swear, those kids were a handful. Making katana is no different from raising kids.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong></p><p>What an idiot I was, reaching a divine level of swordsmithing back when I was still alive...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yeowch, it&#39;s so hot! WHY IS THE CASTLE ON FIRE!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...The evil aura is gone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Muramasa and Kotarou must have won...!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Whoa, really? Hey, you&#39;re right, the air&#39;s normal again! Well, except for all the heat!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hah! Should&#39;ve expected Lord Muramasa&#39;d swoop in at the last minute and take all the glory!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;dve liked to be the one to finish the sorcerer off myself, but the important thing is that he&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now, we&#39;d better get out of here, on the double!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why&#39;d everything have to be on fire!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry back to the ground!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I bet the sorcerer must&#39;ve known the jig was up and decided to go out with a bang or something.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, we need to hurry. Come on, let&#39;s...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Is there someone on the other side of the fire?</p><hr><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>My apologies, but you cannot use these stairs. Not as long as I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You...</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I could have taken that [\u2642 boy&#39;s /\u2640 girl&#39;s] head clean off just now, but I chose not to.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>The Lord Sorcerer only asked me to kill Shinmen Musashi. He said nothing about that [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl].</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Get out of here, Fujimaru. Don&#39;t worry about me. Just go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi...?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve met two exceptional swordsmen on the same day.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This samurai&#39;s skill is truly godly. He&#39;s at least several times stronger than me!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>On the other side of the burning flames...the lone swordsman flashed a breezy smile.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>You know what he looks like. You know his name.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This man pursued a single skill to utter perfection. A man who could cut a flying swallow several times in a single stroke.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The wielder of a fearsome ultimate technique. A man later generations are not certain ever even existed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His name is...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t know who you are or where you came from,but it looks like you&#39;ve got some business with me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You sure you want to do this now, amid this blaze? If we don&#39;t get out of here soon, we&#39;re both goners.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Indeed, I don&#39;t want to throw my life away. I am well aware of the situation. Once I have finished with you, I will quit this place and retire to safety.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Beautiful though you may be, I do not intend to perish with you here. Prepare yourself, Lady Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I can&#39;t change your mind about this? We don&#39;t have any reason to kill each other, do we?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>No, we don&#39;t. I do have a debt to repay the sorcerer, but at this point, I believe a simple offering will suffice.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>There is but one reason for us to fight: we two skilled swordsmen have come face-to-face.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...You&#39;re right. I take it back. We have all the reason in the world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...We may never have met before, but I know your name. It looks like my destiny has finally caught up with me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now, the only thing left to do is put everything I have into this fight. Thanks for waiting for me, Sasaki Kojirou.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>...I see. So that is my name.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Well then, permit me to formally introduce myself: I am the true Sasaki Kojirou. I am the only swordsman who can wield \u201CThe Laundry-Drying Pole. \u201D</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>My apologies. If it is Ganryu you desire,it is not to be so today.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s assume that the name comes later. That you are Kojirou is what matters.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Agreed. It matters not who you are,or whether you are male or female.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>As long as you fight with Niten Ichiryu,you are worth defeating.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>The path I have traveled has been a solitary one. As a swordsman, that has been my way of life.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I have drifted through the rift of history, like a phantom, focused solely on perfecting my Swallow Reversal.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>But now, you are here, Musashi. A beautiful flower, blooming before my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It does not matter where. It does not matter when.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The duel itself may be void of meaning or purpose. None of that matters to the two warriors.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That is what your intuition tells you. After all, once these two meet...!</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Once Musashi finally encounters Kojirou...there is only one possible outcome.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re right. I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself!</p><p><strong>Musashi &amp; Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>The time has come!</p><p><strong>Musashi &amp; Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Neither Heroic Spirits nor Swordmasters, we are but two creatures that live and die by the sword!</p><p><strong>Musashi &amp; Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>It is through this, through history&#39;s greatest duel, that we will prove who we are!</p><p><strong>Musashi &amp; Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>This shall be the ultimate duel!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...As their blades clashed, their power and technique seemed evenly matched.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No, not only that. Their skills had now surpassed everything\u2013time, space, existence, essence...Each was the other&#39;s perfect mirror image.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>One, the zero sword, attempting to surpass Munisai&#39;s peerless \u201Cone\u201D. The culmination of a life spent pursuing a single answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Faced with untold options, it carefully evaluates, crushes, and discards each of them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A finite skill that only arrives at a single correct answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A blade that shaves existence down to a single possibility, the ultimate extreme, remaining only as a \u201Csomething. \u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That is Musashi&#39;s zero; a sword designed to bring about an inescapable end, even against gods or the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The other, a sword that becomes one with endlessness. A path that accepts countless possibilities.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, given the limits of time and space,only a single slash can be made at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His sword accepts that, and at the same time creates many other answers: a sword of infinity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A strike that pushes its existence to the ultimate transparency, only to still have something to hold on to.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That is Kojirou&#39;s Swallow Reversal; a sword designed to create a future that not even gods nor the Buddha could evade.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The realm of the infinite. Or, alternatively, the realm of nothingness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Here, there is no time, no space,no fate, no good, and no evil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It is devoid of thought or feeling; a place that only those who have achieved true mastery with their blades can reach.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Or, alternatively, it is a dream; a vision of hell that all villains see before they die.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Musashi!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Kojirou!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Their swords cross but for a moment, yet in that moment, infinite possibilities play out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>How long will they stay here, alone, attempting to kill each other? Their duel seems as though it will continue forever, with no end in sight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This is not a world. It is neither a Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon, nor a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon. It is something beyond even the rift of reality and dreams.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An impossible domain, where infinity and zero clash endlessly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And yet. And yet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There is another one here...who observes them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>You.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>You bear witness to their duel. You will see how this miraculous, once in a lifetime battle ends.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In this clash between fighters,there can be only one victor.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So who will you watch? Who is the swordsman you will stand beside as they bask in their victory?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Who will it be...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Who is it you hold in your gaze?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Then it is decided! As you watch over them, in this instant, the zero sword shall defeat the infinite sword!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Hraaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Tell them. Though their encounter was like fate itself, tell them it is time to say goodbye.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s over. The winner: Shinmen Musashi Harunobu!</p><hr><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>...Ahh. What a wonderfully fulfilling time that was.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>I hope you feel the same,Shinmen Musashi Harunobu.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Now that I have finally experienced this,I think I will go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Or perhaps I will disappear into a rift that shall never see the light of day, and be done with it.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Although...The Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon, was it?</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>If there is someone in the Throne of Heroes, even just one man, who resembles me, I wish I could share this experience with him.</p><p><strong>Sasaki Kojirou:</strong></p><p>Farewell, Musashi. You were indeed the most heavenly flower I have ever known...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, open your eyes!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Nngh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, I must have lost consciousness.... So, I guess this means...that swordsman is gone?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t have to say anything. I know he&#39;s gone. If he was still alive, he&#39;d be here smiling as he watched me sleep.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So, that&#39;s what Sasaki Kojirou is like as a swordsman, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Looks like the flames are getting pretty close.... Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Thank you. You inspired me to try fighting for what was right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But...in the end, it looks like I&#39;m going to die by the sword. I guess...Yeah, that does sound like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Since when have you been one to just give up?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m sorry. I apologize...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s get out of here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Yeah. You&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what I was thinking, fighting a duel in a castle going up in flames. Now here I am, without the strength to run away. What a fool I am.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>You know...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Just this morning, when I was looking up at the sky...I decided I&#39;d accept whatever happened to me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I thought, if it helped me reach the void...zero...I would try doing something I usually don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Even if I embarrassed myself, and people pointed and laughed at me...I&#39;d give it my all, and see where it led.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Of course...I didn&#39;t think everything would go this perfectly overnight...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...or that someone would be here with me through it all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I never thought things would turn out like this. I guess you&#39;ve been watching over me right to the end now, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...this is the least I can do to pay you back.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Yah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-wha...!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did she just fling me out of the castle...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Farewell! ...Thank you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>...! [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru! Wh-why did you jump off of the keep!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Thank goodness I just barely caught you.

I&#39;m sure...Kotarou...or Grandpa Muramasa...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...will catch you...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>(Sigh) I guess this is the end of my journey.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I reached zero. I finally managed to achieve what I&#39;ve been working for all my life.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And since I&#39;ve found it...that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Now that I&#39;ve reached the zero state, there&#39;s nothing left for me to do. Besides, my own world is long gone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>This has all been a wonderful, yet fragile dream.... I have no regrets.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well...maybe I don&#39;t love that I&#39;m going to go out watching a fire...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I guess I&#39;m even greedier than I thought...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>If I had my choice...I&#39;d want the last thing I ever see...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...to be the big, beautiful, blue sky.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...It sounds like a hawk is crying somewhere in the distance.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Distinguished elder.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Surely it is too soon for you to coop yourself up here in Reigandou. I can see you are fairly withered, but you cannot be older than sixty at most.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...Seems my destiny has finally arrived. You&#39;re late.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I am very sorry. But I am glad to see I am not too late.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re well past \u201Ctoo late. \u201D I can feel death reaching out for me even now. It&#39;s reached the point where I&#39;m thinking about my mother.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Thinking back on your mother? Haha, you are a deal more softhearted than I had thought, Lord Shinmen Musashi.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>You watch your mouth.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>At any rate, it&#39;s good of you to finally come. I&#39;ve been awaiting you for so long. I never thought you would be the one to keep me waiting.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid I cannot rid myself of my regrets. Look. These hands of mine can no longer hold two swords.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me...!</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>There is nothing to forgive. Please hold your head high, distinguished elder.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I must say, you have chosen a wonderful hermitage. It&#39;s completely cut off from all the outside world&#39;s din.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Were I to live a long life and grow old in peace, I believe I would choose just such a place as this little shrine for my last days. It is so quiet and peaceful.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>There&#39;s no hustle and bustle of the town to be heard. Only the slow passage of time.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I see you have reached a state quite unlike the one I attained.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Haha. Hahaha...Of all the things I thought you might say, praising my final resting place certainly wasn&#39;t one of them. You are terrible at giving compliments.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Here, there is no time, no space,no fate, no good, and no evil.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Iori is all grown up. He&#39;s carrying on for Mikinosuke admirably. I think he was a chief retainer for the daimyo, last I heard...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>I am going to die. That is why I have been waiting for you, my destiny.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>I must say, though...I&#39;ve never seen such a handsome swordsman before.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>You look like a cool summer breeze made flesh and blood. Your swordsmanship must be beautiful to behold, my destiny.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Beautiful, you say?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You are my superior in the art of giving compliments by far. I am but a simple eccentric.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>All I ever did was hide away in the mountains and spend my days by swinging my sword. I may be an eccentric swordsman, but I am a far cry from a swordmaster like you.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>\u201CSwordmaster,\u201D eh. Is that what some people call me...?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Hmm, now that you mention it, I suppose I ran into a few of them myself at some point...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Still...hehe, \u201Cmaster\u201D is quite an exaggeration. I am nothing more than a washed-up old man.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>\u201CExaggeration\u201D? You are THE Shinmen Musashi. You will certainly leave behind more than enough legends to earn the title of master.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Miyamoto Musashi. Shinmen Musashi. There is not a swordsman alive who does not yearn to be you, and I have no doubt there will be many more to follow your footsteps.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You will become a legend. I am sure of that much, if nothing else.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...A legend, eh?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just an old man. I was wild and crazy in my youth,but in my old age, I tried to act a little wiser...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>But as you can see, in the end, I&#39;m still just a shriveled up old man dying all alone.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Still, I suppose there were one or two people who reached out to me.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>There was the old monk who never met a lecture he didn&#39;t like. Oh, and a young man and woman who followed me around sometimes.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>......</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Those people are why I&#39;m still alive today. No one can survive all on their own, after all.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Of course, by the time I realized that, I was already all alone...At any rate, that&#39;s all I had to say. Sorry to subject you to an old man&#39;s grumbling.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I believe you are slightly off the mark there, distinguished elder.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>As you said, you raised Miyamoto Iori to be a fine young man, and you are leaving behind the Niten Ichiryu as your legacy.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>You may be alone here in Reigandou now, but stories of your life will continue to spread well after your death.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Now that I have finally experienced this,I think I will go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>All I have is my body and my techniques. Once I die, they&#39;ll both be as dust in the wind.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...Stop that. Now YOU&#39;RE the one sounding like an old man. I don&#39;t want to see you looking so forlorn.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>You give yourself far too little credit. You are a refined swordsman. You are the embodiment of the wind, and are more than worthy of being called my rival.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Our duel was not to be in this life...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>But perhaps someday, in a different time and place...Ahh, if only this were hell.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Then I could devour oni flesh, stand...and take up my blades!</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Worry not. There is no need to mourn our unrealized duel.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>What...?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>I did duel Musashi, only moments ago. I saw for myself what Niten Ichiryu was capable of.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Oh, I must have lost consciousness.... So, I guess this means...that swordsman is gone?</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Shinmen Musashi did indeed appear before me, and reached zero. I assure you, that is the truth.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>I see.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>...Then I shall take your word for it. I see. So, Musashi did reach the void, and came to know zero.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>That is...good to hear, Sasaki Kojirou, my destiny.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Very...good to hear...indeed...</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong></p><p>Just what I needed...to put my soul at peace...</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Farewell, Musashi. Farewell, Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu.</p><p><strong>Longsword Swordsman:</strong></p><p>Farewell, my greatest rivals.

The kind of big blue sky I love is right there above me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There, I see it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s beautiful! So nice! Oh, wait, is it beautiful, or just nice?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whatever. It doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m feeling really good right now,so I&#39;m just going to go with beautiful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The sunlight, the breeze...It&#39;s all perfect! It makes me want to spill everything I&#39;ve been keeping to myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Like...Yeah...Like what happened when I first came here to Shimousa...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...when those creatures first showed up after I met Onui and Tasuke.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If I&#39;d been all alone...if Onui, Tasuke, and you hadn&#39;t been there...I probably would&#39;ve just run away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Heck, I might not even have stopped until I&#39;d reached Edo or Echigo.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s me! I&#39;m Miyamoto Musashi, a woman always wandering from place to place!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m nothing like the good guys in fairy tales who always do what&#39;s right.

That it isn&#39;t that big of a deal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But when I fought alongside you, I think...I was a swordsman who really fought for what&#39;s right. Someone who stood up to those with power, and helped those too weak to fight for themselves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I think it was your bravery that showed me the way.

Not to mention that in the end,I got to face off with my fated rival!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A one-on-one duel with an incredible samurai.

I finally encountered my destiny.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was here that I reached the void...and obtained my zero sword.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s more than I could ever have hoped for.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I only have two regrets. Yes, just two.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>First: I regret that I never got to eat lunch at Grandpa Muramasa&#39;s hermitage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Second: udon. Udon! In the end, I never got to try Shimousa&#39;s udon. Not even once.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But, those things aside...everything else was perfect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I made it to the end.

Um, yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>We will rebuild the castle later,after we&#39;ve taken care of the town.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>It may never be quite like it was before, but I still want to bring the Toke castle town back to a point where it can be considered a second Edo. Yes...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know if it will make a good offering to those who lost their lives, but I hope to do my best all the same!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s done, even if I have to open all my coffers to do it!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>...I WAS originally planning on returning to Edo myself.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>I know how to clean up after a fire,so I should be able to help out.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Of course, now that my establishment is ruined,I don&#39;t know where I can ply my trade. Aaah...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Then what about an emergency meal station!? This area managed to escape relatively unscathed...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...but it&#39;s a disaster zone near the castle. What do you say? I&#39;m sure the laborers and builders would be thrilled!</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Whaaat? I only just finished babysitting.</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t you think it would be better to ask someone with a little more muscle to help out with things like that...?</p><p><strong>Otama:</strong></p><p>Say, come to think of it, where is Musashi anyway?

We will never be able to set foot in this Shimousa again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>H-huh!

I know it this is all very sudden. But...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Think about it like this: from now on, you two can choose where you want to go for yourselves.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>If you like, you can stay here in town and ask the princess or Lady Otama for help whenever you need it. We&#39;ve already talked to them, and they agreed.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Or, you can go back to the hermitage. I have no doubt that Lord Muramasa left you a nice nest egg.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>For my part...I would recommend the former first. Connections are important, after all.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>I know you&#39;ll miss everyone...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>But I&#39;m sure Lord Muramasa wouldn&#39;t want to see you so dispirited like this. So please, hold your head high.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...Okay.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Grandpa always said he was going to go away someday. But...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I still miss him...I hope I can go to the lavatory by myself at night...</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Onui...</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>...But I&#39;ll deal with it. I have to.</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Because when I grow up,I want to be a samurai...just like Musashi!</p><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m gonna be big, and strong,and beautiful, just like her!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ATasuke:</strong></p><p>Ga ga ga goo\u266A</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>That sounds great, and Lord Tasuke certainly seems to approve.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong></p><p>Plus, Lord Muramasa did say that traveling like Lady Musashi wasn&#39;t a bad idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. He did.</p><hr><p><strong>Onui:</strong></p><p>Yup!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The blue sky spread out above me...I looked up at the burned-out remains of Toke Castle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Onriedo Castle collapsed, and now only the wreckage of the old Toke Castle remains.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Neither the castle walls with the creepy heartbeat, nor the pillars, were anywhere to be found. All the monster outbreaks were gone for good.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Work on the castle&#39;s reconstruction had already begun. In fact, this area had been filled with people coming and going just a few moments ago.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I helped out a little, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to stick around to the end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In Chaldea&#39;s last transmission, they said the Rayshift should start in less than an hour.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>So...this is the last time...I&#39;ll ever come here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I haven&#39;t heard anything about any victims being found in the wreckage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>There were no survivors, nor were there any casualties. Everyone who was in the castle after the abnormality broke out has been deemed missing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Along with everyone who went into the castle after it transformed...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...There was a breeze.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A light, gentle breeze that seemed to leave as quickly as it arrived.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>\u201C...! \u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Thinking I&#39;d just heard something, I turn around. I see something glinting off in the distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I desperately pore through the wreckage until all of a sudden, there it is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A katana tsuba. The blade guard.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No, wait...This is what she had on her when...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Mmm...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Mmm. Mmmmmm...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Mmmrrrghhh, curse you, curse you, curse yooouuu!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>They&#39;re dead. Dead. Dead...! Every blade I assembled here in Shimousa, all dead and gone!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>The Seven Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are finished! Shinmen Musashi and the Master of Chaldea finished us all off!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>After all those screaming, anguished souls! After five knights, one human, and one puppet gave their lives and killed countless others...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>The world remains unchanged!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Life&#39;s struggle, its thirst...It&#39;s so bright I can barely stand it! ...Heh. Hehe. Hehehe...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...(Heavy sigh). So this is what a fate worse than death feels like.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Curse you. I won&#39;t be satisfied with just my entrails on a plate. I shall burn off all traces of reason, and rob myself of my sanity.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Curse you...Who could laugh off an overwhelming loss like that!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...No. Wait.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Hehe, hehe, hehehehe HEHEHEHEHE! Well done on your victory, humanity!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His figure was that of a carnivorous beast. His voice like the ghost of an evil king.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But, the Caster of Limbo was supposed to be dead...Wrong. Wrong!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Such a creature could never be the hollow vessel of a Spirit Origin, one of the seven knights destined to save the world!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No, this creature has consumed gods. Its purpose is to tear gods asunder, to make their flesh his own.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He has taken in the dark god as his own personal sun, and transformed the wicked god into his own magical energy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An Ego that sprung forth driven by a powerful being,this demon&#39;s core brims with evil and malice!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Indeed, his True Name is not Abe-no-Seimei at all. It is Ashiya Douman!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A monk turned onmyouji said to be Abe-no-Seimei&#39;s greatest enemy who tried to overthrow the city government together with Fujiwara-no-Akimitsu!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>An unabashed flower of evil! A voracious, carnivorous beast!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Ahh, people. Poor, scared people, who have continually fended off dreadful things. You must not drop your guard.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Fear the curtain of night. Tremble before the dark sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...The world is laden with the roots of evil.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>Ahh, I am truly mortified. But...</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>I may have failed to materialize in Chaldea,but I believe I left behind some good sample data.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>And above all, I finally, finally found lost history: a Missing Belt!</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>...This Shimousa was always twisted.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>A Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon...A destroyed world in an alternate timeline that managed to survive...?</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>...No, that is not right. A parallel world? Close, but not quite.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>This is something else. This Shimousa is part of human history, without being part of human history.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>It is another world observed by the god of a distant star...a world resembling a Singularity, yet not one!</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>What do you think, Lord Satan!? Don&#39;t you find this fascinating!?</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>Hehehe, hahahahahaha, no, no! That was only supposed to be a temporary name, but it was just so ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>I mean, Satan, of all things! Haha. It was only supposed to be a joke.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>But then, the Lord Sorcerer seemed to take quite a liking to it. Nevertheless, I admit, I took the joke too far.</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>Please accept my heartfelt apology, my beloved...</p><p><strong>Ashiya Douman:</strong></p><p>...Lord <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light">.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No one must hear that name. So, for the moment, I will not permit these terrible sounds reach anyone&#39;s ears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>For that name...That name is a great curse upon the entire world.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Welcome back, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re safe and sound. You must be exhausted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to be back, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It feels like it&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve been here.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s good to have you back too, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Kotarou got here ahead of you, and he filled us in on all the details we couldn&#39;t discuss during our transmission.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Now we know that, even though you&#39;ve been asleep this whole time...you were still fighting to help others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>And...to help us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Thank you, Senpai. I can&#39;t wait to hear all about your adventures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Chaldea&#39;s library probably doesn&#39;t have any record of those events, but I&#39;ll be sure to make one myself!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We still don&#39;t know the real identity of this \u201CSatan\u201D the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters mentioned, whether it was actually Satan or something else entirely...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>...and above all, the things you experienced in your dreamland adventure are very valuable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Even a normal Rayshift is a great feat in and of itself, but projecting your consciousness into a pseudo-body through a dream...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>And then encountering a world-crosser on top of that? It was one mindblower after another.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m going to thoroughly debrief you later,so make sure you&#39;re ready for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>...But first, you should go get plenty of rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Your body may have technically been asleep,but your mind was fully active the entire time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>So please, take your time and rest up. There&#39;s no rush...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ll do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I AM kind of tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s all the fuss about in here? ...Oh! You finally woke up!?</p><p><strong>Raikou:</strong></p><p>My, that&#39;s wonderful to hear. But, Master, I&#39;m a little worried...Don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve slept a bit too much?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>Didn&#39;t you hear? Master up and wandered off somewhere while [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] was dreaming.</p><p><strong>Raikou:</strong></p><p>Oh my, it seems there&#39;s an irritating little fly buzzing around in here. How dreadfully unpleasant.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>...I heard Master finally woke up! Hey, move aside! Don&#39;t you know better than to stand around blocking doorways!?</p><p><strong>Raikou:</strong></p><p>Oh, my apologies. I simply didn&#39;t notice. Teehee.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m just poking my head in, since my tails are too big to fit. Oh hey, you&#39;re finally awake, Master?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not quite sure what&#39;s going on, but welcome back all the same, Anchin! I have really been looking forward to hear what you&#39;ve been up to!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong></p><p>I think we&#39;d all like to hear that. Oooh, I know, since we&#39;re all here, why don&#39;t we throw a little banquet to welcome Master back?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong></p><p>Lots of alcohol...Stuff happens and you can&#39;t take it back...Yes, that sounds like a great idea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>I-I&#39;m sorry, everyone,but Senpai really needs [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] rest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s good to be back, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>I see you&#39;ve returned.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>I have nothing more to say. You fought a difficult battle in the rift, and came home to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see you made it back ahead of me.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hi, Mr. Missionary.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know who that is.</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>Didn&#39;t that girl tell you numerous times? You need rest.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong></p><p>...Oh, yes. Before you go to sleep, check your desk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Let&#39;s see...)</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...a Chaldea comms Mystic Code.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I wonder if someone forgot it. Or maybe Monte Cristo put it here on purpose.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My head is so foggy I can&#39;t think of who it could be. I&#39;m not sleepy at all, but my head still feels sluggish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>How exactly am I supposed to rest up, anyway? It feels like it would be weird to go back to sleep...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Just as I was thinking that,the Mystic Code sprang to life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It gave off a quiet beep, then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> M-Musashi!?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s wrong? You look like you&#39;ve just seen a ghost.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Just kidding. Sorry if that was in poor taste.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Lemme see...I think he called this a \u201Cvideo recording? \u201D Remember that missionary we met in Toke castle town?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, someone who looks just like him told me to record this before I left on my journey.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I, uh...Well, to put it bluntly, I died.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>At least, I thought I did. But the next time I woke up, there was this blue sky...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>And from there, I crossed over to some new worlds and kept going on my journey.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After several crossings, I arrived at Chaldea. Well, actually, just outside Chaldea. It was frrreeeeeezing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway, I ran into the missionary look-alike after that, and...here we are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;d tell you not to worry about me,but I guess that&#39;s kind of impossible, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Okay, remember that guy we talked to on your comms device thingy a while back? Holmes, the detective?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>He said I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit who materialized here thanks to a Chaldea summoning spell.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Basically, now that we&#39;ve made a connection, my Spirit Origin got added as a Heroic Spirit after I died...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>So he said it&#39;s no surprise I can be summoned at Chaldea now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Um...I think he also said that now that I&#39;m a Servant, I&#39;ve automatically forged a contract with you as my Master?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Oh, and he also said he found it strange...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...that a \u201Cwhat-if\u201D Heroic Spirit who ordinarily shouldn&#39;t exist could be summoned with a Chaldea summoning spell.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t really understand any of this very well myself, but...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I think...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m...probably not the same Musashi you fought alongside in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>I&#39;m more like a shadow of that Musashi. Sooo, I may not be the person you know...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But I&#39;m still me! You know, a woman who loves to travel wherever the wind takes her!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Anyway...I wish I could see you again.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But by the time you watch this,I most likely won&#39;t be in Chaldea anymore.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>After all, it&#39;s a whole new world here,and I want to explore.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Plus, I HAVE to try 21st century udon!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>But, I promise you this: if you ever need my help again...I&#39;ll move heaven and earth to find you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...Especially since it looks like we&#39;ve made a pretty strong bond now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>Well, anyway, there you have it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong></p><p>...See you again someday, Master!</p>', 14464);
