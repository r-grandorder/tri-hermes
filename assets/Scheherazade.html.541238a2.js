This is a Reality Marble of \u201CScheherazade\u2019s narrated tales\u201D. By narrating them with such an overwhelming presence/sense of reality to the extent that even the World believes in it, those \u201Ctales\u201D are made to be materialized. It summons and gives form to the characters, tools and spirits that appeared within One Thousand and One Nights. \u201CHarun al-Rashid\u201D, \u201CSinbad\u201D, a \u201CMagic Carpet\u201D, \u201CAladdin\u201D, a \u201CJinn (Spirit of the Lamp)\u201D, \u201CAli Baba and the Forty Thieves\u201D, \u201CYamlika, the Queen of Serpents\u201D, and so forth. Even episodes that did not exist in the original (historically proper) One Thousand and One Nights and were written/absorbed into it in posterity are able to be employed given that they will be helpful to her survival as a Heroic Spirit. What is important is not their validity. It is whether or not the King can be entertained by these tales. Naturally, if a large number/large variety of things are produced all at once, the more that are produced, the steeper the Magical Energy consumption becomes. As a matter of course, the conclusion of the tale (Noble Phantasm) is brought to a finish like thus:</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014and such, was the story.\u201D</p><p>From its origin, this Noble Phantasm has an attack specialty against those with the King Attribute. As long as they are an existence similar to a king, even if they are strictly not such a being, there are cases where they would be regarded as a \u201CKing\u201D to Scheherazade.</p><p>\u201CSince it is told that she is the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven\u2026 it seems that she is a king then.

Scheherazade is clearheaded, composed, and is of the outstandingly cool-type of person, but that is not a harsh coldness. It is not an icy coldness, but a coldness like that of the moonlight. Because of her trait where she \u201Cobserves, perceives and understands all of the kings she serves\u201D (for the sake of her own survival), she has a high aptitude in being a prime minister. She primarily advises to the king, and reducing the physical and mental stress of the king is her greatest special skill, but if it is by all means necessary, she can also suggest military advice to her Master in a Holy Grail War.</p><p>Although there is a feeling where she wants to be her lord\u2019s strength, Scheherazade\u2019s fundamental strategy is \u201Cto protect her lord\u2019s life while also protecting her own life\u201D; in other words, she basically tries to choose and have herself conduct a stratagem that would produce the biggest military gains at a low degree of risk.</p><p>Because she always regards the avoidance of her death as number one, Scheherazade\u2019s compatibility with a Master who treats her as someone disposable is bad. In that case, she would easily betray them and search for her own survival route.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>The wish Scheherazade wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cher own survival\u201D. She feels that she does not want to die at least.</p><p>Scheherazade sees her Master as a king who she serves. A Master who attempts to force her into an extremely dangerous situation from which she might not return alive from is a bad king to her, while a Master who cherishes her is a good king to her. If the circumstances of her being cherished will lead to her own survival, then she will give her lord advice, tell tales as well, and further offer her body to them as much as they like.</p><p>But since being summoned is the same as being brought up to the stage again where death exists, that means the moment Scheherazade is summoned, she is quite gloomy. She basically thinks that she does not want to participate in the likes of a Holy Grail War.</p><p>In some sense, it is strange that someone such as Scheherazade was summoned under a system that is fundamentally established by an agreement between both parties\u2026 That is to say, she still believes from the depths of her soul. Even if it is a one in ten thousand chance, even if it is a one in a hundred million chance. Beyond the battles\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the possibility that there is \u201Csomething valuable in exposing one\u2019s life to danger, which can only be obtained during then\u201D is awaiting her.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CCannot sleep, my King?

In order to stop that wrongdoing, Scheherazade \u2013 a daughter of a cabinet minister \u2013 personally married the King. Scheherazade had planned so that, after spending the night with the King together, she would call for her younger sister, Dunyazade, for the purpose of informing her farewell, in which the latter would then look to approach and pester the former for a story. The King was pleased with the story Scheherazade narrated to Dunyazade and requested Scheherazade for its sequel, but dawn had broken out by then. Scheherazade then tells him that \u201CTomorrow\u2019s tale will be even more exciting.\u201D Because of this, the King continued to let Scheherazade live in order to hear the continuation of her tales, and finally\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u2026 The collection of nearly a thousand tales that are being read even as of the present era are, for the most part, added by translators in posterity. According to one theory, the earliest collection of those stories \u2013 which became the overall collection\u2019s core \u2013 only amounted to about two hundred some stories, and those stories even had no ending to them.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Scheherazade was simply a woman who was intently committed to the matter of \u201Cescaping from death\u201D.</p><p>At first, Scheherazade desired to become the King\u2019s wife out of a sense of justice of \u201CI shall stop the insane King.\u201D And she successfully passed through the first night with the power of her tales. However\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014that has been repeated for a long, long time. The King\u2019s heart did not change immediately. Day after day, it was not even unusual for her to die at any moment if she feels exhausted even for a little while. It is something like, a small monkey holding a needle covered with a lethal poison, always sitting on her shoulder for twenty-four hours. She could die on a whim. She could die especially without any reason at all. She could even die if the wind blows on her. When she is sitting side by side with death, she can rely on nothing but her tales, which she has no choice but to tell with her speech, and her own body, which looked like that of a prostitute\u2019s, and those nights were repeated one thousand and one times to the point that they seemed to last an eternity\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That was enough to bring about a change in her spirit.</p><p>Before she knew it, Scheherazade\u2019s goal was simply \u201Cto escape from death\u201D, a desire that burdened her body and soul. As long as it is just that, then that is fine with her. That is her very objective. She will devote that to all of her being. Because if she does not do so, she could die. Even though like that, she might die because she is doing that.</p><p>That is no different even if Scheherazade materializes as a Servant. She will just try to keep on surviving. Even if she has to do whatever it takes. There is neither good or evil in that. It is because her circumstances are just \u201Cas such\u201D.</p><p>\u201CTherefore, if the distinction between reality and tales (fiction/fantasy) is lost and the World is destroyed, then you can escape from death for eternity\u2026\u201D If there is someone who whispers that to her with malice\u2026 Or maybe if\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="role-within-the-game-s-story" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-within-the-game-s-story" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role within the Game\u2019s Story</h2><p>In the Subterranean World of Folklore \u2013 Agartha, Scheherazade was summoned/assimilated by the Demon God Pillar Phenex when he was struck by Scheherazade\u2019s own will to survive.</p><p>As a result of being provided with a Singularity (Holy Grail) by Phenex, Scheherazade uses the vast Magical Energy from it to expand the interpretation of her Noble Phantasm\u2019s property where \u201Cit is able to further employ stories that were added to One Thousand and One Nights in posterity as a part of the Noble Phantasm.\u201D \u201CTales\u201D of \u201Cmythical cities\u201D that existed around the world were forcibly inserted as something part of One Thousand and One Nights, and those mythical cities were completely realized as something part of reality (a group of underground fantasy cities). Using those as the core to raise \u201Cthe tale called Agartha\u201D even more, she generates a tale that reality will eventually not be able to disregard on a global scale, before she would rouse the present World into collapsing by making the Mystery concealed worldwide become obsolete; that was Phenex\u2019s and Scheherazade\u2019s goal.</p><p>After she created the underground world, Scheherazade prepared the necessary \u201Ccharacters\u201D in order to move the tale forward. Including the Servants she personally summoned, she secured the Saint Graphs of several Chaldean Servants with Phenex\u2019s cooperation to be the characters. It was necessary to arrange the appropriate characters, but it was not necessarily true that they conveniently exist on the \u201CThrone\u201D. Although she attempted to use \u201Csimilar people\u201D \u2013 \u201Cthose who possess the essential components\u201D \u2013 as substitutes to be used in the cast, it was moreover necessary to utilize the Saint Graphs that were already summoned. Still, no matter how they were mixed into the cast, she would not be able to simply distort the Heroic Spirits where they each have a soul strongly engraved in human history. For that reason, she first needs to secure character candidates from a reference area similar to the \u201CThrone\u201D in the form of her Noble Phantasm, One Thousand and One Nights, and from there, with the summoning technique formula being applied, it was necessary that those who were reproduced were mixed with the summoned Saint Graphs into the cast. In a tale produced out of reality, characters produced from that fictional world are narrated\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014In some sense, that is the same as One Thousand and One Nights itself \u2013 a nested framework.</p><p>And then, Scheherazade begins to talk. A tale of a world of women, one that is simply straightforward, and clich\xE9d, and frighteningly harsh; one that is neither a gratitude story, nor a moral story, nor a religious story, nor is it a work of a war chronicle, nor is it a work of a mystery. The tale she speaks of\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014all of it together was absolutely necessary. The fact of the matter is, she herself chose to bring up that tale, because she chose that tale to act as the wedge that will break apart reality.</p><p>The reason for it.<br> The meaning of it.<br> It is within the spiral of the rainbow that pierces through the sky.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Her tales.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Fergus</strong></p><p>She really does not understand the reason why, but whenever Scheherazade catches sight of Fergus, she slides away and unintentionally takes up a distance from him. Though it seems that it does not mean Fergus is hated by Scheherazade.</p><p><strong>Nitocris</strong></p><p>This and that happened, and Scheherazade became good friends with her. She believes that Nitocris is a good monarch.</p><p><strong>Child Servants</strong></p><p>Given that she genuinely gets to tell a story with pleasure, Scheherazade is happy. Especially in regard to Nursery Rhyme, Scheherazade has a particular thought about her state of being in that Nursery Rhyme is called \u201Ca tale that is also a hero\u201D, so Scheherazade often shifts her attention to Nursery Rhyme with affection.</p><p><strong>Arash</strong></p><p>A Great Hero of Persia, someone who is famous to the extent that Scheherazade heard of Arash in the bedtime stories told to her.

I was being conscious of a way to make her design not overlap with FGO\u2019s existing characters, but also so that it does not drift too far away from FGO\u2019s concept of its character designs. I got to choose the way her skin is coloured with my own tastes, making it a considerably dark brown colour. Although I think there are pros and cons to her design, including the shaping of her face too, usually I am getting to draw freely because of TYPE-MOON. I am grateful to them.</p><p>The final form of her weapon is my favourite, something like a 6-mounted launcher. Such an item is not limited to this work since it is common for me to habitually draw one-of-a-kind items, so it has structurally become quite complicated and bizarre. Even though I drew a 3-sided view of it, I was wracking my brains on if it was the way the design should be. Well, it must have been difficult for the people who created the data for the game\u2019s use\u2026 I would like to tell them my thanks for letting me borrow their place. Although Ms. Schehera is rather excessively strong-willed, if she gets to serve you as an attendant for a long time, she will be happy when she is able to accept you showing your deep affections to her even like a squid.
