A three-horse chariot. Two of the horses are immortal and divine horses that were bestowed to Achilles by the Sea God Poseidon, while the other one horse is a fine horse that was plundered from a city. The chariot tramples down the battleground by means of extreme speed. It can cause increased damage proportional to the rise of the chariot\u2019s velocity.

A Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type that Achilles activates by getting off from \u201CThe Immortal Chariot of Swift Winds and Surging Waves\u201D to stand on his feet. It is something that embodies the legend that he is the swiftest hero among all heroes of all eras. He can run through a vast battlefield in a single breath, and even if there are obstacles on the field, they will not reduce his speed. He must expose his weak point \u2013 his Achilles tendon \u2013 while running, but there are few Heroic Spirits who can catch hold of him while he is running at this speed.</p><h1 id="andreios-amarantos-the-unfading-flower-of-the-brave" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#andreios-amarantos-the-unfading-flower-of-the-brave" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Andreios Amarantos: The Unfading Flower of the Brave</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel (Self) Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 0</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>Andreios Amarantos (The Brave and Everlasting One).

A Noble Phantasm that becomes available by having Achilles get off \u201CThe Immortal Chariot of Swift Winds and Surging Waves\u201D. A long spear given to Achilles\u2019 parents during the occasion of their marriage by Chiron. A Great Magecraft that is comparable to a Reality Marble, it builds up an area that has the purpose of conducting duels with fellow heroes, but only in the case that Achilles\u2019 opponent has consented to the duel.</p><p>Because Achilles was not summoned as a Lancer, the spear has lost some of its abilities, such as a curse of incurability on the wounds it inflicts.</p><h1 id="akhilleus-kosmos-the-miniature-world-enclosed-by-the-azure-sky" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#akhilleus-kosmos-the-miniature-world-enclosed-by-the-azure-sky" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Akhilleus Kosmos: The Miniature World Enclosed by the Azure Sky</h1><ul><li>Rank: A+</li><li>Classification: Barrier Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 0</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>Akhilleus Kosmos (Achilles\u2019 World).

The very world seen by Achilles is projected, and the ocean currents whirling at some parts of the outer circumference are due to the Sea God. To oppose this shield is, in other words, to take on the world, and if it is invoked, it can even defend against Anti-Fortress and Anti-Country Noble Phantasms.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First Person Pronoun: ore</li><li>Second Person Pronouns: temee / anta / kisama</li><li>Third Person Pronouns: kare, etc.</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>A man with a character that is broadminded and indeed Hero-like. Naivety remains somewhere within this good-natured older brother. Achilles has a flaw where he is lenient towards those who he has particularly recognized as his friends and allies, and on occasions where they return to him as enemies, he will not even attack them initially.</p><p>In other Holy Grail Wars, this flaw can be exploited, and Achilles can be cornered into a disadvantage as a result. (Generally in those cases, he will try to strike back with all his might.)</p><p>Furthermore, it is a matter of grave concern that Achilles can suffer an unexpected defeat because of that naivety. He is perfect as a Hero, but he has many flaws as a human being, so for those reasons, he is a Hero who is loved and can befriended by anybody.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Achilles basically recognizes his Master as an equal. When speaking of this conversely, he will also not approve of being seen by his Master as someone lower than them. He will not change his attitude and would try to be easygoing, and if his Master is a good person, he would drink alcohol together with them and with pleasure, but if his Master is a bad person, he would try to draw a line in socializing with them.</p><p>In any event, Achilles will not go against his way as a Hero\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014and would absolutely not follow orders such as killing unfortunate people \u2013 people who ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time \u2013 for example.</p><p>Achilles extremely hates conducts that are uncharacteristic of a Hero. With that sort of implication, it can be said that his compatibility with a so-called \u2018normal mage\u2019 is remarkably bad.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CYou, I can tell you drew a nice Servant!

Hahahahahaha!\u201D</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>A Hero who boasts one of the most outstanding popularity in Greek Mythology. That life ran through everything like a gale, while simultaneously, it is tinged with a brilliance that is appropriate for one who is called a Hero.</p><p>It is said that when he was asked by his mother whether he desired an ordinary and peaceful life or a life where he dies as a relentless Hero, Achilles chose the latter without hesitating.</p><p>According to the remaining pieces of his legend, the human body part that bears his name \u2013 the Achilles tendon \u2013 was the sole weak point of Achilles, who possesses an immortal body.</p><p>Achilles, who was born between the Hero Peleus and the Goddess Thetis, was roasted by the flames of immortality that were meant for the benefit of the gods by Thetis\u2019 hands, but Peleus opposed that, saying that half of him is human, so she should leave that portion of him as a human.</p><p>Peleus and Thetis parted ways after this dispute, and the portion of Achilles that was left behind as those of a human\u2019s was only the part of one of his ankles that was gripped by Thetis during the immortality process. (There is also another view where he acquired the power of immortality by being submerged underneath one of the rivers of the Underworld.)</p><p>Peleus was unable to raise Achilles, so he entrusted him to Chiron, the Sage of the Centaurs. Chiron, having raised Heracles, Jason, and many others, trained Achilles, and before long, Achilles grew up into a masculine young man.</p><p>When Achilles was asked by his mother, Thetis, whether he desired to live as an ordinary human but with a long life, or whether he desired to live as a Hero \u2013 even though it would be short lived, he chose the latter without hesitating.</p><p>Participating in the Trojan War as part of the Achaean army, Achilles violently killed the heroes of the Trojan army one by one, before eventually challenging their supreme commander, Hector, to a duel, and triumphing in it.</p><p>However, Paris, Hector\u2019s younger brother, borrowed the power of the Sun God Apollo, who was Troy\u2019s ally, to shoot through Achilles\u2019 heel, his sole weak point, thus stripping him of his immortality.</p><p>Furthermore, Achilles, whose heart was pierced, died after he rampaged until he was no longer able to. After his death, his once fellow allies competed for his armour he left behind.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A wild hero who tends to be bright and spontaneous. Maybe because Achilles desires to live and die as a Hero, but the part of his heroic manner that is being emphasized is the part of him being majestic in his heroism rather than the part of him being unprecedented.</p><p>Because of that nature, one cannot also deny the part of him that is lacking in delicacy to some extent, thus Achilles also often loses sight of the important things.</p><p>But still, Achilles\u2019 way of life of always trying to be a proper Hero is dazzlingly noble. Perhaps it is the makings of a Hero that he possessed since birth, but just being next to him is heartening.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>His spear, and his bare hands when empty-handed.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Atalanta</strong></p><p>They were on a common front in another Holy Grail War. A woman who his father Peleus admired, and Achilles also adores Atalanta like she was family to him.</p><p><strong>Semiramis</strong></p><p>\u201CHeeey, hanging out around you while you\u2019re getting irritated is a somewhat pleasant atmosphere!\u201D (Achilles was then tragically attacked by the Hanging Gardens.)</p><p><strong>Heracles</strong></p><p>\u201CI wanted to try to have a bare-handed brawl with him just once since it sounds nice, but I was held back by everybody.\u201D</p><p><strong>Chiron</strong></p><p>\u201CUwa, Teacher! No, because I\u2019m already a graduate! Pardon me for a moment on the hard course! Ah, hey!

Soooo, do you also have your wooden horse with you!?\u201D</p><p><strong>Paris</strong></p><p>\u201C\u2026 The Paris I know of was a youngster who only grew up a little bit and was a little hateful, but\u2026\u201D</p><p><strong>Hector</strong></p><p>Achilles has complicated feelings about Hector, but he does not intend to bring those with him while in Chaldea. If he leaves out the emotional things, he sees him as\u2026 a person who can be respected as a warrior. Unfortunately, it is impossible for Achilles to leave out the emotional things in the first place.</p><p>In this connection, Hector can completely separate his emotions during battle. For example, even if he is an enemy to his parents and siblings, it seems that he can suppress his emotions and carry through with the battle.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea</strong></p><p>Achilles feels some responsibility as one would expect \u2013 the kind of responsibility where he will fight Penthesilea while she is screaming out his name, but\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014it is not like just because he feels some responsibility, he can pick a fight with her for that reason. He was merely driven by an unbearable feeling to say that word.</p><p><strong>Iskandar</strong></p><p>\u201CReverence for me!? An autograph!? Mine!? While you\u2019re at it, you also want my armour!? No, well, but it\u2019s fine!
