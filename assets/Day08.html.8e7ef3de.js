You&#39;re going to eat lunch here today, Emiya?&quot;</p><p>Issei is eating lunch by himself inside.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Good, this is convenient.</p><hr><p>&quot;How is it? How did yesterday&#39;s incident turn out?&quot;</p><p>I sit down at the table and start talking casually.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s still unexplained. They are saying something about there being chemicals in the empty classroom on the first floor. That&#39;s the reason they came up with after searching through the school all night.&quot;</p><p>He must be unhappy, and he starts biting on a tough-looking carrot.</p><hr><p>&quot;But you were lucky. You skipped school after lunch and managed to avoid the disaster. Yes, I guess you were rewarded for your good daily conduct.&quot;</p><hr><p>He now sips on his tea happily.</p><p>...Man.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the right atmosphere to interrogate him, so I&#39;ll wait and see for a while.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>Suddenly, I notice lunch break will be over in five minutes\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Emiya? Did you come up with something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, but I remembered something. This isn&#39;t the time to be leisurely eating lunch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;?&quot;</p><p>I quickly wrap up my lunchbox and turn to Issei.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm, I have a bad feeling about this. Please do not ask me for money.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any even if you want to borrow some.&quot;</p><p>I get up from my chair.</p><p>...I don&#39;t have time.</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>&quot;Issei. Don&#39;t ask questions and just take your top off.&quot;</p><p>I clearly state what needs to be done.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!????&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told you to take your uniform off. Take your shirt off as well.</p><p>It&#39;s not any good unless you&#39;re naked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015W-W-W-W-W-What are you asking for!? Are you insane!? Is it a new way to question me!? No, do I have to do this now!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup, this is urgent. Just take off your top. It&#39;ll be too late once school ends!&quot;</p><hr><p>I attack Issei.</p><p>&quot;Whoa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! Stop it, you fool! Are you really from a family of warriors!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right.&quot;</p><p>To summarize, I didn&#39;t find a Command Spell on Issei&#39;s body.</p><p>I checked thoroughly, but I didn&#39;t find anything like a Command Spell.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good. This is really good.&quot;</p><p>I nod to myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s so good...!? What&#39;s with you doing all this for nothing!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;? Oh, yeah. I&#39;m sorry, Issei. I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s going on, but I needed to check something. It&#39;s done with now, so there&#39;s no longer any problem.&quot;</p><hr><p>I bow and apologize.</p><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015o-okay. If you think you have done something bad, it is natural for you to apologize.&quot;</p><p>Issei goes silent with a serious face.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But now, the search has gone back to square one.</p><p>If Issei, the one at the Ryuudou Temple, is innocent, there&#39;s nobody else here that might be Caster&#39;s Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, Issei. Is there something strange going on at the temple?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? What do you mean by something strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But is there anything that&#39;s different?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let&#39;s see. If you mean recently, there is an unfamiliar woman. But that&#39;s about it. My father and brother are as always.&quot;</p><p>Issei says so naturally.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...There&#39;s an unfamiliar woman?</p><p>Could that be Caster? ...Well, I&#39;m sure she could pretend to be human without a problem.</p><p>Or would that be Caster&#39;s Master?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Maybe I should ask Issei about it.</p><p>I&#39;ll\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>...I guess I&#39;ll ask him about it.</p><p>She&#39;s not one to reveal herself to the ones living at the temple, but I might be able to get some clues.</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei. Can you tell me about this unfamiliar woman?</p><p>Is she from a foreign country, or is her face covered with something like a turban?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What is that? We would kick out such a strange person. ...I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re asking, but she is a legitimate guest.</p><p>...My brother is happy that she might be an evil woman, but I strangely like her. I have only talked to her once, but she is a good person even if she may look evil.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, wow. So asking the question was worth it, seeing how you&#39;re praising a woman. Did you fall in love with her?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;D-D-D-D-Don&#39;t say such a stupid thing, you fool! I admire a part of her that she doesn&#39;t notice herself. First of all, I cannot fall in love with the lover of the one I respect as my older brother, Souichirou\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Issei suddenly stops and lowers his head.</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know if he felt dizzy or what, but Issei falls on the table and does not move.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Issei? Is it anemia or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s not that I feel bad.&quot;</p><hr><p>He raises himself real fast.</p><p>I laugh thinking that he&#39;s acting like a coiled doll.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015, Issei?&quot;</p><p>I look at Issei without looking at my slashed stomach.</p><hr><p>&quot;YOU fell for my trap. The order I implanted into THIS HUMAN functions only when HE meets SOMEONE who INQUIRES about ME.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear someone else&#39;s voice from Issei&#39;s mouth.</p><p>When I realize that voice is of the Servant I met at the Ryuudou Temple...</p><p>&quot;I DO NOT need this DOLL ANYMORE.&quot;</p><p>...The knife in Issei&#39;s hand is stabbed into Issei&#39;s neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...My mind fades from too much blood loss.</p><p>The wound.

I guess he asked Sakura for directions, but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was sayin\u2015\u2015\u2015waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait!!!????&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-Why are you here!?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka jumps out of the back alley as fast as Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, that was my question. But you took me and shoved me in here like a package or something.&quot;</p><p>I explain exactly what happened to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She must have understood, as Tohsaka stops right there.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...It&#39;s good she stopped, but she&#39;s now glaring at me silently.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Oh, that pisses me off.</p><p>I also went into a panic because of the sudden event.</p><p>But it&#39;s not fair if she&#39;s the only one who can make a face like that.</p><p>She shouldn&#39;t have done it if she didn&#39;t want to. Damn, I feel stupid for getting all embarrassed about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015By the way, Tohsaka. Issei has nothing to do with all this.&quot;</p><p>I say so while turning away from her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? What, you already found out...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Issei&#39;s not a Master. Well, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t trust me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? No, that&#39;s all right. You&#39;re not a person who can lie. I bet Issei&#39;s innocent if you say so.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka speaks plainly.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Damn, I lost.&quot;</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>I feel stupid for getting angry if she replies like that... And most of all, I&#39;ve cheered up hearing her say that.</p><hr><p>&quot;But how did you check? I didn&#39;t feel a Master&#39;s presence from him. So you should only have been able to check by attacking him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? No, I only checked if he had a Command Spell or not. That&#39;s something he can&#39;t hide no matter how much magical energy or Master&#39;s presence he hides, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yeah. It&#39;s simple if you just look at his arm.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka nods in assent.</p><p>But she tilts her head in wonder, as if she&#39;s thought of something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Emiya-kun. How did you check for Issei&#39;s Command Spell?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just took his clothes off. He fought back, but I took off his shirt by force.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka freezes while looking at me.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...How strange of her.</p><p>What part of that is strange?</p><hr><p>...The Matou household is quiet.</p><p>Shinji isn&#39;t here, and Sakura doesn&#39;t seem to be here either.</p><p>While I&#39;m wondering what to do now...</p><p>&quot;Oh, did you come here because you were worried about Sakura?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka says so as if it&#39;s natural to ask.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Tohsaka, you know Matou Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m an acquaintance of hers.</p><p>The students in the archery club are all in bad condition, so they&#39;ve been transferred to the hospital in Shinto. That&#39;s why Fujimura-Sensei is running around, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then what about Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;s sleeping in the hospital right now. ...Oh, I see.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Ugh. W-What&#39;s with that evil smile?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Noooothing. But yeah. You should be more worried about the person who comes to help you, rather than contacting me. Oh, I think I&#39;m beginning to understand you now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka smiles meaningfully.</p><p>It&#39;s really humiliating, but...</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Why do you know Sakura comes to my place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015I-I found that out when I went to visit the archery club.</p><p>I&#39;m friends with the captain, Mitsuzuri-san, you know?&quot;</p><p>With that, Tohsaka starts walking up the hill.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka? Are you going home?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s meaningless to stay here. And we need to restart the search for Caster. Let&#39;s share our ideas tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka says &quot;goodbye&quot; and casually leaves.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>...She looks at me seriously from a distance.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, I have something I want to ask you.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka murmurs while looking away.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015? Fine, what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Um, this is a what-if question. Um, what if someone is sent for adoption without any regards to their will... How do you think that person feels while they grow up?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>What does she mean with that question?</p><p>A child that&#39;s adopted with no regard to their will...</p><p>A life where their previous life is all thrown away to be adopted by a complete stranger.</p><p>People say children cannot choose their parent.</p><p>Children who are raised by a stranger after they are born, and how they might feel\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I get myself together.</p><p>...Why was I so sentimental?</p><p>I don&#39;t even need to think about this question.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big problem. If the place they&#39;re adopted to is a good place, I&#39;m sure the person doesn&#39;t have any complaints. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be some complaints if it&#39;s a bad place. All children are like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. You&#39;re right. Why am I asking such an obvious thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka waves goodbye and goes up the hill.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s house is in the opposite direction from mine.</p><p>...Well.</p><p>I have to get back to my house before it gets dark.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04</h2><p>&quot;Yeah.

I think they&#39;re having a sale in the shopping district today.&quot;</p><p>...Hm.</p><p>Saber is looking forward to dinner, so it might be good to make an expensive meal today.</p><p>I can contact Tohsaka after I get home.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I just bought some beef fillet.&quot;</p><hr><p>And veal too. It&#39;s just rare, expensive, and doesn&#39;t taste that different, but I fell for the butcher&#39;s sale talk and bought it...!!!!</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. It was pretty cheap.&quot;</p><p>I can consider that I&#39;ve blown a day&#39;s worth of work on it.</p><p>Saber looks like she likes meat. We&#39;ve been having home-cooking all these times, so I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be happy if I make something like a Western-style full course.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;d be perfect if I could get an aperitif, but I can&#39;t serve alcohol in front of Fuji-Nee.</p><p>Even with the age issue aside, I can&#39;t give Fuji-Nee any alco... hol...?&quot;</p><hr><p>I see something strange out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I wonder what it is and turn to the cake shop, Beko-chan.</p><hr><p>...Is that some kind of a uniform?</p><p>The girl wearing a uniform unfit for this downtown area is troubling the woman at the cake shop.</p><hr><p>I get curious and stop.</p><p>From what I can hear, it seems the money the girl is trying to pay with is not in Japanese yen, and the woman at the cake shop is stumped as to what she can do.</p><p>And on top of that, it seems that the girl can&#39;t speak much Japanese.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>......Well, I got a bargain.</p><p>I guess I&#39;ll do something about it since I happened to walk by.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thank you!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m thanked two-fold and leave the cake shop.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Thank you. You helped me for cake.&quot;</p><p>This girl thanks me as well in funny Japanese.</p><p>But I haven&#39;t done much.</p><p>All I did was money exchange, and I just traded the two thousand-yen bills I had with the paper money she had.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Change. Left over. You can have it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? No, I got enough money already. You gave me two ten-franc bills.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>The girl dressed like Nightingale looks around absent-mindedly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Finished shopping. Goodbye.&quot;</p><p>She bows and leaves.</p><p>I watch her go thinking to myself about the unusual event.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;Oh yeah. Do you like cakes?&quot;</p><p>I get curious and ask her.</p><hr><p>The girl in white stops and stares around absent-mindedly.</p><p>&quot;...Yes.

I don&#39;t have enough free time to be playing pranks on you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015no... Sorry, I was just surprised. So, what&#39;s going on? It&#39;s surprising for you to call me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s about Issei. We promised this morning to get this cleared up today, right? To tell you the result, Issei wasn&#39;t a Master.

Shirou&#39;s been like a different person ever since you started teaching him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am surprised about that as well. But it seems Shirou has a different teacher, so it is not my doing.&quot;</p><p>We&#39;re drinking the after-meal tea now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s good that Fuji-Nee and Saber are getting along.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to interrupt, so I&#39;ll quietly drink tea and rest my body that is tired from training with Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;He has two teachers? Does that mean he&#39;s cheating on you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It seems he is not conscious of it. But I have decided to tolerate it since the result is good.</p><p>...Shirou should learn techniques that are suited for him. His body is already fit, so all that is left is to learn how to move his body properly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, exactly, Saber-chan. Shirou has been training all this time, so his body is really fit. It&#39;s just that he wasn&#39;t motivated until now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Training his body... I see, I am sure he would have trained his body having a dojo like that. Additionally, he had an opponent like you, so it is impossible for him to have no talent.&quot;</p><hr><p>She nods emotionally and takes a sip of tea.</p><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s been a long time since we last did kendo in there. That place wasn&#39;t used for kendo before you came here.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee corrects Saber while biting on a rice cracker.</p><hr><p>&quot;It was not...? Did you not use the shinai at the dojo, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Saber looks at me with surprise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Well, no. I haven&#39;t used it since my father died.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Shirou was fighting Kiritsugu-san any chance he got, but he stopped using the shinai after Kiritsugu-san died. I&#39;m so sad.&quot;</p><hr><p>Munch, munch.</p><p>Fujimura Tiger nibbles on the rice cracker while resting her head on the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p>When Fuji-Nee acts like this, the conversation always goes to\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Man, I wonder why. He was such a kendo boy back then, but he&#39;s just a bum now. I can&#39;t say he had talent for swords, but he was pretty good in archery. But he quit, you know?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015As I thought. Fuji-Nee, stop talking about the past. That&#39;s just really negative.&quot;</p><p>I glare at her.</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee sulks and eats the rice cracker.</p><p>Phew.</p><p>It seems she&#39;s done now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. Shirou&#39;s childhood, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gah......!&quot;</p><p>So why do you have to bring the conversation back up again, Saber!?</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Do you want to hear about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I am curious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right! Then I shall tell you all about him!&quot;</p><p>...The morale of Fujimura Taiga&#39;s army goes up due to the reinforcements brought on by Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I guess it can&#39;t be helped. I don&#39;t want to interrupt, so I guess I&#39;ll drink tea silently.</p><p>I&#39;ll carry out my original intention of resting my body.</p><hr><p>&quot;He&#39;s really twisted now, but he was really cute when he was a kid. He never doubted anyone, and he would do everything you asked him to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But he had a stubborn side to him, and he rarely changed his mind once he decided on something. I guess he was the complete opposite of Kiritsugu-san in that regard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? So Kiritsugu was the opposite of Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. Kiritsugu-san was the kind that accepted everything. He thought that good and evil were different for each person. He took life real casually.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But he would try to do something about it every time he saw someone in trouble, and Shirou was always trying to imitate Kiritsugu-san.</p><p>Shirou was more particular than Kiritsugu-san, so he went and beat up the bullies, saying bad things are bad.</p><p>Yeah, Shirou&#39;s been trying to be a superhero since then.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee happily talks about boring things.</p><p>And beside Fuji-Nee...</p><p>&quot;...? Why do you try to be a superhero?&quot;</p><p>Saber asks me a natural question.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Well. It&#39;s hard to explain. I guess it&#39;s because I admire them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Admire...? You admire superheroes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hm... I guess so.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s embarrassing if she says &quot;superhero&quot; outright.</p><hr><p>&quot;Why is that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p><hr><p>I realize at that moment.</p><p>...There&#39;s no reason.</p><p>Emiya Shirou has admired superheroes since he was a child.</p><p>I kept on running so that I could be of help to people, so that I could help people who were sad.</p><hr><p>That does not change even now.</p><p>But the reason behind it...</p><p>Why did I try to be &quot;of help to people&quot;?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll make your dream...</p><hr><p>&quot;[line9]&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the answer.</p><p>That was the end of the person that meant everything to me.</p><p>He died peacefully because of a simple statement I made.</p><p>...I wanted to protect that trust he had in me.</p><p>Even after he died.</p><p>So that he would be able to rest in peace.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But...</p><p>Is that really the right reason?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I hear my name and get a hold of myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, sorry. I&#39;m going to my room now.&quot;</p><p>Driven by an unknown uneasiness, I get up.</p><hr><p>I leave the living room, as if running away from something.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, not &quot;as if&quot;. I did run away.</p><p>It was a natural question.</p><p>But I was scared something might be revealed if Saber stared at me like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why? What am I scared of?&quot;</p><p>An uneasiness that I don&#39;t understand myself...</p><p>A shapeless fear, an attacking nausea...</p><p>I hurry to my room, bearing the headache.</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee went home, saying that she had work to do tonight.</p><p>Saber is sleeping in the next room like yesterday.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t sleep tonight either, so I stare into the darkness.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t sleep because I&#39;m conscious of Saber.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&#39;Why do you try to be a superhero?&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s because of those words.</p><p>That question is still in my brain.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She asked me why, and I answered &quot;because I admire them&quot;.</p><p>...It&#39;s obvious why I ran away right then.</p><p>Because\u2015\u2015\u2015if she had asked me why I admired them, I wouldn&#39;t be able to come up with an answer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, I have an answer.</p><p>But I&#39;m unconsciously restraining myself from ever saying it.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The reason to be a superhero...&quot;</p><p>...Why ask that now?</p><p>I was just desperate to be like Kiritsugu when I was a child.</p><p>I admired superheroes because\u2015\u2015\u2015there was an ideal I could not make come true.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That should be the cause.</p><p>The true form of the ideal I have, no, the ideal I&#39;ve had since ten years ago.</p><p>I glared into the sky,</p><p>thinking that if I could save someone, it would be a lie unless I could save everything.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But which one is the lie?</p><p>The ideal called a superhero that I&#39;ve admired.</p><p>...The older I get, the more Emiya Shirou strays from the ideal.</p><p>The ignorant child that did not know of limits has learned of limits through knowledge.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015What cannot be saved cannot be saved.</p><p>A miracle is something too big for humans.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But I believed I could be like Kiritsugu when I grew older.</p><p>But all I obtained was the wisdom to conclude that an ideal is just an ideal.</p><p>All I can do are remedial measures.</p><p>Even though I&#39;ve been attacked with the fact that it&#39;s meaningless, I&#39;ve continued to do whatever I could.</p><p>Thinking that it&#39;s good enough if one person is saved by my actions.</p><hr><p>...Even though my objective is to save as many lives as I can, I&#39;ve lost a lot of things on the way.

Can you leave the onions out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right\u2015\u2015\u2015so what happened after that?

Caster is at the Ryuudou Temple, and Issei is coming here from the Ryuudou Temple. There has to be a connection here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no connection. It might just be coincidence.&quot;</p><p>I try to defend Issei.</p><hr><p>&quot;That can&#39;t be true! Look, the mountain gate to the Ryuudou Temple has been closed for the past few weeks!</p><p>No outsider can come in, and Issei&#39;s like the only one who came out from there!</p><p>If he&#39;s not suspicious, everyone would be a fair call!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey now.

What, are you going to stand up for Issei?</p><p>Heh, fine. If you&#39;re going to ignore the obvious, I&#39;ll go and solve things myself!&quot;</p><p>But our school idol is the only one who does not realize the situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Tohsaka, come over here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, are you going to run away!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won&#39;t run away. Just come this way.&quot;</p><p>I drag Tohsaka by her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;H\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey, Emiya-kun...!?&quot;</p><p>She can complain later.</p><p>Just let me get away from here as fast as I can.</p><hr><p>The morning practice must be canceled because of yesterday&#39;s incident, as the archery range is quiet.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>...Good.</p><p>We won&#39;t attract attention here.</p><p>So the remaining problem is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;[line12]&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka, who&#39;s glaring at me silently.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I know what you want to say. I know, so don&#39;t make a face like that. I don&#39;t know what to do if you sulk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not sulking!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p><p>My mind is stunned at the lightning comeback.</p><p>But I have to deal with her calmly.</p><p>Issei&#39;s life is on the line.</p><p>Knowing Tohsaka, I bet she would do something reckless to test Issei.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t try to deceive me. Caster&#39;s base is at the Ryuudou Temple, and Issei is coming to school from the Ryuudou Temple. Why are you ignoring that fact!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka yells at me.</p><p>...She&#39;s right, but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s Issei...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What? Do you have any objection?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But I&#39;ll die before Issei if I give her such an ambiguous answer.</p><p>But I can&#39;t leave Tohsaka like this, so I&#39;ll have to try to convince her somehow...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. You&#39;re saying Issei is suspicious no matter what, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. You might not be able to tell, but the Ryuudou Temple is really strange right now.</p><p>It&#39;s true that Caster&#39;s base is there, but the distortion is too big, and there&#39;s too much being collected\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Collected...? You mean the magical energy sucked up from the town?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015no, it&#39;s nothing, so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...You&#39;re more suspicious than Issei right now, Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Anyway! He&#39;s suspicious because he&#39;s coming here everyday with a cool face from such a place!</p><p>Yes, I always thought I needed to give him a kick, so this would be a perfect opportunity.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s serious.</p><p>I heard that they weren&#39;t on friendly terms, but I didn&#39;t know it was this bad.</p><p>...Actually...</p><p>What the hell did Issei do to Tohsaka?</p><p>I&#39;m a bit curious as to what could cause Tohsaka to be so drastic... No, now&#39;s not the time.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. I agree that Issei&#39;s position is a suspicious one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. You would be guilty too if you keep on defending him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. So leave Issei&#39;s case to me. I&#39;ll find out if he&#39;s a Master or not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>It looks like she doesn&#39;t believe me at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;Trust me. I won&#39;t hold back on Issei just because he&#39;s my friend, nor will I lie to you. First of all, this is all needless worry. There&#39;s no way Issei would do something so evil.&quot;</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><hr><p>The silent pressure continues.</p><p>I bet Tohsaka&#39;s worried that I might go easy because Issei&#39;s my friend.</p><p>Her doubt is only natural, so I just have to endure it.</p><p>I have to get her to believe in me.</p><hr><p>&quot;......All right. I&#39;ll leave Issei&#39;s case to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I sigh with relief.</p><hr><p>&quot;But how will you figure it out? Do you know how to identify a Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka asks about the fundamental deficiency in this proposal.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015well...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to go up to him and ask &#39;Hey Issei, are you a Master?&#39;</p><p>Even though we&#39;re cooperating, I will settle my case with you right here if you&#39;re going to do such a stupid thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s mad.</p><p>She&#39;s really mad.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. It&#39;s all right. I have a way to figure out if he&#39;s a Master or not without asking him. I&#39;ll settle this case today, so please don&#39;t do anything. I&#39;ll contact you once I figure it out.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. Cooperating is like this, after all.&quot;</p><p>She starts walking away with a gesture that obviously tells me she&#39;s not content.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll trust you. But don&#39;t do anything too stupid. If Issei is a Master, doing anything stupid would only result in death.&quot;</p><p>Saying so, Tohsaka goes back to the school building.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I see her off.</p><p>&quot;...Huh?
