I&#39;m home Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is not &#39;I&#39;m home&#39;! How many times do I have to tell you not to go outside by yourself!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... yeah. That&#39;s right, sorry. I&#39;ll be more careful next time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There will not be a next time! I am really angry this time. Shirou, tell me your reason for going out.</p><p>Why are you causing me trouble when your wounds from yesterday are not healed and when Gilgamesh could attack at any second!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber glares sharply at me.</p><p>...But...</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, I went to the church. I thought it would be beneficial if we could ask the priest about Gilgamesh&#39;s weakness or something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... the church...? But why now?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I consulted him before. As the supervisor, I thought he might be able to do something about a Servant that&#39;s still here after the last war.</p><p>But it was useless. I failed.</p><p>...I guess it&#39;s only natural for you to yell at me. I have you, so we should have gone to the church together.&quot;</p><hr><p>I lower my head once more in apology.</p><p>&quot;Uh... n-no, if you understand, it is fine...&quot;</p><p>Saber withdraws her threatening attitude instantly.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>Saber was really mad at my stupidity, but she&#39;s soft enough to forgive me.</p><p>Um, if I&#39;m not conceited, it&#39;s like her resentment at being left alone was cancelled just by having me come home.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That is true. If you regret your actions, I will overlook this case. It seems I did not act maturely.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. You were waiting for me, right Saber? ...Honestly, that really helped me out. My anxieties finally went away when you yelled at me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? You were helped by my yelling?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I was really relieved, knowing that I could come back to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha-&quot;</p><hr><p>...Yes, I&#39;m happy to be back.</p><p>I&#39;m able to see Saber again.</p><p>If I had gone down those stairs, I feel like I would have never returned.</p><p>Thinking about it, I think that choice was a good one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. How about we cooperate with Lancer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Saber, what did you say?&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s past two in the afternoon. I look at Saber over the slightly belated lunch table.</p><hr><p>&quot;I said we should cooperate with Lancer. Gilgamesh exists outside the rules of the Holy Grail War. Lancer will not be able to overlook him as well, so he should be willing to cooperate with us if the conditions are right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. You mean our enemy&#39;s enemy is our ally?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. If some collateral were provided, he should ally with us temporarily.&quot;</p><hr><p>...An alliance with Lancer, huh?</p><p>There certainly might be no other way.</p><p>We can&#39;t match Gilgamesh by ourselves.</p><p>But if Saber and Lancer can cooperate, we should be able to come up with some measures.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You&#39;re right. I don&#39;t know if Lancer will ally with us, but it won&#39;t hurt to ask him.</p><p>...Then the problem would be\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. How to find Lancer.</p><p>Lancer has not appeared since that night, and his Master is still unknown. I did not think he would stay quiet when there are only two of us left...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But he&#39;s not coming out, so does that mean he&#39;s scared to fight you one on one?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. Lancer is a worthy hero. He would be happy to fight me, and certainly not reluctant.</p><p>But he still has not appeared, so perhaps he has some reason not to.&quot;</p><hr><p>We both cross our arms and ponder.</p><p>&quot;You guys are rather well matched this morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-Tohsaka!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin, how long have you been there...!?&quot;</p><p>We are both surprised at the same time.</p><hr><p>&quot;For some time now.</p><p>Shirou is only watching Saber, and Saber is only watching Shirou. I felt stupid, so I just kept quiet.</p><p>Wasn&#39;t that the right choice? You guys had such a good atmosphere going, I couldn&#39;t intrude on you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015!? R-Rin, we are Servant and Master, such things are...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Fine, fine. I&#39;ll say you&#39;re right.</p><p>But about what you two were talking about... I agree that we should cooperate with Lancer. If that goldie is Gilgamesh, we would need to do that to even have a chance of beating him.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Whoa.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long she&#39;s been listening, but Tohsaka understands the situation.</p><p>It seems while we were eating, she&#39;s heard that the true identity of Archer is Gilgamesh and that his Noble Phantasm exceeds that of Saber&#39;s.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, I&#39;ll go home for a while. I need to get a weapon, get ready to lure Lancer out, and prepare some medicine for Illya.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Medicine for Illya...?</p><p>Tohsaka, is something wrong with Illya...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Nothing. Her condition hasn&#39;t changed since yesterday. Her breathing is stable, and her fever is down. She just doesn&#39;t have any energy right now.</p><p>Well, she should wake up and wander in when she gets hungry, so cook her something good when she does.&quot;</p><hr><p>She puts down her empty bowl.</p><p>...Tohsaka was nonchalantly eating lunch too...?</p><hr><p>&quot;See ya. I&#39;ll be back by dinnertime, so don&#39;t do anything until then.&quot;</p><hr><p>After Tohsaka goes home, Saber and I do nothing and just stare at the clock.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...For some reason, the living room is tense.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You want some more tea, Saber?&quot;</p><p>We raise our heads at the same time and freeze as soon as our eyes meet.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What is it, Saber? If you want to say something, say it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No... um\u2015\u2015yes, some more tea, please.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A-All right. I&#39;ll go and prepare some right away.&quot;</p><hr><p>An hour passes in this way.</p><p>If we&#39;re not doing anything else, I should be being taught some sword techniques or be resting.</p><p>But neither Saber nor I mention that.</p><hr><p>...I know myself that I&#39;m acting strangely.</p><p>I know, but I want to be with Saber like this for now.</p><p>No matter how awkward and nervous I am, and even though this is the tenth cup of tea, I still want to watch her face.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...And then.</p><p>When I stand up to go to the kitchen, the doorbell rings.</p><hr><p>&quot;A guest...? At a time like this...?&quot;</p><p>Not many people come by my house.</p><p>Sakura is the only one who might ring the doorbell, but she won&#39;t come here until my cooperation with Tohsaka is over.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is undergoing medical care at her house as well, and it&#39;s not like I associate much with my neighbors.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. Come with me, Saber If something happens, I&#39;ll let you deal with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I shall protect you no matter what.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p><p>I call out, still keeping the door closed.</p><p>&quot;I am from the church. I have come to inform you of the results of the investigation you requested.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My breathing stops for a second.</p><p>The guy on the other side of the door is the guy I went to see this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou? What is wrong? You seem pale.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, I&#39;m fine. Can I open the door, Saber? I&#39;ll send him away if you don&#39;t want him to come in.&quot;</p><hr><p>On the first night we met, Saber did not want to enter the church.</p><p>I remember that, so I check with her.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not mind. I shall abide by your decision.&quot;</p><p>I answer her with a nod and open the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;You took quite some time. Are you for some reason unwilling to see me, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No. I was just surprised since I didn&#39;t think you would come to see me. ...You have something to talk about, right? Come in.&quot;</p><hr><p>I pull back and try to lead Kotomine into the living room.</p><p>But.</p><p>&quot;No, we can talk here standing. I have discovered only a bit, so the conversation should be quick.&quot;</p><p>The priest pulls back and tries to leave the hall.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, where are you going, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told you we shall speak standing up. ...But I cannot do so with that Servant standing there. If she threatens me like that, I prefer to value my life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I turn back to Saber who is behind me.</p><p>&quot;Saber...!?&quot;</p><p>Kotomine is right.</p><p>Saber is emitting a terrible murderous intent that even makes me pale.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What is a Master from the last war doing here? I remember that Kiritsugu shot and killed you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Certainly. When I abandoned my rights as a Master and raised my hands, he shot me from the back. If I did not have God&#39;s divine protection, I would have died then.</p><p>But what of it? It must be like yesterday for you, but it happened ten years ago for me. Are you going to bring up a fight that has already ended?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s murderous intent doesn&#39;t weaken at all.</p><p>&quot;Saber, he&#39;s right. Forget about the last war for now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou. But this man cannot be taken lightly. Kiritsugu targeted this priest before any other enemy because he was an enemy who had to be defeated before anything else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is an honor. If the ones that survived to the end say that of me, perhaps I am not that bad.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015! How can you talk so impudently!&quot;</p><p>The air tenses.</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>If things go on like this, I really won&#39;t be able to stop Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on, Saber. I had Kotomine investigate Gilgamesh. ...We already know his true identity, but everything else about him is a mystery, right?</p><p>Don&#39;t we need to know as much as we can about him now?</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That is true, but\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not mind either way. It might not be that useful.</p><p>...And it is not like I have no feelings.</p><p>I feel bad getting such rude pressure from the Servant of the man who shot me. As I am inexperienced, I might not be able to act as a priest should.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That goes the same for me as well. I will not trust an old enemy.&quot;</p><p>The two glare at each other.</p><p>...This isn&#39;t good, things won&#39;t get anywhere like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber, stay back. I&#39;m going to talk to Kotomine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou...!? No, this man is dangerous. If you are to talk with him, I will also...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I know how you feel, but I&#39;m a Master. I won&#39;t die that easily even if something happens, and you would come right away if something did, right? Nothing dangerous is going to happen.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. A human cannot outwit a Servant.</p><p>Emiya Shirou. It seems your Servant is an excessive worrier.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t provoke her too much.</p><p>I&#39;ll listen to you. I&#39;ll have Saber stay away, so that&#39;s enough, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I do not feel like talking here. There is no way to run if Saber attacks me.</p><p>...There should be a courtyard. I can at least run for a few seconds there even if Saber goes mad. You could stop her in that time with your Command Spell.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Fine. But that won&#39;t happen.</p><p>...Saber, stay by the porch. I&#39;ll call for you if something happens.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes, if you say so, Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. This place is good. This is an open space and I can see the mansion clearly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I move about two meters away.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to hear when he speaks softly, but I can react to anything this way no matter what he does.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So. What did you find out, Kotomine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hn? Oh, I would like to confirm one thing with you before that.&quot;</p><hr><p>A big smile, full of compassion.</p><p>The priest takes one slow step towards me.</p><p>&quot;I am sorry I was away this morning. Here, you forgot this.&quot;</p><p>A thump.</p><p>He throws something onto the grass.</p><p>&quot;...!! The sound of the boundary field...!?&quot;</p><p>The alarm goes off.</p><p>The boundary field Father put up, the alarm that reacts to intruders with malicious intent is going off...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer is the cause of the disturbance. He must have entered this place with some reason in mind.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t hear the priest&#39;s words too well.</p><p>The thing he threw at my feet.</p><p>I can&#39;t take my mind off of it since it looks like it can only be the corpse of a small child.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So Saber went to meet the enemy. He cannot fight with full power inside the building.

You can fight me in your style as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>She must have understood my intentions as she gladly accepts my idea.</p><p>...Yes.

It would certainly help you if we can find something Kiritsugu used to use.

The last surviving Master.&quot;</p><p>He smiles sarcastically and opens his arms to welcome me.</p><p>...This is the site of our battle.</p><p>This is the altar of the summoning in this Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Let Illya down. I&#39;ll beat you up after that.&quot;</p><p>I glare at Kotomine.</p><p>...There&#39;s about ten meters between us.</p><p>The fight will begin if I move another step.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of magus Kotomine is, but I assume he&#39;ll use some kind of projectile weapon like Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>In comparison, I can only punch him.</p><p>Even though I have the dagger Tohsaka gave me, it&#39;s useless unless I get near him.</p><p>...Once the fight starts, I&#39;ll have to run straight at him and stab his chest.</p><p>But first, I have to do something about Illya\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Didn&#39;t you hear me? I told you to let Illya down. What&#39;s so fun about torturing a kid?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand your feelings, but I cannot do that. The Holy Grail has appeared, but the void is yet unstable.</p><p>My wish will not come true unless she bears this until she dies.&quot;</p><p>Until she dies\u2015\u2015then Illya is still alive...!</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. If you have no intention of letting her down, I&#39;ll just have to use force.</p><p>I&#39;ll stop your wish\u2015\u2015that black mud, right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. So this must appear to be my wish to you. \u2015\u2015As expected from the son of Kiritsugu.</p><p>I did not expect two generations to make the same mistake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This mud is not of my making.</p><p>This is the power leaking out of the Holy Grail, the &#39;colorless power&#39; that should have been omnipotent.</p><p>No human power is able to stain it black.</p><p>This Holy Grail has been like this from the beginning. Once opened, it will flow out without end and cause a disaster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This is the true identity of the Holy Grail.</p><p>This thing is filled with every evil, something that curses everything in this world.</p><p>No one can control such a thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...What is he saying?</p><p>If that&#39;s true, then he became a Master not for a wish, but just to open this up...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. What&#39;s your wish?&quot;</p><p>I clench my teeth and glare at the black priest.</p><p>The man smiles.</p><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s see. If anything, it is for entertainment.&quot;</p><p>He makes a simple claim as if it&#39;s only natural.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh... at...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Do you not understand? Music, for example. Why do people find music fun, Emiya Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015w-well...&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about a book? Why do you think stories attract people?&quot;</p><p>Why\u2015\u2015I&#39;ve never thought about it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. You do not even need to think about it. Every entertainment exists to pleasure people. It is amusing because it was made by people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;All creation comes from within people. In short, the most entertaining things in the world are humans themselves. Bare humans are the best entertainment in the world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Compared to that, entertainment created by people is just secondary.</p><p>...Yes, music, stories, like, dislike, pity, belief, betrayal, morals, corruption, illusion, truth...! It is all just trash to be discarded.</p><p>Such things are mere second-rate trashy entertainment.</p><p>What I like to enjoy are people themselves. Such pointless things are not my taste.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;For that, we need to discard excess things such as their lives.</p><p>You heard of flashbacks, right? It is like that. People have value only at the moment of their deaths. Using their lifetime to gain momentum, they jump high to dazzle. That flicker is my wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is the answer to your question.</p><p>As you feed on peacefulness.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I live by feeding on this planet&#39;s light.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The priest offering a speech with his hands apart is abnormal.</p><p>I feel a chill, but not at his speech.</p><p>But at the priest himself because he looks like a holy being while he says he wants to enjoy humans.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, you\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, the fire ten years ago wasn&#39;t too bad. It was on a small scale, but it was filled with unusual excitement.</p><p>...These are the only things I wish for.</p><p>Such a hell contains an explosion of souls, the best flicker a man can give. You must have experienced that as well, Emiya Shirou.</p><p>See? People dying in regret must have touched your heart, did it not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t... talk shit.</p><p>That time...</p><p>That hell... can&#39;t be contained with just that one sentence.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand now? It is in a distorted fashion, but no one loves humans as much as I. Therefore, no one is more appropriate than myself to receive the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>The priest laughs in satisfaction.</p><p>As if...</p><p>As if he thinks that event where people died in vain is wonderful from the bottom of his heart\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh, I see.&quot;</p><p>I concentrate on my feet.</p><p>I put my powers into my legs, about to jump forward.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So, I can kill you...!&quot;</p><hr><p>I jump forward with all my might.</p><p>It&#39;s about ten meters to him. I&#39;ll go in straight at him and\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I jump sideways.</p><p>This is the result of my instincts of not wanting to die...</p><p>...Surpassing my desire to kill him.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I roll sideways onto the ground.</p><p>I stop instantly and look up.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I look at the place I was running over.</p><p>A sound of burning.</p><p>The burning sound is coming from the black mud, stretching out from the lake.</p><p>...It&#39;s like a black carpet.</p><p>The mud slashed like a whip, attacking me as I went after Kotomine, and left a mark on the ground.</p><hr><p>&quot;I forgot to tell you, but you are already within my range. And to add, this thing is sensitive to living beings.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I do not mind you moving, but you will die if you move carelessly.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I jump to avoid the black mud mercilessly attacking me.</p><p>Screw moving carelessly. He&#39;s ready to kill me...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015you fake priest...!&quot;</p><p>I stand up, still keeping watch over the lake.</p><p>...The distance to Kotomine hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p>That means this ten meters is as near as he wants me to get.</p><p>...But that tentacle of mud stretches without limit.</p><p>It will come after me if he wants it to, and I&#39;m sure there are more than one\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, so you are ready to fight. That pleases me.</p><p>I could not kill you if you were to run away, but there will be no problem if you attack me.</p><p>I serve God, so I cannot kill someone who is pleading for their life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Heh, don&#39;t lie. You can&#39;t say that after attacking someone from behind.&quot;</p><p>He must have remembered what happened with Lancer.</p><p>Kotomine laughs as if in admiration.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, yes. I hated you for that.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to put this off any longer.</p><hr><p>&quot;...To be honest, I had hopes for you, Emiya Shirou. I felt some sort of fate when Rin came to the church with you. You cannot know how happy I was when I found out that you were Kiritsugu&#39;s son and that you were like him on the inside as well.</p><p>The wish that did not come true ten years ago... I never expected that I would be able to get my revenge on Emiya Kiritsugu.&quot;</p><hr><p>...The tentacle whips out.</p><p>The quivering mud coming from the lake is like a black snake.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I bite my lip.</p><p>This is the worst situation as I thought.</p><p>The number of snakes continues to increase without end.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long I can survive, let alone how I can get close to him\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;It is only natural for you to be unable to win.</p><p>There is a large difference in the years we have lived. It is a difference you cannot overcome unless you have something major.&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest raises his hands.</p><p>He glares at the heavens as if he is conducting an orchestra.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Put your life on the line.</p><p>You might be able to reach me if you do so\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>He releases the black snakes.</p><hr><p>Sparks fly off.</p><p>The golden knight retreats from the blows which are full of the utmost spirit.</p><p>She must have seen it as an opening.</p><p>Saber dodges the swinging sword and moves deeper into the enemy&#39;s range\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Yaaaaaaaaaa\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>If the yell is a rip, the sword is like a comet.</p><p>It overwhelms the opponent and he hesitates. But she keeps attacking.</p><p>The sword keeps moving.</p><p>It has destroyed rocks and pierced through walls, but...</p><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Every blow is blocked by weapons appearing from behind him.</p><p>&quot;You persistent\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Escaping danger, the golden knight\u2015\u2015Gilgamesh has another sword in his hand.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>It is easy to repel that weapon.</p><p>But she cannot block it straight on.</p><p>All of the enemy&#39;s weapons have unknown abilities.</p><p>It would be suicidal to block it without knowing its ability.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015Haa\u2015\u2015Haa\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber jumps back out of range and catches her breath.</p><p>Gilgamesh raises himself unhurriedly.</p><hr><p>&quot;You do not give up, woman. Can you not tell it is futile?&quot;</p><p>Gilgamesh shows no fatigue.</p><p>For him, this battle is just entertainment.</p><p>There must be no fatigue or strain when he knows he is [wrap t\u0365xt=&quot;going&quot;]going to win.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015Haa\u2015\u2015Haa\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s different for Saber.</p><p>For her, this moment is her only chance of victory.</p><p>Before her enemy becomes serious.</p><p>She has to defeat Gilgamesh before he takes out Ea or she will be the one defeated.</p><hr><p>That is why she has continued to attack without a thought for saving her energy.</p><p>She has cornered the enemy like this more than a few times.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015she could never get past his wall of Noble Phantasms.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you still going to continue? It is good to be loyal to your master, but there should be a limit. That lowlife would have been killed by Kotomine by now. There should be no reason for you to fight now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...My master is still very much alive. Shirou will not be defeated by that Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It can only be a matter of time. You do not know the Holy Grail. Even I have trouble against it. That kid will not last even a minute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;You cannot beat me and that kid cannot beat Kotomine.</p><p>You have mistaken your roles. If you had gone after the Holy Grail, this battle would have been yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>The golden knight&#39;s eyes are not laughing.</p><p>He is serious.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But that is wrong.</p><p>For Saber, such a choice would be a mistake.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Nonsense. This is the correct decision. I will not lose to you, and Shirou will not lose to a corpse such as that.</p><p>You have fallen low to hope for a result that has yet to happen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh. It seems you still have energy to talk impudently.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015Space distorts.</p><p>The number of Noble Phantasms behind Gilgamesh increases.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It is coming.[l]</p><p>She grips her holy sword once again.</p><p>...Actually, there is a way.</p><p>There is only one, but there is a way to defeat that golden knight.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015But for that...[l]</p><p>It will not succeed unless several conditions are met.</p><hr><p>Even if she defeats Ea, he will be able to defend against her attack if he has energy left. And the method to defeat Ea will remain unknown until she takes a direct hit from it once more.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Take a hit from Ea...? No way. Even with the sheath, I would not be able to get up after being hit.[l]</p><p>But there is no other way to win.</p><p>It is a matter of how to grasp that slight chance.</p><hr><p>Usually, she selects the best choice by instinct and follows that view.</p><p>But right now, she cannot even feel it with her instincts.</p><p>Probably because the probability of victory is so low and the chance of a comeback is pretty much zero.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>But still, she must fight.</p><p>For Shirou who abandoned his protection to give her back her sheath\u2015\u2015</p><p>She cannot be defeated here by him.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. It seems you will not be convinced without a complete loss.&quot;</p><p>More weapons appear.</p><p>They move without Gilgamesh touching them and they aim at Saber.</p><p>The weapons, whose handles were only visible before, all show blades now and await their master&#39;s order.</p><hr><p>This is this knight&#39;s way of fighting.</p><p>From the beginning, Gilgamesh has never been a swordsman.</p><p>These Noble Phantasms are produced in the air and become bullets at their master&#39;s command.</p><p>That is why he is called Archer.</p><p>This Servant is an archer with the strongest arrows.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do your best to avoid them.</p><p>If you do well, you shall only be stabbed in the limbs!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>With one command, the godspeed rain of swords begins.</p><p>Each one has fatal power.</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>She eludes every one of them like a falling leaf\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>A sword from the front,</p><p>a spear from the left,</p><p>a polearm from below and above,</p><p>a three-edged sword arcing and attacking from behind,</p><p>a swing from a hammer bigger than she is\u2015\u2015!</p><p>She blocks, repels, dodges, and twists her body away from the last attack...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015a, ah\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Breathing hard, Saber recovers the stance she was driven out of.</p><p>\u2015\u2015In that instant.</p><p>She sees them behind her enemy.</p><p>Behind Gilgamesh.</p><p>The Noble Phantasms are already produced: 47 of them\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015guh...!&quot;</p><p>She jumps full force.</p><p>Many Noble Phantasms stab into the ground as not to let her escape.</p><hr><p>In the rain of Noble Phantasms, she is hit time after time.</p><p>Her armor is destroyed, her gauntlets pierced, and even the pieces covering her feet are pierced.</p><p>Saber manages to avoid a fatal wound even in this danger, but then sees the worst thing possible.</p><hr><p>On the other side of the rain of Noble Phantasms...</p><p>As if to finish off a fleeing enemy, Gilgamesh is pulling out his favorite sword\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Ea\u2015\u2015!</p><p>She stops her jump.</p><p>She lands right away and pours magical energy into her holy sword.</p><hr><p>But will it be in time?</p><p>Wind roars.

You are Kiritsugu&#39;s fake, so the debt Kiritsugu owes me from ten years ago shall be returned with your death.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...The skin with mud on it is burning.</p><p>It feels like acid is slowly seeping through the pores of my skin.</p><p>I grit my teeth, bear it, and check on my right ankle.</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s totally black.</p><p>I can&#39;t feel it nor can I move it at all.

I don&#39;t care about that, but\u2015\u2015why do you hate Kiritsugu so much? Was it so annoying to you that Kiritsugu destroyed the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is just hatred for a similar person. Kiritsugu and I were alike, so everything he did got on my nerves.

It must be so for you.</p><p>After all, he was a good enough person to let me go.</p><p>He defeated me, the cause of that disaster, but he did not take my life.</p><p>You should know that was a mistake.</p><p>If he had killed me, those orphans would have been able to lead a peaceful life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Y...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You should not be able to retort.

He let the one who cursed him go and as a result, died within a few years.</p><p>Believing that he had accomplished his goal and that the Holy Grail War had ended.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>Then, what?</p><p>Kiritsugu died because of this guy?</p><p>And that peaceful face he had on the night of his death was...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, let me ask you one last question.</p><p>What was Kiritsugu&#39;s last moment like? Did he give something to you as his son and pass away with satisfaction?</p><p>Ha, how foolish can he be.</p><p>He accomplished nothing and pushed the responsibility onto you. His passing must have been ridiculous...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015YOU\u2015\u2015!!!&quot;</p><p>I kick off the ground.</p><p>I drove magical energy into my right foot and moved it by force.</p><p>&quot;Gi\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I ignore my tearing muscles and run to him on all fours like a dog\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yes.</p><p>I would expect at least that much spirit.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine raises his hand toward the waterfall behind him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>What is he thinking?</p><p>That is a &#39;curse&#39; so strong that it&#39;s visible.</p><p>You could call it magical energy specialized for destroying people.</p><p>There is nothing you can do with it as it cannot be reshaped or anything.</p><hr><p>Anybody that touches that mud will be stained with a strong &quot;curse&quot; and will be melted as if digested.</p><p>In the process.</p><p>The pain and fear before death remain as magical energy and become the next &quot;curse&quot; to seek out living people.</p><hr><p>So, you die if you touch it.</p><p>Anyone who touches it will die unless they can get the mud out of their body.</p><p>...The priest stuck his hand in that waterfall of mud, but he doesn&#39;t stop smiling.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is your reward.

How can I be a hero if I cannot swallow a curse such as this?</p><p>All evils of the world? Heh, bring at least three times as much as that if you want to stain me.</p><p>See, Saber. A hero is someone who carries with them everything they see.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I am already carrying everything in this world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber gasps quietly at his words.</p><hr><p>...She will never be able to come to terms with this heroic spirit.</p><p>His arrogant thinking, his selfishness to consider himself the greatest, and his merciless nature that never thinks of others.</p><p>This is different from the path of the king she chose.

Do you dislike being treated roughly?</p><p>Then get used to it. I do not hold myself back on women or food.

Ridiculous. I cannot believe you gave him your body just because of the binds of the Command Spell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You are wrong. Do not misunderstand, Gilgamesh.</p><p>I do not obey anyone. My body has never had such freedom.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. Then you will not be mine no matter what?&quot;</p><p>His red eyes pierce Saber.</p><p>There&#39;s no human emotion.</p><p>He will kill if she disobeys.

Kotomine&#39;s objective was Illya. He must&#39;ve known from the beginning that she was the vessel of the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015Illya is the Holy Grail......!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...To be more accurate, her heart is. Magi are people with magecraft-Circuits, but Illya is a human made from a Magic Circuit.</p><p>I think she will become the vessel to summon the Holy Grail as soon as there is only one Servant left.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Then, Kotomine took Illya...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He took her. But... guh...! As long as Saber is still alive, the path won&#39;t open. Kotomine won&#39;t try to do anything to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can only hope so.</p><p>Lancer isn&#39;t an easy Servant to beat either.</p><p>He can&#39;t match Gilgamesh, but he might be able to at least run away.</p><p>...I can only hope so. But I can&#39;t tell Tohsaka about that right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll go save Illya, so you can depend on me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. Then, the second thing.</p><p>I think Kotomine&#39;s at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>That&#39;s the best place to summon the Holy Grail.</p><p>He&#39;ll be out of the church already, so he has to be hiding at that temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Okay. So Kotomine is at Ryuudou Temple, right?&quot;</p><p>...It must be hard for her even to move her neck now.</p><p>But Tohsaka gives a slight nod.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then this is the last thing. \u2015\u2015You won&#39;t be able to beat Kirei.

Lancer&#39;s Master has been identified?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, well... I found out, or more like I knew it....</p><p>Lancer&#39;s Master was a foreigner dispatched by the magecraft Association.

If you found their base, you should have told me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was going to. But it seemed strange from the outside. I went in thinking it was empty. All I found were traces of blood and a left arm with no Command Spell.</p><p>There was nothing else. I think the arm was cut off, but based on how much blood there was, I don&#39;t think the Master&#39;s alive. ...Lancer&#39;s Master is already dead.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015? Then Lancer does not exist anymore? They were defeated by another Servant after Shirou was attacked ten days ago?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I wish that&#39;s the case, but the bloodstains were older than that. Do you know what that means...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015The Servant was not killed, and the Master was killed first.</p><p>So a Master took the arm.... the Command Spell, and formed a contract with Lancer?</p><p>But\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou and I are the only remaining Masters, right? But Lancer still remains.</p><p>Then that means a magus who&#39;s not a Master became one after stealing the Command Spell... but is that even possible, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. The transfer of the Command Spell can only be between Masters and Servants. No matter how superior the magus, he cannot become a Master by stealing the Command Spell.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then, one more question. Is a Master still a Master if they have their Command Spell and their Servant, even after the Holy Grail disappears?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh... i-it is just as you say. As long as the Command Spell and the Servant remain, that magus retains the rights of a Master even after the Holy Grail War\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber realizes the meaning of Rin&#39;s question and swallows her words.</p><p>&quot;Then you think that... the one who killed Lancer&#39;s Master and formed a contract with Lancer is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. I can&#39;t think of anything else. In that case, Lancer&#39;s actions make sense.</p><p>He seemed like his role was to inspect other Servants, right? Usually, they expose their true identity when they fight, but he wasn&#39;t even hiding his.</p><p>So that must mean he was only there to collect information.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I feel the same way. He did not fight to the end even when he fought with me. Once they have used a Noble Phantasm, it should be a rule for the Servant to kill their enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. So Lancer&#39;s Master has another Servant. He collected information using Lancer and attacks with this other unknown Servant. It&#39;s a great strategy.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m sure it was a pain for Lancer. He had to fight six Servants, study their techniques, and return to his Master.</p><p>Fighting all six Servants to a draw... he&#39;s quite outrageous in a way.&quot;</p><hr><p>Rin grows quiet and ponders.</p><p>Did she follow suit?</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber feels a chill for no reason.</p><p>Lancer&#39;s Master has already been killed.</p><p>An unknown Master who uses a heroic spirit of that degree just to collect information.</p><hr><p>...And as the Master planned, the only Servants remaining are Lancer and Saber.</p><p>If the enemy is such a person, is it not dangerous to leave Shirou by himself even during daytime?</p><p>There were several enemies before.</p><p>But there are no other enemies now.</p><p>If they only have to defeat Shirou, the enemy might not follow their previous plan\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Rin. Do you know where Shirou would be?&quot;</p><p>Once she starts thinking like that, it will not stop.</p><p>She cannot leave Shirou alone.</p><p>Even now, Shirou might be in a danger.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Eh? ...Hmm, I don&#39;t know. I asked you because I didn&#39;t know, but he might be at Kirei&#39;s. He went off to talk to him before too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To that church\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? What&#39;s wrong, Saber? Do you have something against that church?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No. It is not that, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>That church is not a holy place.</p><p>It is stagnated with death to the same level as the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>The instant she regrets that Shirou might be there by himself...</p><p>A vision of some other place pops into her head.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015She glares into the distance.</p><p>She looks in one direction, towards Kotomine church on top of the hill.</p><p>There is no time.</p><p>Saber leaps out to the yard and jumps onto the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Hey, Saber! What are you doing...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I am going to the church. Please take care of this place, Rin.&quot;</p><p>Without even turning to Rin, she jumps off.</p><p>She runs like a bullet.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She reaches the place without stopping or slowing down.</p><p>If anybody saw her, it would have just looked like a sudden gust of wind.</p><p>The wind is clad in silver and blue armor.</p><p>Saber is armed as soon as she sees the enemy&#39;s territory.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She did not intend to arm herself.</p><p>She had decided to arm herself once she entered the church.</p><p>But she could not help it.</p><p>As soon as she saw the church, her mind burned up and made her arm herself.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Her chest is burning.</p><p>The nausea that has been assaulting her is not hers.</p><p>It is the chill coming from her Master, a hopeless scent of death.</p><p>She does not know what is going on.</p><p>The only sure thing is that Emiya Shirou is on the verge of death.</p><hr><p>And there is no time.</p><p>His wound could cause him to die at any second.</p><p>That pain and the chill going around her body cause a sickening nausea.</p><p>It is less than a thousandth of the pain Emiya Shirou is feeling.</p><p>But she still cannot stop her nausea.</p><p>Her Master is wounded that badly.</p><hr><p>...He will not live.</p><p>She will not make it even if she rushes with godspeed.</p><p>He is dying right now, and she might lose her Master in front of her eyes\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The instant she imagines that, her rationality vanishes.</p><p>She just has to rush to her master as fast as possible.</p><p>If godspeed is not fast enough, she just has to break through the reason of God.</p><p>And fortunately, this is God&#39;s house and her enemy is God&#39;s messenger.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her angry glare stares down the church.</p><p>She crashes through the door and enters the chapel.</p><p>She does not see the chairs.</p><p>She ignores the path, goes through the chapel, through the courtyard, and down the stairs leading underground.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015All that&#39;s left are the demolished walls and floor of the church.</p><p>Incidentally, she is not that violent.</p><p>She tried to open the door softly and did not put that much magical energy into her legs when she kicked off the ground.</p><p>She merely could not control them.</p><p>She goes down the stairs and reaches the underground temple.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015The sense of death is near.</p><p>Actually seeing it, her anger goes over the limit.</p><p>Anger toward herself and anger toward the enemy who did such a thing.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yo. I&#39;m sorry, but this is it, Saber.&quot;</p><p>She cannot even hear the voice of Lancer blocking her way.</p><p>She is straining at her limits, and it seems she cannot loosen up no matter what happens.</p><hr><p>Her master is down in the darkness.</p><p>In the back room.</p><p>In the middle of the room full of live corpses, he is on his stomach.</p><p>...Blood is pouring out of him, and his gasping can be heard even in this temple.</p><p>\u2015\u2015He is alive.</p><p>All the while she is relieved, she shakes from having left him for so long in that state.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber heads to the back room.</p><p>But there&#39;s a guard in front of it.</p><p>Holding his lance behind him, the blue spearman looks at Saber with fearless eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yo. I&#39;m sorry, but this is it, Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She does not hear his voice.</p><p>So she does not stop.</p><p>&quot;...! You! Ignoring me, huh...!?&quot;</p><p>It is as one would expect from him to block it while he was talking.</p><p>Lancer blocks Saber&#39;s surprise attack, but could not defeat its power as he retreats to the wall.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But that makes the hindrance go away.</p><p>There is no time to fight Lancer now.</p><p>She has to save her master who is on the verge of death.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh, is that kid that important to you?</p><p>I don&#39;t mind\u2015\u2015but in that case, you really can&#39;t leave me alone.&quot;</p><p>Saber stops at the entrance.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015What do you mean by that, Lancer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well. I&#39;m the one that stabbed him, but this is actually the second time I did it. He stayed alive the last time I did for some reason, so I &#39;pierced&#39; him for sure this time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015You used Gae Bolg on Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I didn&#39;t hit his heart. But the curse is still there.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Even you should know the curse of this lance. This is the &#39;lance of cause and effect&#39;, that reverses the cause and the effect. The one cursed by this thing cannot change their fate unless they have great luck.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;To put it simply, the wound made by the Gae Bolg cannot be healed.</p><p>The one cursed cannot heal and bears the wound until they die. \u2015\u2015As long as this lance exists.&quot;</p><hr><p>That changes the air.</p><p>Saber&#39;s eyes finally regain intelligence.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Ha. You finally understand? You want to save that kid, right? Then you&#39;ll have to settle your match with me first.&quot;</p><p>Lancer&#39;s beast-like killing intent comes at Saber.</p><p>It is true that Lancer is serious.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you insane, Lancer? A lancer would fight a swordsman in this small room? I cannot believe such a foolish idea would come from you.</p><p>...I shall let you go if you leave now. Leave that lance and disappear.</p><p>I do not want to slay you in such an undesirable battle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that a more foolish idea? What kind of heroic spirit would discard their partner?</p><p>I didn&#39;t pierce him to make some kind of a deal.</p><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;m here to fight you, Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>There is no dishonesty in his words.</p><p>Lancer does not intend to let either of them leave here alive.</p><p>For him, this is the first and last battle where he can go full strength.</p><hr><p>Lancer&#39;s wish is not for the Holy Grail.</p><p>He wishes only for battles appropriate to heroic spirits.</p><p>Such a simple wish that should have been easily granted to a normal Servant was never granted him until now.</p><p>Therefore\u2015\u2015he has no intention of losing out on what might be his last chance.</p><p>Even if it happens to be an unfavorable situation for him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right. Then I shall just slash away that lance along with you.&quot;</p><p>Saber readies her invisible sword and faces the blue knight.</p><p>&quot;Well said. To be honest, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re the one that&#39;s left, Saber...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer&#39;s lance runs like a flash of light.</p><p>Saber confronts it straight on.</p><p>The rematch begins with both of them executing powerful blows.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>&#39;It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015haa, haa, haa, ah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>All I can hear is my own breathing now.</p><p>I might have a fever that could burn someone to ashes, as it feels like my brain is already melting and pouring out of my ears.</p><hr><p>&#39;Stop stop stop stop&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015Haa, ah, haa, ha, ah\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Something&#39;s wrong.

Wake up, Emiya Shirou. Your Servant has arrived.&quot;</p><p>...I hear a voice.</p><p>It&#39;s coming from right behind me.</p><p>But I can&#39;t hear what it&#39;s saying.</p><hr><p>...My vision is blurry.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing in front of me.</p><p>All I sense are the voices asking for help and the figures that are already dead.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. He is doing well, but he cannot match Saber as I expected. I need one more Servant either way. I do not care whether that happens to be Saber or Lancer\u2015\u2015but I shall make a selection before that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t hear anything.</p><p>But this man&#39;s voice echoes in my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, it is time for your turn. Let us go, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015My head is lifted.</p><p>The man grabs my head and pulls me forward.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015That lets me feel the man behind me.</p><p>The man has swallowed black corruption.</p><p>His heart is black and it seems like he&#39;s surrounded by an unknown darkness.</p><p>The black corruption reaches in from the outside world, and it&#39;s like a chain binding the man.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it means.</p><p>Only one thing is clear.</p><p>This man\u2015\u2015Kotomine Kirei was just like me.</p><p>His body had some kind of fatal wound, and he is compensating for it with that unknown &quot;something&quot;.</p><p>As I heal using Saber&#39;s powers...</p><p>Kotomine Kirei is maintaining his corpse-like body with this black corruption\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;That is it, Saber. Lower your sword if you wish to save your master.&quot;</p><p>...What is going on?</p><p>My vision is still blurry and I cannot even raise my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;You too, Lancer. We are partners seeking the Holy Grail after all. We should not kill each other so recklessly. If Saber only came to pick this man up, I will gladly let her do so.&quot;</p><p>A gloomy laugh.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Do you think I would believe those words coming from one who has killed Lancer&#39;s Master and is about to kill my Master as well?&quot;</p><p>...Who is he talking to?</p><p>I can&#39;t hear the voice, but the sound rings through my fainting mind like a bell.</p><hr><p>&quot;Trust me. I do not wish to fight you. Things have turned out like this, but I will not interrupt you if you wish to seek the Holy Grail.</p><p>From the beginning, my role is to determine the possessor of the Holy Grail.</p><p>You two are more than qualified. Therefore, if you wish, I could give you the Holy Grail right here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015! Are you saying the Holy Grail is here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is here. The Holy Grail exists everywhere.</p><p>It is a shapeless vessel to begin with. Its completion depends on when, where, and what it is summoned in. This church is sufficient just to summon it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course, the Holy Grail is incomplete if there is more than one Servant remaining, but it should still be able to grant most wishes. If that is not sufficient for you, then you may continue fighting.</p><p>I do not want that, but I shall accompany you if you choose so. Is that fine with you, Lancer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...It&#39;s not. We don&#39;t need to go so far. We could decide the match right now if we wanted to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In this situation? You are at a disadvantage in this room and Saber would not be able to fight if she is concerned for her master. I do not think this would be a satisfying battle for you.&quot;</p><hr><p>A spitting sound.</p><p>It seems the man has reluctantly agreed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine, then let me ask you one thing. What is the Holy Grail?</p><p>Isn&#39;t it not meant to appear until there&#39;s only one of us left? Did the thing that summoned us trick us from the beginning?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it is true. The Holy Grail will not appear until there is only one Servant left.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015the vessel in which the Holy Grail will appear is a different story.</p><p>That is prepared with a shape from the start, and power flows into it until the Holy Grail is summoned.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Since only two Servants remain, it should begin to acquire power as the Holy Grail.</p><p>Is that not correct, Saber? You remained to the end in the previous war. You should understand what the &#39;Holy Grail&#39; summoned in this land is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, the Holy Grail is always here and waits to be filled with the blood of the sacrifices.</p><p>But do you not think that is sad? You do not need to wait until only one remains. It should be possible to grant your wishes right now.</p><p>So there is no meaning in killing each other right here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. Your opinion is certainly correct.</p><p>But then, who are you? Is your objective not to obtain the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I told you that I am the selector. If an appropriate person exists, I shall gladly give out the Holy Grail.</p><p>For that\u2015\u2015I wish to hear from you, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>My body moves.</p><p>My head is grabbed and my body is lifted.</p><p>It... hurts.</p><p>The wound in my chest opens up.</p><p>The pain makes my vision go white.</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not worry. I only wish to hear his answer.</p><p>The Holy Grail only answers those who wish for it. It must interest you whether your Master is appropriate for the Holy Grail or not.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That is useless. Shirou does not seek the Holy Grail.</p><p>My Master is not as lowly as you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, he said so at the start.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But that will not be his true opinion. As every man has his darkness, this man also has a dark side.</p><p>For instance, did this boy truly curse nothing on that day ten years ago? Is he not shaking it off by forgetting what lay ahead?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>What&#39;s he saying?</p><p>The fire ten years ago has nothing to do with this.</p><p>This is meaningless.</p><p>Nothing should come out of it.</p><hr><p>&quot;I will open your wound.</p><p>It is time for your confession, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>My back arches.</p><p>My mind reverses like electricity is running through it.</p><p>\u2015\u2015In place of my fading mind, a red vision appears.</p><hr><p>Stop.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>Stop. Stop. Stop.</p><p>Stop, stop, stop, stop, stopstopstopstopstopstopstopstop...!!!!</p><p>There&#39;s no meaning in this.</p><p>No one will be saved if I remember this now\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>Everybody died.</p><p>Everyone was dead.</p><p>I was the only one wandering through the fire.</p><p>The houses had burned down with burned up corpses under them, and sounds of crying came from all around.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&#39;It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts&#39;</p><hr><p>I walked alone.</p><p>I sought help and I wanted someone to save me, so I kept walking, not looking to the side.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop.</p><p>All the while.</p><p>How could I think that no one was asking for help from me, when I could still move?</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop.</p><hr><p>&#39;Help help help help&#39;</p><hr><p>Yeah, I noticed.</p><p>There&#39;s no way I couldn&#39;t have noticed...!</p><p>I walked though it all.</p><hr><p>I ignored the voices sobbing in pain.</p><p>I ignored the voices going mad trying to escape.</p><p>I ignored the screams of those not wanting to die.</p><p>I ignored the pleas of mothers wanting me to take their children.</p><hr><p>I even ignored the dying eyes that could not ask for help.</p><p>I kept walking, only seeking help for myself\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&#39;Wait wait wait wait&#39;</p><hr><p>I was tired of looking at corpses.</p><p>I was already tired of seeing people die in pain.</p><p>I thought I couldn&#39;t save them.</p><p>I thought they would die no matter what I did.</p><p>That&#39;s why I never stopped.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop.</p><hr><p>&#39;Give it back give it back give it back give it back&#39;</p><hr><p>I thought I had to live even a second longer because I had to go that far.</p><p>If there were people who died without being able to do anything,</p><p>As long as I could do something, I thought I had to live.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop.</p><hr><p>But my heart was almost crushed.</p><p>I held back my tears and walked on in search of an escape.</p><p>It was hard to live on while ignoring the pleas for help.</p><p>I knew...</p><p>It would be easier if I apologized, so I never apologized.</p><hr><p>I believed...</p><p>...That would be my only sincerity, as I could not do anything.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop.</p><hr><p>&#39;It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts&#39;</p><hr><p>...And as I wished, I alone was saved.</p><p>The only ones at the hospital were children unfortunate enough to be in areas near where the fire occurred.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to know about it, but the man in the white coat told me.</p><p>In that area.</p><p>I was the only survivor.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Stop already.</p><hr><p>I saw people dying in pain.</p><p>I saw just as many sad people.</p><p>Because there was a funeral for all those who died in a big

You must have intended to obtain the Holy Grail from the beginning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Nonsense, I came by it by chance. I killed Lancer&#39;s Master because outside magi are troublesome. I do not want outsiders to discover the true nature of the Holy Grail, so I had the Master leave at an early stage.

What are you going to do now, Kotomine? Are we settling the match with these nuisances here?</p><p>I don&#39;t think this is good directing on your part.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not say that. I was not expecting this either. I shall listen to your complaints later, so forgive me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, if you understand, it&#39;s fine.</p><p>But can you not do something about that vulgar man? I might kill him if he glares too much at me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015What the hell is this, Kotomine? That man is your Servant...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I did not explain it to you yet. He is my Servant from the previous war. We shared the same feelings after the last war ended.</p><p>Since he obeyed me and I prepared sufficient food for him to stay here, we ended up cooperating.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...So that&#39;s the reason for that disgusting room. Fine, but why didn&#39;t you tell me about it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you think there was a need to? Or did you want to cooperate with him on your mission?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No way. I&#39;d rather die than cooperate with that guy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>...Now, there are three.</p><p>Lancer is by the stairs, and Gilgamesh is standing in the temple.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no way we can win.</p><p>We can&#39;t even match Gilgamesh, and we can&#39;t even run away if Lancer&#39;s there as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine, you said you didn&#39;t know about him...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not doubt me. I am a priest. I cannot lie.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! That&#39;s not true! You said you couldn&#39;t ignore a Servant from the last war...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I was surprised as well. I ordered Archer to stay here, but he disobeyed and went to attack you.</p><p>It is only natural for you to discover me if you investigate Archer. Therefore, I had to come up with some sort of a plan. See? I did not lie to you at all.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>I-I&#39;m pissed...!</p><p>That guy tricked me and I came straight to the enemy&#39;s base...!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So, you are Archer&#39;s Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct. This is much like a repeat of ten years ago.</p><p>Well, I was unable to witness the final moment since Kiritsugu had already defeated me. This will be the second and the last time I shall see you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Answer me. Why does Archer still remain? What caused that fire? Why are you still alive even after being beaten by Kiritsugu...!?&quot;</p><p>Saber is angry as there&#39;s hatred in her voice.</p><p>A question long unanswered.</p><p>As if asking about the crime of the disaster ten years ago.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not even need to tell you.</p><p>Ten years ago\u2015\u2015the Holy Grail was incomplete but full, and it was possible to obtain it.</p><p>I merely touched it. You and Kiritsugu were powerful, so I wished for a diversion to separate you two. But I was surprised by the diversion that occurred.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>Could that be...?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Then you caused that fire with the power of the Holy Grail...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows? I think the Holy Grail would have done the same thing even if I was someone else. It is a thing of that nature. People call it an omnipotent vessel, but only blood, darkness, and curses fill it.</p><p>You saw it as well, right? The darkness that spilled out from it when you destroyed the Holy Grail. It only spilled onto Archer. Archer would not have lost his way if you had not destroyed the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Nonsense. The Holy Grail is a magical vessel that grants the wishes of its possessor. That fire must have been your wish...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Only the result. The process was not what I had in mind. I only wished for people to be gone from that place.</p><p>In any case, you lack imagination.</p><p>Your wishes will be granted? That is fine, but how will your wish be granted? Did you think the world would change the instant you wish?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not know about the original Holy Grail, but this Holy Grail is merely a vortex of power.</p><p>It cannot make precise calculations or correct any inconsistencies. It is only pure power.</p><p>It is like a great weapon. If the possessor wishes for great riches, it will kill everything around it to bring happiness to its possessor.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand? That magical vessel is a defective item that can only grant the wishes of its possessor through a method called &#39;destruction&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015that is not what was promised...!</p><p>Is the Holy Grail not something that will grant any wish to its possessor...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is. The measures the Holy Grail takes are very reasonable.</p><p>Letting one person survive means killing another.</p><p>This world is one of equal exchanges. Wishing for some special event means feeding on something to make it possible.</p><p>Wishes will not come true if you worry about harmony.</p><p>It is merely a fluctuation dependant on the plundering of the weak. It is the most efficient fluctuation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I can understand Saber&#39;s surprise.</p><p>If Kotomine is telling the truth, this Holy Grail is far from the Holy Grail she wished for.</p><hr><p>A power that only grants the wish of its possessor.</p><p>The usurper that grants the wish of its possessor at the cost of everything else.</p><p>This is the true identity of the omnipotent power given to the Master and the Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then\u2015\u2015the Holy Grail is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;A poisoned vessel that eliminates everything but its possessor.</p><p>You will know when you see it. It is a true curse.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015And that delights me.</p><p>Touching the Holy Grail is a dream for a man of the church. But this Holy Grail exists to kill everything, and to be able to control that\u2015\u2015it is like a dream.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying that, the priest laughs.</p><p>It&#39;s not a polite laugh like before.</p><p>A laugh from the bottom of his heart... a holy laugh without any evil.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That laugh forces me to realize.</p><p>This man is not human.</p><p>I cannot let him have the Holy Grail over anyone.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Then, this is goodbye.</p><p>Take care of this trash. Lancer, take the boy. Archer, take Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>The priest turns his back and goes up the stairs.</p><p>...The only ones left are me, and the two Servants.</p><p>And Saber, standing as if to guard me, glaring at her enemies.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Time passes.</p><p>We have to defeat Lancer and Gilgamesh to escape outside.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible to beat them.</p><p>We have to do something and regroup, but\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou&quot;</p><p>Saber mutters while looking at the enemy.</p><p>&quot;I know I am asking for something impossible, but please stay beside me.&quot;</p><p>She grasps my hand firmly.</p><p>\u2015\u2015That tells me she&#39;s ready.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right. I&#39;ll do my best to follow you, so don&#39;t worry about me.&quot;</p><p>I nod to her.</p><p>...I can barely walk right now.</p><p>Saber and I both know that.</p><p>With that in mind\u2015\u2015Saber has told me she will break through this.</p><p>So what can I do but nod?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. I trust you.&quot;</p><p>She replies in a small voice.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Now\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Letting go of my hand, Saber runs to the temple.</p><hr><p>The two figures react to her movement.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>Only Saber and I are surprised.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015What happened?</p><p>Lancer&#39;s lance that should have attacked me goes for Gilgamesh.</p><p>Gilgamesh&#39;s longsword repels Lancer&#39;s lance as if expecting it\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, I missed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Your lance must be pretty light.&quot;</p><p>The two separate without any sign of hostility.</p><hr><p>&quot;Your target is that lowlife. You do remember that I&#39;m in charge of Saber, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that. Sorry, but I changed my mind. He didn&#39;t order me with the Command Spell, so I&#39;m not gonna obey him.&quot;</p><p>Saying so.</p><p>Lancer faces Gilgamesh as if protecting us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015Lancer, you are...&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it&#39;s something stupid, don&#39;t say it. I&#39;m not helping you or anything. I&#39;m just following my beliefs.&quot;</p><p>Lancer points his lance at Gilgamesh.</p><p>He really intends to let us go.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I was at my limit too. I&#39;m not nice enough to listen to his orders when he looks down on me this much. I&#39;m cutting my ties with Kotomine right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015you are breaking your contract with him? So you do not mind being eliminated now, even though the Holy Grail is right in front of you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t treat me like you. I&#39;ve never had any interest in a second life. ...No, no hero is interested in such a thing.</p><p>We&#39;re not attached to this world. We&#39;re just attached to the oaths we couldn&#39;t fulfill.</p><p>Well, I guess a greedy apparition like you wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. A man with a brilliant death has something different to say. So this betrayal is a result of your heroic pride as well, huh?</p><p>Geez, following your beliefs sure is hard, Lancer.&quot;</p><p>...The air behind him distorts.</p><p>Weapons appear in empty space\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Lancer. He has all the original Noble Phantasms. He is the king of heroes with the longest history. Even you cannot take him on head to head\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Damn, I see. No wonder he&#39;s so conceited. He&#39;s the guy who destroyed his own country by just doing whatever he wanted, so of course he&#39;s twisted.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer, this is no time to be bluffing\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just get lost. Who are you to give me advice? Don&#39;t think I&#39;m on your side just because I protected you.</p><p>...Geez. This is why I don&#39;t like well-mannered knights.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer urges Saber to run.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber hangs her head for a second.</p><p>&quot;...Good luck. I shall return this favor.&quot;</p><p>Taking my hand, she runs to the stairs.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Damn, I let them go.&quot;</p><p>Gilgamesh just watches us go, not trying to follow us.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh? So Saber wasn&#39;t your target?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, to be honest, such a match did not suit my taste. If you had not done this, I would have done the same thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>We go up the stairs.</p><p>...She must be worried about me as we aren&#39;t going up that fast.</p><p>Ignoring our slow pace, the confrontation underground escalates without limit.</p><p>The murderous intent continues to grow.</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you mean by that? Did you intend to let Saber go as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I had no intention to kill Saber. That thing is mine.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015I cannot stay idle if [wrap \u02B9ext=&quot;I&quot;]I want the Holy Grail.</p><p>I need just one more Servant to die for the ritual to be completed.&quot;</p><hr><p>A thousand swords appear.</p><p>The golden knight grins.</p><p>That&#39;s why he was able to block Lancer&#39;s surprise attack.</p><p>Lancer wasn&#39;t the only one trying to launch a surprise attack on his ally.</p><hr><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015so this was your plan all along.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told you. I would have done the same thing if you had not done so.</p><p>You deserve praise, Cu Chulainn. This situation is ideal for me.&quot;</p><p>The distance between the two decreases.</p><p>Before I see them clash, we leave that place.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-22" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 22</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><p>I stop.</p><p>My body tells me I&#39;m at my limit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let us rest here, Shirou. You cannot continue in your condition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Ye... ah. I&#39;m just... causing you trouble... like this...&quot;</p><p>I move away from Saber and sit down on the grass.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The wound on my chest is still there.</p><p>It&#39;s stopped bleeding, but the hole is still there.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I feel sick...&quot;</p><p>Even though the pain is gone, I have a hole in my body.</p><p>Just looking at it makes me sick and I wonder why I&#39;m alive like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, let me look at your wound.&quot;</p><p>Saber crouches and looks into my chest.</p><p>...It&#39;s a bit embarrassing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015no, it&#39;s all right...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excuse me\u2015\u2015this will hurt a bit, but please bear it.&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s finger runs across my chest.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but she places her hand over my wound and digs into it\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Agh\u2015\u2015!! \u2015\u2015!!&quot;</p><p>My body jumps.</p><p>Saber&#39;s hand mercilessly digs into me and\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;You, wha\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s digging into me with her bare hands.</p><p>It should hurt.</p><p>It should hurt, but\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no pain.</p><p>Rather, pain seems to disappear around the places Saber touches.</p><hr><p>&quot;I am done, Shirou. I restored magical energy to the sheath, so your wound should heal in half a day.&quot;</p><p>Taking her hand off my chest, Saber looks relieved.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sheath\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t understand at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. What do you mean by sheath? I think you mentioned it before, but could it be your sheath?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s sheath.</p><p>The sheath of the sword Excalibur.</p><p>The sheath of her sword is not Invisible Air.</p><p>In the legend, the sheath of Excalibur was a Noble Phantasm that makes its possessor immortal.</p><hr><p>But she shouldn&#39;t have that.</p><p>King Arthur died in the battle of Camlann because that sheath was lost.</p><p>Saber shouldn&#39;t have the sheath right now\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. My sheath is inside your body. It was my fault for not realizing that fact until last night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In my body...? What&#39;s that supposed to mean? I don&#39;t remember anything like that. It&#39;s just ridiculous.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that so? It was simple from the beginning. You summoned me, Shirou. It was foolish of me to think it was by chance that I was summoned.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;To summon a heroic spirit, one needs a symbol connected with that spirit. Since you are inexperienced as a magus and uneducated as a Master, you needed a connection that would overcome all those deficiencies.</p><p>That was my sheath\u2015\u2015the lost sheath of Excalibur.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015well, that may be true...</p><p>But why would it be in my body?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kiritsugu probably put it in there.</p><p>Emiya Kiritsugu used the sheath of Excalibur as the catalyst to summon me in the last war. The sheath is a Noble Phantasm that heals the possessor&#39;s wounds. He must have thought that it would be more useful for him to keep it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I have healing powers and I do not die easily.</p><p>If the Master, who dies easily, has the sheath, they have a better chance of surviving the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then, Father survived the war because he was like me...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Probably. And after the battle and after I disappeared.</p><p>Kiritsugu wandered through the burned field and found a dying child. He had no healing powers, and even if he did, I assume it was too late.</p><p>...So I believe there was only one way for him to save that child.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I unconsciously place my hand on my chest.</p><p>...On that day ten years ago...</p><p>I accepted death, looking up at the sky.</p><p>My whole body was burned, and maybe it really was burned to ashes.</p><hr><p>When Kiritsugu found a kid barely alive, he had to rely on what he had on hand.</p><p>The sheath of the holy sword that protects the life of its possessor.</p><p>He must have saved that dying life by implanting the sheath.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then, it really is...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. It has been disassembled and lacks its original form, but your body certainly contains the sheath. It is the cause of your healing powers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015B-But I almost died once. I was pierced by Lancer at school and\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>Someone saved me at that time.</p><p>When I came to, there was no one there and all I found was a rock.</p><p>I took the rock home because I thought it was something important, but is it still at my house right now...?</p><hr><p>&quot;That was before we made a contract, correct?</p><p>The sheath is my Noble Phantasm. It does not exhibit its power as a Noble Phantasm until magical energy is channeled into it. You cannot obtain your immortality unless you make a contract with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I am sure it will protect the possessor&#39;s life if any magical energy is in it, but it will be weak. I am sure fusing with the sheath was the only way to save a dying person.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Um... I&#39;m sorry Saber. Your sheath was used for something like this....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Please do not say such a thing. You are my Master, so it is only natural for you to use what is mine.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015I was happy when I learned about it. Even though I could not save anybody, I had saved your life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Her smile is so brilliant that I have to look away.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou? Does your wound hurt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not it! Just don&#39;t worry about it. There&#39;s nothing wrong with you!&quot;</p><p>I hide my blushing face and shut my mouth.</p><p>There&#39;s no pain if I don&#39;t speak, but this is really awkward.</p><hr><p>...I wonder how long we&#39;ve been like this?</p><p>Just as I start to calm down.</p><p>Saber quietly says,</p><p>&quot;Kiritsugu was correct. He did not betray me.&quot;</p><p>She says so as if regretting her past.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That Holy Grail was not what I sought. ...No, I did not need the Holy Grail to begin with. Kiritsugu must have known that.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Her murmur sounds more like a confession.</p><p>Saber apologizes to a person she cannot apologize to anymore.</p><p>And she looks at me to part with the wish she held for so long.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>My heart understands just by being beside her.</p><hr><p>...Arturia sought the Holy Grail.</p><p>A lonely king who needed to believe that ruin was avoidable with the Holy Grail.</p><p>\u2015\u2015If.</p><p>A girl who wished for what would happen if she could redo the selection.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I knew it. I knew I could not redo things.</p><p>I knew it, but I still continued to deceive myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>...But this is the end.</p><p>Her long battle will finally end\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Thank you, Shirou. I finally understand the path I need to take.</p><p>...Yes. The Holy Grail and I are just dreams that must not exist.&quot;</p><hr><p>She murmurs that she would still like to be forgiven.</p><p>It was a mistaken wish, days that were not to be wished for, but...</p><p>The weakness was just a passing dream a girl saw.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>What should I feel, listening to her?</p><p>Saber&#39;s answer is beautiful.</p><p>A decision full of dignity and purity just like her.</p><p>She is proud of her past and has accepted the end that awaits her.</p><p>\u2015\u2015And now.</p><p>Saber has decided to follow her oath until the very end.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even need to tell me what that means.</p><p>She will not hesitate any longer.</p><p>And I find that beautiful.</p><p>A dark night. From the moment I was captivated by her figure in the moonlight\u2015\u2015I have loved her.</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>Regardless of what awaits ahead, there is only one thing to be done.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Saber. Let&#39;s destroy the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>I say so, throwing aside my attachment and my selfishness.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yes. I believed that you would come to that conclusion, Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber nods in response.</p><p>...I can&#39;t smile back at her.</p><p>It takes all I have to suppress my heart, telling me I don&#39;t want this.</p><p>But still\u2015\u2015there will surely come a day when I can be proud of being trusted like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I get up.</p><p>Now that I&#39;ve decided, there&#39;s no time to rest.</p><p>It&#39;s clear what must be done, and the enemy is clear as well.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no time to stop.</p><p>Today.

The affection score should&#39;ve been met if you&#39;ve been playing normally!</p><p>If you are going to restart, it is best to restart from around day 7!</p><p>You will pass the requirements by day 8 at the earliest!</p><p>Hmmm, but you get to meet me if you go outside on day 8. If you stay in the house, one Saber affection point will be added, but I guess you won&#39;t need it if you&#39;re playing properly.</p><p>That is all!</p><p>\u2015\u2015Oh, this feels so good!</p><p>I finally fulfilled my reason to exist!</p><p>Yes, I can finally be proud of myself...!</p><p>...Oh.</p><p>But Taiga. Most people passed the Saber affection score check, right?</p><p>Yeah. Shirou isn&#39;t the type to ignore Saber-chan.</p><p>You normally wouldn&#39;t end up like this.</p><p>...Taiga. Um, it&#39;s really hard to say this. But if it&#39;s that rare, wouldn&#39;t that mean not many people would come to this dojo...?</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I-It&#39;s probably all right.</p><p>The skip function and the Tiger Stamps are intended just for this.</p><p>Everyone will probably desperately play in strange ways to get to this dojo.</p><p>...Yeah. By that point, everyone will hate this bad end with its weird conditions.</p><p>So in other words, your dojo that tries to make everyone happy is actually something that troubles players trying to fully complete the game.</p><p>I-Identity crisis!</p><p>...!? Man, explosion endings are the worst...!</p><hr><h2 id="scene-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-25" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 25</h2><p>Not having a weapon when it&#39;s needed.</p><p>This is the place to help such people, the Tiger Dojo.</p><p>Well. It is the prevailing view that the outcome of battle is decided before it even starts.</p><p>What does it mean, student!?</p><p>Um, I guess you shouldn&#39;t start a fight until you have a weapon or a plan?</p><p>Yes! The enemy is the unfair Servant that prepared the strongest force with his money. So you should at least prepare one weapon that lets you turn things around.</p><p>Then Taiga, are you saying you should restart from the night before the fight and prepare a new weapon?</p><p>What can you do in such a short time?</p><p>You can do this!</p><p>Saber-chan originally had three Noble Phantasms. You should be able to do something if you prepare the last one.</p><p>I see. You just have to give it back to her, right?</p><p>Yup. Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar&#39;s.</p><p>It&#39;s something too valuable to lose, but you have to give back what you found.</p><p>Oh, you said something good, by your standards.</p><p>I guess you&#39;re a school teacher even if you&#39;re a bad one at that.</p><p>Ahahahaha! Praise me, praise me!</p><p>Yeah, yeah. Then while Taiga is in a good mood, we will make a major announcement.</p><p>This corner has continued modestly as a side to the main story, but this is the final episode!</p><p>We will use a different outlook and start &quot;Tiger Dojo Part II: Taiga One Hundred Million Yen Debt&quot;!!</p><p>We&#39;re going to move the setting to my castle and update our standing pics, music, and even hardware!</p><p>Production budgets will double and it will be so rich that you won&#39;t even think this is a bonus corner!</p><p>Gahahaha, so many wonderful things!</p><p>I don&#39;t quite understand, but is it like getting a totally new graphic designer!?</p><p>That&#39;s right, master! We will be freed from this rough art! Osu!</p><p>Marvelous! In that case, let us get away from this dojo right away!</p><p>Listen, everyone. The key to the second route is on the third day!</p><p>Once you see an ending, there should be a choice that wasn&#39;t there before on the third night.</p><p>Then hit, hit, hit!</p><p>Use whatever you can including your Command Spell to stop the raging lion!</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>Then everyone, I&#39;ll be waiting for you in the renewed Tiger Dojo!</p>', 4434);
