The historical Musashi Miyamoto was a devout of Tenman Dai-Jizai Tenjin, and he can be considered his guardian deity.</p><p>Tenman Dai-Jizai Tenjin is the name given to the heavenly god of the Dazai Prefecture\u2019s Tenmanguu Shrine; in other words, the amalgamation of the thunder god and Japan\u2019s most prominent vengeful spirit Sugawara-no-Michizane and Dai-Jizai Ten Mahesvara (also known as Shiva, the Hindu God of Destruction).</p><p>Additionally, Dai-Jizai Ten is also considered an avatar of Guanyin.</p><p>In reality, before Sugawara-no-Michizane started to be worshipped as the heavenly god of scholarship at the end of the Heian Era, he had already been conferred the divine name of Tenman Dai-Jizai Tenjin, so, putting it bluntly, Tenman Dai-Jizai Tenjin is Sugawara-no-Michizane\u2019s aspect as a wrathful god traced over to Shiva.</p><p>It is speculated that the reason Musashi chose the thunder god as the object of his devotion is because most kenjutsu practitioners before him and their schools were devout to the Kashima Shrine, and the god Takemizuchi worshipped there was said to be the thunder god\u2019s ancestor.</p><p>Takemizuchi, the god of thunder-turned-god of kenjutsu.</p><p>In response to that, since Musashi chose to perfect himself on \u201Cthe art of the sword\u201D instead of \u201Cthe technique of the sword\u201D, he did not devote himself to the same god of thunder or kenjutsu, but to Tenman Dai-Jizai Tenjin, who also has an aspect as the god of scholarship. Or so it is speculated.</p><p>Additionally, at the time (and even now), Dai-Jizai Ten was often confused with Ishana Ten, the king of a place named Take-Jizai Ten, due to their similar names.</p><p>Ishana Ten is considered to be on the same god as Izanagi, the ancestor god of Japan. And, due to how its name is pronounced, he is associated with Shana-ou (Minamoto no Yoshitsune). Since Yoshitsune was, even at the time, considered the originator of the samurais\u2019 militarization, Ishana is implied to be connected to both Japan and the origin of samurais.</p><h1 id="kai-no-bokutou-oar-wooden-sword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kai-no-bokutou-oar-wooden-sword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Kai no Bokutou (Oar Wooden Sword)</h1><ul><li>Rank: C+++</li><li>Type: Anti-Unit</li><li>Range: 3-10</li><li>Max.

Many stories write about his anecdotes and he is probably the man who most strongly embodies the image westerns have of samurais.</p><p>However, most of the anecdotes from his 10 years of fighting have their circumstances shrouded in mystery and are highly suspected to be fictional.</p><p>Also, the difference between some of these anecdotes is so big, it is hard to believe they were all the same person. The divergence in his personality between them is especially extreme.</p><p>The only point that they pretty much all have in common is that he was quite the thug in his younger years, and then started reflecting and trying to calm down as much as possible with the years.</p><p>He was born in Ohara Town, Sakushuu Province (currently Mimasaka City, Okayama Prefecture).</p><p>In 1584, his father served the lords of the Takeyama Castle (the Shinmen family) as a martial arts instructor and received his lords\u2019 family name, becoming Munisai Shinmen.</p><p>Munisai Shinmen built a jittejutsu dojo in Miyamoto Village, Yoshino District. Since this place was Musashi\u2019s hometown, he took Miyamoto as his family name.</p><p>Munisai was quite well-paid for a martial arts instructor, but lost his job before Musashi could grow, and as result, he had a poor childhood.</p><p>It is said that since he was a child, he was abnormally big, and was nicknamed \u201CBountiful Boy\u201D (Hounen Warabe) for it.</p><p>They said he was so big because he was born in a year the harvest was bountiful.</p><p>His strength was proportional to his size, and he never lost a fight since his childhood. According to his father, Munisai Shinmen, his martial arts training was the true source of Musashi\u2019s strength.</p><p>At age 13, he was already strong enough to put adults to shame. He challenged Kihei Arima, a warrior-in-training from a village nearby, and killed him in the fight.</p><p>Later, at age 17, when Musashi was full of ambition, he and his village friend Matahachi joined the Battle of Sekigahara as members of the Western Army. He experienced a brutal defeat. After losing the war, he fled back to his village perplexed, was condemned for the underlying crime of belonging to the defeated army, and had the bitter experience of being arrested for 3 years. But there, he met High Priest Takuan and his friend Terumasa Ikeda, who caused Musashi\u2019s change from a beastly murderous scoundrel to a respectable warrior.</p><p>Afterwards, Musashi travelled all over the country, met powerful enemies like the Yoshioka household from the capital, the Houzouin from Nara, and the Yagyuu clan, and kept maturing from his interactions with them. Before long, Musashi embraces the decision of pursuing \u201Cthe art of the sword\u201D instead of \u201Cthe techniques of the sword\u201D.</p><p>However, this form of maturing was fleeting as dew if compared to the cruelty of the world.</p><p>People die if they do not eat, and they can get sick if hit by the rain.</p><p>Musashi was still too young to reach an unfeeling mental state while still living.</p><p>Pushed by the multiple intertwinings in their fates, the people\u2019s expectations, and his own high fame as a warrior, Musashi challenges Ganryuu\u2019s Kojirou Sasaki to a battle.</p><p>This fight was definitely not a long one, but it was a fierce clash between their martial skills and their humanities. Musashi got a hard-fought victory, but commented \u201CI\u2019m not sure whether or not I can really find another enemy like you in my life\u201D on Kojirou.</p><p>The texts said \u201CKojirou believed in the sword of power and technique, while Musashi believed in the sword of the spirit. That was the only difference between them.\u201D Their clash was truly the battle between \u201Cthe technique of the sword\u201D vs. \u201Cthe art of the sword\u201D.</p><p>There are no records of how Musashi lived after that fight.</p><p>The only clue he left was \u201CThe crash of the waves is constant in the world. (\u2026) Someone will know. About the heart two meters under the water. About the water\u2019s depth.\u201D</p><p>After numerous battles, Musashi looked back at the 30 years of his life and reached the realization that him excelling at his martial arts was not the only reason for him to continuously win all his battles so far.</p><p>In a sense, you could say that after 30 years, Musashi finally faced the path of martial arts.</p><p>Additionally, it is said that Musashi only finally felt like he learned the path of martial arts at the age 50.</p><h1 id="book-of-five-rings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#book-of-five-rings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Book of Five Rings:</h1><p>Before dying, Musashi wrote a book about the mental state he reached during his lifetime and the techniques he cultivated.</p><p>The book was split into 5 volumes titled Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Void.

Musashi has a vague idea what this will lead her to at the end, but she did not let that bring her down and made her journey to achieve the first and the last goal given to her, the \u201Cmental Zero\u201D.</p><p>After her encounter with Chaldea, she learned about the historical Musashi Miyamoto and started called herself \u201CGirl Musashi\u201D due to acknowledging that she is \u201Cnot someone from the correct history\u201D.</p><p>Also, in a less relevant note, udon is pretty much Girl Musashi\u2019s favorite food, so becoming a drifter made her realize how different udon is from region to region/from country to country. She has been making a secret lifework of trying the different udons from everywhere she goes.</p><p>#Musashi\u2019s Favorite Swords:</p><p>Records state Musashi had numerous favorite swords.</p><p>Inscriptionless Kinjuu: A tachi from the Nanbokuchou Period, which had its inscription erased by scratches.</p><p>It was the sword used to slay hundreds of Yoshioka retainers in the battle against the Yoshioka household, along with the 85cm straight sword Ryoukai.</p><p>Izumi-no-kami Fujiwara Kaneshige and Kazusa-no-suke Kaneshige: Swords said to be made by Musashi himself.</p><p>Those aside, there are also records for swords named Musashi Masamune and Yamatokokujuu Kunimune.</p><p>Girl Musashi did not have any of these named swords, but, just like her historical counterpart, she also possessed multiple katanas.</p><p>Her reason was simply \u201CThe more weapons the better, right?\u201D</p><p>As such, when she sees a Heroic Spirit with many weapons (like, say, Gilgamesh), she groans in jealousy, despite the fact that Musashi would not want to carry more than 5 katanas.</p><p>(The 5th katana is her Noble Phantasm, the Sword of Void. She only carries up to 4 katanas in her belt.)</p><p>Girl Musashi is one who quickly acknowledges, \u201CIf I break 5 swords before finishing them off, then they\u2019re not an opponent I can beat\u201D, then runs away if she can or graciously accepts her death if she cannot.</p><h1 id="niten-ichi-ryuu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#niten-ichi-ryuu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Niten Ichi-ryuu:</h1><p>Contrary to popular belief, the Niten Ichi-ryuu is not just kenjutsu with 2 swords. (Niten Ichi-ryuu\u2019s two-sworded kenjutsu was not even perfected during Musashi\u2019s lifetime; its techniques were perfected by the efforts of his future apprentices.)</p><p>According to the notes Musashi left in the Book of Five Rings, taking the text literally, the Niten Ichi-ryuu is stronger in its disciplinary methods and mental preparation aspects than in its practical kenjutsu.</p><p>If one were to ask what is the Niten Ichi-ryuu, the answer would be none other than Musashi Miyamoto himself.</p><p>The father called himself \u201CMunisai\u201D (with the \u201CMuni\u201D part meaning \u201Cno two of\u201D), so the son coined the term Niten Ichi (meaning \u201Ctwo heavens into one\u201D), containing a direct antithesis and a roundabout agreement to his father.</p><p>Musashi put high emphasis on the Buddhist concept of \u201CVoid\u201D.</p><p>Void is nihil, emptiness, and 0.</p><p>The concept of \u201C \u201D. The very concept that \u201Cthe \u2018nothing\u2019 exists\u201D is 0, and is void.</p><p>It other words, beyond the \u201C1\u201D, to which there is \u201Cno two of\u201D, there is 0.</p><p>The path to reach it is none other than the Niten Ichi-ryuu. Through the sword, one can reach the understanding necessary to embody the \u201CVoid\u201D\u2026 Zen and the Sword As One is, without a doubt, exactly what Musashi aimed for.</p><p>However, the concept of \u201CVoid\u201D is remarkably difficult to understand. Even 2000 years after its discovery, humanity still has not fully comprehended it.</p><p>(It actually has not been much more than 300 years since humanity managed to perfectly understand the number 0.)</p><p>Therefore, when people talk about the \u201CVoid\u201D, even many Zen priests will strongly deny that it is \u201Csomething that already exists\u201D.</p><p>One takes the concepts, objects and phenomena in front of them and keeps completely shredding them up, scraping them off and erasing their existence as much as possible.</p><p>Then, after one scraped off something\u2019s existence to the extremes, to the point one could say it no longer has any, \u201Csomething\u201D still remains. That is what they believe to be \u201CVoid\u201D.</p><p>(Pursuing the concept of Void also requires \u201Cconfrontation\u201D aside from just \u201Cdenial\u201D, but we will omit that part.)</p><p>Also, Musashi believes \u201CAn art\u2019s path runs and crosses through all arts\u201D, so by learning the essentials of the sword, he learned the essentials of painting and sculpting. Conversely, this also means that in order to comprehend the essentials of the sword more deeply, he needed to get involved with painting and sculpting.</p><p>To become Zero, one must master all. That was the path the Niten Ichi-ryuu strived for.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Kojirou Sasaki:</strong></p><p>When we faced off against each other, he told me he had no name but oh, so this person is Kojirou Sasaki!</p><p>He looks as dandy as the rumors said, but, hmm, this sir looks like he doesn\u2019t care about anything besides the sword!

As the person who designed her, it\u2019s not my place to say this, but I\u2019m glad she turned out to be a cute and attractive character in more than just appearance. I\u2019m very glad she turned out to be a character I want to stay with me forever. Including the Niou in her Noble Phantasm, this was a job where I had a lot I needed to design.
