In any case...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> She probably cannot stand the fact that her existence is based and depends on Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> To Jeanne Alter, even if her existence is like an ephemeral dream, a mere bubble... No, perhaps it is BECAUSE she knows how fragile her existence is...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> She attempts to use her own strength alone to keep afloat, so to speak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am at a loss for words.

You won.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> That was a good move, but not good enough...<br> Ah, I won. Black Jack.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s too bad, Senpai...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re pretty good at this, that&#39;s some skill you got there. You got a future, kid.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Anyway, what are we playing next? You might be quick with your hands, but I won&#39;t lose a bet! The night&#39;s is still young and\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa, we got a rare guest here...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I was wondering where all the noise was coming from. Just a bunch of morons addicted to gambling, I see.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Everyone needs a bit of entertainment from time to time. Wouldn&#39;t you say so, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. We&#39;ve been fixing minor Singularities nonstop lately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Jeanne?<br> If there&#39;s anything I can do, I will be glad to help you...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not Jeanne.<br> Don&#39;t lump me in with that stupid saint.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really!? Oh... Um...<br> In that case, Dark Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Wrong again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I am a part of Jeanne d&#39;Arc that broke off from her.<br> I&#39;m my own, original being.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You may call me Jeanne Alter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter, wanna join us?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t want to.<br> People CHEAT at cards, right!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I know exactly what sort of thing goes on in card games! Yes, I do!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hey, that&#39;s kinda prejudicial of you.<br> Not that you&#39;re wrong though, generally speaking...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> So you WERE playing dirty.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> No I wasn&#39;t!<br> I said \u201Cgenerally speaking.\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Whatever.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Fujimaru, time to go fix some Singularities. Don&#39;t think for one second that you get to just laze about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did something happen?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Precisely.<br> I need to go fix a minor Singularity.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> And you&#39;re coming to help me.<br> Got it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If you say no, then I&#39;m just going to bother you until you say yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t received any reports about a Singularity being detected...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Yes and no.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...There are places that can&#39;t even be classified as minor Singularities, but I know that eventually, some will.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s quite the claim.<br> Is that your intuition as an Avenger speaking?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...You could say that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Senpai hasn&#39;t had a break like this in a while...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Duty calls, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s your obligation as a Master.<br> C&#39;mon, time to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re motivated...but I hope this isn&#39;t you being sarcastic.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t just sit here and ignore a Singularity.<br> I&#39;m coming with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Billy, you coming?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Um... Nah. Pass.<br> Don&#39;t think I&#39;d be useful this time anyway.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Y&#39;know, I do know someone who can help, though.<br> Be right back.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...How selfish.<br> I see outlaws are all the same.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Pot, meet kettle.<br> You&#39;re really not one to talk about being selfish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that a well-deserved break is gone, I do worry about Senpai&#39;s health... But, I will go get ready to navigate for you guys!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I am not seeing anything here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No shit.<br> It hasn&#39;t become one yet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I really want to know how you know all this, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I guess that can wait till later.<br> I&#39;m going to trust you for the time being.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Servants accompanying the Master on this Rayshift will be... C\xFA Chulainn, Jeanne Alter, and...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Me.<br> The kid asked me to join them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s a rare sight to see you on missions.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Perhaps.<br> The kid has keen intuition, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand.<br> He&#39;s a tough opponent in card games.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So, where are we Rayshifting to?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> France.<br> Former First Singularity.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The Foundation of Humanity is currently being restored there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> France... A former Singularity...where the Hundred Years&#39; War of Evil Dragons took place.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Exactly. I guess you could say we&#39;re here to clean up the mess that Singularity left behind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> In other words... Time to exorcise some bad spirits.<br> We have to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter, what do you mean by bad spirits?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Just come with me.<br> You&#39;ll see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, Jeanne Alter!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She ran off.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I guess we&#39;ll just have to follow her.<br> I&#39;ll catch up to her first.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I will accompany Fujimaru. Like she said,<br> I can sense some lingering remnants around here.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, they pose no threat to humanity even if left alone, and would eventually perish on their own...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Hmmm, Singularity, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh... These are...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, well. This is just terrible.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A group of vengeful spirits.<br> But this is...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You can sense it as Servants, can&#39;t you. There&#39;s nothing you can do about the rage they&#39;re feeling.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If left alone, they will eventually pose a threat.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come, Fujimaru.<br> Time for exorcism.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Steel your heart.<br> It&#39;s time to fight.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ugh, this whole experience is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder Billy bailed.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...This spirit...<br> Jeanne Alter.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Is this your redemption? To deal a finishing blow?<br> Or are you looking for something else?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Nothing like that.<br> I just want closure, and to wipe my slate clean.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> After all, the previous me left this mess behind.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So it&#39;s your conscience.<br> You should really learn how to let go.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> At the very least, this fixation of yours is unnecessary for this journey of restoring Humanity.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Any one of us could&#39;ve been summoned by the other side.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Proper Heroic Spirits like you can say that.<br> I can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> To me, the biggest regret I left behind was...me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Um... Master.<br> What do we do now?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sure, these vengeful spirits might be harmful to the people here if left alone, but would they pose a threat to humanity as a whole? No.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The worst they can do is eat a few animals or the odd person here and there. But the way things are looking, no human wants to get anywhere near here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> From what I can tell, there&#39;s not a living person left in that nearby town anywa\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go help her.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But, a job without compensation won&#39;t do morale any favors...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oh that reminds me, Billy told me he&#39;d forget about all the money you owe him if you do this.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Geronimo, are you serious!?<br> Okay, now I&#39;m motivated!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmph. As long as you&#39;re on board, I couldn&#39;t give less of a shit about your motive.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head into town, Fujimaru.<br> I mean, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Got it?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Just like C\xFA Chulainn said...there&#39;s no one here.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Wrong, something is definitely here.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve picked up the readings as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, the only living creature there is the Master.<br> All the other entities I&#39;m picking up are spirits.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> No surprise there. This town was destroyed a long time ago. Even if the world has repaired itself, even if its citizens are revived...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> The only thing Humanity repairs is history. The hatred and despair engraved on this timeline will never fade away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple. Hatred and despair die hard.<br> Anything could cause those remnants to resurface.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we must crush them first.<br> Do you follow?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Now, the next wave of enemies is coming.<br> Are you ready?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Master, just in case.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> She&#39;s not asking if you&#39;re ready to put your life on the line for this upcoming battle.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> She&#39;s asking if you&#39;re capable of exterminating those spirits. They might become evil in the future, but right now, they&#39;re still innocent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course I am.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmph, I wonder if you really are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What if I told you those spirits are still innocent?<br> Would you still say you&#39;re ready to put them down?</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Anyway, more enemies are coming!<br> Get ready!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> It hurts... It hurts... Hot... Suffocating...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> Help... Help...<br> I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t want to die...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> Die... Won&#39;t die... Death... I am dead...<br> Kill me... I will kill you...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, please keep it together! If you show any weakness, those ghost will possess you and kill you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> They don&#39;t even know who they should hate anymore.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If other people were to visit this town during the course of Humanity restoring itself, they would be possessed and slaughtered.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...If you want to stop that from happening, you have to exorcise every ghost here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> However, they have not sinned, and they don&#39;t deserve any punishment. But it would be too late for them once their hate finally manifested.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure salvation is still possible for these poor souls since they haven&#39;t killed anyone.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve realized by now...the source of such a grudge, such hatred in innocent spirits...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter, who brought you here.<br> She is the source.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> More specifically, the Jeanne Alter of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So these are ghosts of those who died in the Hundred Years&#39; War of Evil Dragons?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Naturally. The Jeanne Alter responsible for that crime has already been defeated.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason to force the newly summoned Jeanne Alter to atone for the sins of her old self.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But then...<br> Why did she manifest as an Avenger?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Now I understand what you&#39;re trying to say, Geronimo.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Does the fallen maiden have the intention of fulfilling her duty as a Servant to help restore Humanity?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If not, she&#39;s unfit to be Fujimaru&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> She would just be a crazed woman who uses her status as a Servant to satisfy her own twisted desires.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The real question is...<br> Which one are you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...More than anyone, that&#39;s what I want to know;<br> it&#39;s why I&#39;m here right now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But for the most part, it&#39;s what I expected.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I thought that I&#39;d at least enjoy taking my revenge.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> But if I&#39;m being honest... I&#39;m not enjoying this at all.<br> It&#39;s actually boring me out of my skull.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I see, that&#39;s good.<br> Indeed, nothing fun comes from vengeance.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, exorcising these poor souls will not bring you salvation either.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So, why? Why do you persist?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> What do I need salvation for?<br> I&#39;m just a fleeting dream.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Even if I pour everything I have into that effort, I will leave nothing behind. And that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s just the hand I was dealt.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here to atone for my sins, nor am I here to seek salvation. I&#39;m here for one purpose and one purpose only: to bring you victory.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> That...is the one thing I won&#39;t forget.<br> I can never forget.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Hah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Humph.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Did you get what I said!? Are you just pretending to be an idiot or are you actually that dumb!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Psh, whatever.<br> Not like I need your stupid thanks!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Now, we just need to clean up the castle.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> We already got this far.<br> We&#39;ll stick with you until the end.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed. However, I want you to show us the conclusion you&#39;ve reached.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Not just your conclusion, but what led you to it as well.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> ...Ughhh. Why...why...!<br> I...am...ah...ahhhhhhh...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> Kill... I must kill... I must...protect...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> God...<br> Why would you forsake us...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> It feels terrible in here. Come forth, restless dead who can only lament your own tragedy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Come at me! I am standing right here!<br> Don&#39;t just bitch and whine! Fight me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You who were powerless in life! Come on!<br> Fight me! Kill me! Punish me for my sins!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...U-ummm... Jeanne Alter?<br> What are you trying to do?</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> You... Yooouuu! Curse you... Curse you curse you curse you curse you curse you curse you curse yooouuu!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Fool, look what you&#39;ve done!<br> They&#39;re fusing together!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...That monster is the sum of all the hatred they bear her. But this is... I see...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So...HE was the one you were really hoping to find salvation for... No, that&#39;s better left unsaid.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> ...You...<br> How...did...you...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I see you somehow managed to keep you consciousness... Charles VII.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> Jeanne... To think...you would...kill...the innocent...civilians...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I did. That&#39;s right.<br> And now I&#39;m going to kill them again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let anyone\u2013not some big damn noble hero, or a loser antiherotake this from me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I killed you, I killed your followers,<br> I killed the civilians, I killed them all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here to make excuses. I&#39;m not here for salvation. I&#39;m not here for punishment. This isn&#39;t FUN for me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m just fulfilling my duty as a Servant!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> Duty... I see...<br> So you are calling this your...duty...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong><br> We will hate you, and forever curse you.<br> Yet there&#39;s no hatred in your heart?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Master, do you know?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Charles VII, the one you know from the history books...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> He ordered a retrial for me\u2013no, for Jeanne d&#39;Arc\u2013<br> eighteen years after her death.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> He testified to her innocence, her honesty,<br> and her bravery on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Due to his testimony, among many others,<br> the original sentence was overturned.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Maybe he wanted to make amends.<br> Or maybe he just did it to ease his own conscience.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Or maybe, he did it hoping to save Jeanne... But once you&#39;re dead, you&#39;re just lost in the endless abyss.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, not that knowing his motive would make a difference to your life.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Knowing you, you probably don&#39;t even care to find out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.<br> I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> If anything, the other me would be happy that...<br> No, she wouldn&#39;t care, either.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> She&#39;s not the sort to worry about her reputation after her death. Actually, she didn&#39;t seem to care even while she was alive.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> How it happened doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that this incident has been resolved the way it should.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, you didn&#39;t let anyone else do this for you, easy as it would have been to do so.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The logic behind your resolve, your dignity...<br> Those are what makes you a Servant.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Jeanne Alter, by your actions you have proven yourself to be a just and proper Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Jeanne Alter really is a great Servant!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> ...Now this farce is over.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Time to get on with restoring Humanity.<br> Say your goodbyes to this hellhole.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, death has been wiped away from this land.
