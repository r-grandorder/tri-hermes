That may have been a bit much.<br> Allow me to explain our situation.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A mere twenty-seven minutes ago, we observed a slight space-time fluctuation over Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It was a very small anomaly, but showed no signs of natural decay, and so you Rayshifted to accompany us on a mission to investigate...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Sadly, we&#39;ve lost communication with Chaldea. Currently, we&#39;re working to repair the Spiritual World Communicator and restore communications.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you haven&#39;t given up on the Communicator.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course not. With Miss Blavatsky&#39;s help, the Spiritual World Communicator has been strengthened!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> With the power of science, we shall debunk all the world&#39;s many misconceptions! And if the spiritual world proves to be real, we can expand our consumer base!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll listen to Edison&#39;s ramblings later.<br> Master, can you get up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ah, good! You had no trouble getting up! I would expect no less from a seasoned Master like you! Ever reliable once you are properly alert!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Now we need only gather information.<br> Geronimo is currently out scouting.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m back, king of inventors. Based on the vegetation and the stars, we&#39;re definitely in North America.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, I did not see any airplanes or satellites.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm, so it is safe to assume we are in America prior to the 19th century. Or at least a world very similar.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Still, we&#39;re not at all clear on our situation.<br> We had to Rayshift quite suddenly.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> There is a possibility that we are in a distant future where humanity becomes extinct, but let&#39;s not think so pessimistically.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just work on not getting worked up over nothing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Looks like the animals are getting along nicely.<br> Now, about our precise location\u2014</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> Grrrrrr...!!!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh-ho. Has a primitive being made its appearance...?<br> No, could that be\u2014</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> (It looks...human...?)<br> Geronimo, what in the world is that!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A humanoid monster... A wendigo!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A man-eating spirit of legend passed down by the Algonquin people. There&#39;s no returning one possessed by a wendigo to their normal human form!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what the heck&#39;s going on, but...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that, Master!<br> Mash Kyrielight, moving to the defense!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Wendigo:</strong><br> Guoooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Wendigo:</strong><br> Uryyyyyy!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!

Sooo red!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master...!? That look you&#39;re giving your wound...it&#39;s not...hungry is it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, no! Don&#39;t! Don&#39;t try to eat it!<br> It will taste bad! It&#39;s bad! No good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We need to end this event while we can still keep our characterization consistent!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> (...Mash is losing her cool too... Hm...I hope this is not some type of Mental Corruption...)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I must admit, we are quite thoroughly surrounded. Troubling...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This campsite may be protected by the Territory Creation Geronimo and I have, but...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Right. I&#39;m not certain we can take an attack like this.<br> If necessary, I can go out and attack them.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No, hold on. I have every confidence in your skill in battle, but I am not sure how well Mash and I can defend Master alone... Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is this rumbling...?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Something truly gargantuan is coming this way...!<br> Is it a Phantasmal? No... It&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that is...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An attacking...titan!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Impossible...! A Spirit... A Divine Spirit...<br> No, it can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Are you okay?<br> I&#39;ll help you!</p><p><strong>Wendigo:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-amazing...! The wendigos are going down like it&#39;s some massive game of whack-a-mole!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Okay! Keep this up!<br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ye...yeah, barely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You really helped us out...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sooo biiiiiig! No need for explanation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Master! This definitely needs explanation!<br> This person is obviously not normal!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...At least I don&#39;t sense any hostility from her.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Giant one, what Spirit has guided you to us?<br> I am a warrior of the Apache from the south.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I have many names, but those closest to me call me Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I would ask you for your name. Without it, I cannot show my gratitude or tell my ancestors of you.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Paul Bunyan. That&#39;s my name.<br> I come from far away, and I go far away.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Bonjour and nice to meet you, unknown Mage.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She really...is huge...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bigger is ALWAYS better!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the point, Master. Talking is one thing, but one wrong step, and you will get pancaked!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It&#39;s like we&#39;re conversing with a small mountain. Geronimo may be used to it, but this is inconvenient.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Huh? Where did everyone go?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh? Could it be...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t seem like she can hear us.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. It is likely very much like our inability to hear the footsteps of the ants around us.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ah! Master, step aside!<br> The giant Spirit is starting to walk!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Alone...again...<br> I&#39;m so lonely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And she&#39;s gone...<br> Should we follow her?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No, even if we follow her, she will not hear us.<br> Let us follow the Spirits&#39; guidance to our destiny.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. What a rational way of thinking. Then let&#39;s set forth! So long as we keep moving, we will eventually reach civilization!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just...more...forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We&#39;ve been walking here for over three hours.<br> It&#39;s like we&#39;re going in circles...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I am afraid that I am not familiar with the forests of the north... My apologies. For an Apache scout to get lost... This is an embarrassment to my tribe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Geronimo.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Heeeeeey!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Wh-what a relief!<br> I finally found you guys!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is she...smaller?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Small is kinda, uh, relative here...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmmm... What unknown work of science could this be!? How interesting!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Strange and rare Spirit, I am grateful that you have answered our call.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Heehee. Me too.<br> I got scared because I couldn&#39;t hear you guys anymore.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is my Master.<br> [\u2642 His /\u2640 Her] name is Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice to meet you, Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep. Nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is wonderful, Senpai.<br> Bunyan seems like a wonderful person!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> All right, Paul Bunyan. I am Edison.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Ehhh!? This fluffy thing is Edison!?<br> Where&#39;s the zipper in his costume?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Stop! There&#39;s no one inside!<br> I am Edison! No more and no less than the man himself!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry. I just get this urge to take stuff apart when I see something so intricately made...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Oh, but I really respect you!<br> You are the king of all the world&#39;s inventors, after all!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Harumph. That&#39;s right. Children needn&#39;t know that I am also called the king of lawsuits!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It is wonderful that you are so innocent!<br> Here, take a Mini Edison Lion Badge.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Collect ten, and you can exchange it for a Mega Edison Lion Badge. Surely the big badge would suit your big body!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ah, but I digress. We are wondering just what in the world you might be, Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m a lumberjack! And I&#39;m okay! I got summoned by someone, and ended up in this forest.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> This whole time...I&#39;ve been alone in the forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When you say you were summoned...does that mean you&#39;re a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like it.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Servant... Yep, probably.<br> I think...I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you low on Magical Energy?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;m...hungry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Very well! Then a Master is what you shall have!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please lend us your strength to correct this Singularity!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Is that...okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Okay! I think, I can be useful!<br> Ask me anything, okay?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get down to business. Where in North America are we? We aren&#39;t familiar with this place.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I think...it&#39;s North Dakota.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> North Dakota!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Well, we certainly ended up in a dreadful place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not that versed in American geography...<br> Is North Dakota really that bad?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...To be blunt...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Blunt?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It&#39;s the boonies!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> North Dakota is about 183,000 square kilometers in area. It is the equivalent of the majority of the British Isles or an island nation like Japan.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But the entire population is about 760,000 as of 2017. It&#39;s been like that for years.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which means, in a state with such a low population, we may walk for hours and hours without finding any trace of civilization whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou. (Nods)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> If worse comes to worst, we may be stuck in this forest forever!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The forest is teeming with Spirits. We even run the risk of using up all our magical energy, or Master&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Demon:</strong><br> Grrrrrrrrr...!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Speak of the devil... I mean Spirits!<br> Can you help us, Miss Paul Bunyan!?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep! I&#39;ll chop &#39;em all up with my axe!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s so...vast...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm...indeed it is. This is the problem with the countryside... Not so much as a streetlight in sight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sleepy, I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m tired...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If only we could reach a village...<br> We can only camp out so many times.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The weather around here can change in a blink of an eye. If a snowstorm were to start, Master will definitely be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> If only I had my favorite axe, this would be easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Favorite axe?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep. My special axe for chopping down trees!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s a limited \u26055 CE, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> What...are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s okay this time!<br> We don&#39;t need to farm anything in this event!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> (Yet another bizarre outburst... Could there be something in the air causing this strange behavior?)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I see. If Miss Bunyan did have her favorite axe, she could open up this forest to create a path for us.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> But the person who summoned me took my axe away...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> They said it was really dangerous...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A mage?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are they like?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t remember.<br> They went really far to the east...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is interesting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. They might know something about the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That&#39;s more reason we need that axe...<br> Unfortunately, my magecraft is not up to the task.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Dwahahaha!<br> What are you saying!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What a strange question to axe!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Is the sort of wacky nonsense one might say, but that one will not be THIS one! Why? Because I&#39;m a genius, of course!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Edison?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Miss Bunyan! As a denizen of the United States, you must realize you are forgetting one critical thing!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Do it yourself!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> DIY... Make...it...myself...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Indeed! The pioneers all started out in small shacks and eventually built their own world!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Just like me! I started out in a small, poor lab, but eventually expanded into a giant corporation!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What are your hands for!?<br> What are your arms for!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes! To build your future! Don&#39;t hesitate! Break through! Fight it! And if you can&#39;t fight it, sue it!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s the frontier spirit!!!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Frontier Spirit...<br> The pioneering mentality...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Great Spirit Bunyan. I also agree.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Once in the past, the coyote stole the source of knowledge from the sun, giving the world its light.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Steadfast determination changes the world a bit at a time. We shall lend you a hand, O Spirit.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Okay. I have the plans... As long as we can make a workstation, we can probably make the axe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay! Time to farm materials!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this enough?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe so. We have just about everything Bunyan requested.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad. Just a bit more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Let&#39;s keep going, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If only we could collect mats like this.Curse you, developers!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai! I completely understand how you feel, but please calm down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, how do Gears and Proofs of all things enhance my skills? It doesn&#39;t make any sense!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> (There&#39;s a change in the air again... Are the Spirits agitated? Is...something terrible about to happen...?)</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> Gyaaaoooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Another monster!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh! Senpai, prepare for battle!<br> It seems the monster has decided we&#39;re enemies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah, this situation brings back memories.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why is it always when the good stuff happens?Those bastards...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, yes! Sorry to interrupt, but here come the wyverns!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t even have any good materials to drop, but let&#39;s just grit our teeth and power through!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...The Spirits have stopped stirring.<br> It seems that was the last of the wyverns.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a while since I saw wyverns.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder what Siegfried&#39;s up to...?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Sorry, I do not have much to say or do here...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> Please watch \u201CFate/Apocrypha\u201D...now streaming on Something-or-another-flix...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong><br> The light novels are...well, you could import them...<br> I&#39;m counting on you, Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He just...plugged his title...and left...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master... Who are you talking to?<br> Is it a Spirit that I can neither sense nor see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, nothing... Nothing. Never mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Something...incredibly terrifying...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. Perhaps this is the same principle as the Spiritual World Communicator. Fujimaru...you&#39;re...um...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Perhaps you may have heard the voice of a ghost...someone very much like you, yet different...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I-I see...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You must have some notion that I cannot quite fathom. If it&#39;s all right with Fujimaru, it&#39;s fine, though.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Anyway, Bunyan said that the workstation is complete. Come with me.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Tiiiiiiiiimmmbeeeeeerrr!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is amazing...!<br> The trees are falling like dominos.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. Even the logging machines humanity has developed are no match for Bunyan&#39;s axe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but don&#39;t you think she&#39;s going a bit overboard?<br> At this rate, there won&#39;t be any forest left!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I chopped them down so they can be used as lumber, and I cut them so they could grow back!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;ll create a path to civilization for you, and then bring all that to the lumberyard!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, about that...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-the forest really is gone...!<br> All that&#39;s left is a neatly stacked pile of lumber!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ah! I knew it! Paul Bunyan!<br> I&#39;ve heard that name before!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What!?<br> You know her, Edison!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmmm, I feel like we&#39;ve had this conversation before...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Don&#39;t fret about the small things!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Not every player has played every event, you know!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this what a proper global social mobile RPG targeted at a broad audience should be like?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Within me, George Washington is saying the only thing to not fear is not fear but the mundane itself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are...you sure that&#39;s right, Presi-King?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mundanity is scary.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...At any rate...<br> Who is this Paul Bunyan?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I have not heard of this Spirit.<br> Is it one you revere, or perhaps an angel or saint?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. I believe I recall that in newspapers she is said to have been the greatest lumberjack in all of America.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A single blow of her axe created the Mississippi River, and a blow from her fist could dig an oil well that would reach clear through to China!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> She could drain all five Great Lakes dry in a single gulp. A swing of her pickaxe could shatter the entire Rocky Mountain range!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even the Great Plains of the Midwest are said to be what remains of Bunyan cutting down a forest!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> In a way, she&#39;s a great being who created the United States by hand! That&#39;s who Paul Bunyan is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A legend that created America...<br> That kind of Servant was summoned here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I see. I understand now.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But if all that were true...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A being so powerful must be a Divine Spirit. Summoning such a thing should not normally be possible.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> (...Hm... There is a more important, immediate reason Paul Bunyan cannot be summoned...)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s set those questions aside for now!<br> She is, after all, standing before us!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The question is: who summoned Miss Bunyan? Considering that they summoned a Servant, they must also be in possession of a Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> And that tells us that the person who summoned her must be the person who created this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes. O Spirit, O Bunyan...answer my\u2013</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...Something&#39;s coming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something...something shiny...is descending...!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Uh, dispatch, this is Deputy Billy.<br> I&#39;ve got eyes on the site of illegal deforestation.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...Did I get my line right?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Correct. Illegal deforestation is bad civilization!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Huh!? Bad...civilization...!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes! And so I, Wyatt Earp, shall destroy you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wyatt Earp?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ah, the legendary Wyatt Earp! I know of him from my own lifetime! He is a legendary gunslinger of the West!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Truly, there is no question that Wyatt Earp would be a Heroic Spirit! But you&#39;re...erm... Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Altera. That is Altera.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> I know nothing of this \u201CAltera\u201D you speak of.<br> I am Wyatt Earp. Yes. Wyatt Earp.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Master from a faraway land, no matter who you have contracted with...</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> I am absolutely not them.<br> I am a lawman. Wyatt Earp.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh-huh. Sure, Altera.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Honestly, just go with it. No use arguing.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> We definitely didn&#39;t have the budget for a bunch of new art and stuff. So, for today, she&#39;s Wyatt Earp.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Just like how I&#39;m a sheriff&#39;s deputy here.<br> I guess that makes me our Doc Holliday?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> These new stories are overwriting the Heroic Spirits we know... So that&#39;s what happened...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;ve just received a spiritual message from the developers. \u201CDon&#39;t think too hard about it.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This spiritual communicator is BS, like Mahatm\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, COME ON! Wyatt Earp Servant WHEN!?</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Good. That&#39;s the reaction I wanted.<br> That adaptability is your greatest strength. Cherish it.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Save it for the trial.<br> You destroyed a forest illegally, after all.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> For such crimes, you must be punished.<br> Right here. Right now.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Wait!?<br> We just wanted to reach town\u2013</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I was about to ship all this out because I didn&#39;t want to waste the trees I chopped down!</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Make efficient use of the results of your destruction...<br> I see. Those words cut deep...</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> But none of that matters! I see the crime you committed, and that is that. Excuses get you nowhere.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> What I question is your responsibility of your actions. Paul Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> (This Spirit of judgment has appeared to pass sentence on Bunyan... Truly that proves that Bunyan is a Heroic Spirit that shouldn&#39;t be\u2013)</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Giant, destructive lumberjack, receive your punishment.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Ugh! I&#39;ve been struck in the head by an axe-like blunt instrument!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> It&#39;s over!<br> Don&#39;t bother us again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Altera! Please, listen to us!</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> ...You are mistaken.<br> I am absolutely not Altera. No.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> When the morning star shines in the eastern sky, a single ray of light will shine upon Chicago.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> That shall be me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have absolutely no clue what you&#39;re on about.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> ...Actually...</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> I&#39;m really not sure what this Heroic Spirit is about myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, then no one understands!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just jump. You have Saint Quartz, right?</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> ...I-if I had any...if I did...I wouldn&#39;t be going through all of this...</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Quartz... So small...but so rare...</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Ugh! I used up all my time making silly small talk with you! I can only fight for three minutes at a time.</p><p><strong>Wyatt Earp:</strong><br> Farewell, for now. You shall be properly tried next time, Paul Bunyan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She disappeared!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did she really just take off and fly to Chicago?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It appears so. Wyatt Earp...what type of Altera was it!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...And I&#39;ve been abandoned.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Billy the Kid.<br> The young hero, the Thunderer. O, brave assailant...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Where did you come from, and where do you go from here? Please, tell us.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You and I are both Heroic Spirits. We are both Spirits of the dead who have come from the Throne of the Root.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I&#39;m really not into this whole mysticism junk...<br> Eh, whatever.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> So me, Wyatt Earp, and even Bunyan...were all Summoned by the same mage.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> She&#39;s in Chicago.<br> And she&#39;s controlling everything from there.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Chicago...that&#39;s far to the east of here!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> And Altera headed over there too...I see.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Can I go now?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Playing sheriff was okay, I guess.<br> But next time, I&#39;d rather play the outlaw...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pave the way...to Chicago!</p><h2 id="section-2-hamburg-steak-and-parsley" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-hamburg-steak-and-parsley" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Hamburg Steak and Parsley</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So vast...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Un-freakin&#39;-believably vast...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...

I could eat a horse or twenty-seven...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve eaten yakisoba before!?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep! When I was digging an oil field on the West Coast, some Chinese workers made some for me.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> It was so good...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> My apologies.

Are you all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something...hit the house...!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It&#39;s buffalo!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> We&#39;ve noticed that the buffalo herds have become violent recently!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A stampede!?<br> Or could an evil Spirit be possessing them...?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is bad, Master. If we don&#39;t do anything, a ramshackle house like this will be trampled!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah...we should go out there to beat up the herd!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna join too. I won&#39;t let this nice shack that somebody made get destroyed!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Oh...really?<br> We won&#39;t be able to pay you back for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need anything in return.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!<br> I knew you would say something like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh I better get so many Hearts outta this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is obviously just wishful thinking Please, snap out of it, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go...

Broiled, stewed, and fried...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel as if we ate a lifetime&#39;s worth of hamburg steaks...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s the difference betweenfried hamburg steak and buffalo croquettes?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Nuahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What do you think of the new Edison Brand Salisbury Steak Maker\u2122!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Salisbury steak?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They weren&#39;t hamburg steaks?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes. Nowadays, I hear fancy shops try to pass it off by calling it a German dish.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But here in the States, it was called Salisbury steak!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> During the turmoil of the Civil War, Dr. Salisbury developed a mincemeat steak using red meat!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Not only is it healthy, but it can be mass-produced!<br> Such is the dish that I, the genius Edison, improved!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Um, we haven&#39;t heard of that. So it&#39;s basically hamburg steak, right? Maybe they&#39;re even just hamburgers?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> In French and German books, they all say<br> \u201Chamburg steak,\u201D so shouldn&#39;t we just go with that?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmmm, but since we are in the States, I would prefer to call it Salisbury steak, the American way...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed. Even if it is unremarkable, being prideful of one&#39;s own culture is important.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> H-hm. Coming from you, and with a straight face,<br> I couldn&#39;t help but laugh aloud...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...if only I had nerves of steel! But what do you think, Geronimo!? Was the dish to your liking?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes... A buffalo hunt, then sitting with my comrades to eat our catch brings back memories.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> My tribe once hunted buffalo on horseback.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But there are no more buffalo. They were driven near to extinction by firearms and railroads.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Now, buffalo living in nature preserves are all that remain... Mere memories, like us Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I was able to taste that again. I suppose some good fortune befalls one even as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep. It&#39;s really, really, really tasty!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re glad! This is a dish that Mommy taught us!<br> Eat a lot, okay?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Oh, but I don&#39;t want parsley.<br> I just want hamburg steak.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s no good, Bunyan!<br> Good children must eat everything on their plates!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> But...it&#39;s bitter.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t leave friends behind, okay?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Indeed. Parsley is a wonderful vegetable chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> O-okay. If everyone says so, I&#39;ll try my best to eat it.<br> I&#39;ll savor everything on my plate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Please...take the rest of my food... I&#39;m so full of hamburg steak I think I&#39;m going to burst...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yay! It&#39;s been a while since I ate with a bunch of people!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I was always alone in that forest!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Glad to hear it! Then next I shall cook Salisbury steak teriyaki style!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> After grilling it rare, using this Edison-made portable cooking stove...hm?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Unnntouchable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oops, Altera did it again...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I am not Altera!<br> And I am not Britney Spears either!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want some hamburg steak?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes. I will have a plate.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Yes. This is...(munch)...somewhat...good civilization. (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But I know better. There are far better and tastier hamburg steaks out there in the world. And I know they&#39;re full of umami.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ghh! No...not that.<br> Bribery will not work on me!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I am Park Ranger Buffalo Bill!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, but you&#39;re Altera, though.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Our two weapons are Spirit Origin and magical energy...and Noble Phantasm...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...She flew east...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder what that was about...?<br> And that was three weapons...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Did she want to eat hamburg steak?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That must be it!<br> Because hamburg steaks really are delicious!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Anywhere can be paradise with delicious food!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Grow big and strong, you hear?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Bunyan?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> She&#39;s back.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Unnntouchable!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Altera&#39;s back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need a cool name for this: Alteranate? Wait, no...</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> No! I am Park Ranger Buffalo Bill!<br> Our THREE weapons are...</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Spirit Origin, magical energy, Noble Phantasm, and moderation!</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> I...I got it wrong again!<br> Math is bad civilization! I&#39;ll come in again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Wh-what!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to do it again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re getting nowhere.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> I see. True.<br> Everyone makes little mistakes sometimes.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll start over. Anyway...<br> We have tons of weapons. Got it?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. One does not make a great nation by sweating the small stuff.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So, what is it this time...um, Buffalo Bill...?</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Do I need to spell it out? You have committed the heinous crime of killing the endangered buffalo! That is, the American bison!</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Now come quietly, or there will be trouble.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Wait. I can&#39;t ignore what you just said.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The buffalo do not belong to anyone.<br> That is to say, they are gifts of nature.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We hunted a berserk herd that was threatening humans. We did not pursue the herd that fled.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Bunyan made sure to use their bones, hides, and horns so nothing was wasted. Every piece of meat was ground up to make hamburg steak.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We have done nothing wrong. There was no malicious killing. Do you still believe we committed a crime?</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Yes. What you did cannot go unpunished.<br> Time to taste my Winchester War God Sword!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If that is the case, I am an Apache before I am a Heroic Spirit. I will not permit anyone to deny the Apache way of life!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Nor will I allow Master or the children to be punished for sharing the blessings of the buffalo!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take that!</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> ...How? How could you possess such strength...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Our bonds... That&#39;s what Chaldea is all about!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s all about the embers, Ascension,and a carry from good support!</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> I see...<br> So that is your strength...</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> But go no farther, Master who has come from the outside world... You are trying to do something that must not be done.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What? What do you mean, Buffalo Bill? Spirit who takes the name of the legendary buffalo hunter.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bill:</strong><br> Goodbye-ffalo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s...gone...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Did I...do something bad?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You were just eating lunch with us.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t do anything bad!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nobody can really say what&#39;s good or bad.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yeah. If we hadn&#39;t killed the buffalo, the children would have gotten hurt.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This land is unforgiving. There is no universally agreed-upon justice to be found.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Justice comes through victory...whether it be by swords, magecraft, or words.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> If that&#39;s so, merci.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Thank you for fighting for my sake.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;re full, let&#39;s go. We need to go meet the person who summoned me in Chicago.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Then Jack and I will go too.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re tired of waiting.<br> And Bunyan&#39;s our friend now.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Master?

Tsk!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Th-thank you, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For what?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Well...because...I&#39;m so big.<br> I just assumed that I would be a burden to everyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s different.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You should see some of the folks at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> R-really...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right... There are some pretty...unusually large people, like Kiara and Gorgon...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it so much! It&#39;ll turn you gray!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s what makes you unique.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> What...makes me...unique...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm! As long as it is not illegal, uniqueness is to be embraced. That&#39;s what the U.S. is all about!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Now to gather information. That mage will probably have left some trace of their activities.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> So we&#39;re going to split up and search!<br> Like detectives!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> If we find Mommy, can we dismember her to make sure it&#39;s her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stay, Jack, stay!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Okaaay. We&#39;ll hold back.<br> Could you make more hamburg steaks for us, then?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, team, circle up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sound off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Two!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Third!</p><p><strong>Mash\uFF06Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So, status? Report, everyone.<br> Sidenote: I have nothing.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> One look at me and everyone from animal control to the police came rushing in. There were even heroes who kept calling me villain.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Guess what? I ate a pizza THIS big!<br> It was really tall and delicious!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep! It was really good!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You should try it next time, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, okay!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Well, that&#39;s all very...useful.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I have one thing to report.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh that&#39;s a relief...! I was afraid this would only end up being about our dining experience...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> There was this shop called \u201CClub High Society,\u201D where a group of occult fans gathered.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Many of them are not mages at all, but such a place almost certainly has the backing of the Mages&#39; Association.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I see. It may be a good idea to check them out.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let us head over to \u201CClub High Society\u201D!</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Hey, stop right there. No kids allowed.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm? Are you speaking of Master?<br> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] may look young, but I assure you, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] is no child.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Maybe this will change your mind.<br> (Passes him something under the table)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Edison just handed over a huge wad of money to the bouncer...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The obvious go-to move for a successful businessman!</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Well, when you put it like that... (Fumble, fumble).<br> But I still can&#39;t let those little girls in.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> You can&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I&#39;m older than you.</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> No can do, little girl.<br> Now be good little girls and stay outside.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Awwww, we want to dismember too.</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Dismember...? Whatever. There&#39;s a coffee shop open twenty-four hours just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let them know a couple of kids are coming.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Do they have any sweet taffy?<br> Or maybe a nice cake?</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Of course they do.<br> Chicago donuts are the best donuts in the world.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh, donuts! The holes in donuts must be a portal to a wonderful world!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Jack. But... I&#39;m a little sad that we&#39;re not going to be with Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yep. Master, take good care of Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Wait right there. We&#39;ll be right back.</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Ready? New customers coming in!</p><p><strong>Celebrity:</strong><br> Hahahahaha. What did you think of the medium reading the other day?</p><p><strong>Celebrity:</strong><br> Ah, it was so incredible. Spiritual enlightenment is a once in a lifetime experience, after all!</p><p><strong>Celebrity:</strong><br> I&#39;m planning to head to THAT town next. I hear there&#39;s a grimoire that&#39;s been there since its early days as a settlement.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They seem to be talking about some complicated things...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it. They all look so serious.<br> Why don&#39;t they just talk about useful things?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s mostly a bit of harmless misinformation. The Mystics of the Spirits would never truly be revealed to the untrustworthy.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Concealing Mystics, huh?<br> So you agree with the Mages&#39; Association?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about the Association. It&#39;s simply that in our tradition, those with the lineage of the Spirits must live up to that position.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Should knowledge of the Spirits be made public, it would become mundane; it would lose its value.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s an opinion worth listening to. I&#39;d like to hear more, but looks like we don&#39;t have the time.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed. You can see it too, right, Master? That woman there is the only one with actual magical energy.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> The...pretty lady...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mata Hari...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please be careful.<br> That is not the Mata Hari we know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep. That&#39;s not the Chaldean Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Tee hee. Welcome to Club High Society.<br> Pleased to meet you. I&#39;m Mata Hari, this club&#39;s mistress.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> I wonder how long it&#39;s been since a real mage has set foot in here...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> And now...goodbye.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh...getting dizzy...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> What&#39;s...this?<br> My head&#39;s getting fuzzy...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Director...let&#39;s go wrestle...magical circuits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, what were you just thinking!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come here, my little eggplant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!? Wh-what did you...!?<br> What do you mean, \u201Clittle eggplant\u201D!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please...stop!<br> You mustn&#39;t...you mustn&#39;t...you mustn&#39;t stop!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Tee hee...that&#39;s right...drown in your pleasure.<br> I am Mata Hari, the woman with the eyes of the sun!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way you can escape from this charm.<br> Goodbye, strange mage from another world.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Not a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh...!? Wait, what the...!?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Impossible!?<br> But I used my Noble Phantasm on them...!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> How unfortunate for you.<br> Did you think Geronimo and I would be unprepared?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We&#39;ve set up a barrier around this club.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We asked Miss Nursery Rhyme to act if anything unusual happened.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t think for an instant that a lone Assassin&#39;s magical energy would suffice against three Casters!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> I knew this would happen. Fine. Much as I do not approve of the male manner of problem-solving...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Get them, men.</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> What&#39;s the problem here?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Club High Society is my castle.<br> Don&#39;t you dare think you can get out of here alive!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Take...that...!<br> Please get out of the way!</p><p><strong>Bouncer:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> So this is the end.<br> Tee hee...you&#39;re so strong...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Please, tell me.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Where is these girls&#39; \u201CMommy,\u201D the mage who summoned me?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> ...I suppose it&#39;s about time someone told you.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> The World&#39;s Columbian Exposition.<br> Go there, and you will meet the one you seek.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...World&#39;s Columbian Exposition?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Listen, Paul Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> (She&#39;s petting me...without getting scared.)</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Humans...even if you are a Heroic Spirit...can live on just by being loved.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> You are loved by your Master. That&#39;s why you were able to reach this place...despite your unlucky stars.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Someday...there will be a Master who will use a Grail to power me up to level 100 too...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Perhaps...the me in your Chaldea is like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mata Hari...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We are transient existences, ephemeral guests in this world, spiritual forms of what was once human...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yet, when we do exist...each time we are summoned, we are given new consciousness.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master. The bond that you and the rest of the Servants have formed is a real one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That is neither dreams nor fiction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master.<br> To the World&#39;s Columbian Exposition!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> So this is the World&#39;s Columbian Exposition...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Historically, this is the World&#39;s Fair held in 1893.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So it is an event to showcase the current culture and innovation of modern nations. Is this sort of boasting really necessary, though?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I would normally think that cultural exchange without combat is a good thing, but this fair is proving to be the exception to that rule.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This place is fairly dripping with the arrogance of privilege. Hideous. It is truly hideous.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. During the 1893 World&#39;s Fair there were many...\u201Cexhibitions\u201D of minorities.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Agreed! This is far from rational!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The worst part is this horrible use of electricity! It&#39;s AC! They&#39;re using AC!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The Edison Tower&#39;s DC should have been more than sufficient!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You&#39;re like an argumentative spiritual leader in the guise of a thunder god worshipper. But I still respect you... If you still can call that rational.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Indeed! That&#39;s the DC way of thinking!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I know this place has its flaws.<br> But it&#39;s still fun.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> There&#39;s lots of buildings. There&#39;s lots of detail put in them. The carpenters, the plasterers, and the gardeners...they all put in a lot of effort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you like buildings, Bunyan?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Yep. I like to destroy, but that&#39;s my job.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Making something is really fun.<br> And I love to see what other people make too.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Tee hee. I agree. I enjoy them too.<br> Because things made by others are always wonderful.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter who the storyteller is. It&#39;s an intimate contract between the reader and the work.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Such things are everywhere, but not anywhere.<br> That&#39;s why it&#39;s so wonderful! Right, Jack?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yep. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But your story ends here. Abruptly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I figured we were about due for this again.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Like a shooting star that cuts through the sky...like a wavering candle flame...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Even if you think it has some shape, it will disappear. That&#39;s the fate of all stories.</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> I am Davy Crockett, guardian of the fading pride, and protector of order.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ah. So you&#39;re a guardian of the World&#39;s Fair this time. Then I have one question for you.</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> Very well, Edison, king of inventions. What is your question? You have the right to ask, as you are one of those who began the Age of Reason.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> WHY AC!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Called it.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I ask of you: why use AC!!??</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious. Because the great genius, Nikola Tesla is right here.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> AC can shine its light in any darkness.<br> It promises quiet and stability.</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> Yes. AC is good civilization.<br> DC is bad civilization.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> Putting that aside, I cannot let you pass beyond this point.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s our line! I&#39;m going to skewer you on the Edison Tower and make you into a decoration!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I, as a gentleman, am reasonably, justifiably angry! Understand, Master!? Note that in my biography!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes. Totally. Reasonable. Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Good! I will use mathematics and Newtonian mechanics to destroy everything efficiently! Scientifically!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying we&#39;re going to solve this with violence?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ultimately, yes!<br> And that&#39;s really the whole notion! I&#39;ll make them cry!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Then I shall show you who it is that truly rules the heavens as the modern-day thunder god!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> The World&#39;s Fair&#39;s power engine...the Allis Engine has stopped...! Impossible...! What is that power...!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you know, mister professor?<br> Unpredictable things can happen anywhere, at any time!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s what storytelling is. Coincidence trumps certainty. That&#39;s how the good ones always go!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I see... I shall take that into account in my future theories... That way, we needn&#39;t say AC lost to DC.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Wait a minute, you bastard!<br> What did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> See you later!<br> Good luck on the rest of your journey!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Why you! Hey! Don&#39;t you dare think running away makes you the victor! Though... I suppose my technology doesn&#39;t get used so much later on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t know that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t blame Edison for being so emotional...let&#39;s just leave him alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And this is your final stand, Davy Crockett.</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> So it is.</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> Let me give you a warning, Paul Bunyan and Master.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Davy Crockett:</strong><br> You should not proceed further.<br> If you do, you will be faced with your worst nightmare.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Nightmare... Are you saying there&#39;s a nightmare waiting ahead?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Bunyan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got your back.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We are with you, and Master&#39;s also here. Mash, Mister Lion, and Geronimo&#39;s also with you.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Thank you...!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go in further...to the center of the World&#39;s Fair!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Is this the center of the World&#39;s Fair?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. There&#39;s a Japanese pavilion with a Japanese garden. It seems Japanese craftsmen built all of this.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even today in 2019, this site is preserved in Jackson Park as the Osaka Garden.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The street light that I made using a bamboo filament from Kyoto is also displayed. DC all the way!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But why is the Japanese pavilion the center?<br> I doubt it&#39;s anything to do with magecraft.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> No point wondering!<br> We&#39;ve already been through enough!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go. The Japanese pavilion is farther in.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> This is the pavilion? What a strange building.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this is... I don&#39;t know to express it...but everything is just...wrong...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Feels like everything&#39;s getting jammed together!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...This is a story where endless wandering, unnecessary repetition, and lies have all clumped together.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> At the end of all these nonsensical digressions and drawn-out plots...you have finally managed to reach your final destination.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...none of you are destined to reach the third anniversary!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You can&#39;t be...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way! A...(mumble, mumble) that resembles Senpai!?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A\uFF1F\uFF1F\uFF1F:</strong><br> My name is [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Master from a Chaldea different than your own...from one of the many parallel worlds.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> That&#39;s who I am.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Mommy... You&#39;re Mommy.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Yes. Jack the Ripper, Nursery Rhyme, and all the Servants you defeated...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> I&#39;m the one who summoned them all.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> But it may be easier for Fujimaru to understand if I say that I got them all from the gacha.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Tell me. You summoned us and created a Singularity. What is your plan?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Paul Bunyan.<br> I didn&#39;t summon you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh!?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> You&#39;re not a Servant. You&#39;re just a phantom, no more than an urban legend roaming about.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Paul Bunyan was just a joke amongst the settlers of North America. Then some trash tabloids wrote some articles on it for shits and giggles.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> She has no basis in myth, and nobody actually believes in her existence. She&#39;s the very lowest form of spiritual existence: a hazy shadow without a will.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> But then I let her possess udon dough, and gave her shape.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;m... I&#39;m...not a Heroic Spirit...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why the hell would you do that?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> That should be obvious! To make a welfare Servant to give out for the second anniversary of FGO!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Don&#39;t \u201Chuh?\u201D me!<br> You&#39;re a Master. I KNOW you know!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> For F2P Masters like me, welfare Servants are the most important Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry, during GSSR, I...um...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> No more boring small talk! The great thing about social games like this is that anyone can enjoy playing without thinking about them or even paying attention!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> An idyllic world where everyone is equal!<br> To make that so, strong gold Servants are necessary!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I used udon dough to create Bunyan&#39;s Spirit Origin. My plan was to produce a giant! To make the goddess who shapes the very world!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I get it now. Bunyan&#39;s legend contains mankind&#39;s universal belief in a deity of creation.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s not possible to summon an actual god, but an artificial one, possessing godlike qualities...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I see...that&#39;s me...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Right. That&#39;s why I poured all my Grails and QP into you! But even so... EVEN SO...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> What we actually got was just a wacky...useless thing!<br> If we gave YOU as a welfare, Chaldea would be DEAD!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You. Called. Bunyan. A. Thing.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Oh come on. What the hell else would I call it?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s a \u26051. \u26051!<br> You get those in the FP gacha!!!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> That thing is absolutely worthless!<br> No Servant below \u26054 is worth a damn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The number of \u2605s has nothing to do with trust.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Oh, big talk, huh? Trust is just something the weak use to cover their weakness! So why hasn&#39;t my little eggplant turned into a \u26055?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Strong bonds don&#39;t overcome lack of rarity.<br> You should know that as a Master...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> In the end, only the Masters who post Servants over Lv. 90 get picked as Support!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> They have a handful of limit broken Kaleidoscopes, and they have a surplus of event CEs!!!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> A world that celebrates only the ultra-whale Masters, where only they get all the glory and friend requests! That is what I am trying to put a stop to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Listen, you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone has their own way of playing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can only spend so much money,but we have infinite love to give!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What matters is embers, mats, skill gems, Grails, and time!!!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Hnnnnnnnnnghhhhhh!!! Your logic is...<br> I don&#39;t even have a comeback for that!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Humph. But let&#39;s chill it out a minute here.<br> Sure, our playstyles differ.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> But... Do you really want to give your loyalty to a development team who won&#39;t give you an NP animation skip button, and die with this useless Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why you trapped Bunyan in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Obviously! The only Servants we need are beautiful female Saberfaces!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wrong!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You need to stop right there before you curse us.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> There&#39;s no value in something without use.<br> Bunyan is... Well, she was a failure.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> So, I wanted her to vanish into a secluded forest.<br> But noooo, you had to bring her all the way here...</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> What I want are \u26055 Servants, or the one exception to that rule: my cutie, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;ve come this far, I&#39;ll have to eradicate Bunyan and all of you from this other world.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> How horrible!

What, are you thinking of fighting me?<br> Even though we&#39;re both Masters? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s all your fault.

Even if her lore was a joke in the early States,<br> I cannot ignore that she stands before me!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The only thing that must disappear is you, Master from another world.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Eh? Are you seriously going to fight me?<br> Come on, take a joke! This is like...a tiny prank!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> I mean, I also saved Humanity.<br> Don&#39;t I deserve Servants that I prefer and want?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Shut up!

Much more than usual.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Not that I&#39;m unhappy about your change, but I&#39;m not wild about this biting the hand that feeds you crap.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Fine. If you&#39;re going to defend Bunyan, I just have to fight you.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid you know too much, and now...you must die.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s your prim and proper party versus my poor but beautiful party.</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see which Chaldea reigns supreme!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Gwaaaaahhhh!!!<br> My C, B, AND A teeeeeeammms!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got plenty of \u26055s!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why you...why you!!!</p><p><strong>Nameless Master:</strong><br> Oh.

They were all so under leveled...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Being lazy and failing to level your Servants has finally come back to bite you.

Ah crap!<br> I let the truth spill out there at the last moment!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master.<br> You don&#39;t need to be sad about this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> She was consumed by her evil ambitions.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> She was no longer human...or maybe she wasn&#39;t from the start? Anyway, she was not a good Master.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We saved a soul who was swallowed up by an evil Spirit...

It was as if the city of Chicago was moving, like a living being.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The people who gathered came from various places eventually grew to number in the hundreds of thousands, and in time created a megalopolis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Chicago&#39;s eastern end had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Iberian Peninsula, while the western end reached Japan&#39;s Nerima District.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master and I have been in this city the whole time.<br> I feel we&#39;ve been enjoying our stay here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Except for Edison...who has been cooped up in a laboratory at the Japanese pavilion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where shall we go today?

We just need to be patient until Edison fixes the Spiritual World Communicator so we can get back in contact with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh? Is that Geronimo heading our way?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master, Mash!

I have borrowed her body, but I am not the one you know as Altera.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this Altera...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know. This one&#39;s super serious.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> I am the goddess Columbia.<br> The guardian of this land.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Columbia?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> A goddess who is a symbol for the United States.<br> She is related to the Roman goddess Libertas.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Rather than being a deity for worship, she&#39;s more like a personification of the nation. Like Uncle Sam.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Treating her as a goddess is actually quite insulting to indigenous people like me. I never imagined that I would actually see her in person...</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> I guard all those who live on this land.<br> Geronimo... You and I are of the same ilk.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Great Spirit, I only pray that you are the same goddess who brought forth corn and great harvest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So why was Edison...</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> He...got too close to the truth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Truth?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Edison and I were investigating the truth behind this world and Bunyan...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> His Spiritual World Communicator opened up the door to this world, and the giant Spirit Bunyan is the core of this world. Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> ...Correct.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> If your theory has gotten you this far, I suppose there&#39;s no need to hide it any longer.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Have you not noticed? This place is not a Singularity that the other Master created.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> This world is Paul Bunyan&#39;s own consciousness.<br> It is similar to what you call a Reality Marble...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Impossible. Paul Bunyan&#39;s Spirit Origin could not possibly maintain a Reality Marble of this caliber.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Living beings exist in this world.<br> Sentient people are living day-by-day here.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s neither a dream nor illusion. This world is real. It exists. So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s a Reality Marble that can contain something of that sort?</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> You know perfectly well of just what could make that possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Grail!</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Which means that the nameless Master turned out to be a formidable Master, after all.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> That Master possessed a Grail.<br> And mixing it with udon dough...created Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> The Third Magic that can grant any wish...<br> That Master did not understand the meaning of it at all.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> The Grail&#39;s wish was distorted by the udon dough, which is how Bunyan manifested.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying...that this unnatural world itself is Bunyan&#39;s inner world?</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Correct, Medicine Man...wise one.<br> It is the memory of the States.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Because it&#39;s a memory, it was warped into something ideal, into a mere fleeting dream.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> That other Master meant to seal Bunyan in here.<br> But the opposite happened. It brought her here as well.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Bunyan possesses an infinite potential for destruction and creation. It&#39;s potential the United States as a nation has in itself.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Thus, Bunyan will continue to shape and develop this world... And once it reaches its limit, all will be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that why that Master took away her axe?</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Correct. Though it was a futile effort.<br> This loop is already at its 12,520th cycle.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> And now that you have given Bunyan an axe, the cycle of creation and destruction has resumed.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> And Bunyan has seen outside this world. She has seen your Chaldea through that Spirit World Communicator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No... That can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Yes. At this rate, Bunyan&#39;s world will begin to encroach upon your world as well.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> The humanity that you all worked hard to restore will tolerate even a fabricated Heroic Spirit like Bunyan.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> And as such, some manner of chaos must ensue.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now you mention it, everyone was going bonkers...</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Exactly.<br> Do you understand now, Master of Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now you mention it,everyone beside me was going bonkers...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I hate to tell you this...but you were no exception, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Thus, you must live here as part of Bunyan&#39;s world forever. Just like that other Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The hell I am! This isn&#39;t the fate I signed up for!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to free Mash, the others, AND Bunyan!</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> ...I see. I knew you would say that, Master of Chaldea... Strong one.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Then I have no choice. I must destroy you, then remake you to incorporate you all into this world.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> I must maintain balance in the multiverse. For nine people to be happy, one must always be sacrificed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even still!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We will never give up, no matter what!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> Ungh... I cannot believe how strong you are!</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> You fought valiantly even against my true self...<br> The me not veiled by history&#39;s memories!</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> ...But I must still seal Bunyan away!<br> She is...too dangerous!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> Dangerous? I&#39;m dangerous?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bunyan!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;m too big. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t live in a city.<br> That&#39;s why I wanted to expand and make the city bigger.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I thought there would be somewhere I would belong as long as I searched for it. That&#39;s why I created, created, and created...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> But...that was all for...nothing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bunyan! That&#39;s not</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I get it. I&#39;m just something added on to this world. An extra. Just a piece of parsley put on a plate of hamburg steak as garnish...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> That&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to end all this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...The world...!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hnnng...where are we?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We are probably in Bunyan&#39;s inner world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t we already in her inner world?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The area before was just her consciousness on the surface. But now we are deep in her unconscious. This is a realm even I cannot fathom.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is a world so deep in her heart, that only a tremendously knowledgeable mage, an experienced spirit-tamer, and the guidance of the Spirits could help you reach such a place.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Were you to be swallowed by such darkness, no mere layman could help you escape.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master, Mash, I mean no offense, but do not leave my side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Kyaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s Nursery Rhyme!</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> Grrrrrrrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> ...!

Then run.<br> Don&#39;t hesitate, and don&#39;t turn back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A...suicide attack!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In the end, Heroic Spirits are simply familiars.<br> Mages should not hesitate. Soldiers should not fear.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Waitwaitwait\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, exactly! Hold that thought, Geronimo!<br> Your actions are ungentlemanly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Edison!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t you heard of the phrase:<br> a genius strikes when you least expect it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Edison!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I so expected it!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Self-sacrifice is indeed a noble thing to do.<br> It&#39;s much like Davy Crockett at the Alamo.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But he would also say something like this: a true gentleman&#39;s triumph would be to come back from the dead to rejoin the group!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A hero does not become so by dying, but by pursuing their hopes and dreams till the very end!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...You never cease to surprise me. Despite your clownish face, you always have a resolve for truth...guide of the lion Spirit.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather be called the incarnation of the thunderous lion!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I was merely playing dead, a truly ungentlemanly thing to do, for this very opportunity!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> And all the better with all the monsters now gathered here! Allow me to show you my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The brilliance of my light shall erase all ignorance, and free those trapped in the prison of imbecility!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Illuminate the girl&#39;s darkened heart!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> WFD: World Faith Domination!<br> ANNIVERSARY EDITION!</p><p><strong>Civilian:</strong><br> Huh...?

My Noble Phantasm strips away all things mysterious, and exposes all hidden truths!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The scene of this peaceful city is precisely the truth that Bunyan pursued.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I will use my WFD\u2122 to continue to keep things this way.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Go, Master!

Seize Bunyan&#39;s Grail, and destroy it before she is given status as a Heroic Spirit in the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Goddess Columbia:</strong><br> She is merely a being from folklore unworthy to be a Heroic Spirit. Destroying her should be possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you do that!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Once a story&#39;s been told, it&#39;s real! Nobody can say it didn&#39;t happen... Not even the original author can do that!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s the rule of storytelling. It&#39;s an absolute rule that can&#39;t be broken. Why? Because here there are people who also believe in us.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I cannot accept a world where minorities are trampled upon.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to be here.

I think that all the time!<br> Wait...does that mean I&#39;m worthless, too...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, no, that&#39;s not possible. Even if I were, I&#39;m a genius before I&#39;m worthless.

But it looks like there&#39;s a lot more than that going on here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s a Singularity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> SKIP! It&#39;s an event, right? Gimme materials!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!?<br> Senpai is acting strange!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci, is this another Singularity!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. It&#39;s a Singularity.<br> That&#39;s why I had Edison help me out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a region in North America that we can&#39;t observe with Chaldeas right now. That&#39;s why Edison and I were looking into it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Doing that has made us vulnerable, so someone took the opportunity to invade our world! And now we need to get out there and see what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So there you have it, Fujimaru.<br> Ready to Rayshift?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll roll that prize roulette until my finger snaps off!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Um, sorry to break it to you, but there&#39;s no prize roulette this time around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no! You killed Senpai!<br> S-Senpai, please get up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Eh? An NP animation skip button?<br> I don&#39;t think...that&#39;s in the game either...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm... I see. I get it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What? Did you figure something out, Edison?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t you noticed? Fujimaru has been acting and talking strange.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not just [\u2642 him /\u2640 her].<br> Everyone in Chaldea has been acting strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right...Andersen suddenly started speaking in bad poetry, and the other Servants suddenly started to have Altria-level appetites...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm. This is just a hypothesis, but it is possible that my Spiritual World Communicator contacting a Singularity like this...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...has resulted in everyone&#39;s deteriorating mental and intellectual states!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I dunno what that means but I like the way it sounds!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? No, Senpai!<br> That sounds bad. Really bad!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right. It&#39;s not about stringing together important-sounding words.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe everyone&#39;s acting highbrow because it&#39;s so peaceful here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I do sometimes get an urge to run around naked. Even Andersen is said to run around naked in elation when he finishes a manuscript.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Absolutely did not need to know that.)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t really deny that. It is worth noting, though, that things that threaten humanity may not always appear stylish, or even intelligent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Preach, Edison.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I might turn into a silly version of myself and chew up Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a bizarre conversation...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> And now we have discovered a Singularity! The only way, then, to investigate my theory is to apply the proper scientific methodologies!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Yeah, can&#39;t argue with you there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then, as acting commanding officer for Chaldea, I am officially issuing a new Order!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Get to that Singularity, investigate, and resolve it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood, roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yahoo!

Where are you going with that?</p><p><strong>Professor M:</strong><br> Have you not heard the phrase<br> \u201CStay tuned for the next episode\u201D?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Rrrrrrrr...<br> Get back to work, you two!</p><p><strong>Professor M:</strong><br> Owww! My back, my back! It made a sound backs should not make! Miss Fran, would you mind bending me back into shape?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Okay, Papa!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Dodgey professor, asking her to realign your back with her weapon is extremely dangerous.</p><p>\uFF0494-01-56-53-1-0</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> First place?<br> First place in what?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> What was it...? Oh, right, prison breaking...<br> I think it&#39;s about the outcome of the prison break!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my...<br> Right then! We need to escape, and quickly!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Keep going!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> (Sigh) I&#39;m beyond tired. I don&#39;t mind physical activity,<br> but it&#39;s such a downer when I can&#39;t see the sunshine.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I would agree.<br> However, escaping is our current priority.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> We should be fine. We have the blessings of the Buddha. We will definitely get out! Because we didn&#39;t do anything wrong! ...We haven&#39;t, right?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Wehave been busily digging. It is quite the deep exercise. I am learning a great deal.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Digging...quite deep...?<br> Hmm, did you just make a pun...?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> N-no. Absolutely not!<br> I would never do such a thing!!!</p><p>\uFF0494-01-56-54-1-0</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Ah yes, now I am one step closer to getting out of here. It&#39;s only a matter of time until I become the Demon King of the Prison Break Heaven!</p><p><strong>Mysterious Racer X:</strong><br> Prison Break Heaven... Heaven, you say?<br> Like heavenly food...angel food cake...mmm...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I may be locked up, but no lock can stop the rock! Oh,<br> don&#39;t forget to give us supplies when you come visit.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Racer X:</strong><br> I demand sweets! The food here freakin&#39; sucks!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Huh, maybe we should forget about escaping, and just take the place over? I&#39;ll be Warden Nobbu.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Racer X:</strong><br> Then I shall be Mysterious Executioner X.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Not much of a difference than now, is there!?</p><p>\uFF0494-01-56-55-1-0</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Shine forth, light! Sure we can call this the new dawn for the just and true age of the pharaoh!</p><p><strong>Caster of Storytelling:</strong><br> The light of dawn...<br> Indeed, seeing it always gives me a sense of relief.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Digging and burying are basically the same thing. I am the incarnation of the god of the underworld and the master of burial! I could not possibly lose at this!</p><p><strong>Caster of Storytelling:</strong><br> Cave-ins, lack of oxygen, flooding underground...<br> We were fortunate not to be literally buried...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (Gasp) ...! I was so intent on listening to your stories, I didn&#39;t realize we managed to dig through! We did great, didn&#39;t we!?</p><p><strong>Caster of Storytelling:</strong><br> I am humbled to receive such praise.<br> Then we shall revisit the story another time...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (It&#39;s wonderful that we lost track of time, but it&#39;s bad to be so wrapped up in what comes next, right?)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (I wonder how that story ends...?)</p>', 1564);
