However, during the moment of them preparing an attack, the effect will be drastically diminished.</p><p><strong>Independent Action: [A]</strong></p><p>It is primarily a distinct Skill of the Archer Class. A Skill granted to Emiya because he grew accustomed to mobilizing unaided since when he was alive. Even without a Magical Energy supply from his Master, it becomes possible for him to remain materialized for about a week at most.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Magecraft: [B]</strong></p><p>Emiya has learned Magecraft. From another angle, because he understands Magecraft, he consequently excels at the methods of killing mages. With this Skill\u2019s ranking, by all rights, it works as a bonus for all sorts of checks during the moments of doing combat against Casters.</p><p><strong>Affection of the Holy Grail: [A+]</strong></p><p>Emiya is being deeply loved by the Greater Holy Grail itself of some era. That love is even equivalent to the world\u2019s greatest curse. Due to the existence of this Skill, his Luck rank is being flipped up to even outside the standard. Without meeting specific conditions, it is possible for him to even break through the abilities of enemy Servants that cannot be typically broken through. However, this good luck is also something that mercilessly steals the happiness of others. He himself is not aware of the existence of this Skill, and he sometimes does not even hear the \u201Cvoices\u201D being whispered to him by the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Scapegoat: [C]</strong></p><p>A set of crafty techniques for one to survive the battlefield.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="chronos-rose-gather-ye-rosebuds-while-ye-may" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chronos-rose-gather-ye-rosebuds-while-ye-may" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chronos Rose: Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~10</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>\u201CTime flows, and even though the flower smiles to this day, it shall completely wither away tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>An ability to manipulate one\u2019s own time flow.

Due to this power that has been sublimated as a Noble Phantasm, it becomes possible for super consecutive attacks where when using them, he might as well be called invincible in Anti-Personnel Combat.</p><h1 id="phantasm-punishment-mystery-bisection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#phantasm-punishment-mystery-bisection" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Phantasm Punishment: Mystery Bisection</h1><ul><li>Rank: C+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 0~2</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>A knife that has the power of the double attributes of \u201CSevering\u201D and \u201CBinding\u201D \u2013 Emiya\u2019s own Origin \u2013 put into it.

An \u201Cimitation Heroic Spirit\u201D referred to as a Guardian, and moreover, someone who does not exist in the proper human history. This \u201Cwhat-if that probably would have been possible\u201D exists now only due to the threat that attempts to destroy human history itself from its very foundations\u2026 in the Grand Order case alone.</p><p>As a result of the Einzbern family not adopting the strategy of hiring an outside Master, Emiya did not meet with his wife who he was bound to meet; consequently, he neither separated from said wife, nor did he suffer discouragement that would come because of that separation; as a consequence, that heart of steel remained as steel, and before one would know it, his emotions completely withered away as well; thus, his soul was called out to the Ring of Deterrence.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Irisviel</strong></p><p>\u201CEinzbern\u2019s homunculus.

While Emiya still has a Hero\u2019s charm that is a little like in the olden days, it would have been nice if I produced something that gives off a sort of a prototype impression, you know; although I intended on drawing him a bit younger rather than drawing his appearance in his prime that is known primarily by his acquaintances, I wondered if I made his substance not quite complete yet too as he is surely identical to his prime appearance, or something like that, but as expected, there was an immense pressure put on me. After that, I wondered if I can do THIS and THAT successfully to capture the different nuances of his face in the anime version, Mr. Takeuchi\u2019s version, etc., and although I would not think about this matter to be thoughtlessly overambitious of me, I thought too hard about it, became frightened and fainted in agony afterwards.
