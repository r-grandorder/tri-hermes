You know what to do now, right?&quot;</p><p>I answer the deep voice with a polite &quot;yes&quot;.</p><p>The man patting my head nods once, lets go, and stands up.</p><p>...So, that was it.</p><p>If I&#39;d known then that it was our final moment together, I would have made him laugh with my best jokes.</p><p>I had practiced telling jokes a lot, in hope that I could bring a smile to his grave face.</p><p>I guess you could say I was sad that I couldn&#39;t tell him any of them.</p><p>&quot;Put the Association in your debt by the time you mature. I&#39;ll let you decide what to do after that.

I&#39;ll do my best to be a proper magus\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for a student to follow the words of their teacher.</p><p>Since then, through many twists and turns... I, Tohsaka Rin, have matured.</p><p>It has been ten years since the winter day on which my father went to war.</p><p>I haven&#39;t exactly been waiting for this moment, but I am excited.</p><p>That&#39;s only natural.</p><p>The event I have never forgotten about is about to start\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>Something is ringing.</p><p>Brrring. Brrring.</p><p>&quot;...Shut up. Stop it.&quot;</p><p>The sound doesn&#39;t stop.</p><p>It rings loudly as if I&#39;m an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What? Come on, I was up late last night, so...&quot;</p><p>It should let me sleep in a bit longer.</p><p>No, it has to let me sleep in.</p><p>I was deciphering my father&#39;s will until early this morning, and I&#39;ve used up too much magical energy.</p><p>In other words, my mind and body are dead tired.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, geez\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015you&#39;re really stubborn.&quot;</p><p>Brring. Brring. Brring. Brring.</p><p>The alarm clock doesn&#39;t speak my language.</p><p>So why does the ringing sound like it&#39;s telling me &quot;You&#39;re going to be late&quot;?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Late... Being late is bad...&quot;</p><p>Though that depends on the situation.</p><p>I&#39;m a good student, but maybe I can get to school at the last moment just for today.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right... I set the alarm thirty minutes early, so I should be able to sleep for thirty minutes more...&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?</p><p>Isn&#39;t that strange?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Set it thirty minutes early...?&quot;</p><p>I look at the alarm clock drowsily.</p><p>The clock is pointing exactly at seven.</p><p>I usually get up at six thirty, so the spare thirty minutes have already been used up.</p><p>...Oh, why can&#39;t I think when I wake up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>I stare at the alarm clock for several seconds.</p><p>Shutting it off, I decide to get out of bed.</p><hr><p>Passing through the cold hallway, I enter the cold living room.</p><p>It&#39;s seven o&#39;clock on the last day of January.</p><p>Fuyuki City is usually pretty warm in the winter, but this morning it&#39;s as cold as any other city.</p><p>I can even see my breath indoors, and on top of that, there&#39;s no one else in the house to warm it up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heater, heater...&quot;</p><p>Turning on the heater, I head to the bathroom.</p><p>At times like this, living on your own is inconvenient.</p><p>If there were someone to wake up before me, the living room would be warm by now.</p><hr><p>I wash my face at the sink.</p><p>I brush my long hair and get ready.</p><p>A cold morning, a cold sink.</p><p>The only advantage is that the cold water clears your sleepiness completely.</p><hr><p>I tie my ribbon and I&#39;m all ready.</p><p>All I have to do is eat breakfast and head out.</p><p>Looking at the clock, it&#39;s only a bit past seven, and I&#39;m a bit disappointed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Man, I guess I don&#39;t have to run after all.&quot;</p><p>Then again, I would never do anything as clumsy as running to school anyway.</p><p>It is the custom of the Tohsaka family to act with composure and elegance at all times.</p><hr><p>Taking a custom like that seriously must mean that my family originated from a very high-class background indeed.</p><p>Owning this old western-styled mansion is proof of that and on top of it, the Tohsaka family is a bloodline of sorcerers able to use the power of &quot;magecraft&quot;.</p><p>If you&#39;re talking about age, our family has an ancient history.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, it&#39;s not something I can brag about.&quot;</p><p>Actually, I can&#39;t speak openly about it at all.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, by the way. I, Tohsaka Rin, am a magus\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Who on earth can I brag to like that?</p><hr><p>magecraft is just what it sounds like... magecraft.</p><p>I don&#39;t care if you get ideas like abracadabra or whatever.</p><p>You can just think of us as people who do strange things by casting spells.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, though it&#39;s not like we fly around on brooms or make stars appear with a wave of a wand.</p><p>...Well, we could do that, but we don&#39;t bother as it&#39;s kind of meaningless.</p><p>We&#39;re basically heretics who hide ourselves from the world.</p><p>We&#39;re prohibited from standing out and even if we weren&#39;t, we would rather be at home studying magecraft.</p><hr><p>On top of that, the word sorcerer is completely inaccurate.</p><p>To be precise, there are only five sorcerers in the world.</p><p>Things no one can do, things beyond the ability of modern science... The ones who can make such &quot;miracles&quot; are the ones we call sorcerers.</p><hr><p>Miracles that can never be achieved, regardless of time or effort... those we call True magecraft.</p><p>Those things that are mysterious, but achievable with time and effort... those we call magecraft.</p><p>That&#39;s why what I do is called magecraft rather than True magecraft.</p><p>It&#39;s complicated, but that&#39;s how it is, so just accept it.</p><hr><p>Well, to be honest, the modern world doesn&#39;t recognize the existence of magi.</p><p>As we believe, control, and learn things that are immeasurable, our existence is incompatible with the modern world.</p><p>Because it&#39;s kind of meaningless.</p><p>Going to a normal school and becoming a normal adult will bring you far more happiness than studying magecraft.</p><hr><p>Human technology is great.</p><p>In the past few hundred years, it has been leading the way ahead of magecraft.</p><p>Nothing is impossible for humans.</p><p>The miracles once only possible through magecraft are now &quot;tools&quot; and not miraculous at all.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Still, magecraft has its good points.</p><p>Just as there are things possible only through science,</p><p>there are also things possible only through magecraft.</p><p>It was the master of the Tohsaka family who said that if science is moving toward the future, magecraft is moving toward the past.</p><p>Something about the past and the future ending up at the same place, everything always running toward the zero point.</p><p>Let&#39;s put off all these difficult discussions. They should wait until we&#39;re old.</p><hr><p>Finishing breakfast, I grab my bag.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh yeah. I should bring the pendant.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t really want to take the thing to school, but it&#39;d be a waste just to leave it here.</p><hr><p>&quot;This thing is a hundred years old after all. It&#39;s by far the greatest jewel in the house.&quot;</p><p>No, that&#39;s an understatement. It&#39;s much stronger than that.</p><p>I found this after decoding Father&#39;s will last night. It contains the equivalent of ten years of my magical energy.</p><p>There was said to be an heirloom, and this might well be it.</p><hr><p>We, the magi of Tohsaka, are skilled at the transformation of power. We put our magical energy into jewels whenever we have free time.</p><p>To put it simply, the jewels are bullets and we are the gun.</p><p>The only other thing I can say I received from my father is the Magic Crest of the Tohsaka family engraved on my left arm.</p><p>In essence, this is the proof of the successor, and it&#39;s like a tattoo that condenses all the inherited magecraft of the Tohsaka family.</p><hr><p>&quot;...It hasn&#39;t started yet, but I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt to be careful.&quot;</p><p>I put the pendant, which can now be said to be my father&#39;s memento, into my pocket.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is the last resort. Pretty much anything is possible with the magical energy contained in this.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s seven thirty.</p><p>I should get going or I&#39;ll be late for school.</p><hr><p>&quot;Schlie[szlig]ung. Verfahren Drei.&quot;</p><p>I weave my words with magical energy quickly.</p><p>Being a magus, I can&#39;t let my guard down when leaving my house.</p><p>Even though there&#39;s never been a single robber, wandering child, nor a stray cat.</p><p>...And I don&#39;t think my neighbor has ever come to say hello, either.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I don&#39;t really care. But not even a stray cat? What&#39;s up with that?&quot;</p><p>I look up at the mansion I&#39;ve grown so accustomed to over the years.</p><p>Fuyuki is certainly a strange city with many Western-styled houses on this side of town and an area full of Japanese-styled houses just beyond the intersection.</p><hr><p>I guess it&#39;s because many foreign families came to live here a long time ago, but even so, I don&#39;t see many foreigners around here now.</p><p>There&#39;s a foreigners&#39; cemetery in the new city across the river, but it only has the graves of the first generation of families.</p><hr><p>&quot;Maybe the soil of Japan didn&#39;t suit them.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ll go to the church and ask the priest sometime.</p><p>He knows about lots of boring things.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>Stepping outside, I feel a certain incongruity.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s up? It&#39;s quieter than usual...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s especially quiet with no sense of the morning&#39;s noisiness.</p><p>At seven thirty, the street should be filled with students going to school and people going to work.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I guess there are days like this.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps everyone slept in today.</p><p>It&#39;s unusually cold, so I bet everyone&#39;s still wrapped up in their warm beds.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm... But even so...&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s strange that I haven&#39;t seen even one student so far.</p><p>At seven thirty, you can usually see people in uniform here and there.</p><p>But I&#39;m the only person at the school gates, and it looks like the clubs are just starting their morning practice.</p><p>In other words, the only explanation is...</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Tohsaka? You&#39;re up early today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...As I suspected.&quot;</p><p>With a small sigh, I turn to the girl who addressed me.</p><p>&quot;Morning. It really is cold today, huh?&quot;</p><p>This girl, speaking so frankly, is Mitsuzuri Ayako.</p><p>She&#39;s my classmate in class 2-A, and there are a lot of stories about her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Mitsuzuri-san. Please excuse the abrupt question, but do you know what time it is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? It&#39;s almost seven. Are you still asleep?&quot;</p><hr><p>She waves her hand in front of me, wondering if I&#39;m alright.</p><p>She is one of the few friends who know I am not a morning person.</p><p>...In other words, she thinks I&#39;m not fully awake yet.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess the clocks at my house were an hour fast. All of them.</p><p>Not just my alarm clock, but the wall clocks as well.&quot;</p><p>Really, just what&#39;s going on here?</p><p>Did Father arrange for all the clocks to go mad when the pendant was removed from the basement?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing. Anyways, are you off to morning practice as usual?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. The archery club has lots of problem students and one good member quit. So I have to get them to look good to attract the new freshmen in April.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. There&#39;s always something to worry about, isn&#39;t there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can say that since it&#39;s none of your concern. Oh, do you wanna come? The guys will love it if you come and watch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Archery club, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have three acquaintances in the archery club.</p><p>One is Ayako, the person before me right now, and the other two are people I barely talk to.</p><p>And for one of those two, the word acquaintance doesn&#39;t really suffice.</p><p>I became friends with Ayako because I had been watching the archery club from afar.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll go if all I have to do is watch. I have nothing else to do this early anyways.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great, let&#39;s go right now then.&quot;</p><hr><p>The impressive archery range is one of our school&#39;s outstanding aspects.</p><p>Perhaps the director is just interested in archery, but the range is much too fancy for a mere school club.</p><hr><p>&quot;Come on, there&#39;s still time before practice, so let&#39;s go in and have some tea.&quot;</p><p>Happy about something, Ayako drags me in by the hand.</p><p>It&#39;s a bad habit of hers. She talks like a guy when she&#39;s expressing her true feelings.</p><hr><p>As Ayako said, there&#39;s no one in here.</p><p>While sipping hot tea, we prepare for today&#39;s class.</p><p>The tea tastes really good in this open winter environment.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll come straight to the point. How&#39;s it going, Tohsaka? Have you found a reliable partner yet?&quot;</p><p>So.</p><p>As there&#39;s no one else around, Ayako comes straight out and asks me a ridiculous question.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh, that&#39;s a really direct way of asking.</p><p>Judging from your tone of voice, you&#39;ve already found yours?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No comment. I&#39;m going to keep it a secret until you tell me. So what&#39;s going on? Looking at your tired face, I feel like I&#39;m right.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Another no comment... but, you&#39;d probably see through my lies. Unfortunately, not yet on my part.</p><p>How about you? I assume you don&#39;t have time to take it easy either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;True, but things aren&#39;t looking good for me. I could get one right away, but it&#39;s not that kind of matter, you know? Our future depends on this, so I can&#39;t just compromise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. So you don&#39;t want to choose hastily and lose to me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. The important part is making you lose. What I get comes second.&quot;</p><p>She laughs boldly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez. We really are alike.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. When we first met, I warned you we&#39;d have this kind of relationship.&quot;</p><p>Yes, she did indeed.</p><p>I was certainly surprised when at our first meeting, she said &quot;We&#39;ll probably end up with a &#39;kill or be killed&#39; relationship&quot;.</p><hr><p>Or in other words, &quot;Unless we go all out against each other, we&#39;ll never really be friends&quot;.</p><p>I agreed with her on that, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve had a friend-or-foe relationship for two years.</p><hr><p>&quot;By the way, why are we talking about this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? You&#39;re the one who started it, Tohsaka.</p><p>You said there&#39;s something wrong with a woman never having a boyfriend, so we decided to see which of us could get a boyfriend before the third year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh yeah. Just tit for tat, I suppose. And did we say the loser would obey the winner for a day?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Even kids don&#39;t make promises like that nowadays, but it&#39;s not like we&#39;re sore losers.</p><p>Whatever the result, the loser will obediently follow the winner&#39;s orders. Just thinking about it gets me excited.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ayako laughs.</p><p>Honestly.</p><p>She&#39;s so serious about this. Mitsuzuri Ayako is such a difficult person to deal with.</p><hr><p>...Though, I can&#39;t wait to beat Ayako either, so neither of us are people you want to deal with.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. But, Mitsuzuri-san? It&#39;s fine to enjoy yourself, but you should take care not to get your objectives wrong. You know that&#39;s not the only point of the contest, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I can&#39;t call it a complete victory unless I beat you with a relationship you would really be jealous of.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s the biggest problem for us. No matter how good a guy it is, there&#39;s no point if we can&#39;t bring ourselves to love him.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ayako sighs heavily.</p><p>To my knowledge, Mitsuzuri Ayako is said to hate men.</p><p>Rumors are never to be trusted, however. As she suggested this match, rather than hating men, I think she just didn&#39;t have a chance.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But, that aside.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold it. What do you mean, &#39;us&#39;?</p><p>I&#39;ll say it right now, but I&#39;m not cold-hearted like you. I&#39;d have no problem loving a guy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a lie. Or you&#39;re fooling yourself. There&#39;s no way you&#39;d ever be concerned about a guy.</p><p>You&#39;ve never given one good response to any of the confessions made to you. If you had even the slightest interest, you&#39;d think of going out with them. But you keep declining, so it must mean you&#39;re not interested in men.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re not thinking enough. Couldn&#39;t we say I&#39;m declining because I already have someone I like?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow, that&#39;s a good answer. I like that, it&#39;s romantic.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ayako nods seriously, not making fun of me.</p><p>Her sigh says, &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that was the case.&quot;</p><p>...Geez.</p><p>I really can&#39;t keep anything from her.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re right, I think so too.&quot;</p><p>Well, it&#39;s exactly as she says.</p><p>I know myself how cold I am.</p><hr><p>&quot;I admit it. I know nothing when it comes to love and relationships.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly. You&#39;re the one who said we&#39;re alike.</p><p>...Oh, it&#39;s almost seven. Let&#39;s leave the secret talk there. You never know when someone might walk in on us, and we should act like proper students.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I never knew you had social manners like that. It was worth getting up early just to hear that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh, not so much as you. My social manners are nothing compared to yours. You hide yourself so much it almost seems like you&#39;re a different person.&quot;</p><p>Ayako gives an exaggerated sigh.</p><p>Both of the teas she made are now empty, and it&#39;s my turn to make it.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, why don&#39;t you join a club, Tohsaka? I won&#39;t listen to any lies about not having the athletic ability. I&#39;m still bitter that I lost to you in all aspects in last year&#39;s physical testing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh? But you beat me in lung capacity. And also in weight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahahaha! All right, I&#39;m three kilograms heavier than you!</p><p>...Hey, being heavier isn&#39;t something to be happy about, you fox!&quot;</p><p>Ayako slams on the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Be careful, you might spill the tea, Mitsuzuri-san. You&#39;re the captain, so you should treat this place with care.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up. I&#39;m your rival first and captain of this place second.</p><p>Naturally, if there are no members around, I&#39;ll go after you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ayako looks at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p>This girl has her own sense of beauty and she always says,[r]</p><p>&quot;Beautiful people have to do some kind of martial arts.&quot;</p><hr><p>She&#39;s a bold person experienced in most martial arts.</p><p>She joined the archery club with no experience and is now the captain as if it were only natural.</p><p>She&#39;s probably one of the top three people in the school you should never disobey, regardless of gender.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, isn&#39;t it a problem to claim you&#39;re not the captain if there are no members around?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. I&#39;m the captain in name only, so all I can do is keep an eye on the problem members.</p><p>There are people better than me, so it&#39;s not a very dignified captaincy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? But Fujimura-Sensei says that your skills are outstanding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh... Well, if she says so, that gives me some confidence. Yeah, I guess it&#39;s no good to think about people who don&#39;t come here any more. Yeah, if Fujimura-Sensei said that, I guess I should take being captain more seriously.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. Speaking of which, it&#39;s almost time for the club members to arrive, right? I&#39;ll get going but you stay and be a good captain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, you&#39;re not going to stay and watch?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t understand. Watching from a distance is fine, but outsiders shouldn&#39;t be in the range, should they?&quot;</p><hr><p>Just as I rise, someone enters the range.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, captain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, morning, Matou. You&#39;re alone this morning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be of help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, it&#39;s okay. If he doesn&#39;t want to come, there&#39;s no point forcing him to.&quot;</p><p>Ayako addresses the club member who just entered.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be going. See you later, Mitsuzuri-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, see you later, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Thank you for coming, Tohsaka-Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks. You take care too, Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>I leave the range trying not to interrupt them.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Tohsaka, good morning. I&#39;m lucky to see you so early.&quot;</p><p>Bad luck. I&#39;ve run into someone I don&#39;t want to see.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Matou-kun. You&#39;re early today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. As the captain, I have to come early as an example to others.&quot;</p><p>This smiling guy is Matou Shinji, of class 2-C.</p><p>He&#39;s the vice-captain of the archery club and owner of the hearts of half the girls in this school.</p><hr><p>Kind of an idol, good looking, good grades, sociable, and kind to girls.</p><p>I&#39;m not too well-informed in such areas, so I&#39;ve only heard all this from my classmates.</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your good mood, but you&#39;re missing a word, Matou-kun. It&#39;s an important word, so I don&#39;t think you should forget it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? What do you mean missing a word?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re missing the &#39;vice-&#39; part, vice-captain. You should watch out. It makes no difference whether you&#39;re the captain or the vice-captain, but if you put a lot of weight on it, people might think you&#39;re concerned about it, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...</p><p>You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll be careful from now on. Thank you, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve done nothing to earn your thanks, but I guess it doesn&#39;t matter if you think otherwise.&quot;</p><p>Bidding him goodbye, I leave the range.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. You came to watch, right? Then you should stay and watch. You&#39;re very welcome here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d rather not. I don&#39;t want to interrupt the morning practice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. If anyone&#39;s bothering you, I&#39;ll just kick them out, so come in for a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t want to be a bother.</p><p>Besides, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m interested in archery.</p><p>I don&#39;t like watching people I don&#39;t know practicing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What? You didn&#39;t have any interest in archery?</p><p>...Oh, so that&#39;s why you were watching us after school.&quot;</p><p>......</p><p>I don&#39;t know what he thinks the reason was, but he&#39;s undoubtedly making a big misunderstanding.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, so you knew, Matou-kun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, our eyes met many times, yours and mine. After I shot, you would always be looking at me, right?</p><p>I wanted to call out to you, but it&#39;s the rules, you know? We can&#39;t raise our voice on the range.&quot;</p><hr><p>As if happy about something, Shinji moves in closer to me.</p><p>His smile carries a sense of superiority.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I misunderstood. I thought you liked archery, but you actually have no interest in it, right? So why were you watching the range?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Oh, I see now.</p><p>Yes, the conversation could certainly have been taken that way.</p><hr><p>&quot;Can you move away, Matou-kun? I really don&#39;t like people coming so close to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh? Tohsaka, what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Honestly, it seems you still don&#39;t understand.</p><p>...It&#39;s not my style, but I&#39;ll put it in terms even you can understand.</p><p>Matou-kun, I&#39;m saying that I have even less interest in you than in archery. Frankly, I never even knew you were in the range, and I&#39;m not about to start looking out for you now either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015W-What...!&quot;</p><p>As if I&#39;ve angered him, he reaches out for me violently.</p><p>I easily avoid it and turn my back on him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Goodbye, Matou-kun. It&#39;s good to have some ego, but you shouldn&#39;t let it grow too large.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you...!&quot;</p><p>He sounds like he wants to say more, but it doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s going to scream or come after me.</p><hr><p>...Geez, he really is all show.</p><p>If he was just a little bit more mature, he wouldn&#39;t be so much trouble for the people around him.</p><hr><p>From the back of the school where the archery range is based, I enter the school building.</p><p>It&#39;s past seven, but I can&#39;t see anyone in the hallway.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Tohsaka-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Good morning, Fujimura-Sensei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, good morning, Tohsaka-san. I&#39;m so happy you greeted me properly.&quot;</p><hr><p>The strange woman seems to be crying of happiness.</p><p>...It&#39;s hard to believe, but this person of surpassing friendliness and cheerfulness is a teacher at this school.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh, Sensei... is there a way to greet you improperly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course there is. First years always greet me properly, but the older ones never greet me by my last name. You shouldn&#39;t copy their rudeness, okay?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t really understand, but I won&#39;t be rude to you, Sensei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good girl. Oh, I wish everyone was as good as you, Tohsaka-san.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fujimura-Sensei waves goodbye and leaves.</p><p>Fortunately, she isn&#39;t my homeroom teacher.</p><p>Fujimura-Sensei teaches English.</p><p>She has such a kind face, but she also has a black belt in kendo, and I hear she was respected as the &quot;Tiger of Fuyuki&quot; in her student days.</p><hr><p>...Though, that&#39;s a bit strange.</p><p>Wouldn&#39;t a tiger normally be feared, not respected?</p><p>Apparently in a good mood, Fujimura-Sensei heads for the archery range.</p><p>For some reason, she&#39;s in charge of the archery club and not the kendo club.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s almost seven-thirty.</p><p>I can see a few students doing club activities outside, but there&#39;s no sign of anyone in the school building.</p><p>But still...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Gah, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I bump into someone who greets me rudely.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Student President. Are you patrolling the school building this early in the morning? Or perhaps taking care of the club rooms? Not that I care, but you&#39;re certainly diligent.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh! What are you planning? What are you doing here? You&#39;re not in any clubs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just felt like it. I don&#39;t get up early like your family does, Ryuudou-kun.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>The Student President makes an unhappy face.</p><p>For some reason, I seem to be his enemy.</p><p>I really don&#39;t know why.</p><p>...Perhaps it&#39;s just because I said &quot;skip the temples, they&#39;re boring&quot; in a meeting to plan for the field trip.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Let me ask you a question, Tohsaka. Have you been staying at school until late at night recently?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. You should know I always go straight home, Ryuudou-kun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. This is my job, so naturally I know about everyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So you don&#39;t even have to ask, right? I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re asking, but isn&#39;t it bad to force student council jobs onto outsiders?</p><p>You should collect information on your own. Don&#39;t rely on outsiders like me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot, how are you an outsider!?</p><p>Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know how you worked your evil deeds on our Treasurer, you fox!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you misunderstand. I was merely working out how much each club should receive because Mitsuzuri-san asked me to.</p><p>I think it&#39;s only right for students to take an interest in where their money is going.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...H-How can damaging our Treasurer&#39;s psyche enough to keep him off school for a week be &#39;only right&#39; for any student? As always, I&#39;m amazed by your way of thinking.&quot;[l]</p><hr><p>&quot;The same to you. You should keep a watch on those under you.[l]</p><p>It&#39;s not fair to favor the non-sporting clubs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that. That&#39;s why I had intended to deal with the matter myself\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei, the repairs are done.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015And then.</p><p>A guy appears who I didn&#39;t expect to find here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, sorry Emiya. I&#39;m the one who asked for help, but it seems like you&#39;re doing all the work. Forgive me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. So, where next? There&#39;s not much time left.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, the AV room is next. It seems it&#39;s been working badly for a while, but it finally died.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It can&#39;t be fixed if it&#39;s dead. It would be quicker to just buy a new one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...True, but it&#39;d help if you could take a look at it. It might be dead to my eyes, but only faking it to yours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Well, let&#39;s take a look.&quot;</p><hr><p>The Student President leaves with the male student.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My thoughts have stopped at this sudden event.</p><hr><p>The guy with wrenches and spanners in hand turns back as if remembering something.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re up early, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>And with that, he leaves.</p><hr><p>...Was that supposed to be a greeting?</p><p>The student whom the president called &quot;Emiya&quot; leaves quickly.</p><p>Emiya... that would be Emiya Shirou, from class 2-C.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s fine, but...&quot;</p><p>How can I put it?</p><p>I just think it&#39;s hard to tell whether a guy who looks at home holding a wrench is useful or scary.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s seven thirty in the morning, and there&#39;s no one in class 2-A.</p><p>&quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll study ahead.&quot;</p><p>I sit at my desk and work on a few math problems.</p><p>There&#39;s thirty minutes until homeroom... I guess I&#39;ll just be bored until my classmates arrive.</p><hr><p>Fourth period ends and the noisy lunch break begins.</p><p>Our school has a cafeteria, but half the students stay in the classroom.</p><hr><p>Actually, most of the ones who stay are girls.</p><p>The cafeteria food is rather roughly made, so girls tend to dislike it and as a result...</p><p>&quot;Ah, um, Tohsaka-san...! W-Would you like to have lunch with us...!?&quot;</p><p>...Girls end up eating lunch together like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thank you, Saegusa-san, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m eating at the cafeteria today. I slept in this morning and didn&#39;t have time to make lunch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I see... I&#39;m sorry to invite you without realizing that. I guess I&#39;m being a bother.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saegusa-san looks downcast as if apologizing.</p><p>She&#39;s one of the calmest in a class full of calm students, and a kind person who cares about me for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so. It just happened that way today, so don&#39;t worry about it. Please ask me again tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>I smile at her from the bottom of my heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, yes. I guess even you sleep in from time to time.&quot;</p><p>My smile must have relaxed her as she returns it with her own.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Her smile is cute.</p><p>Saegusa Yukika-san isn&#39;t the most beautiful person, but her smile warms the hearts of everyone around her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. I try not to let it show, but I actually sleep in quite often. I&#39;m not in any clubs because I can&#39;t get up in the mornings.&quot;</p><p>Saegusa-san&#39;s expression reveals her surprise.</p><p>Her presence really relaxes me, but I can&#39;t just have fun talking.</p><p>If I keep talking to people like this, I&#39;m bound to reveal my true self.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m off to the cafeteria. Enjoy your lunch, Saegusa-san.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. You too, Tohsaka-san.&quot;</p><p>We exchange a warm goodbye and she returns to her group of girls.</p><hr><p>It seems she&#39;s eating with Makidera-san and Himuro-san.</p><p>Oh yeah, Saegusa-san is the manager of the track team.</p><p>Makidera and Himuro-san are the track team&#39;s hopefuls.</p><p>Makidera is a friend I sometimes go window-shopping with, but I don&#39;t know Himuro-san that well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, you were rejected, Yukicchi? Didn&#39;t I tell you Tohsaka wouldn&#39;t bring lunch? If you want to eat with her, you&#39;ll have to make her lunch too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Maki, can&#39;t we just go to the cafeteria too, then?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No way. There isn&#39;t enough room in that place for people who bring their own lunches. And even if we did sit with Tohsaka, the men&#39;s glares would be annoying as hell.</p><p>Like last vacation! We went to hang out together, but she&#39;s the only one who got any attention. Don&#39;t you just hate people who have to show off their beauty like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>Makidera speaks without thinking as the girls surround Saegusa-san&#39;s desk.</p><p>In contrast to her nasty mouth, she&#39;s a Japanese beauty who looks wonderful in a kimono.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, I think that Tohsaka-sama can hear you.&quot;</p><p>In contrast to Makidera&#39;s loudness, Himuro is the cool, steady type.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ack, crap, Tohsaka heard that? Ugh, she&#39;s really glaring at me...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, I-I don&#39;t think she&#39;s glaring at you, really...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She is. She&#39;s scariest when she&#39;s smiling. Come on, take it easy Tohsaka. It&#39;s us we&#39;re talking about, right? I bought you taiyaki, remember?&quot;</p><p>She waves her chopsticks, puffing out her cheeks.</p><p>The knowledge that this girl&#39;s hobby is collecting wind chimes just shows that the world is far too complex.</p><hr><p>...Anyways, it&#39;s not good for Saegusa-san to keep watching this.</p><p>She&#39;s panicking, seeing Makidera continually talking bad about me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Saegusa-san.[l]</p><p>And Makidera-san? I&#39;m the one who paid, and it was crepes, not taiyaki. You should fix that habit of yours of changing the facts you remember, or I might have to reconsider things next time, okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh. That smile is really scary.&quot;</p><p>Makidera hides behind the lid of her lunch box.</p><p>Saying goodbye to the three of them, I leave the classroom.</p><hr><p>I shut the door behind me.</p><p>...And then,</p><p>&quot;Man, come on! There&#39;s no big difference between crepes and taiyaki, they&#39;re both just sweets wrapped up!&quot;</p><p>Makidera&#39;s words are ones no girl should ever speak.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Taiyaki and crepes, the same...!?&quot;</p><p>Is she really a girl? Are all sweets the same to her?</p><p>Perhaps she just has very convenient taste buds that can&#39;t tell a 500 yen crepe from an 80 yen taiyaki, but...</p><p>Why you... I could have saved 420 yen if I&#39;d just bought you taiyaki to begin with...!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why am I getting mad about this?&quot;</p><p>I guess I&#39;m still tired from last night.</p><p>The cafeteria would be too much effort, so I&#39;ll just get a drink and some bread and eat on the roof.</p><hr><p>I buy lunch and head for the empty rooftop.</p><p>It&#39;s a convenient location as no student would come near it in the wintertime.</p><p>It&#39;s too cold to eat, but that&#39;s a small price to pay for being able to eat without worrying about other people.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, lunch comes first.&quot;</p><p>I start on my tomato sandwich and hot lemon drink.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple lunch, but the taste is much improved in this peace and quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>I finish my sandwich and my hot lemon drink.</p><p>...I&#39;m a bit tired.</p><p>It&#39;s a difficult balance, being a good student while trying not to be too social.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s my vanity... no, my conviction, that I must be number-one both academically and physically.</p><p>If I am to be a student, I want to be the best, and it&#39;s unthinkable for me to dishonor the Tohsaka name.</p><p>So that&#39;s why I&#39;m a perfect student, flawless in all aspects.</p><hr><p>But at the same time, I also have a dangerous job as a magus, so I shouldn&#39;t associate with normal people.</p><p>Normally, any magus whose identity is discovered has no choice but to eliminate the witness.</p><p>...I don&#39;t want to do that.</p><p>So inevitably, my social life has become a shallow one.</p><hr><p>I only hang out with Makidera on weekends, and I try to refuse invitations from friendly people like Saegusa-san.</p><p>Even though I&#39;m the best honor student in the school, I live trying not to become too important to anyone.</p><p>Though, sometimes when I&#39;m tired like this, it makes me think that this life is rather boring.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s time already?&quot;</p><p>I finish my hot lemon drink and stand up.</p><p>I should stop drowning in sentimentality and go back to being the usual Tohsaka Rin once I go down the stairs\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Homeroom is at an end. Those of you on day duty, finish the daily report and check the locks.</p><p>Those of you without club activities are to go home quickly.&quot;</p><hr><p>2-A&#39;s homeroom teacher exits after repeating his usual line.</p><p>As far as I know, this line hasn&#39;t changed all year.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, you&#39;re going home already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. There was an event with Matou-kun this morning, so I&#39;m heading home before it becomes a bother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Haha, I thought so. Matou was in a bad mood this morning, so I thought you must&#39;ve given him a hard time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Did I cause you any trouble, Mitsuzuri-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not at all. It&#39;s normal for Matou to torment the younger students, and I think that kind of thing will be good mental training for him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, that&#39;s good. Well, I&#39;ll make up for it some other time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. Don&#39;t be put off and come by again!&quot;</p><hr><p>I head straight home.</p><p>It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have any business with the archery club or the student council, but I haven&#39;t had enough free time for them these past few days.</p><p>Once I leave school, Tohsaka Rin is no longer a student.</p><p>The rest of the day is not for myself as a student.</p><p>Instead, I must become a magus of the Tohsaka family\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Back at my house, I&#39;m greeted by the blinking light on my answering machine.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s unusual for me to get any messages. It was... just as I thought, it&#39;s you, Kirei.&quot;</p><p>I already know what he&#39;s going to say, but he&#39;ll be scary later if I don&#39;t listen.</p><p>When I press the play button, I hear a familiar voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s me. I&#39;m sure you know, but tomorrow is the deadline, Rin.</p><p>It&#39;s a problem for me if you take it easy. There are only two remaining seats.</p><p>I must ensure all the Masters are arranged quickly.&quot;</p><p>This priest shows no mercy as he gets right to the point.</p><hr><p>&quot;If you wish to abandon your right to become a Master, contact me today. It takes some time to dispatch a substitute magus.&quot;</p><p>Liar. Someone like you would be able to arrange a substitute in no time.</p><hr><p>&quot;You already show signs of the Command Spell. Quickly, summon your Servant and open the Command Spell.</p><p>Unless, of course, you&#39;re not planning to be a part of this Holy Grail War. If you value your life, you should run to the church quickly.&quot;</p><hr><p>The message ends there.</p><p>...His words are concise.</p><p>He&#39;s telling me that if I am to fight, I should get ready by today and if I&#39;m not going to fight, I&#39;m an eyesore and should just retire quickly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, you don&#39;t have to tell me that.&quot;</p><p>Well, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>Today is as late as the deadline can be extended.</p><p>Fortunately, I was able to decode Father&#39;s will last night.</p><p>My preparations are ready.</p><p>All that remains is\u2015\u2015\u2015yes, obtaining the qualification to enter this fight...</p><hr><p>&quot;The Holy Grail War... a fight to the death for the one and only Holy Grail. A ritual of the Holy Grail passed down for hundreds of years, huh?&quot;</p><p>The magi who participate in the Holy Grail War are called Masters.</p><p>This is not so much a rank, rather it indicates &quot;one who is in control&quot;.</p><hr><p>The requirement to enter the Holy Grail War.</p><p>That is to summon a familiar called a Servant, and to form a contract with it.</p><p>No matter how great a magus a person is, one is not considered a Master until he has a Servant under him.</p><hr><p>Servants are beings very different from normal familiars.</p><p>The methods of summoning and controlling them are different as well.</p><p>A magus planning to enter the Holy Grail War usually prepares a catalyst to summon a Servant, but....</p><hr><p>&quot;...Really, I wish Father could have left me something with a connection to Saber.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t have anything with any &quot;connection&quot;.</p><p>I can summon a Servant.</p><p>If I wanted to, I could summon one right now and form a contract with it.</p><p>The town&#39;s sacred ground is under our jurisdiction.</p><p>As the daughter of the Tohsaka family which has protected this town through the generations, I will not lose to magi from elsewhere.</p><hr><p>But that said... I guess you can&#39;t go out to sea without a compass. Or perhaps I should say things are completely unplanned?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Servants are attracted to symbols.</p><p>If you want to summon a strong Servant, you need something that has a connection to that Servant.&quot;</p><p>In other words, a sword, armor, talisman, bone of that Servant, or something like that... something valuable beyond belief.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I was hoping there&#39;d be something like that in Father&#39;s will, but... No, this is a great trump card too. But still....&quot;</p><p>The pendant I found last night in the basement is one of the best Artifacts in its class.</p><p>It&#39;s great in its own way.</p><p>It&#39;s great, but it won&#39;t help me to summon my servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh! It&#39;s fine. I can do it without help from that sort of thing. After all, there can&#39;t exist any Masters capable of handling Saber other than myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015All right, I&#39;ve decided.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to make Kirei complain any more by postponing it any longer, and it&#39;s not like me to wait until the last second.</p><p>It&#39;ll come down to just trying it.</p><p>I&#39;ll face the summoning tonight with full power and obtain Saber by force...!</p><hr><p>Late at night.</p><p>The clock is about to strike two.</p><p>This is the best timeframe for my magical energy.</p><p>The peak of my magical energy is at exactly two in the morning.</p><p>Since this will be my first and last chance, I can&#39;t afford any mistakes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Withdrawal within elimination, engrave four areas and surround with the summoning circle... right.&quot;</p><hr><p>I engrave the circle onto the floor of the basement.</p><p>You don&#39;t need a large-scale summoning to summon the Servant.</p><p>Servants are called forth by the Holy Grail.</p><p>As the Master&#39;s priority is to keep the Servant in this world and to supply them with enough magical energy to substantiate, the Holy Grail takes care of the summoning.</p><hr><p>&quot;Bare and silver and iron.

What are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those are your first words? I guess I&#39;ve been called to a terrible Master.&quot;</p><p>The man in red gives an exaggerated shrug.</p><p>&quot;Maybe I&#39;m the most unlucky of all,&quot; he adds.</p><p>...I do declare.</p><p>This guy has a twisted personality.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But this would be the Servant?</p><p>Since they call it a familiar, I thought it was something shapeless, but this is human-like.</p><hr><p>...No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p>Just standing here, I can tell this thing has outrageous amounts of magical energy.</p><p>Don&#39;t be fooled by its appearance.</p><p>This is certainly an existence far beyond human, a &quot;ghost&quot; that has reached the level of spirits as a human.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t be overwhelmed forever.</p><p>That thing is mine.</p><p>So, I&#39;ll have to change my thinking from now on.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Just to check, but you are my Servant, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to ask. Are you my Master? This is the first time I&#39;ve been summoned so roughly, so to be honest, I still can&#39;t grasp the situation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This is the first time for me as well. I&#39;ll have to refuse that kind of a question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. But when I was summoned, you were not in front of me. Explain to me what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Don&#39;t joke around and tell me you&#39;re like a newborn chick who can only determine your Master when you open your eyes.&quot;</p><hr><p>The unknown Servant frowns.</p><p>It&#39;s a rather vague response, and I cannot tell if he&#39;s angry at my complaint or impressed at how correct I am.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, anyway, what I&#39;m asking is. You&#39;re my servant and not anyone else&#39;s, right?</p><p>Until we clarify this, I have no obligations to answer any other questions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...That&#39;s what you say after failing your summoning? In this case, I think there are other things you should say.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing else. We have to clearly determine who&#39;s the master first.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>The Servant raises his brow.</p><p>Perhaps because it was an imperfect summoning, this guy isn&#39;t even trying to hide his dissatisfaction with me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. So we have to define who&#39;s master, huh? Your actions are full of mistakes, but it seems your mouth is rather better.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, I certainly agree with that opinion. Unless we make it clear who is the stronger and who the weaker, it&#39;ll be hard to handle each other.&quot;</p><p>The Servant looks at me meaningfully as he lays on the rubble.</p><hr><p>&quot;Who&#39;s the weaker...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I am a Servant, so I&#39;ll accept this Master-Servant relationship. But that&#39;s only according to the contract, right?</p><p>Who&#39;s superior and if the other is worthy to fight alongside with. That&#39;s a different story.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well? Are you a magus worthy to be my Master, young lady?&quot;</p><hr><p>The Servant grins.</p><p>He smashes my house and that attitude like he&#39;s king makes me angry enough, but now he asks me if I&#39;m worthy to be a Master...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m not asking for your opinions.</p><p>All I&#39;m asking is if you are my Servant or not.&quot;</p><p>I glare at him.</p><p>I will not lose to someone who looks down on me this frankly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm, I see, I see. So you&#39;re saying such an obvious question isn&#39;t even worth answering? How courageous. Your spirit is that of a splendid Master, but....&quot;</p><p>&quot;I s-a-i-d, don&#39;t get the order wrong...!</p><p>It&#39;s the duty of the summoner to confirm first. Now answer me. You are my Servant, right...!?&quot;</p><p>I step forward, ready to attack depending on his answer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez. You are a stubborn young lady. We&#39;re not getting anywhere this way.</p><p>...I guess it can&#39;t be helped. Let&#39;s say I am your Servant. In that case, would you be my Master? Just hypothetically.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;O-Of course...! If you&#39;re my Servant summoned by me, who else but me would be your Master...!?&quot;</p><p>I somehow cool my boiling head and glare at this rude guy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I see. Well, let&#39;s suppose that&#39;s true.</p><p>Then, where&#39;s the proof that you are my Master?&quot;</p><p>The Servant talks nonsense, grinning.</p><p>He must think I&#39;ll panic about this proof of Master thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here. This is proof that I&#39;m your Master, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>I show him the Command Spell on the back of my right hand.</p><p>Heh, don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know anything.</p><p>My father talked a lot about Masters, so I know about the Command Spell.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you satisfied? Are you still going to complain?&quot;</p><p>I thrust before him the proof that I&#39;m a Master.</p><p>The Servant in the rubble looks confused, then...</p><p>&quot;...Man. Are you serious, young lady?&quot;</p><p>His face clouds with discontent.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha... what do you mean, am I serious?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean, that way of thinking. So you&#39;re a Master if you have a Command Spell? A Command Spell is only a tool that governs the Servant.</p><p>Geez, you act like a Master just because of that?</p><p>What I wanted to see was, are you worthy for me to pledge my loyalty to?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah... uh.&quot;</p><p>T-That&#39;s true, but... you&#39;d normally think of the Command Spell when talking about the proof that one&#39;s a Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So, what? I&#39;m not fit to be a Master then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d like that, but no go. Since you have the Command Spell, it seems you are my summoner. It&#39;s unbelievable, but it seems you really are my Master.&quot;</p><p>He gives an exaggerated shrug of his shoulders.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015This is bad.</p><p>My boiling point is so low, it seems I won&#39;t be able to cool down in time.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;ll accept it.</p><p>You&#39;re my Master for now. But I have conditions as well. From now on, I will ignore your opinions. I will decide how to fight, and you will follow my plans.</p><p>This is the best I&#39;ll compromise on. You don&#39;t mind that, right, young lady?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Uh, I think this is it, Father.</p><p>I&#39;m almost at my limit.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. You accept unhappily, but what do you mean about ignoring my opinions? You&#39;re my Servant, right?&quot;</p><p>I ask him in a trembling voice, just in case.</p><p>There&#39;s the issue of the Command Spell too, so this is my last warning, the biggest compromise I can make.</p><hr><p>And to that...</p><p>&quot;Yeah, in name only. So, formally I&#39;ll obey you. But I&#39;m the one doing the fighting. You can hide in the basement here and stay there until the Holy Grail War ends.</p><p>That way, even an inexperienced person like you should make it out alive.&quot;</p><p>He tells me he has no hope for me with eyes full of disdain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, are you angry? No, I will respect your position, of course. I am called to help my Master win after all.</p><p>My victory is yours, and I shall give you everything that I earn in this fight. You shouldn&#39;t have any complaints about that, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to use the Command Spell anyway.</p><p>Well, you can leave the rest to me. You just worry about your own safe...ty...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m pissed\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Fine, if you say that, I&#39;ll use it!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Anfang...!&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no holding back now. I&#39;ve no sympathy for a twisted guy like him...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha... you&#39;re not...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly what you&#39;re thinking, you rude scum!</p><p>&quot;Vertrag...! Ein neuer Nagel Ein neues Gesetz Ein neues Verbrechen\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>(I announce to the Command Spell! By the order of the Holy Grail, give the law of obedience to this one, my Servant!)</p><hr><p>&quot;You idi...! Wait, are you insane, Master!? Who would use the Command Spell for something like this...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up!</p><p>Look, you&#39;re my Servant! You have to obey every single one of my orders, okay!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The symbol on my right hand throbs.</p><p>The three Command Spells.</p><p>The essence of the Holy Grail War, the three claims to the Servant&#39;s unconditional obedience, is now used.</p><hr><p>&quot;A-Are you not even thinking...! Using the Command Spell for such a general thing...!&quot;</p><p>Huh, it&#39;s too late now.</p><p>...First of all, I wasn&#39;t expecting this either.</p><p>I hate myself so much, I want to die.</p><p>To go ahead and use the important Command Spell for something like this...!</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>Leaving the ruined living room behind, we move to my room.</p><p>In front of me is the Servant who should be &quot;absolutely obedient&quot; from my Command Spell.</p><p>He&#39;s there, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I understand your personality now, Master.&quot;</p><p>How exactly is this &quot;absolutely obedient&quot;?</p><hr><p>&quot;Just to make sure... do you understand how important the Command Spell is, Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I know. It&#39;s the right to give your Servant three orders, right? What about it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. Look, the Command Spell forces the Servant to act according to an order.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t merely stop their actions, it strengthens their actions as well.</p><hr><p>For example, I can&#39;t instantly teleport to somewhere far away. But if you command me to &#39;go&#39; using your Command Spell, then assuming we have enough magical energy, such things become possible.</p><p>This is what is meant by unconditional obedience. It is the three crystallizations of a great magecraft that allows a Servant to surpass limits on their ability even they can&#39;t control. Well, only two now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I know that. It&#39;s fine, we still have two and that order I gave you isn&#39;t useless, either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. This was certainly a miscalculation on my part.</p><p>The Command Spell works poorly on broad orders.</p><p>For broad and long-lasting orders like &#39;protect me through this&#39; or &#39;win this battle&#39;, the power of the Command Spell weakens. The force will last a long time, but since the associated pain is weak, some Servants will be able to disobey.</p><hr><p>In contrast, a single, simple order like &#39;deliver the next blow with all your power&#39;, or &#39;don&#39;t break that glass&#39; is absolute, and even the most powerful Servants will find it hard to disobey.</p><p>...So, I think you can guess what I&#39;d like to say next, Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I get the idea. So you&#39;re saying a broad, long-lasting order is meaningless, right?</p><p>If the effect is weak, Servants can act against it. It&#39;s better to make a single absolute order than to give weak ones, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. Basically, the Command Spell is a way to bring about miracles beyond our abilities. Stupidly using it for orders that can be achieved by other means is unforgivable.</p><p>The Command Spell you just used is exactly that. Whether or not I&#39;ll obey you is something that we could have solved by discussion. Even with the command, something like &#39;obey my every order completely&#39; is beyond even a hundred Command Spells.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh... so the Command Spell I just used was meaningless...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Normally, the answer would be yes. But it seems that your abilities as a magus are on a completely different level.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Is he happy or unhappy?</p><p>The Servant has a smile on his face as he sighs.</p><hr><p>&quot;On a completely different level... you mean....</p><p>Hey, you. Tell me honestly your condition right now.&quot;</p><p>I have a gut feeling, so I ask him boldly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what I mean by miscalculation.</p><p>That Command Spell should have only changed my attitude to &#39;well, I&#39;ll respect Master&#39;s opinions slightly&#39;.</p><p>But right now, I feel a strong bind from your words. If I disagree with you, let&#39;s see... it seems like I drop a rank.</p><p>In other words, it&#39;s like my body feels heavy when I go against your will.&quot;</p><p>The Servant shrugs his shoulders as if to say it&#39;s a pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015So...&quot;</p><p>...That means the Command Spell wasn&#39;t meaningless, and it worked in my favor?</p><p>But this guy speaks as sarcastically as always, and it doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s any weaker at all.</p><p>Though, even if he is weakened when going against me, I doubt even ten of me could take him on...</p><hr><p>&quot;Let me take back what I said before, Master.</p><p>You are young, but you are an outstanding magus.</p><p>It was my mistake to patronize you and try to keep you out of the battle. I apologize for my rudeness.&quot;</p><p>He adjusts his stance and bows his head politely.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015\u2015hey, stop it. We argued a lot, but they say both sides are usually at fault in this sort of thing...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. I&#39;m glad you understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You changed your tune quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it was a miscalculation, but not an unwelcome one. If you&#39;re this talented, I have no objections to your involvement in the battle.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>Uh... he seems to be saying he&#39;s found a powerful Master, so...</p><p>&quot;So you accept me as Master even without the Command Spell?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I wasn&#39;t clear back then as I was just summoned, but we are completely connected now. If you&#39;re really a magus, you should be able to feel the connection from the contract.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Contract...?&quot;</p><p>Hm, now that he mentions it, my body does feel strange.</p><p>It feels like the nerves, once closed within me, are now pointing outwards.</p><p>...And on top of that, part of my magical energy is flowing into the man in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Servants are called by the Holy Grail, but what keeps them in this world is...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, the power of the Master. Servants stay in this world by receiving magical energy from their Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;The magical energy you supply is sufficient. There might be problems with your experience, but your ability is outstanding.</p><p>A normal magus would pass out after summoning a Servant, but you&#39;re still full of energy.</p><p>The Command Spell earlier, and this amount of magical energy... you&#39;re definitely a first class Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! H-Heh! Praising me now won&#39;t do you any good.&quot;</p><p>A bit embarrassed, I avert my gaze.</p><hr><p>...I wasn&#39;t really expecting this.</p><p>I&#39;m forcing him to obey with the Command Spell, but for a Servant, a being superior to humans, to honestly accept that I am his Master....</p><hr><p>&quot;...So? Which Servant are you?&quot;</p><p>I collect myself and finally get to the point.</p><p>&quot;You can&#39;t tell from my appearance, huh? Ah, excellent.&quot;</p><p>......</p><p>No, I was just mistaken before.</p><p>This guy is certainly making fun of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right, this is a question from your Master.</p><p>You&#39;re not Saber, are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have a sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...As I suspected.</p><p>This is natural, though. I mistook the time, the summoning circle didn&#39;t work, and I even summoned the Servant to the wrong place.</p><p>It was all too clumsy to call Saber, the strongest Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What a blunder. Using that many jewels and not calling Saber... it&#39;s too appalling to face.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hmph. Well, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Uh, well, it was a big mistake and I regret it, but it&#39;s my fault, so...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, Archer isn&#39;t too flashy, I know.</p><p>All right, I&#39;ll make you regret your abuse later on. And I won&#39;t accept any apologies when that time comes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>...This is unexpected.</p><p>The unknown Servant seems disappointed by my fixation on Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;What, did I get on your nerves, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I get it. But keep your eyes open as I will definitely show you how lucky you are.&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer protests with narrow eyes.</p><p>The air he carries is offensive, but his behavior seems childlike and pure.</p><p>...You know...</p><p>He might be a pretty good guy.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. Then be sure you make me regret it later on, Archer.</p><p>If you do, I&#39;ll honestly apologize.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, and don&#39;t you forget it, Master. Know how great the one you summoned is and be grateful.</p><p>Though, even if you do apologize then, I probably won&#39;t be satisfied.&quot;</p><p>Archer grins again.</p><p>Huh, maybe he does have a twisted personality after all.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, fine. Leaving that aside, which heroic spirit are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>His sarcastic tone disappears, and he frowns seriously.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer? Your Master is asking you a question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s... a secret.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t answer the question of who I am, because\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hold on. If it&#39;s for a stupid reason, I&#39;ll be pissed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>Oh, that face again.</p><p>Archer must be really troubled as he opens his mouth like he&#39;d rather not say anything.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s because I don&#39;t know myself.&quot;</p><p>...Wait, what was that..?</p><hr><p>&quot;Whaaaaaaat!? Are you making fun of me!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I didn&#39;t mean to insult you, Master.</p><p>But this is what you get for your failed summoning. It seems my memory is confused. I know who I am, but things like my name and origin are a bit vague... Well, they&#39;re trivial things to be missing, so we shouldn&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it? Of course I&#39;m worried about it!</p><p>If I don&#39;t know which heroic spirit you are, I can&#39;t tell how strong you are!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s no problem. It&#39;s a trivial matter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Trivial, you say? How can I make a plan when I don&#39;t know how strong my partner is!? There&#39;s no way we can fight like this!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? I am the servant you summoned. Naturally, I am the strongest.&quot;</p><p>Straightforwardly.</p><p>The knight in red looks at me with absolute confidence and trust.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha...&quot;</p><p>My thoughts freeze.</p><p>There&#39;s no dishonesty in Archer&#39;s words.</p><p>He thinks more highly of my power than I do, even though we&#39;ve only just met.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...My face is burning.</p><p>Geez, I&#39;m definitely blushing.</p><p>Why am I so weak against unexpected things?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, fine. It&#39;ll make no difference that no one will know your true identity. They do say that to fool your enemies, you must first fool your allies...&quot;</p><p>I say this to hide my embarrassment, looking away from Archer.</p><p>Well, I can find out later how good a Servant he is.</p><p>For now, I have a higher priority.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I shall not question you about your true identity for now.</p><p>So Archer, here&#39;s your first task.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Already? You are aggressive.</p><p>So, who&#39;s our enemy\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>As he&#39;s asking, I throw a dustpan and broom in front of him.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Clean the room downstairs, please. You made that mess, so be responsible and clean the place up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He stands there blankly for ten seconds.</p><p>After recovering his thoughts, he grabs the broom ready to make an objection.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. Just what do you think a Servant is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A familiar, right? He&#39;s a bit insolent, so he&#39;s difficult to control.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer swallows his words.</p><p>I don&#39;t intend to take back my words, and I do have a trump card.</p><hr><p>&quot;Objection. I refuse such an ord\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? This is an order as a Master. Doesn&#39;t your body feel heavy when you go against your Master&#39;s wishes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing to you, but the penalty would continue until you clean up the living room. Won&#39;t it be dangerous to fight in such a condition from tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh.&quot;</p><p>He groans for a few seconds, clenching the broom.</p><hr><p>The Servant in the red coat, Archer, closes his eyes in dismay.</p><p>&quot;Understood. Damn you, Master.&quot;</p><p>He acknowledges my request gracefully.</p><hr><p>Well.</p><p>It&#39;s getting late, so I should rest for tonight.</p><p>I can decide about how to treat him after I wake up.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The day of fate comes to a close.</p><p>No, this night is the start of fate.</p><hr><p>There are six including myself now.</p><p>Once the last one summons a Servant, the seventh one who is not yet a Master, this Holy Grail War will commence.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not far ahead.</p><p>The battle I&#39;ve waited ten years for is about to commence....</p>', 1293);
