I kept thinking about how to differentiate him from the other beautiful Servants, and especially fussed over his eyes.</p><p>I tried to include into his design my interpretations of elements from stories, court music, as well as the beauty of flowers and the moon. The are still legends about magatama in japan so I included them as a symbol of the moon&#39;s protection. Maybe I included too many...I actually didn&#39;t know how to draw the wrinkles in his wide pants so I ended up making them myself.</p><p>It&#39;s really nice how Lanling doesn&#39;t show any skin yet you can clearly still have a peek at his slender and elegant body line. My headcanon for him is that his hair got cut shorter and lost its color to symbolize the tragedy he experienced in life, so it&#39;s possible he may have had long, black hair when he was alive. The droplet-shaped decorations in his mask can also look like tears from certain angles, so yeah I included some other anecdotes like that to his design.</p><p>I chose the goldencup flower as one of his motifs as apparently it blooms during the month he died. For his face during the Noble Phantasm animation I tried to draw him so beautifully that I couldn&#39;t replicate it again, so I ended up drawing him trial and error over and over again. He sure shines really brightly, huh!</p><p>I tried to display this one stage of beauty that isn&#39;t too adult nor too childish, so how did I do..!? I personally hope everyone finds him androgynously sexy. I figured Lanling&#39;s bravery would already be shown in battle, so instead for his final ascension art I decided to display him showing his pureness of character, and I hope people see it as him showing a beautiful smile directed towards someone he can trust.
