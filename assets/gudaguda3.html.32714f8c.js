Exactly!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re still figuring out how it happened,<br> but what we do know...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...is that Fujimaru got trapped there during a Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Normally, we don&#39;t have any issue tracking [\u2642 him /\u2640 her],<br> but for some reason, it was tricky this time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But being the unparalleled genius that I am, I was able to brute-force my way to reestablishing comms!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re all right, Senpa\u2013Wait,<br> what happened to your stomach!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay. It looks worse than it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I got...shot. Just a little though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure you&#39;re all right!?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Relax. A little spit and [\u2642 he&#39;ll /\u2640 she&#39;ll] be good as new.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Spit...!?<br> Um, Senpai, can I ask who you are with?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Oryou&#39;s Oryou. Just who the hell are you?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Yes, yes, just wait your turn, Oryou...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try that again. It&#39;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I&#39;m Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I take it you&#39;re Master Fujimaru&#39;s friends?<br> You&#39;re affiliated with this Chaldea place [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] spoke of?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the ones who helped Fujimaru out.<br> Thanks for that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You seem like the sort of Servant with a good head on his shoulders.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How about it, Fujimaru?<br> Has that been your experience so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He and Oryou did save me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I definitely don&#39;t think he&#39;s a bad person.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Got it. If that&#39;s what you think,<br> I&#39;m willing to give them a chance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I do want to make sure of one thing first.<br> What are you hoping to get out of all this, Rider?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I suppose I should&#39;ve seen that question coming.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Hmm. There&#39;s no sense lying about this,<br> so I&#39;ll just be direct.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I want to either retrieve or destroy the Holy Grail. I&#39;d even be happy to let Master Fujimaru have it if [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] wants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, and why is that? I don&#39;t see how an arrangement like that could possibly benefit you.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got me there... Someone else said something real similar to me a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> All right, let me put it this way. The Holy Grail is the cause of a lot of suffering for the people here.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I want to help them and put a stop to it. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You want to help them? That&#39;s it? You&#39;re really just going to say it flat out like that, in that lovely baritone voice of yours?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heh... Hahahahaha!<br> You really got me good! Talk about an emergency!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to laugh that much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on Da Vinci, be nice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh come on, you have to admit it&#39;s funny. I mean,<br> this guy couldn&#39;t be more suspicious if he tried!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still... Hmm, I suppose I will take you at your word. I do know Sakamoto Ryouma to be a Heroic Spirit who is certainly worthy of trust.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Why is that, Acting Director Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, I took a gander at his file, and everything he&#39;s saying right now lines up with how he was in life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He&#39;s a very greedy person. He always sought wider recognition more than individual gratitude.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> People like that might talk a good game, but they don&#39;t lie. Don&#39;t you agree, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, you may be right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I do think he&#39;s a good person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, uh, I see...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, Rider, I&#39;m counting on you to take good care of Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As for us, we&#39;re Chaldea, the Security Organization dedicated to the Preservation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You can think of us as Fujimaru&#39;s backup team,<br> [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] operational support, if you like.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I am Leonardo da Vinci.<br> Most people just call me Da Vinci, though!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I&#39;m Mash...Mash Kyrielight.<br> I&#39;m one of Senpai&#39;s Servants.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re...Sakamoto Ryouma.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even though you&#39;re a master of the Hokushin Ittouryu, your greatest achievement did not involve drawing your sword...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but in helping to negotiate the Satchou Alliance in an effort to restore imperial rule to Japan. You were a hero of the Meiji Restoration.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Wow, Ryouma. Oryou didn&#39;t know you were so famous.<br> Yaaay. Now we can have sekihan tomorrow too.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Mmm. How kind of you.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see, Da Vinci, was it?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;ve already gotten a good look at what&#39;s going on here in Tokyo, yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Righto. Honestly, this sorta stuff happens all the time, so it&#39;s not really anything new for us. But let me fill you in just in case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That place you&#39;re in now? Tokyo is the only thing that exists there. Basically a self-contained island.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Only Tokyo?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s shut in by a series of invisible walls, which makes it impossible to get in or out using conventional means.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit like a Singularity in that it&#39;s quite separate from regular human history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, nobody can escape from here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that mean you can&#39;t intervene from the outside?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> A Singularity, huh... Yeah, that sounds about right.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re spot-on.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Nobody, whether human or Servant, is able to set one foot outside the Imperial Capital&#39;s limits.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> It&#39;s completely isolated, even from history itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, how is Senpai supposed to get back?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fact that we&#39;re able to communicate like this means there should also be a way to Rayshift [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] out of there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Though we&#39;ll need a lot more information and a much more stable connection to improve our odds of success.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fortunately, since I&#39;m such an amazing genius,<br> I&#39;ve already mapped out the Singularity&#39;s structure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Near as I can tell, it&#39;s erecting a Bounded Field around several different points to maintain the whole area&#39;s integrity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ve narrowed down a few points that seem like likely candidates, but I can&#39;t say anything for sure without seeing them for myself...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Not to worry. What you&#39;ve said has been a big help, believe it or not.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I already planned to investigate this place myself anyway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry, the simulation we&#39;re using to observe you there just went kinda haywire.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like somebody&#39;s jamming our signal. Whoever it is, they must have some kinda jerkwad engineer working for them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to take us a while to sort all this out,<br> and we&#39;ll have to disconnect while we do it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid this is all we can do for now.<br> Let me send you the points to investigate before we go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...All right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep an eye on things from here as best we can,<br> but make sure you watch your own back too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, please be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-by the way, is that Okita there with you?<br> She seems...kind of different...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was too busy with my analysis to pay much attention, but now that you mention it, she DOES have a different air about her, doesn&#39;t she.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just the air.<br> Her whole color palette is\u2013</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Who was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, that was Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was my really helpful kouhai.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? You hungry or something?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re more than a little clueless about some things, aren&#39;t you, Oryou.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Anyway, we don&#39;t have any time to waste.<br> I need to find out what the other Servants are up to.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Since your wound still needs time to heal, can I ask you to stay here and watch the place while I&#39;m gone?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> He means weaklings should stay put.<br> Sit... Stay! Good small fry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Small fry...?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll keep Master safe.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Yes, please do. That will be a big help.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Say, I have an idea. If you have the time,<br> maybe you&#39;d like to help me a bit with my work?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Things have kind of piled up while I&#39;ve been away from the office, you see.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be happy to pay you, of course, and you wouldn&#39;t have to go far out of your way. Just handle whatever you&#39;re comfortable with. That should be fine.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Since this area is a good ways away from the three Servants&#39; territories, it should be pretty safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Territories?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Ah, yes. It&#39;s a sort of additional rule specific to this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> As long as a Servant with an official class is inside their own territory...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...they receive special support from the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t have any support.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I specified they have to have an official class.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Only once a Servant has won a battle for a class,<br> and then been registered as that class...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...will the Holy Grail begin to support them.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> You can&#39;t compete with other Servants over territory until you&#39;ve done that much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Reminds me of that ink shooter that Archer and Hokusai play...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It reminds me of Risk or something.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Essentially. All of the contestants are competing for territory.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Incidentally, since I&#39;m a Rider, I have some leeway to ignore the other Servants&#39; territories and go where I please.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Luckily for me, that&#39;s a handy thing to be able to do when you&#39;re conducting an investigation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you catch on so quickly. I&#39;ve never been part of a Holy Grail War quite like this either.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> There are still a lot of things I&#39;m unsure about, and the only way to find out more is to do the legwork.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that go for the Mini Nobus too?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> You mean those strange creatures the Archer was commanding? It seems so, yes.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> The effect seems to differ depending on the Heroic Spirit and class, so in the end, it still comes down to investigating matters directly.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> All right then, I&#39;m going out for a while.<br> Thanks for keeping an eye on my office in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Oryou will bring you back a frog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be careful out there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um, I&#39;m not really fond of frogs...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> See you soon.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Hey, Ryouma.<br> Are you sure about them?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> You mean the Master? I think we&#39;ll be fine.<br> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] seems like a perfectly nice person.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I do consider myself a decent judge of character, you know. Plus, it seems like [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] friends are rather capable as well.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> No, Oryou meant to ask if those weaklings will be okay watching your office alone.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m shocked.<br> I never thought you would ever worry about a human.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Have you taken a liking to [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Yes. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] looks yummy.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Ah, I see...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be fine.<br> If I&#39;m right, then that Servant is...</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> What? Does your stomach hurt?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> No, no, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Anyway, this certainly isn&#39;t the first time, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...it looks like this Holy Grail War is going to be quite a pain in the neck.</p><h2 id="section-3-man-slayer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-man-slayer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Man-Slayer</h2><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMan in Black Coat:</strong><br> Hmph. I don&#39;t know if you were some big,<br> tough Saber in your day, but you&#39;re nothing to me.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMan in Black Coat:</strong><br> You got some nerve, thinking you could take me on as weak as you are.</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMan in Black Coat:</strong><br> Oho...

Ughhh...</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Fine, since you asked. But just today.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t over, Ryouma!<br> Hey! Let go of me, you brute!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> D-don&#39;t call me a brute. Oryou&#39;s not a brute; you&#39;re a brute. Hey, are you sure we can&#39;t just leave this annoying bug behind?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> No, sorry. Try not to let him provoke you for a bit... Anyway, Okita, we&#39;ll be saying bye for now.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going any\u2013Urk...!?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;d strayed out of my territory...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong><br> I guess going after Riders on foot isn&#39;t the best idea...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong><br> ...Still, that Servant...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong><br> She looked just like me...</p><h2 id="section-4-battle-front" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-battle-front" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Battle Front</h2><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um... Do you guys know each other or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Is it just me, or is it kind of cold in here?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Why did we bring this dumb little bug with us?<br> He&#39;s ugly. We should have left him behind.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Well, Izo and I go way back.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Okada Izo of Tosa was pretty famous in Kyoto back when the Tokugawa shogunate was on its last legs.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> So, you know each other?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> KNOW each other!?<br> This coward betrayed us!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...And I said I was sorry about that.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> Sorry!? You think just saying sorry makes up for what you did!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> How about I cut you to ribbons right here,<br> and then we&#39;ll see how sorry you are?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...I see. I didn&#39;t realize you hated me that much.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...All right. If that&#39;s what it takes to make you feel better, go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Kill me.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Huh? No. That doesn&#39;t work for Oryou.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Oryou. Please, stay out of this.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> I&#39;m serious about this, Ryouma!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AIzo:</strong><br> I&#39;m a man of my word!

It&#39;s nothing.<br> If it helps Izo feel better, I can deal with it.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Besides, if he&#39;d really meant to kill me,<br> I&#39;d be dead.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Wha... I-I knew you were a coward, but I didn&#39;t think you were an idiot, too! I swear, as long as we&#39;ve known each other...!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Dammit! Just go ahead and die for all I care!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Haha... Well, that should help keep the peace around here, right?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Oh, would someone mind grabbing those bandages for me?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Phew. Thanks, Oryou.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Oh, and I&#39;m good on saliva, thanks.<br> Besides, it&#39;s...pretty sticky.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Shut up. If you die, Oryou dies too, you know.<br> Be careful.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> This doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve forgiven you!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I, uh... I just don&#39;t feel like killing you now, that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I know. Thanks, Izo.<br> Holding back for now is more than enough.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Why you... Do you EVER shut up...!?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Now, getting back to our previous discussion...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I&#39;ve managed a bit of investigating. Between that and the data Chaldea gave us, I think I&#39;ve more or less sorted out how things work here.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> There are anchors made from fragments of the Holy Grail located at several points around the city...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...and each of them commands its own Servant.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Every Servant with an official class has their territory set around their anchor.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> The rules of this Holy Grail War are simple: fight the other Servants, gain their territories, and become the sole victor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Exactly!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Damn, I wanted to be the one to explain all that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Geniuses are the best at dramatic entrances! Even if that wasn&#39;t quite what I was aiming for this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank goodness you&#39;re all right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks to Da Vinci&#39;s analysis,<br> we&#39;ve figured out a way to bring you back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...So!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since the anchors holding that place together are made from Holy Grail fragments...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...all you have to do is destroy them, and that world&#39;s foundations should come crumbling down, taking the Singularity with them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even better, once that&#39;s done, the signals jamming our observations should disappear too...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...which will make Rayshifting Fujimaru back to Chaldea pretty simple.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still... We have a goal, but actually making it happen is a bit more difficult.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s the whole twisting a Holy Grail War into some sort of Servant war game thing...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Why would anyone go to the trouble of setting up this Singularity to run on a system that is such a complete pain in the ass?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep an eye on that as we investigate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For now, Fujimaru, I&#39;d like you to focus mainly on destroying the anchors.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aw crap, are we out of time already?<br> Okay, one last quick thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You know the Servants&#39; territories?<br> Well, they look like they&#39;re linked to the anchors too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The more you whittle down enemy Servants&#39; territories the less assistance they&#39;ll get from the Grail.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, looks like we&#39;re out of time, so, later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Senpai, about the tan Okita next to\u2013</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...She seems a little too friendly with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash and I have been through a lot together.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...I see. A lot, huh.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> At any rate, now we know what our goal is.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> We need to whittle down each Servant&#39;s territory and sever their connection to the Grail. Yeah, that&#39;s a lot more clear-cut.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Which means this is where we get serious.<br> If we all work together, I&#39;m sure we can pull it off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it! ...Uh, by the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Er... What about you, Assassin? What are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> You will help us, right, Izo?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Are ya insane!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Why would I ever help YOU lot!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I&#39;m ONE of the Servants in this Holy Grail War, you know!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I don&#39;t expect you to help for nothing, Izo.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Sure, you&#39;re a genius with the sword.<br> But even you can&#39;t take them all on alone, can you?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother buttering me up!<br> All you ever do is trick me into going along with you!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Izo. You saw that enemy Saber for yourself, remember?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> She&#39;s tough. Really tough.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...You mean the one in the haori?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I&#39;d recognize that detestable blue haori anywhere... Ryouma, does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. She&#39;s part of the strongest group of master swordsmen of the late Tokugawa shogunate...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...the group you and I have a long history with...</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hey, you...</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!?!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.<br> Get in my way...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...and I&#39;ll cut you down where you stand!</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong><br> ...!?!?!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Not yet...

Awfully smut for a glorified athlete.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I hate to bring you down while you are clearly riding high on your victories over so many weaklings...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m afraid now that I&#39;ve found you,<br> your luck&#39;s run out.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Prepare to be cut down where you stand!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Good, good. That&#39;s the sort of absurd boasting I had been hoping for.

These two are only here to watch.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I can handle a little spear-wielder like you without breaking a sweat.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Now DIE!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Kaka, that&#39;s more like it!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I look forward to seeing what challenge,<br> if any, your swordsmanship offers.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...This is awful.<br> All these beautiful flowers, snuffed out in their prime.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Even for a Berserker, this is horrific.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> This park is supposed to be for everyone.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> It looks like he just went around killing anyone who happened to be close by. Even Oryou wouldn&#39;t make this much of a mess.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that. You can get awfully messy. Anyway...how do we find the Berserker in question...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Hey, you.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Ah. Ryouma, behind you.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Hey, you... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Oh, well then... It seems the Berserker found us.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Huh? Wait a moment... I know there&#39;s something wildly different about you, but aren&#39;t you...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Well, well. It looks like Izo isn&#39;t the only blast from my past here.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Answer me... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> If you refuse to answer...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...that will itself be answer enough...!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I never thought I&#39;d run into the Demon Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi having a drink among the cherry blossoms here of all places.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Looks like you won&#39;t need to hold back, Oryou!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> So you are my enemies.

The territory!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> You changed places with that Lancer you defeated, didn&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> You can&#39;t fool me! I know how you Three Knight Classes get way more support from the Holy Grail than the rest of us!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re a coward, using cheap tricks like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Izo, it&#39;s...really not that in this case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This particular Lancer is just, well...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s not using anything.<br> ...He&#39;s just strong, plain and simple.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...What a shame.<br> If only you didn&#39;t have such a short temper.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You have enough natural talent that, with training,<br> you could have really been something.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> C-COULD have been!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> My sword has never failed me!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Nobody could beat me! I could make any other style my own just be seeing it in action once!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I...I am a genius with the sword!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I know. You clearly have a gift for observation.<br> You even surpass me in raw talent.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> But that&#39;s all you have. A true martial artist must be skilled in many disciplines. Training only in one discipline is no path to supremacy.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You should have disposed with such foolish notions while you were still young. Unfortunately, it seems fate was not kind to you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I can tell you must have died while you were still young and foolish. What a waste.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> What did you say...?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Enough talk now.<br> I have sworn to take no more than one life per battle.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> This is as far as you go, Assassin,<br> but I&#39;m willing to let the [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] live for now.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> After all, if I were to kill everyone every time, I&#39;d soon run out of prey with which to make my living.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stand back, Izo. Let&#39;s do this, Alter!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Got it.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Are you mad!? How many times have I told you!?<br> Even I was no match for him!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way such a pathetically weak Servant as her could last more than a second!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...I see. So you will be my true opponent.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Very well then, yours will be the life I take in this battle.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Master, this Servant is very strong.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> But I won&#39;t let him kill you. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you, Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know you won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Trust born from loyalty, hmm? Very well then.<br> It&#39;s been some time since I killed a human!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Guh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Alter!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hahahaha! This was quite an exciting match!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You were doomed from the start, but still you blocked my attacks no fewer than three times!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Pathetic swordsmanship indeed. You seem to lack confidence in your skills...but that is obviously not because you had it once and then lost it.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> No, I believe there is nothing wrong with you as you are now.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> That is why your last push was so powerful.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...The gods can be quite cruel. You have lost your destiny, and so remain ignorant. Yet from that ignorance came a flawless, techniqueless decisive blow.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Your conviction was a sight to behold.<br> You must care about that [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] a great deal.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Lancer.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...Still, I may not have lost if I hadn&#39;t relaxed my guard.<br> I suppose I&#39;m in no position to lecture.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You there, subservient Assassin. I would say that my spear and your sword were a hairsbreadth apart.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> But even a hairsbreadth can be a world of distance.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Why are you helping me?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You remind me of myself. I went around causing no end of trouble when I was young, too.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Take it from this old man. If you want to progress, it&#39;s not too late to\u2013Ah, perhaps it is too late, since Servants don&#39;t grow or change?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Well, no matter. Even if what I tell you helps only in this conflict, it will still be of significance.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Take this as a chance to work on your swordplay.<br> Rebuild your skills from the ground up.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Stop wasting time telling your opponents how much better than them you are. Instead simply demonstrate your superior strength and skill.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> The task is the same, of course. But changing your approach will change how you feel about it.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Besides...<br> It&#39;s fun to surpass one&#39;s own limits.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You actually beat him.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Yes... His skill with a spear was incredible.<br> I&#39;m still not quite sure how I did it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Alter... You seem a lot stronger now.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Am I? It&#39;s hard for me to tell.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Now that I think of it, I feel like I&#39;m moving better after seeing that Saber fight.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Hey. This is as far as we go together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Izo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...But</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Wait. I hate to say it...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...but your battle with that Lancer helped to weaken him.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Shut up. We&#39;re not friends, or allies,<br> or even friendly acquaintances.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I had a job to do, and now it&#39;s done.

You look beat up.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Our job was pretty difficult.<br> Not for Oryou, though.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I know, I know. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t any help.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> We ended up running into the Berserker, you see.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t easy, but we made it back here at least.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Congrats on a job well done, Fujimaru.

What about the Berserker?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Sorry, he turned out to be kind of, uh, tough.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> By the end, I was so beat up I couldn&#39;t make it to the anchor.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> We&#39;ll go back there and get to it tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> We spent the whole night at that park...</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Hmph.

So that&#39;s what happened with your group.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not dead.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Izo&#39;s a lot more sensitive than you might think.<br> It&#39;s best if we give him some space for now.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> If you have energy to worry about that,<br> spend it worrying about Oryou instead.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Yes, yes, yes... I&#39;m always worried about you, Oryou.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Good.

Huh!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> What is it?<br> Does he want me to hand over my gun or something?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> N-no, nothing like that...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> He says he&#39;ll let us have the Holy Grail once all the other Servants have been defeated.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Does that mean Caster&#39;s forfeiting this war?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am... That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Sister... Something doesn&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Why&#39;s Caster even taking part in the Holy Grail War at all then?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> I told you, call me Lady Nobunaga.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Tell Caster that I understand and accept his terms.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, ma&#39;am!

Just a hint of their pale blue haori was enough to make me turn around and go the other way.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> So Oryou just has to murder the Archer then.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> That&#39;s a rather crude way to put it,<br> but, yes, I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> You two should be careful too.<br> That Archer was frighteningly strong.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Her? That dumb Archer&#39;s bullets aren&#39;t enough to even scratch Oryou.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Just relax and let Oryou take care of her.<br> This time, Oryou will even bring you back a frog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all look out for each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You really like frogs, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do this thing.<br> Wanna light a signal fire to mark the occasion?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> No, no.

Figuratively speaking.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> My head?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been investigating for a while, and everything I&#39;ve found points to you being the key to this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Hmm... Does this mean you&#39;re forfeiting the war too, Rider?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Are you giving up on your wish for the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Well, as it turns out...the real Rider is long gone by now.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Oryou got rid of him.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> I was never truly part of this Holy Grail War to begin with.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m only here because the world itself called to me.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> What?<br> Then, you mean you&#39;re part of the Counter Force...?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Wahahahaha! This is great!<br> I&#39;ve made an enemy of the world itself!</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s where things stand.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Then I suppose we do have to fight.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Fine then. Once I defeat you, I&#39;ll be able to widen my sphere of influence even further.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s do this, Oryou!<br> I&#39;m going to use my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.

I knew you would stand head and shoulders above the rest of this rabble of Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong><br> Who am I? What a cruel thing to say.<br> We just signed a treaty mere hours ago, remember?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> So you&#39;re the Caster. Now I see. With Rider dead,<br> and the tide of this war turning in my favor...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...you realized you were nearly out of time to ambush me, and hurried here before missing your opportunity.</p><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong><br> Yes, I am a Caster. My True Name is Nankoubou Tenkai. It was my idea to build this Imperial Capital with the goal of keeping the Tokugawa dynasty safe.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> So you&#39;re Takechiyo&#39;s man...?<br> Hmph, never heard of you.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> Well, no matter.<br> This saves me the trouble of hunting you down.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ANankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Now, now, Lady Nobunaga, are you quite certain you don&#39;t remember me? Perhaps it would help if I took off these sunglasses.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...You!?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a long time,<br> my lord...Lady Oda Kazusa-no-Suke Nobunaga!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s the meaning of this?<br> What are you even doing here!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> What the...!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t move!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> I already have you in the palm of my hand,<br> Lady Nobunaga. Just like back at Honnoji!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Ah, now I see. \u201CNankoubou Tenkai\u201D was just a cover... And you rule this land...?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> I knew you would catch on quickly, Lady Nobunaga.<br> Indeed, this entire Imperial Capital is my territory.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Compared to the power I have amassed, the fights among you other Servants have just been little scuffles and brawls.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> With each Holy Grail War,<br> my territory collects new Spirit Origins...</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> This is my territory...</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> ...The Imperial Capital of the gods!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...So this entire Imperial Capital is your territory, huh!?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> I have waited a long time for this day.<br> A very...very long time.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> This is why I fled from that man, curried favor with the Tokugawa family, and have been biding my time for three centuries.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Now, at last, the true Lady Nobunaga will return!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong><br> ...Mitsuhideee! You bastard!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> ...Good. Take her away.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Now, I have the Holy Grail, Lady Nobunaga&#39;s Spirit Origin, and the souls of the countless Heroic Spirits that have come to this land.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> At last, my wish will be granted!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Hehehe...<br> Hahahahahaha...!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong><br> Haaahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope Sakamoto&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Ah, there you are, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nobukatsu...!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Come on, Sister, don&#39;t just pop up out of nowhere like that. You&#39;re scaring them.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> Right, right, sorry. It&#39;s just that your body is so suffocating it&#39;s hard to get comfortable in here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Well, what do you expect? We&#39;re two different people sharing the same Spirit Origin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you... WHAT?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re Nobukatsu and Nobbu?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...What is this person, Master?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Long time no see! You&#39;re my sister&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> Shut it, Nobukatsu. I&#39;ll do the talking.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> Oh, hey Okita, I didn&#39;t know you were here too.<br> You look different though... Did you do something with your hair?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> ...And your...skin?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nobbu? Is that you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeeeah... Now it feels like GUDAGUDA...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> Well, you could say that,<br> and you could also NOT say that.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong><br> Look, just hear me out.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Basically, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> ...the Holy Grail summoned both me and you here at the same time.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Well, more like it tied me down to it, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tied you down to it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, did that happen to Okita too?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Yep. Normally, my Spirit Origin would&#39;ve been made into the Holy Grail&#39;s Servant...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> ...and I would&#39;ve been forced to do its bidding.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> But right before I was Servantized, I cut off a bit of my Spirit Origin to prevent that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know that was a thing you could do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yikes...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Usually that sort of thing would be impossible.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> But after everything that transpired last time, Nobukatsu happened to be inscribed near my own Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> I therefore rented out a bit of space in his Spirit Origin so I could manifest, too!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> Usually, my Spirit Origin would be too weak to materialize at all...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> ...but I managed to pull it off after adding Sister&#39;s to my own.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Still, this was an all-star team technique. It only worked because Nobukatsu and I are actual siblings.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> That said, this Spirit Origin is a little small for me, so it&#39;s kind of cramped in here. Can&#39;t do anything about that, though!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ve been here biding my time seeing how things would play out ever since.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Are you kidding me? What kind of plot twist is that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Long time no see, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, about that Okita who isn&#39;t like Oki\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry Mash, but this is urgent.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I am intrigued by the idea of housing two personalities in one Spirit Origin...but, yes, this is definitely more important.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I figured out the structure of that Singularity...or rather, why it was made in the first place.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Listen closely. That entire area is designed to collect Servants and produce pure Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s more like a magical circuit used for magecraft rituals than anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It collects Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Pure Spirit Origins?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Now I see... It&#39;s a kodoku.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong><br> You know about it, Sister!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, interesting. A kodoku is old Eastern magecraft that involves filling a pot with venomous snakes or insects and having them kill each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The mage then uses the fluids of the one creature that survived to cast a curse. What an excellent analogy.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Basically, whoever&#39;s behind this is having Servants kill each other to get their hands on extremely pure Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> That&#39;s why they needed a Holy Grail War with so many different Servants fighting each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, from what we&#39;ve observed, they&#39;ve actually conducted a great many Holy Grail Wars there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How many is a great many?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For a long time now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say for sure, but I&#39;m pretty sure that since the whole place was carved out of history...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s been host to Holy Grail War after Holy Grail War in order to keep collecting Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if he IS taking advantage of the Holy Grail&#39;s power...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the sheer planning, preparation, and time it would take to pull that off is insane.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> ...Maybe, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past that kumquat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kumquat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that your</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that he&#39;s come this far, that Caster must be planning something pretty outrageous.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Now I see.<br> So that&#39;s how we ended up out here.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Rider. I see you&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Yup! Thanks to Lady Nobunaga&#39;s...kid brother?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What a relief...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Oryou?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Sorry. Oryou&#39;s still trying to live the whole thing down.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Oryou&#39;s actually my Noble Phantasm, you see. Once I was back up to snuff, she was able to maintain her form again.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Things don&#39;t usually go this well, but it looks like these are special circumstances.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> All that posturing you did when we said goodbye, and now look at us. This is so embarrassing. Oryou wishes she could just crawl into a water hole and die.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Well, I can&#39;t exactly take advantage of my power in Nobukatsu&#39;s body anyway. Rider may be an especially weak Heroic Spirit, but he&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Haha, you&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m hardly the only one. Compared to you, Lady Nobunaga, almost every Heroic Spirit here is third-rate at best.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All the same, we still have to do something about the Caster&#39;s plot...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...or Fujimaru will never be able to get back home.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Then there&#39;s only one thing to do.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> We grind that kumquat\u2013I mean,<br> Caster&#39;s plans into the dirt...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> ...and go back to Chaldea like the badasses we are.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> True. If we can stop him, then Master can go home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what are we waiting for!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can do this if we all work together!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Hey. I&#39;m coming too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Izo? Is that you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do I know you?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Izo... That&#39;s the outfit you wore during\u2013</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I&#39;m not doing this for you.<br> I just don&#39;t like being anyone&#39;s pawn.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who this Caster thinks he is, but nobody pulls my strings and gets away with it.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Come on, Ryouma, we don&#39;t need him, do we?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...We can absolutely use him.<br> Izo is worth a hundred ordinary soldiers.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Hmph. So, do you know where this Caster is?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a decent idea, but I don&#39;t have his exact whereabouts just yet. But you can fix that, can&#39;t you, Assassin?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> You bet. If there&#39;s a Servant in their territory, I can find them no problem.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go, Master.<br> I have a feeling this is why I&#39;m here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Alter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please take good care of Senpai, Alter!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Phew! I finally got to say it.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Mash, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight!<br> Uh... Your name is Alter, right?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Yes. Don&#39;t worry.<br> I&#39;ll make sure to protect Master in your stead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> All right then, it looks like all the players are in place.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Talk about a motley crew.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> ...But, at least things are finally getting interesting!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think, Fujimaru!?</p><h2 id="section-9-rushing-in" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-rushing-in" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Rushing In</h2><p><strong>Alarm:</strong><br> Intruder alert, intruder alert.</p><p><strong>Alarm:</strong><br> Enemy Servants detected.<br> All Heroic Spirit Soldiers to your positions.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Out of my waaay!</p><p><strong>Officer:</strong><br> Our guns aren&#39;t working on them!

That&#39;s why he lost everything before dying a pitiful death!</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong><br> But worry not!<br> None but Lady Nobunaga can ever rule Japan!</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong><br> Yes!

Lady Nobunaga?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to do this, you might as well finish it yourself.

Is that what I said?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> What&#39;s with this guy? His fighting style&#39;s all over the place, but he&#39;s very strong.

I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Not even a Holy Grail can sway the Demon Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Who would have thought.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen any Heroic Spirit with such incredible willpower. No wonder you&#39;re the Berserker of the Shogunate&#39;s end.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...There you have it.<br> We ended up calling a temporary truce.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you just tell us?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> For the record, Oryou was against that truce.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not cool, sitting on this up till now...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Haha, I used to get that a lot when I was still alive.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Berserker...

Advance!</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> ...The Berserker and the Rider? What&#39;s going on? Why are all the losers from the Grail War gathering here?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Oh, putting together ragtag groups has always been a skill of mine. You&#39;d be surprised how well people of differing philosophies can come together.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Hmm, the Satchou Alliance was last year&#39;s news. How about we call ourselves... the OdaShinsengumiTosa Alliance?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> No. Too long.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> What do you think you&#39;re doing!?<br> Get these idiots!</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> ...Hngh!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> ...Divine punishment.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t have forgotten about me, Caster...</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the Assassin!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Hmph, easiest job I ever did in my life.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> You...

Why is everyone meddling in my plans!? This is exactly what happened back then!</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> Instead of listening to MY plans for absolute domination, a bunch of fools were deceived by a greater fool who was nothing but talk, preventing me from completing my plans!</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong><br> Why!? Why won&#39;t anyone listen to me!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANobunaga:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever understand, Mitsuhide.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ANobunaga:</strong><br> ...No matter.

There&#39;s only one me, Kumquat!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ANobukatsu:</strong><br> Uh, Sister, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s our most pressing concern right\u2013Aaah! The mud is at my feet now!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> This is bad... Just how many Servants&#39; Spirit Origins did Caster fill the Holy Grail with?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s going to end up becoming something on par with a Divine Spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gotta do something!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gotta find a way to stop him!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> It&#39;s no good. Nothing&#39;s working on him, Ryouma!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Well this is a pretty pickle. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve got any tricks up your sleeve, do you, Lady Nobunaga?</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> If I hadn&#39;t had to fight you first,<br> I could&#39;ve wiped the floor with this idiot!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong><br> But I can only pull out my killer demon so many times. What about that dragon of yours? Can&#39;t she do something?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Oryou&#39;s wiped. Just between us, it&#39;s a miracle Oryou&#39;s still here after turning into a dragon.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t you go wimping out now.

I knew you were a fake!<br> I&#39;M the real Lady Nobunaga!</p><p><strong>Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong><br> Now, bow down before me!

I wish I could have helped you out myself... Oryou, can I ask you to fight one more time?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> Hmph, lucky for you Oryou still had one last secret frog. Oryou can go at least one more time with this.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong><br> Are you ALL idiots!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need your whining. If you&#39;re not going to help, then get out of the way. Okita, you&#39;d better live up to all that talk.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Hijikata. I remember now.

She never even had the chance to decide for herself.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Then maybe she&#39;s been summoned here to repay that debt...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Yeah. Her Spirit Origin has been tuned to be used up all at once for the Counter Force...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> She&#39;s like a bomb just waiting to go off.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> She&#39;s on a completely different level than me,<br> in every possible sense.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Once she goes off, there won&#39;t be a speck of her Spirit Origin left.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re done talking.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> Whatever Okita&#39;s debts are, they&#39;re hers to settle.<br> It&#39;s none of our business one way or the other.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Yeah, I know.

Back when I lived in Kyoto, I heard the Demon Vice Commander had neither blood nor tears to shed.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> ...Of course, that may have been helped along by things like you forcing subordinates to commit seppuku if they went around using the Shinsengumi&#39;s name to raise money.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> ...Shut up.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ANobunaga:</strong><br> ...Now!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong><br> Oryou!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong><br> RRRAAAAAAHHH!!!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong><br> I AM!

I guess we have to fight! Come on, Alter Me!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Got it, Normal Me! If two Okitas join forces, we can unleash limitless Okita Power. Now...</p><p><strong>Double Okita:</strong><br> ...witness the power of Double Okita!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> ...Nghhh, Auntie, that&#39;s Chacha&#39;s coffee...<br> ...Yaaawn... (Zzz)</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Hehe... She&#39;s sleepy. She looks so peaceful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That was a hell of a fight, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That Double Sandanzuki was pretty sweet.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Indeed. I could never have won without your Command Spells and Normalkita laying down her own life.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> From now on, I&#39;ll need to work hard enough for the both of us in order to support you, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Alter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If only Okita hadn&#39;t pushed herself so hard...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, whoa! I&#39;m not dead!<br> I just fainted a little! That&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go getting all weepy on me now!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> You certainly have it hard, don&#39;t you, Normalkita?<br> I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like myself.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> Huh!? But not even the Holy Grail can cure this curse!? Why do you get off scot-free when we&#39;re both Okita!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong></p><p>...Ah! Huh?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> What&#39;s Chacha doing here...? Oh, hi, Master.<br> Hi, Okita. Hi, Okita. What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We were all just about to go home together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It...uh, it&#39;s a long story.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> I see... Chacha didn&#39;t know Chacha did that... Chacha&#39;s sorry for all the trouble, Okita, um, Alter, right?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> Besides, I was born just a short while ago.<br> All of this stuff is very exciting to me.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s a wonderful feeling, being alive.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Born recently... Is that so... Hmm...<br> Maybe I did get a little carried away.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Maybe we can start over?<br> It&#39;s nice meeting you, Alterwhatsit.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...How strange. Hearing someone as small as you call me that is...oddly calming.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> Hehe, is that so? Well, you can think of Chacha as your mother! Ask me for anything!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> And make sure you bring Chacha ice cream on Mother&#39;s Day!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, I finally got through!<br> Are you all right, Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, more or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can we just have dinner now, please?</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> Good, it looks like Chacha&#39;s back to normal.<br> Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> Now hurry back before supper gets cold.</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> I really must say, though...this pudding I found in the fridge while you were out sure is tasty! (Smacking lips)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Nobunaga, that&#39;s Chacha&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong><br> ...Pudding you found in the fridge?</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> Mm! The oden we&#39;re having for supper is especially tasty, too! (Munch munch) I always did love strong flavors! Wahahaha! I can&#39;t put it down!</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> What? Is this all we had? Oh, sorry. I guess I ate it all for a snack while I was waiting for you guys.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> ...Oden?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll buy more oden and pudding, okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh no...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger Yodo:</strong><br> DEATH TO AUNTIE!<br> NO MERCY!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong><br> This...is the power of the Counter Force...!</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s the matter with you two?<br> Doesn&#39;t this seem weird to anyone else?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong><br> (Sigh) Here we go again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep, that&#39;s GUDAGUDA...</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong><br> W-wait!
