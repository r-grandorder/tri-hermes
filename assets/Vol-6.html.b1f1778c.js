On it stood a city built primarily on oceangoing trade.</p><p>That city was spoken of in many tales\u2014some had it that it was an island, surrounded by the sea on all sides, others that it was a peninsula, and still others that the power of the gods enabled it to shift freely between the two\u2014but the most important point was not the city\u2019s origin or geography but the people that ruled it.</p><p>The Amazons.</p><p>That tribe, also called the Amazones, was distinguished by being made up entirely of women. Except when those who desired offspring mingled with men of neighboring cities, hunting, agriculture, animal husbandry, and all other aspects of life were conducted entirely by women.</p><p>Men who took issue with that\u2014kings of neighboring cities and groups of brigands who made their strongholds in the mountains\u2014often attacked their city, but the Amazons beat back every assault.</p><p>Not only ordinary life but the military preparations essential to the defense of the city were managed entirely by women. Their skill in horseback riding and archery, in particular, was so impressive that word of it reached the cultures of distant Greece.</p><p></p><p>In Themiskyra was a queen.</p><p>Her mother was Otrere, a devout priestess of Artemis and a great woman who had had congress with Ares, once the god of war, and, despite being human, borne the god\u2019s child.</p><p>Otrere\u2019s daughter, however, surpassed her in heroism.</p><p></p><p>She was a priestess of the god of war and the queen of a people.</p><p>She was also a war-leader who rode in the vanguard and kicked up a storm of blood.</p><p>That young queen ruled powerfully over the surrounding lands with her might and wisdom, the divine aura and divine artefact she had inherited from the god of war, and the charisma to unite her sturdy warrior women.</p><p>On horseback, it was said, a sweep of her spear would part the sea and a shot from her bow would shake the forests. Her prowess was sufficient to inspire faith in her followers and terrified awe in neighboring cities, and her fame spread to distant Greece.</p><p></p><p>But . . . a turning point came for that queen and for all the Amazons.</p><p>A fateful wind carried a lone ship to Themiskyra.</p><p>Aboard it was a man who was then hailed in Greece\u2014and who would be hailed by future generations\u2014as a great hero.</p><p>It is said that the young queen was quite taken with him.</p><p>The reason for her attraction was simple, but that very simplicity made it complicated.</p><p>It was not a sense of duty to leave mighty offspring.</p><p>Nor was it a lust for physical pleasure.</p><p>Admiration.</p><p>When the queen, who until then had known no one truly strong except the gods, saw that man . . . she saw for the first time a man who was a fitting match for her origin, the god of war.</p><p>According to the surviving Amazons, the queen\u2019s eyes shone then like the eyes of a child who had just been told tales of the Olympian gods.</p><p>The queen did not hesitate to grant that great hero, who said that he had come on the order of a king to obtain the belt of the god of war, permission to stay and to negotiate.</p><p>Of course, she had not let her emotions get the better of her or decided to give up the belt without a plan.</p><p>She decided to give up the belt after allowing any women of her tribe who wanted children to mingle with the heroes aboard the ship and entering into a trade agreement with the city-state to which the great hero belonged.</p><p>The fact that the king did not want the belt for himself, but because his daughter asked for it helped negotiations to proceed smoothly.</p><p>The queen and her people ultimately accepted it as \u201Cgiving aid to a woman living in a far-away land.\u201D</p><p>In the end, they came to the conclusion that forging a peaceful alliance with that great hero was worth more to the Amazon people than the war-belt.</p><p>Neither the queen nor her people would ever hide behind an army of men. They would not be afraid even to do battle with that great hero, but the queen was not so mad for battle that she would go to war without cause.</p><p>Given that the great hero was a man, they could not accept him as one of them, but by establishing a friendly rivalry between them, the queen hoped to cultivate a competitive spirit in her women and make them a stronger, more united people.</p><p>Although the queen allowed her emotions to drive her as she raced across the battlefield, she also made many such political decisions. For that reason, she was known to her people as a woman of two faces, but both of those faces commanded their respect.</p><p>They could not say whether her policy concerning the great hero and his men was realistic based on the social conditions of the time, or an impracticable pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>That was because it never bore fruit.</p><p>The relationship the queen had envisioned between her people and the great hero fell apart at the negotiation table just as she was about to hand over the belt.</p><p></p><p>Because the schemes of a goddess led . . . to the queen\u2019s tragic death.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Main Street, Snowfield</p><p></p><p>A massive horse dashed over the broken asphalt, weaving through the thick, jet-black mist.</p><p>There had been four horses at first, but one and then another had been consumed by the oncoming darkness until the hoofbeats of only one could still be heard.</p><p>Even with its fellows hidden from the world, the last gargantuan horse raced through the city night as the whim of the grotesque Heroic Spirit on its back\u2014Alkeides\u2014without the slightest trace of fear.</p><p>But even a Heroic Spirit as great as Alkeides had no choice but to flee.</p><p>The blackness came on.</p><p>The blackness came on.</p><p>An overwhelming cloud of blackness was hot on Alkeides\u2019 heels, borne on the air that swayed with the leaves of the roadside trees, on the breeze that blew between the buildings, and even on the despairing sighs of those it had already consumed.</p><p>Alkeides carried within him warped, mud-like magical energy the color of destruction, but the shadow that pursued him embodied a different kind of darkness.</p><p>Alkeides had no way of knowing exactly what that \u201Cblack mist\u201D was.</p><p>Still, all his accumulated experience and the senses honed by the deadly combat he had just been engaged in told him that it was no ordinary being.</p><p>He could not know what became of those engulfed by the inky blackness, but he did notice one thing: The Spirit Origin of Kerberos, a part of his Noble Phantasm, had vanished from the area.</p><p>The magical energy that linked them was not completely gone, but he could neither recall it nor dismiss it.</p><p>It was as if a massive ward was slithering of its own accord in an effort to isolate him.</p><p>As the dark torrent, like the khamsin he had once seen in an arid region on the Mediterranean coast in life dyed black, rushed on behind him, his horse\u2019s hooves at last outpaced the \u201Cblack mist.\u201D</p><p>There was no longer any obstacle in the way of his horse. His escape seemed simple.</p><p></p><p>That instant . . . the faint sound of something slicing the air reached Alkeides\u2019 ears.</p><p>\u201C. . . Here?\u201D The bowman-turned-avenger muttered, a hint of a different emotion in his irritated voice.</p><p>\u201CYou would attack me in these circumstances? You are certainly fearless, queen.\u201D</p><p>At the same time, he nocked an arrow to his bow and, still urging on his horse, twisted his upper body and loosed it.</p><p>There was a crash, and sparks shone in the night of Main Street.</p><p>A moment later, hoofbeats resounded through the gaps between buildings, weaving a tumultuous ensemble with those of Alkeides\u2019 massive steed.</p><p>A single, swift horse appeared, displaying extraordinary movements. On its back rode a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>\u201C. . . Alkeides!\u201D The woman on the horse\u2014the Rider-Class Heroic Spirit Hippolyte\u2014shouted the moment they caught sight of each other. \u201CHow dare you! Are you planning to dishonor what those brave heroes achieved by using a curse to hold back the venom?!\u201D</p><p>When he heard that, Alkeides flashed a fearless grin behind his cloth, even while he suppressed the hydra venom coursing through his veins with the power of the \u201Cmud\u201D that had flowed into him through Bazdilot.</p><p>I see. That explains it.</p><p>The image of the police officers he had faced shortly before flashed through his mind.</p><p>Those humans, setting aside the one called John . . . They may have wielded Noble Phantasms, but I doubt many could have stood firm in the face of my strength.</p><p>His torrent of magical energy should have been enough to scatter a mob of police officers.</p><p>But they had remained on the battlefield and survived.</p><p>They had been consumed by the black mist, and he did not know what had happened to them after that, but they had been unnaturally resilient . . . Or rather, some outside force had unquestionably been enhancing their meagre strength.</p><p>\u201CQueen.\u201D</p><p>Alkeides\u2019 doubts instantly came to a head as he urged on his horse with all his might, and he matter-of-factly stated his conclusion.</p><p>\u201CYou . . . gave them your protection, didn\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Hippolyte accelerated her horse and fired her next arrow in silence.</p><p>Alkeides deflected it with his bow. The deflected arrow flew forward and tore up a large chunk of asphalt.</p><p>The avenger\u2019s massive steed, however, trampled the viscous obstacle as if it were not there and hurtled forward, always forward with all its might.</p><p>Alkeides flowed smoothly into a counterattack without stopping the scything motion of his bow.</p><p>He nocked three of his own arrows at once and fired them in unison with the acceleration of his horse.</p><p>The three arrows tore through the air, each tracing a different trajectory, closing in on Hippolyte from the front, back, and above.</p><p>Hippolyte, however, skillfully maneuvered her horse and rode it across the side of a building.</p><p>Running in such a way would normally, of course, be impossible.</p><p>Launching out of the posture of a mountain deer walking up the wall of a dam, the swift steed continued to practically glide through the urban landscape with the force of a falcon.</p><p>Horse and rider moved like a single creature\u2014Hippolyte continued to use her bow without being shaken by her steed\u2019s movements. Paired with their blinding speed, their movements could be mistaken for a centaur of legend.</p><p>The queen of the Amazons, sometimes called \u201Cthe original equestrian tribe,\u201D drew a pinnacle of horse-riding skill whose perfection belied her youthful appearance\u2014or rather, which had been arrived at by a different path than \u201Cperfection\u201D in the modern day\u2014from the depths of her Spirit Origin as she sliced through the darkness of night accompanied by the neighing of her steed.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sure that some of those officials were men,\u201D Alkeides probed the queen as his own horse rocked him.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CHas the radiance of the Grail and the logic of war led you to abandon your pride, queen of the Amazons?\u201D</p><p><img src="https://imgur.com/a/LEWNtpA" alt=""></p><p>\u201C. . . Silence.\u201D</p><p>Neither of them allowed their offense or defense to slacken, even as they exchanged words.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know what you would wish for . . . but would you really forsake your way of life for the wish-granting Grail?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI said silence!\u201D</p><p>Hippolyte added emphasis in vexation. Alkeides showered her with quiet yet forceful words.</p><p></p><p>\u201CLike you did when you betrayed us?\u201D He asked, probing.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>The queen\u2019s response . . . was not an angry bellow but silence.</p><p>All expression vanished from Hippolyte\u2019s eyes, which had been blazing with fury. Her mount was leaving the nighttime scenery behind it with the speed of the wind, but in her mind, time had stopped.</p><p>The face she exposed in the dark night was devoid of expression, or perhaps its expression had been blotted out by so many other emotions piled onto it like coals.</p><p>But that only lasted a moment.</p><p>Just the instant between her horse kicking the ground and its hooves striking it again.</p><p>After that brief blank in which the world seemed to have frozen, the look plastered on her face was . . . a fearless grin.</p><p>\u201CNonsense!\u201D</p><p>She swiftly drew her own horse alongside Alkeides\u2019 gargantuan steed and brandished a long spear materialized from the depths of her Spirit Origin.</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWere you trying to test me? Then you should have put more scorn in your words, Avenger.\u201D</p><p>The spear was longer than its wielder Hippolyte was tall. She swung it at Alkeides, pressing him in an effort to take his life.</p><p>In a flash, her Noble Phantasm, the war god\u2019s belt, was wrapped around her arm that held the spear, and a thrust cloaked in a divine aura shot out at Alkeides\u2019 bow.</p><p>Alkeides countered by immediately activating the same Noble Phantasm\u2014the war god\u2019s belt\u2014and parrying the thrust with his divine-aura-clad bow.</p><p>A limb of his mighty bow deflected the spearhead, and a loud crash echoed through the city night.</p><p>Scattered divinity tore through the surrounding darkness and slowed the pursuit of the \u201Cblack mist.\u201D</p><p>They clashed a second time, then a third, then their horses separated, and Hippolyte roared:</p><p>\u201CYou can\u2019t seriously believe that I would fall for a taunt like that!\u201D</p><p>Their voices sounded with strange force in each other\u2019s ears despite the sounds of hoofbeats and flying arrows that filled the air.</p><p>They continued to launch attacks on each other as their horses crossed paths in three dimensions and the \u201Cblack mist\u201D closed in behind them with renewed vigor.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re acting desperate, Alkeides!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh . . .?\u201D</p><p>Hippolyte was firing her bow at the gaps in the Nemean lion\u2019s pelt that protected him while occasionally switching to her spear and attacking his weapon directly.</p><p>It was a ceaseless rain of blows, perfectly in sink with the movements of her galloping horse.</p><p>She was struggling to bridge the gap in the magical energy contained in their Spirit Origins with skill, but Alkeides was worn down by consecutive battles and was in no condition to shake her off with brute force.</p><p>Beside which . . .</p><p>. . .</p><p>As he fended off the queen\u2019s spear thrusts, Alkeides realized.</p><p>Her strength is growing.</p><p>The quantity and quality of her magical energy were clearly greater than they had been during their encounter in the ravine.</p><p>Has she been temporarily boosted using a Command Spell . . .?</p><p>No, this isn\u2019t a momentary enhancement. The base of her Spirit Origin has been reinforced.</p><p>\u201CI retract my insult, queen.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CI imagined that your strategy was to provide your blessing to others while remaining hidden yourself and strike me while my guard was down . . . but you intend to tear through me head-on.\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course I do,\u201D the queen casually shot back from astride her horse, then bellowed: \u201CAlkeides . . . you\u2019re laboring under a misunderstanding.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have no intention of denying my sisters\u2019 and my people\u2019s beliefs, whatever they may be.\u201D She built up power in the cloth wound around her right arm\u2014the war god\u2019s belt\u2014she continued in a clear, ringing voice: \u201CBut you could never know why my people were born . . .!\u201D</p><p>Her right arm glowed and the divine aura that filled her body swelled explosively.</p><p>She concentrated the greater part of that radiance into the spear in her right hand and channeled the remainder into her mount.</p><p>The queen and her prized steed had gone beyond unity of horse and rider and become one with her weapon as well. They formed a single arrowhead, driving a ferocious blow into Alkeides.</p><p>\u201COr what I truly wished for at the end of those lush, spirit-haunted plains!\u201D</p><p></p><p>For an instant, the \u201Cblack mist\u201D hid them completely . . . then the loudest crash yet rang out and scattered it once again.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Well struck, queen.\u201D</p><p>Once the black mist cleared, it revealed Alkeides atop his horse, with the spear thrust into his left arm.</p><p>\u201CIt seems you have found an excellent Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can see that in this short time you have either grown far more accustomed to battle or received precise tuning. They must be impressive to enable you to draw out so much divine power in this world so far removed from the Age of Gods.\u201D</p><p>His wound, however, was far from lethal. Despite the fact that the spearhead was still embedded between his bones, the dark red \u201Cmud\u201D was already squirming out to fill the wound.</p><p>\u201C. . . Alkeides . . . what are you carrying inside you?\u201D Hippolyte asked, her face growing grim and her right hand still gripping her spear. \u201CWhat is that \u2018mud\u2019?\u201D</p><p>Because her spearhead was still stuck into Alkeides, they were naturally forced to continue riding in parallel. As Hippolyte, seeing the \u201Cmud\u201D oozing from her opponent\u2019s wound, hesitated to pull back her spear for a moment, the bow swung by Alkeides\u2019 right hand bit into her side.</p><p>With a grunt, she hurriedly blocked it with divine energy from the belt, but the force of the blow pulled her spear free and put distance between the two horses again.</p><p>Alkeides checked that the mud had staunched his wound once the spear was removed, then casually declared:</p><p>\u201C. . . Who can say? But given that it adapts to my current form . . . it\u2019s probably part of a \u2018human.\u2019\u201D</p><p>The next instant . . . a portion of the mud that had overflowed from his wound abruptly grew into a dark-red surge that launched itself at Hippolyte.</p><p>\u201CIn which case, demigod queen . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CKnow that you cannot pierce the end of man with mere divine power.\u201D</p><p>The \u201Cmud\u201D the color of half-rotten blood and distinct from the \u201Cblack mist\u201D leapt to engulf Hippolyte like a mass of living slime.</p><p>She and her horse avoided it just in the nick of time.</p><p>But the \u201Cmud,\u201D which seemed to have a will of its own, pursued Hippolyte, forming into an immense pair of viscous jaws to consume her in a single gulp.</p><p>\u201CIt will take more than that . . .!\u201D</p><p>Hippolyte once again focused magical energy into the belt wrapped around her arm, preparing to draw it more divine energy . . . but as if in response, the mud suddenly burst apart.</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>It spread out like a spiderweb centered on a Main Street intersection, becoming a cloud of muddy fumes that threatened to envelope Hippolyte and her mount from all sides.</p><p>Faced with what looked like a forest of black trees closing in on her from every direction, Hippolyte, aware of the dangers, began to fuse her own Spirit Origin with the belt, when . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201CWith my Command Spell, I order you:\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .! Master?!\u201D</p><p>A voice sounded within Hippolyte, going beyond telepathy and speaking directly to the nature of her Spirit Origin.</p><p></p><p>\u201CDraw the dragon from the leylines and release it with divine might!\u201D</p><p></p><p>The next instant, magical energy welled up from her surroundings\u2014from the sacred ground of Snowfield itself\u2014and was drawn into Hippolyte\u2019s Goddess of War.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rainbow-colored radiance lit the darkness of night.</p><p></p><p>It was not only her Noble Phantasm.</p><p>The magical energy contained within the Heroic Spirit herself swelled explosively, and with an immense torrent of light with her at its center, she blasted away most of the oncoming \u201Cmud.\u201D</p><p>When the blinding light subsided, and Hippolyte surveyed her surroundings . . . the \u201Cmud,\u201D the \u201Cblack mist,\u201D and even Alkeides were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Realizing that he had taken the opportunity to withdraw, Hippolyte gritted her teeth.</p><p>\u201CAre you trying to say I\u2019m not even worth settling things with . . .?!\u201D</p><p></p><p>Once Hippolyte\u2019s anger had subsided, she turned to the empty air and spoke. She was communicating telepathically with her Master.</p><p>\u201CMaster, one of your valuable Command Spells . . .\u201D She began to protest but was unable to continue.</p><p>\u201C. . . No. Thank you, Master. And I apologize. It seems I still wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201D</p><p>The recoil she had suffered and the twisted magical energy of the \u201Cmud\u201D that had almost flowed back on her the moment she had blown it away with her Command-Spell-boosted Spirit Origin had convinced her:</p><p>As things stood, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop it.</p><p>She was able to surmise that it would have been impossible for her to completely shake off that \u201Cmud\u201D mingled with Alkeides\u2019 blood and an immense quantity of magical energy without the aid of a Command Spell.</p><p>And . . . if that \u201Cmud\u201D had done anything to her, she was sure that it would have been dire.</p><p>She believed that her Master, observing her from a distance, had used the precious Command Spell to save her because her Master had taken it more seriously than she had.</p><p>Even if my Master used up all three Command Spells, I doubt I would ever want to rebel . . .</p><p>Hippolyte harbored no dislike for the being who was her Master.</p><p>There was points on which they disagreed, but her Master was worthy of riding alongside.</p><p>But for that very reason . . . she felt indebted to her Master for needing the help of a Command Spell in a battle with an opponent tied to herself.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>The cityscape after Alkeides had departed and the black mist had rolled back.</p><p>Hippolyte stroked her horse\u2019s neck as she surveyed her surroundings.</p><p>She had already left Main Street and put a considerable distance between herself and the hospital from which the \u201Cblack mist\u201D had burst.</p><p>As the sky began to lighten, she sensed the townspeople who had been kept away beginning to stir near the hospital.</p><p>\u201CIn any case, I can\u2019t keep fighting like this. Let\u2019s start over, Master,\u201D Hippolyte telepathically announced and remounted her horse.</p><p>\u201CYou ran well, Kalion. Let\u2019s rest with Master.\u201D</p><p>Hippolyte called her horse\u2019s name with a peaceful expression, then dematerialized and slowly set off back to the stronghold where her Master was, taking out-of-the-way side streets.</p><p>The retreating figures of the girl and horse were seen by several people before they dematerialized, but because casinos and other businesses occasionally employed horses for publicity, no one paid them much mind. They assumed that Hippolyte\u2019s clothes must also be promotion for some event and continued on their ways.</p><p>The people of Snowfield could no longer afford to waste energy on such minor oddities.</p><p>People who were supposed to have left the city inexplicably returned saying that they \u201Cdid not want to leave.\u201D</p><p>A mysterious disease was running rampant among animals.</p><p>Terrorists had attacked the police station.</p><p>Then there was the gas pipeline explosion in the desert, the damage caused to the city by a freak windstorm, and the fire in the factory district.</p><p>It was one disaster after another, and everyone who checked the news or the weather all suspected the same thing: that the enormous hurricane that had the western United States in an uproar, which had formed without warning and was supposed to be heading straight for their region of the country, would make a beeline for Snowfield.</p><p>That all of this could not be coincidence. That something was happening in their city.</p><p>They had no proof.</p><p>If they wrote about it online, the responses from people in other areas were full of comments like, \u201CTalk about bad luck,\u201D and \u201CYou guys must be cursed.\u201D</p><p>The fact that there had been few deaths was part of the reason, as were the efforts of a government agency to conceal any eye-catching damages, but unease was still growing among Snowfield\u2019s residents.</p><p>Still, the situation had not deteriorated to the point of panic and rioting.</p><p>The countless suggestions and wards built into the city at its inception restrained such impulses.</p><p></p><p>Even so . . . they were approaching their limit.</p><p></p><p>The faces of those who sensed how bad their situation had become were beginning to show signs not of resistance but of resignation.</p><p>They had no idea what was going to happen.</p><p>The unease just swirled in the depths of their intuitions.</p><p>A feeling that the town called Snowfield would soon be coming to an end.</p><p>And that their lives and those of everyone else would be dragged into it.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>In the Sky</p><p></p><p>A massive airship flew, through the power of magecraft, at a normally unattainable altitude.</p><p>Inside the blimp, which doubled as the workshop of Francesca\u2014a mage who was among the masterminds of the \u201CFake Holy Grail War\u201D in Snowfield\u2014the mage girl observed events on the ground below alongside Francois Prelati, the Caster she had summoned.</p><p>Francesca had been using Francois\u2019 Illusion Skill to deceive spatial distance and observe the battle in front of the hospital as if it were unfolding right in front of her without relying on familiars. However . . .</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s weird . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D Caster asked, stuffing his face with pumpkin pie.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of funny stuff going on,\u201D his Master, Francesca, answered with an air of confusion. \u201CI\u2019m mean, I\u2019m happy that unforeseen things are happening, but not knowing the answers makes my head feel all fuzzy, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou sure are selfish. Just what I\u2019d expect from me.\u201D Caster\u2014Prelati\u2014replied with a raucous laugh. Francesca ignored him and continued to think out loud.</p><p>\u201CThe Amazon queen\u2019s Spirit Origin is higher quality than it was when I saw her in the ravine. Her fortune\u2019s about the same, but her physical abilities and her inner magical energy maybe have gone up by maybe a full rank.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWow, that can happen? I never expected to see a Servant grow during the War.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt can, if they get a boost from an injection of magical energy. . . . Do you think her Master, little Doris, has finally taken reinforcement magecraft into forbidden territory? Maybe putting her lifespan and even her Crest on the line to enhance her own Magic Circuits by force . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhoa. That queen\u2019s master is on \u2018our side,\u2019 right? She should know that the grail\u2019s a warped fake. She\u2019d have to be crazy to still risk her life for it.\u201D</p><p>Prelati seemed to have taken an interest, because he wiped the pumpkin cream from around his mouth with a handkerchief and turned to look at Francesca.</p><p>\u201CWell, we won\u2019t get to find out if it can approach the Third Magic or not until all\u2019s said and done . . . but considering how much magical energy is involved, it should be able to grant some pretty high-quality wishes.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, who cares! It\u2019s more fun if they really struggle instead of going down easily, anyway! I mean, we\u2019ve got a real upset on our hands, with a top-contender like Gilgamesh going down!\u201D Francesca suddenly decided to accept the situation and burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201CAnyway,\u201D Prelati asked her, \u201CI\u2019m more interested in that black mist that came out of the hospital. What was that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2019Who knows\u2019? . . . That stuff\u2019s not normal. Should we do something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat would you do in my shoes? Panic and cry that you\u2019re confused and scared?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Well, if I didn\u2019t know, I guessed I\u2019d say, \u2018Who knows?\u2019 But seeing a gender-swapped me crying her eyes out might be surprisingly hot, so why not give it a try?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI completely agree, but it\u2019d be a pain, so only if I feel like it. Right now, I\u2019ve got no clue what\u2019s going to happen, and I want to enjoy it to the max!\u201D</p><p>She brushed off Prelati and went on wondering aloud.</p><p>\u201CStill . . . little Tsubaki ending up as a Master was a funny accident, but I\u2019d like to know what kind of Heroic Spirit she summoned. I mean, it seems like it whisked a bunch of people off to who-knows-where, you know?</p><p>\u201CAnd that girl . . . Haruri, right? My organs ached with joy when she summoned a monster, but she wasn\u2019t very exciting today, was she?</p><p>\u201CI mean, it\u2019s no fun having people do whatever they feel like where I can\u2019t see them.\u201D</p><p>At that point, Francesca narrowed her eyes, and her smile took on a wicked air as she muttered:</p><p></p><p>\u201CAnd that bloodsucker coming and going as he pleases is just a little . . . unpleasant, don\u2019t you think?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>In a Dream</p><p></p><p>\u201CIt looks like quite a lot have been drawn into \u2018this world.\u2019 . . . I wonder what will happen now.\u201D</p><p>The hematophage in the shape of a young boy\u2014Jester Karture, the mage who was technically Assassin\u2019s Master\u2014used his power to switch his power to switch his body to his boy form and gloated over the city from atop a building.</p><p>\u201CIf Miss Assassin sides with this world, she\u2019ll make enemies of the police. Not that they were friendly to begin with,\u201D Jester muttered to himself, chuckling.</p><p>\u201CIf she sides against this world, she\u2019ll have to kill little Tsubaki, who she fought so hard to protect. Yes, it won\u2019t hurt me, whichever way it goes.</p><p>\u201CThis is a Holy Grail War,\u201D Jester continued with a wicked grin at odds with his youthful appearance. \u201CEveryone around you is an enemy. Everyone.\u201D</p><p>Soon, a hint of ecstasy crept into his smile, and he spread his arms wide in ecstasy.</p><p>Jester continued to express his own joy in the world, as if trying to take the blue sky, in which the sun had fully risen, on himself.</p><p>\u201COnly I . . . Only I, your Master, can be your ally . . . Miss Assassin.\u201D</p><p></p><p>And so, Jester was drunk on his own ecstasy . . . but he was overlooking something\u2014a single \u201Cabnormality\u201D that had occurred in that world.</p><p>Not even Tsubaki\u2019s Servant, Pale Rider, had noticed it.</p><p>Beneath the Kuruokas\u2019 residence, something else was being born.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the house, a mage\u2019s workshop, larger than the basement, had been constructed.</p><p>Around a certain \u201Ccatalyst\u201D that had been carefully preserved in its center, an abnormality was manifesting.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it ought to be called an apparition.</p><p>At the very least, it was no one\u2019s Servant.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Why?\u201D</p><p></p><p>It was a being that might have become one, but no magical energy linked it to anyone.</p><p>It had probably risen in response to some influence and would soon disappear. \u201CIt\u201D was cloaked in a red garment causing quivering water droplets to drift about it.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhy am I here . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>It had clean-cut features and a strange, androgynous figure . . . but it did nothing in particular. It only wavered in that spot.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Zheng?\u201D</p><p></p><p>For the moment.</p><h2 id="chapter-17-day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-17-day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 17: Day 3</h2><p><strong>Breaking Dawn and Wakeless Dreams II</strong></p><hr><p>Day 3, Morning, Snowfield Police Station, Chief\u2019s Office</p><p></p><p>A full day had passed in Snowfield since the deadly battle in front of the hospital.</p><p>The damage to Main Street had been explained away as an underground gas and water pipe accident triggered by the pipeline explosion that had left the crater in the desert.</p><p>The terrorists supposed to have attacked the police station had sabotaged the pipes before the attack, and the delayed effect on plumbing already damaged by the desert explosion and magnified the tragedy . . . or so the cover story went. Possibly it had been judged that the gas company would not last until the end of the Holy Grail War without an excuse.</p><p>The townspeople\u2019s anger was directed at the nonexistent terrorists, but because news that those terrorists were still at large was spread at the same time, a portion of the citizens developed a sense of danger and began to avoid visiting the city\u2019s urban areas without a good reason.</p><p>In the midst of that situation, one man\u2019s muttering filled his spacious office.</p><p>\u201CSo, Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, was taken down . . .\u201D Snowfield\u2019s chief of police, Orlando Reeve, muttered to himself with a frown as he went over the reports of one of his subordinates assigned to monitor Gilgamesh\u2019s Master, Tine Chelk, and her faction.</p><p>He had guessed as much based on magical-energy measurements he had conducted in his office the night before.</p><p>Kuruoka Tsubaki, the Kuruokas\u2019 daughter, was believed to have somehow developed Command Spells while unconscious and become a Master.</p><p>He had dispatched officers to take Tsubaki into protective custody and confirm the intentions of her Servant, but their visit had turned into a melee between multiple Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Orlando had observed an extraordinary torrent of magical energy. An instant later, the Spirit Origin response he believed to be the King of Heroes Gilgamesh had fluctuated and was now becoming undetectable.</p><p>\u201COur most dangerous enemy is gone . . . or at least that\u2019s how I normally ought to look at this.\u201D</p><p>The chief had not despaired, but his face was severe.</p><p>He may have lost a powerful enemy . . . but the blow to his own faction had been devastating.</p><p>More than twenty of his subordinates\u2014all but a few he had held back in case a third party attempted to exploit the commotion\u2014had vanished immediately after the King of Heroes\u2019 Spirit Origin faded.</p><p>If they had been killed, he would be able to give up on them and immediately shift focus to his next move.</p><p>He did not have enough of a mage\u2019s mentality to be unmoved by the loss, but he was prepared for all of them to die, himself included.</p><p>But, while he was not going to complain, not knowing if they were alive or dead did force him to consider his next move.</p><p>There were not even traces of corpses\u2014only the material damage remained.</p><p>Most of the nearby surveillance cameras had already been destroyed by the battle, but several surviving cameras had captured footage of a black mist welling up from the direction of the hospital.</p><p>It looked like little more than thin smog on video, but if some form of magical energy were at work, then it might appear thicker to the naked eyes of mages or Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Even his second in command, Vera Levitt, had disappeared.</p><p>The chief had lost most of his pawns, but he considered confirming whether they were alive or dead his top priority.</p><p>Even supposing that the mist did take their lives, the absence of bodies has to mean something.</p><p>Consider the motive. Save figuring out who did what for later.</p><p>Do they plan to use the corpses? Either by controlling them like zombies, or by extracting information about us directly from their brains . . .?</p><p>If they aren\u2019t dead . . . they might brainwash them without killing them or torture them for information . . .</p><p>It was depressing to think that he risked his subordinates turning against him or having information stolen in either case, but the chief continued his conjecture.</p><p>Other possible reasons . . . Does Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s Servant need to hide a large number of humans somewhere?</p><p>Either way, it boils down to a \u201Cwhydunnit.\u201D</p><p>Although, while I can manage painstaking investigation, deductions were never my specialty.</p><p>Its Master\u2019s orders . . .? No, that couldn\u2019t be it.</p><p>Kuruoka Tsubaki is comatose. She\u2019s in no condition to communicate with her Servant.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Wait. Is that really true?</p><p>I\u2019m deliberately severing the link, but according to Faldeus, Servants\u2019 memories can flow into their Masters through the magical energy that connects them . . .</p><p>What about the reverse?</p><p>What if it read something from Tsubaki\u2019s subconscious mind while she\u2019s comatose and . . .</p><p>Just as the chief\u2019s thoughts were accelerating, a voice that slammed on the breaks sounded through the room.</p><p>\u201CYo.\u201D</p><p>The chief turned and saw his own Servant, Caster Alexandre Dumas p\xE8re.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you doing here, Caster?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I\u2019ve just been lending a hand.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSorry, bro,\u201D Dumas answered the chief\u2019s suspicious question, \u201Cyou cut off telepathy from your end. Then again, I didn\u2019t try the phone \u2018cause I was sure you\u2019d stop me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, what are you talking about?\u201D The chief asked despite suspecting he would not like the answer.</p><p>\u201CWell,\u201D Dumas continued light-heartedly, plopping down onto the visitors\u2019 sofa in a corner of the office, \u201Cit was lucky I was watching the fighting from a step back. If I\u2019d been at ringside, I\u2019d be in that black mist now myself. . . . \u2018Course, I probably could have focused on supporting your officers better that way.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?! You were there?! I don\u2019t remember giving that order!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, and I don\u2019t remember getting it. Good to know both our memories are in good shape. We could be witnesses for an alibi; that\u2019s an important role in plays and novels.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .! Do you understand your position? My officers and I can be replaced, but if anything happens to you, our Heroic Spirit, our faction is finished.\u201D</p><p>The chief\u2019s words were charged with quiet anger, but Dumas brushed off his feelings with a shrug and answered as flippantly as if he were ordering breakfast.</p><p>\u201CNot really. There are plenty of ways you could make it work. It\u2019s about time we got some Heroic Spirits at a loose end, with just their Masters killed\u2014just make a contract with one of them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you think you can get out of this with assumptions like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m saying that you wanted in to this war, so don\u2019t chalk it up as \u2018finished\u2019 so easily.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>At Dumas words, the chief paused to take several deep breaths in silence, wiped all trace of anger and impatience from his face, and resumed speaking with careful self-control.</p><p>\u201C. . . I suppose you\u2019re right. Sorry. Even if all of our forces, including the two of us, die, we shouldn\u2019t consider that the end.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha! I like how it only takes you a second to cool your head.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll take that as consolation . . . but cooling my head won\u2019t help me to improve our situation.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen have some good news\u2014my treat. Your officers who disappeared are still in good shape.\u201D</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>The chief\u2019s eyes widened slightly.</p><p>\u201CI can still sense the weapons I cooked up,\u201D Dumas continued with a cheerful grin. \u201CI may not be much of a Caster for this Grail War, but I can at least tell if things I\u2019ve been mixed up with still exist or not. Going by my feelings, the weapons I gave them are still somewhere in our world . . . but not somewhere you could walk to. . . . That\u2019s my honest opinion.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut the fact that the Noble Phantasms are intact doesn\u2019t guarantee their users\u2019 safety, does it?\u201D The chief asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201CJohn\u2019s alive, at least,\u201D Dumas answered.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll explain that later. It just means I\u2019ve got a Noble Phantasm I hadn\u2019t told you about yet.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . No. If you say you\u2019ll explain later, I\u2019ll wait. My officers\u2019 safety takes priority.\u201D</p><p>The chief swallowed whatever he had been about to say and returned his attention to the problem at hand.</p><p>\u201CStill . . . I don\u2019t understand. Are they inside some kind of ward? . . . Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a Reality Marble?\u201D</p><p>A Reality Marble.</p><p>At the thought of the term, the chief mentally let out a little groan.</p><p>\u201CA Reality Marble . . . That\u2019s great magecraft, right? Builds up a little world out of a mental landscape and jams it into our world?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour understanding is a little crude, but not entirely mistaken. . . . Hmm, a Reality Marble or similar magecraft would certainly be capable of isolating a certain number of people. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a Heroic Spirit had a trick or two like that up their sleeve . . . but it ought to require a massive supply of magical energy. It could hold the people who disappeared captive for a short time, but not over an extended period.\u201D</p><p>Even in the world of magecraft, Reality Marbles were said to approach Magic.</p><p>Considering the magical energy of mages, even a Heroic Spirit should not be able to overwrite reality with their \u201Cworld,\u201D sometimes even bending the laws of physics, for more than a few minutes.</p><p>It would be a different story if they had a source of magical energy to maintain it longer, but their surveillance system ought to detect some sign of a movement of magical energy on that scale.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that Faldeus has already picked it up and is withholding the information . . .</p><p>No . . . there\u2019s also the massive magical energy reading that did suddenly appear last night.</p><p>We should keep running the surveillance system, but if it\u2019s possible to completely conceal a flow of magical energy on that scale, we\u2019ll need to try other approaches as well.</p><p>While the chief sank into thought, Dumas was reading a newspaper lying on the reception table.</p><p>\u201CHey, more bad news. Get a load of this\u2014there\u2019s a hurricane heading straight for us. Think a Heroic Spirit could be behind that?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . The hurricane developed far to the west of us. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s unrelated. Still . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CGoing by that sour face, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not so optimistic. That\u2019s good. Whether it\u2019s connected or not, wind and rain is gonna blow our plans all out of whack. Looks like a whole bunch of your country\u2019s big shots died in one day, too. That\u2019s another storm to worry about.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m concerned about that . . . but I doubt I\u2019d get a satisfactory answer about it out of Faldeus or that old bitch.\u201D</p><p>The timing being what it was, the chief suspected everything taking place in the United States of being involved with the \u201CFake Holy Grail War\u201D in Snowfield. But even if it were connected, he frustratingly lacked any immediate way to be certain.</p><p>In central Snowfield, with the situation only growing worse, the chief realized his own powerlessness.</p><p>No, I already knew that.</p><p>I was always prepared to be outclassed in terms of ability. Still, we . . .</p><p>The chief clenched his fists.</p><p>\u201CSo, what\u2019re you gonna do, bro?\u201D Dumas asked casually.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen are you gonna go save them? It\u2019ll depend on where they vanished to, but if a Heroic Spirit like me can sneak in there, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201D</p><p>The chief frowned.</p><p>He did not know everything about the Heroic Spirit he had summoned, but he did have a general grasp of his capabilities.</p><p>\u201C. . . You almost fooled me earlier, but I can\u2019t afford to send you to the front lines. I haven\u2019t ordered you to go that far, and I don\u2019t intend to. If you\u2019re going to insist on acting on your own initiative again, I\u2019ll restrict your movements even if it means using a Command Spell.\u201D</p><p>The chief\u2019s tone was severe. Dumas wiped his usual grin off his face and answered in earnest.</p><p>\u201CNo, you did order me. And first thing, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CBrother, you asked me to make weapons for your officers\u2014to give \u2018the strength to fight\u2019 to a bunch of people who are novice mages and compared to Heroic Spirits aren\u2019t much different from the brats rocking in strollers out there in the park.\u201D</p><p>Dumas flipped through the newspaper, pointed to a page of a serialized short story by an author living in Las Vegas, and tapped it with his finger as he began to expound.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m an author, brother. What \u2018strength\u2019 can I give you guys? What \u2018weapons\u2019? Is it the \u2018Noble Phantasm\u2019 that latched onto me from who-knows-where when I became a Heroic Spirit, whatever that is? The Item Creation Skill I got served as a garnish? Well, that\u2019s one answer, but it doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the matter.\u201D</p><p>At that point, Dumas stopped his fingers and lifted the newspaper between them.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s only one thing that I can give to other people! Yes\u2014stories!\u201D</p><p>The next instant, Alexandre Dumas sent the newspaper fluttering through the air and loudly proclaimed, amid the rain of letters:</p><p>\u201CFiction or nonfiction! Plays I edited or my own autobiography! Fantasies worked out from A to Z inside my head! Lofty personages and historical ways of life reworked into history! The compiled history of the world\u2019s cooking! Every last one of them is a \u2018story.\u2019\u201D</p><p>Dumas continued in a clear voice, like he was performing a scene in a play.</p><p>He was not raising his voice, but it echoed in the pit of your stomach, like the song of a huge whale heard close up.</p><p>The chief judged that even if it were only an illusion, the words were sufficient to create that illusion. He did not ignore it as more of the Heroic Spirit\u2019s usual banter.</p><p>Seeing the chief\u2019s attitude, Dumas went on in high spirits.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s true that when Mr. Garibaldi said he was gonna start a revolution, I supported him with ships and money and weapons. But that was a \u2018story\u2019 too. The moment other people found out that gold, guns, and glory had fallen into someone else\u2019s hands, those things gained a bunch of meanings. Alexandre Dumas, author of Les Trois Mousquetaires, supported the hero causing a sensation! I might not\u2019ve had much effect back then, but it was enough to influence one person\u2019s life. I glanced at some info about me online, and that story was there all right. That at least shows that people remembered it for a hundred years and a bit.\u201D</p><p>After hearing Dumas\u2019 speech, delivered like an actor in a play, the chief fell silent for a few moments, then ordered his emotions as he began to speak.</p><p>\u201C. . . I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. But that has nothing to do with you putting yourself in harm\u2019s\u2014\u201D</p><p>But Dumas cut him off.</p><p></p><p>\u201CJohn Wingard.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>The unexpected proper noun from Dumas caused the chief to freeze for an instant.</p><p>\u201CVera Levitt, Annie Cuaron, Don Hawkins, Chadwick Li, Yuki Capote, Adrina Eisenstein, . . .\u201D</p><p>The chief immediately recognized the list of names that Dumas rattled off as he carefully picked up the sheets of newspaper that he had just sent dancing through the air.</p><p>They were the names of all the members of \u201CClan Calatin,\u201D the fighting force he had organized.</p><p>It was only a list of names, but the chief felt an undeniable power behind the words and continued to listen without interrupting.</p><p>\u201C. . ., Sophia Valentine, Eddie Brando . . . and last but not least, you, brother\u2014Chief of Police Orlando Reeve.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I knew you had been looking up details, but I didn\u2019t expect you to memorize all of their names.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, not just their names\u2014their faces, voices, personal histories, and everything else I could learn, down to their favorite herbs and spices. But you\u2019re the type to memorize all your officers\u2019 names yourself, aren\u2019t you, brother?\u201D</p><p>Dumas was not boasting. Once he had finished his matter-of-fact statement, he placed the neatly folded newspaper on the table and moved to the chief\u2019s desk.</p><p>The Heroic Spirit planted both his hands on the desk, leaned his large frame forward, and addressed \u201Chis own words\u201D to his Master.</p><p>\u201CThe names I just listed were the \u2018cast of characters.\u2019 They\u2019re already major characters in one of my works.\u201D</p><p>At that point, Dumas grinned broadly, spread his arms wide, and concluded:</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t fancy myself as God, and I\u2019ve got no intention of controlling \u2018em. But the program is a once-in-a-lifetime Holy Grail War\u2014probably the first and last one you and your people\u2019ll ever see. And I provided a bit of the script in the form of \u2018weapons\u2019 and \u2018power.\u2019\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve given the actors a little twist, but I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna turn out in the end, even for me. Doesn\u2019t that sound like the ultimate play\u2014the ultimate life? Doesn\u2019t it make you want a front-row seat?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Within the Ward</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou mean . . . this is a fake world?\u201D Ayaka Sajou muttered disbelievingly, slipping through the church doors and looking out at the world spread out under the blue sky.</p><p>It was a beautiful cityscape, the kind of scene that would be picked out for the cover of a tourism pamphlet.</p><p>It lacked the weight of history, but the well-ordered blocks of buildings displayed harmony, and the casino hotels and municipal offices in the city center stood out as especially grand.</p><p>The city scenery was the same as ever.</p><p>But even Ayaka could tell at a glance that the situation was not normal.</p><p>For one thing, she could see no one in the city except herself and the police officers.</p><p>For another . . . the church and Main Street in front of the hospital, which had been so showily destroyed the night before, had been restored as if nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all fixed . . . How?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo . . . It looks less like it was repaired than like it was never damaged,\u201D Saber\u2014Richard the Lionheart\u2014who was linked to Ayaka by magical energy responded.</p><p>As he said, there were no traces of repairs on the street, and skid marks and stains that looked days old remained as they had been.</p><p>Ayaka still could not quite bring herself to believe it.</p><p>\u201CIf this really is a fake world,\u201D she asked Saber, \u201Ccan magecraft do something like that . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, although this is coming close to Magic. But it\u2019s probably just barely achievable if you poured a ridiculous amount of time, skill, and resources into it, so I guess it is magecraft and not Magic.\u201D</p><p>Saber sounded almost relaxed. Ayaka heaved a half-exasperated sigh.</p><p>\u201CYou know, this situation seems really weird to me . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, it is. But at the same time, it stimulates my curiosity. Doesn\u2019t the thought of whoever cast this great magecraft excite you?! What will we do if the great Merlin, or someone like him, turns up? In terms of this era\u2019s values, I think I ought to get their autograph.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t care,\u201D Ayaka shot back a perfunctory response. \u201CAnd I don\u2019t know much about this \u2018Merlin\u2019 guy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaybe, but he\u2019d be a powerful enemy. What should we do? Throw him at the moon . . .? No, I\u2019m sure that was just one of Mother\u2019s embellishments . . . Still, he\u2019s a legendary mage . . . If we\u2019re lucky enough to catch him, maybe I could hold him by the leg and swing him around as my Excalibur . . .? He might make a powerful magic sword . . . It\u2019s worth asking if I do get to meet him!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka looked at Saber, who was quietly getting worked up and muttering nonsense to himself with a grin, and kept walking, thinking to herself that he had certainly inherited his mother\u2019s imagination.</p><p>\u201CMore importantly, is it true that we can\u2019t leave unless we defeat that mage . . .? Isn\u2019t there a safer way that we could, I don\u2019t know, sneak out . . .?\u201D</p><p>Saber had just been seriously injured, and Ayaka wanted to avoid conflict as much as possible, but a denial came from a direction other than Saber.</p><p>\u201CI think that would prove difficult. There is a possibility, but who can say how long it would take to find a way without anything to go on?\u201D The female police officer told her with an expression like an android whose emotions had not been configured.</p><p>\u201CUmm . . . Vera, right? Thank you for answering so thoroughly.\u201D</p><p></p><p>A world with few signs of human life.</p><p>The area around Ayaka and Saber, however, was an exception: ten of the police officers whom they had met in the church were surrounding the pair as they walked.</p><p>The officers had informed Ayaka that the world they were in was part of a closed space, and Ayaka had formed a temporary alliance with them to eliminate the source that had created it.</p><p>As far as Ayaka was concerned, it was better than being arrested, and Saber saw no reason to object to the temporary alliance, so they had ended up joining forces without much hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Vera Levitt.</p><p>That was how the leader of the police officers had just introduced herself. Ayaka glanced at her and asked, still warily:</p><p>\u201CAre you, umm . . . a Master in the Grail War?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t tell you the details, but think of me as a member of a faction working for a Master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, the police are in league with the mages who set up this Holy Grail War? But probably not all of you\u2014the ones who questioned me didn\u2019t seem to know anything.\u201D</p><p>Saber plainly stated his conjectures with his usual candor.</p><p>\u201CBut judging by the importance of your battle in front of the hospital, it\u2019s reasonable to suppose that you sent the majority of your forces there. And given that no reinforcements came, I\u2019d guess that a bare minimum stayed to guard the Master you work for and you have around thirty police officers working with you. Am I right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I don\u2019t consider that information necessary for our escape.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re certainly honest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D Vera asked suspiciously but remained expressionless.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s entirely possible that you\u2019d dispatched another hundred officers to other important locations,\u201D Saber explained, \u201Cbut your brief silence and the way your eyes moved made it obvious that I guessed right.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Vera fell silent.</p><p>\u201C. . . Wasn\u2019t it kind of mean of you to go out of your way to point that out?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka sounded disgusted.</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s not like that!\u201D Saber hurriedly countered. \u201CI wasn\u2019t mocking her or showing off! Her reactions to an unexpected conversation were easy to read because she\u2019s fundamentally honest. I meant that it\u2019s a virtue that she can be honest despite being a mage. There was a mage called Saint Germain who hung around me, and I could truly never tell if what he said was true or if he was making it up.\u201D</p><p>At that, other voices chimed in.</p><p>\u201CSaint Germain . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe alchemist?\u201D</p><p>The officers walking nearby muttered to each other.</p><p>\u201COh, I guess he really is famous. He always said he\u2019d dropped in on all kinds of people. . . . I sympathize with the people he bothered. But then, the kind of big names that went down in history probably had no problem accepting his odd ways,\u201D Saber added with a shrug.</p><p>\u201CAre you really a Heroic Spirit?\u201D One of the officers asked. \u201CYou seem awfully relaxed . . .\u201D</p><p>The young officer had been too focused on the battle with Alkeides to see the details of Saber\u2019s duel with the King of Heroes. That was why he found Saber unbelievably carefree compared to the Heroic Spirits he had faced\u2014Assassin, who had attacked the police station, and Alkeides.</p><p>The other officers admonished their young colleague\u2014\u201CHey!\u201D \u201CWhat\u2019ll you do if he takes that as a challenge?!\u201D\u2014but in Saber\u2019s mind, the young officer\u2019s words recalled a certain voice.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re always like that, brother.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou race across the battlefield like a devil, but you completely let you guard down in peacetime!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you even understand what it means to be king, brother?!\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CAnd you are?\u201D Saber asked the young officer, fondly remembering his relative\u2019s exclamations from his lifetime.</p><p>\u201C. . . John Wingard. You can call me John.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>The police officers and Ayaka were startled by Saber\u2019s sudden change in expression, but Saber himself paid them no mind and said, with a look of joy:</p><p>\u201CI see . . . So, your name\u2019s John!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis must be fate. Let\u2019s be friends, John. Think of it as going with my carelessness.\u201D</p><p>Saber walked amiably up to the officer and patted him on the back.</p><p>John, who had no idea what was going on, looked cautious.</p><p>\u201CWhere\u2019d this come from?! What\u2019s my name got to do with anything?!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, well, you see . . .\u201D Saber glanced away, apparently conflicted. \u201CHave you figured out my True Name? Whether I can tell you depends on that. . . . Oh, hang on. That means I just gave away that the name \u2018John\u2019 has something to do with my True Name. All right, wait a moment while I figure out how to gloss that over.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s already hopeless. Just give up,\u201D Ayaka said with a sigh, although she did not appear angry.</p><p>Ayaka understood that True Names were important, but the Heroic Spirit had introduced himself to her despite her protests that she did not want to know, so it was clear to her that the chances of keeping it hidden were slim.</p><p>A proper Master might have ordered him not to reveal any information connected to his True Name even if it cost them a Command Spell. Ayaka, however, did not even think of herself as a Master, and was assuming the position that if Saber were going to give it away on his own, there was nothing she could do about it.</p><p>Ayaka was still exasperated, but Saber ignored her and presented the excuse he had come up with.</p><p>\u201CI know . . . The makers of the wonderful modern music I heard last night . . . Elton, Lennon, Williams, Travolta . . . I just thought that you might have musical talent, seeing as you have the same name as them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut \u2018John\u2019 is Elton John\u2019s last name . . .\u201D One of the officers pointed out. Saber, however, began to hum contemporary music with unnecessary skill in an effort to play it off.</p><p>\u201CThat doesn\u2019t seem like something a Heroic Spirit who\u2019s supposed to hide his True Name would say . . .\u201D Vera, who had been watching, muttered to herself with a rare look of confusion.</p><p>In the fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki, there had been a Heroic Spirit who loudly announced his name to people he was meeting for the first time . . . but Vera had no way of knowing that anecdote. She conjectured that this Saber was either highly unique or a cunning Servant calculatedly playing the clown.</p><p>Given his eccentric behavior, such as declaring that he would pay for the damage to the opera house in front of TV cameras or dematerializing in front of non-mage police officers, she was leaning toward the latter.</p><p>Based on that conjecture, Vera deliberately doled out a small amount of their information.</p><p>\u201C. . . The chief seemed to have an idea of your True Name.\u201D</p><p>Vera shared information with the chief, but that information was not passed on to the other officers.</p><p>The chief had been reasoning analogically based on the information that Saber had \u201Cblond hair streaked with red\u201D and the speech he had given in front of the opera house. Spreading information before they were certain could prove fatal if they turned out to be mistaken.</p><p>As a result, she did not attempt to identify him as the Lionheart and instead attempted to keep him in check by suggesting that they knew his identity.</p><p>John heard his superior and asked Richard again.</p><p>\u201CAll that aside . . . aren\u2019t you still a little carefree for a hero? You didn\u2019t make a fuss about trusting us or showing us your back; what\u2019re you planning to do if we attack your Master here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s an interesting question. . . . What do you think I should do, Ayaka?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re asking me?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re the one whose life would be in danger. I\u2019d like to ask you how to deal with enemies while we have the chance. I wouldn\u2019t want to accidently kill one with a counterattack only to end up making you sad because you didn\u2019t want me to kill anyone.\u201D</p><p>Richard was practically saying that actually dealing with them would be easy. One of the officers, who felt slighted, called with a slightly disgruntled look:</p><p>\u201CYou seem awfully sure of yourself. Are you trying to say you could hold back against us and still not\u2014\u201D</p><p>John stopped him with a hand.</p><p>\u201C. . . What, John?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Haven\u2019t you noticed? We\u2019re being watched.\u201D</p><p>The officer looked at John and was taken aback.</p><p>For the past several seconds, John had been sweeping his gaze over their surroundings with a grim expression and cold sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>Richard, on the other hand, looked at John, impressed.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m surprised\u2014you noticed in an instant. Either way, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be so cowardly as to attack Ayaka from behind . . . but I see you\u2019d make a good knight as well as a good official.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka did not understand what he was talking about, while the police officers turned their attention to their surroundings. Like John, caution and surprise were causing cold sweat to form on their faces.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Only Vera remained cool. She shifted her attention to the pistol holstered at her hip and asked:</p><p>\u201CTwo . . . No, three. Can I consider that to be your forces?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? What?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka looked around again . . . and finally noticed.</p><p>A heavily bandaged man she had seen the other day was standing on top of a building . . . and a lance-wielding man on horseback was peering at them out of an alleyway.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s . . .!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I introduced the archer to you once before, Ayaka. I\u2019m impressed, Vera. I didn\u2019t expect you to sense Lock\u2014Assassin while he\u2019s hidden.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI couldn\u2019t sense him. But I judged that you would need one more to cover all your blind spots and protect Ayaka Sajou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s even more impressive. I see. The people around you must shine brighter in battle with you leading them,\u201D Richard casually remarked. As he did so, the archer and the others vanished like a mist lifting.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D John asked, still tense. \u201CWhat are they?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy comrades. When I\u2019m certain that you won\u2019t target Ayaka, I\u2019ll introduce them to you along with my True Name.\u201D</p><p>\u201CComrades . . . Did you summon them from outside this ward?\u201D</p><p>Richard answered Vera\u2019s doubt with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201CThey\u2019re half fused with my Spirit Origin. They just came with me automatically.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . As a check on us, that was careless. We\u2019re guessing your True Name. Don\u2019t you think that information will bring us a step closer to the heart of the matter?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you concerned for me? . . . I knew that you were more like knights than mages.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Vera remained expressionless but narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201COh, I apologize if I offended you,\u201D Richard answered cheerfully. \u201CThat wasn\u2019t an insult. I value chivalry, but I don\u2019t disdain mages. I\u2019m praising your humanity. You\u2019re cool and collected, but you aren\u2019t callous.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . That doesn\u2019t answer my question. You\u2019ve been letting your guard down with us too much. You\u2019re putting all your effort into protecting Ayaka Sajou . . . but you seem to be lacking any idea of ultimately defeating us once our alliance is over. As someone in this alliance with you, that strikes me as cause for concern.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn other words . . . I seem like I must be plotting something, so you can\u2019t trust me to watch your backs?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? . . . Saber isn\u2019t that kind of . . .\u201D</p><p>Ayaka started to protest, but Saber stopped her.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s fine.</p><p>\u201CThank you, Ayaka. Well, I understand her caution as someone responsible for an organization. But if we want to return to our world safely, it will help to clear up any ill feelings in our alliance.\u201D</p><p>Having said that, Saber came to a halt in the middle of the carless street and addressed the police officers.</p><p>\u201CI suppose you\u2019re right . . . I still haven\u2019t managed to get serious about concealing my True Name . . . No, about this entire Holy Grail War. I was only in earnest about my personal \u2018war\u2019 with that golden Heroic Spirit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou aren\u2019t taking it seriously . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. I\u2019m not going easy out of disdain for you. I\u2019ve already explained this to Ayaka . . . but I simply haven\u2019t found a wish for the Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou . . . don\u2019t have a wish?\u201D</p><p>Vera was doubtful.</p><p>With a few exceptions, the Heroic Spirits summoned by the Holy Grail formed contracts with living mages in order to make use of the Grail\u2019s wish-granting powers.</p><p>If Saber had no wish, then why had he manifested?</p><p>Is it because the Grail is a fake . . .? No, but . . .</p><p>Vera tried to reason it out but determined that she ought to leave anything further to the chief and Caster\u2014Dumas\u2014and continued to listen to Saber\u2019s words in silence.</p><p>\u201CThere were things I prayed to God for when I was alive. It\u2019s not easy to tell whether my prayers were answered . . . but they were things I can\u2019t wish for on the Grail, or rather, there would be no point wishing for them. But since I was summoned here like this, I suppose I must have some wish that even I don\u2019t know about yet.\u201D</p><p>Saber gave a casual shrug and flashed a friendly grin at the police officers.</p><p>\u201CBasically, until I find that wish, I\u2019m not thinking about going out of my way to kill you just to win. My top priority right now is to return Ayaka to her homeland unharmed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy homeland . . .?\u201D</p><p>For some reason, it was Ayaka who asked the question.</p><p>\u201CYou came from Japan, didn\u2019t you? Am I wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo . . . you\u2019re right, but . . . Oh, it\u2019s nothing. Sorry for interrupting. Just keep going,\u201D Ayaka mumbled evasively and became lost in thought.</p><p>Saber was concerned about Ayaka but brought his speech to the police officers to a conclusion.</p><p>\u201CSo, I will keep our alliance as long as you have no intention of harming Ayaka. Yesterday\u2019s enemy becoming today\u2019s ally was an everyday occurrence in my day.\u201D</p><p>Saber grinned as if to ask, \u201CWhat about in your era?\u201D Vera considered briefly, then surveyed her fellow officers and nodded.</p><p>\u201CUnderstood. We won\u2019t accept everything you\u2019ve said on faith, but we will keep our agreement.\u201D</p><p>Once he was sure Vera had finished, John spoke to Ayaka.</p><p>\u201CUmm . . . Sorry about that. It was only to test your partner, but I still talked about stabbing you in the back. That\u2019s not something a cop should be doing. Sorry.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Oh, don\u2019t mention it. . . . Saber started it, anyway,\u201D Ayaka answered bluntly.</p><p>John let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201CThanks. . . . You\u2019re awfully tolerant for a mage.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not a mage.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>John and the other officers looked confused.</p><p>Ayaka, however, seemed unwilling to explain further, because she shrugged and began walking with Saber.</p><p></p><p>Ayaka Sajou.</p><p>Vera did not let it show in her expression, but she was reconsidered Ayaka Sajou.</p><p>Who is she?</p><p>According to the records of her interrogation, she was a tourist visiting the city . . . but further investigation had revealed that the records of her entry into the United States had been falsified.</p><p>She must have entered the country illegally through some kind of string-pulling, but Ayaka herself seemed strangely unaware of the fact.</p><p>There was also information that the chief had shared with Vera but had kept from the other members of Clan Calatin because it might cause confusion.</p><p>There is a mage by the same name . . . but she\u2014Saj\u014D Ayaka\u2014is confirmed to be active in Romania.</p><p>I saw a photo of her face, and she does look almost identical apart from her hair and eye color.</p><p>If she\u2019s a fake, then for what purpose? If she planned to take Saj\u014D Ayaka\u2019s place, why did she change her hair color?</p><p>Saj\u014D Ayaka is supposed to have an older sister, but there\u2019s no record of her having a twin.</p><p>In any case . . . I\u2019ll have to keep my guard up.</p><p>Now that they were unable to contact the chief, Vera was for all intents and purposes the leader of Clan Calatin. She decided to work with Saber and Ayaka while maintaining the bare minimum of caution.</p><p>They possessed numerous \u201CNoble Phantasms\u201D of their own, but considering their individual combat ability, she determined that antagonizing Saber would be inadvisable.</p><p>At that point . . . Saber voiced a question as he walked.</p><p>\u201CHey.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou said you\u2019re going to eliminate the mage or Servant behind this, didn\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Yes. We theorize that that is the most reliable method of destroying this ward-world.\u201D</p><p>Saber thought for a moment, moved his mouth slightly as if talking to himself, and then:</p><p>\u201C. . . Yes. I suppose so. My comrade \u2018Caster\u2019 agrees that that would be the simplest way.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour \u2018comrade\u2019 . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CThink of them as something like that bandaged archer and the others.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>He even has one that acts as a mage? Vera recalled the mysterious entities\u2014entities that were probably part of the Spirit Origin that was Saber\u2014whose Spirit Origins seemed weaker than proper Servants but still far stronger than ordinary mages grew even more wary than before.</p><p>Saber\u2019s words, however, threw cold water on both Vera\u2019s caution and the other officers\u2019 determination to give their all to escape.</p><p>\u201CStill, most of my \u2018comrades\u2019 aren\u2019t too enthusiastic about it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy not?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy not? You\u2019re asking why not? . . . Are you sure you\u2019re not overlooking an important possibility?\u201D Saber stopped again and said, giving them a glimpse of his serious face as a Heroic Spirit, not the carefree attitude he had shown them so far.</p><p>\u201CThe girl you were trying to protect . . . little Tsubaki, wasn\u2019t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI heard about her from a mercenary I met yesterday. I heard about her . . . but have you considered that the one who shut us up in this world . . . could be Tsubaki\u2019s Servant?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Vera and a few other officers who had been prepared for that possibility lowered their gazes slightly, while John and several others who had just realized were momentarily taken aback and then began to make a variety of expressions.</p><p>\u201COf course, it could be that crazy thing that fought the golden Archer at the end, or some other Servant I haven\u2019t even seen . . .\u201D</p><p>Saber paused, then asked the cruel question in a matter-of-fact tone.</p><p></p><p>\u201CBut if that little girl is the cause, will you be able to kill her?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>At the Same Time, A Closed-off Town, Inside Crystal Hill Casino</p><p></p><p>While Saber and the police officers were walking along Main Street . . . a different group was moving quite nearby.</p><p>It was not the second group of police officers, who had split their forces.</p><p>They had never joined up with Saber and the police officers in the first place.</p><p></p><p>One of them, his eyes shining as he spun a roulette wheel by hand, exclaimed:</p><p>\u201COh, wow! I only watched at Mr. Fem\u2019s casino, so I couldn\u2019t tell, but now that I get to spin a roulette wheel myself, it\u2019s lighter than I thought!\u201D</p><p>The young man\u2014Flat Escardos\u2014shouted like a child. An answering voice came from the watch wrapped around his wrist.</p><p>\u201CI doubt anyone but you would think of that in our situation.\u201D</p><p>Then, the Heroic-Spirit-turned-wristwatch\u2014Berserker, a.k.a. Jack the Ripper\u2014stated his impressions as he surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>\u201CHmm . . . A totally silent casino with no hustle and bustle is a little eerie.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? You know casinos, Jack?\u201D</p><p>\u201COnly as information. It was either given to me by the Grail, or perhaps due to a theory that my true identity was an immortal gambler. In any case, I can guess how much noise this place is ordinarily filled with from its gawdy d\xE9cor.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, it certainly makes you uneasy,\u201D the pair\u2019s \u201Ccompanion,\u201D who had been watching the exchange, added with a shrug. \u201CIt looks like there\u2019s power, but I\u2019m surprised how much quieter it is with no one working the slots.\u201D</p><p>The man looked to be in his mid-thirties and was distinctively dressed in a priest\u2019s cassock and an eyepatch.</p><p>Four peculiarly dressed young women followed behind him, each surveying their surroundings with serious expressions.</p><p>The priest\u2019s name was Hansa Cervantes.</p><p>He was an overseer dispatched by the Holy Church, but he and his nun subordinates had been enveloped by the \u201Cblack mist\u201D and trapped in that world.</p><p>\u201CI think the police are here too. Shouldn\u2019t we meet up with them?\u201D Flat casually asked the overseer.</p><p>\u201CI provided the church, but if this is part of the Holy Grail War caused by a Servant, then helping them to escape would be unwarranted favoritism. That goes for you too, of course. I\u2019ll share information, but I don\u2019t plan on helping you destroy this ward-world.\u201D</p><p>Once Hansa had realized that he had been pulled into a ward modeled on the city, he had set out to investigate alone. In the process he had encountered Flat and they were now joining forces to survey the city.</p><p>\u201COh, really? . . . Well, I guess I can\u2019t complain. I wouldn\u2019t enjoy winning a game where the judge was taking my side, anyway. Plus, if you did that, I\u2019ve got a feeling the Holy Church would end up taking the Grail.\u201D</p><p>Flat regretfully related his negative impression of the Holy Church, but Hansa nodded with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201CYeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019d probably do that if I got orders from higher up. It\u2019s always been obvious that nothing good would come of letting mages get their hands on something that grants wishes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd the Holy Grail War having an overseer originally only applied to a Japanese city called Fuyuki, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut it\u2019s a fact that we\u2019re using that as our excuse to intervene. My bosses might change their policy if they ever realize just how different this Grail War is from the one in Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p>Hansa deliberately refrained from saying whether that change would be for the better or the worse and shifted his gaze to the nuns.</p><p>\u201C. . . Well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s no use,\u201D one of the nuns answered politely with a shake of her head. \u201CWe were unable to detect the presence of a mystical core forming the ward in this area. It may be skillfully concealed, but in that case, it may prove difficult to locate with our equipment.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . I thought they might be drawing on the Grail\u2019s power directly, considering they\u2019re recreating the whole city . . . but that doesn\u2019t matter if we can\u2019t locate the core.\u201D</p><p>Whether they were looking for the Grail or the core of the ward-world, they had guessed that there would be something suspicious about the tallest building in the city center, but it appeared they had guessed wrong.</p><p>\u201CThe power is on, right?\u201D Flat asked.</p><p>\u201CYeah,\u201D Hansa answered, looking up at the chandeliers on the ceiling. \u201CBut who knows where it\u2019s coming from, so who knows when it will stop?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019d . . . like to try going up to the top floor while the elevators are still working.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? You think the \u2018core\u2019 might be there? It\u2019s true that the area extends above and below the building. It might be worth checking . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, no,\u201D Flat stopped him with a wave of his hand. \u201CI didn\u2019t mean that. It would be a lucky break for us if it were up there, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s because from up there . . . I can see over the whole city.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Do you have a plan?\u201D</p><p>Flat answered Jack with a slight nod, slapped his own cheeks to psyche himself up, and said:</p><p>\u201CIf I take a look at it . . . I might be able to figure something out . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201CIf I can find a place where the guard is thin, I might be able to get in touch with the \u2018outside\u2019!\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>At the Same Time, Los Angeles, U.S.A.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .

A scattering of fallen billboards and broken trees was visible nearby, but there was not a human to be seen.</p><p>The record-breaking hurricane had formed suddenly and without warning.</p><p>Central Los Angeles would escape with only a few more damaged cars and buildings . . . but those who endured the raindrops pelting their faces to look up at the sky in the midst of the storm would later say:</p><p></p><p>Four huge tornadoes came down out of the sky.</p><p>They strode across the land, shrouded in flashes of lightning . . .</p><p></p><p>Almost like the feet of a gargantuan beast braving the skies and threatening to trample the very world to pieces.</p><h2 id="interlude-mercenary-assassin-pale-rider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-mercenary-assassin-pale-rider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: Mercenary, Assassin, Pale Rider</h2><hr><p>\u201CI\u2019m glad you\u2019re both better now!\u201D</p><p></p><p>An innocent girl\u2019s voice rang out in the garden showered in warm sunshine.</p><p>Squirrels, kittens, and other small animals scampered over the neatly trimmed lawn, and the countless little birds perched on the branches of a tree that grew in the garden were giving a modest singing recital.</p><p>If the word \u201Cheartwarming\u201D took a physical form, it would probably be a scene like this.</p><p>There, the kind of vista seen only in picture books spread out in reality.</p><p>The two people the girl had spoken to, however, were totally divorced from that atmosphere.</p><p>One was a young man in black.</p><p>There were still traces of childhood in his appearance, and he could just as easily be called a boy. But in contrast to his looks, he wore an unsettling assortment of holstered guns, knives, and other weapons.</p><p>The other was a girl, her whole figure likewise in black.</p><p>Beneath her black cloak, which concealed as much of her face and skin as humanly possible, she was looking around her with a hint of confusion. If that were all, she would look like an ordinary woman in a niqab, but the black folds of her garment hid countless weapons, and something about her, unrelated to her dress, gave a general impression of danger.</p><p>The young man\u2019s name was Sigma.</p><p>The girl was a Servant who had been summoned as Assassin in the \u201CFake Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>A variety of circumstances had led the two of them to act together, but they were currently trapped together in the strange space.</p><p>\u201CYeah, thanks.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . You have my gratitude.\u201D</p><p>Sigma and the girl Assassin each expressed their thanks.</p><p>The young girl\u2014Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2014responded by looking bashful and dashing awkwardly into the house.</p><p>\u201C. . . That was Kuruoka Tsubaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, that\u2019s the girl who commanded a Heroic Spirit while unconscious.\u201D</p><p>Both of them had already realized.</p><p>The girl\u2019s parents, who lived in the same house with her, were clearly under the mental control of something . . . but only the girl was different.</p><p>She was subject to no mental restraint\u2014truly free.</p><p>\u201CMeaning that that black figure . . . was her Servant.\u201D</p><p>The large figure that Kuruoka Tsubaki had introduced as \u201CMr. Black.\u201D</p><p>Pale glows floated here and there inside the mass of shadows, roughly as tall as the tree in the garden and so dark that it seemed to suck in nearby light.</p><p>It had withdrawn into the house for the moment, but it had not appeared to have substance, so it would not be surprising if it sprang out of the ground without warning.</p><p>The thought prompted Sigma to increased vigilance and the girl Assassin to thought.</p><p>\u201CWas it . . . really a Heroic Spirit?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt could also be a monster or wraith . . .\u201D Sigma muttered, but the girl Assassin shook her head.</p><p>\u201CNo . . . I don\u2019t think so. I did not sense any tremors of malice or hatred from that being. . . . No, I sensed no fluctuations of magical energy at all . . .\u201D</p><p>The magecraft-user and Servant remembered how they had both been surprised by that \u201Cshadow\u201D when they had woken up in the garden.</p><p>If it were hostile, it would already have dispatched them. . . . Considering that they had not been attacked in their sleep, they thought that it might not even recognize them as enemies.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t sense anything like consciousness from it, but it does seem to obey that child.\u201D</p><p>Assassin\u2019s words prompted Sigma to broaden his speculation.</p><p>\u201CMaybe her Servant is something else and that \u2018shadow\u2019 is a familiar . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s possible . . . but we lack sufficient information. That fiend\u2014the hematophage\u2014must know something . . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin gritted her teeth beneath her veil.</p><p>But she could not sense the hematophage either.</p><p>He was certainly plotting something, but it would be difficult to locate him unless he made contact.</p><p>The two of them had just surveyed the area under the pretense of going for a walk, but they had found few signs of human life.</p><p>They had spotted the occasional human figure, but like Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s parents, they had seemed to be under some form of mental control.</p><p>They could make conversation, but that was all.</p><p>They did not seem particularly alarmed by Sigma\u2019s armaments, nor did they seem to know anything about that world.</p><p>They had made numerous inquiries, but the people were ordinary civilians and unresponsive, and they had not been able to obtain any more information.</p><p>There was only one commonality\u2014most of the people out walking claimed to have lived in the factory district but fled from a fire or some other disaster.</p><p>\u201CThe factory fire . . . I heard about it yesterday. A battle between Heroic Spirits.\u201D</p><p>According to what he had heard from Watcher before he had lost contact, a Heroic Spirit who had not been involved in the battle had concealed the damage to the destroyed factory district, but it seemed that they had not been able to erase the fact that a fire had occurred.</p><p>The residents, however, had apparently displayed strange behavior and seemed, like Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s parents, to be under some kind of mind control.</p><p>They could have carried their investigations further by taking destructive actions against those \u201Cpeople\u201D and that \u201Ccity.\u201D But given that they did not understand the structure of that world or their enemy\u2019s capabilities, that would be suicidal.</p><p>Sigma considered calmly and decided to investigate based on the fact that telepathy was usable.</p><p>\u201COrdinary civilians won\u2019t understand the situation whether they\u2019re under mind control or not.</p><p></p><p>\u201CBut . . . what about a mage who knows the hidden side of the Holy Grail War?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou want to ask me something?\u201D Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s father said with somewhat vacant eyes.</p><p>\u201C. . . Yes, somewhere away from your daughter, if possible.\u201D</p><p>The mage, who had come as far as the front door at Sigma\u2019s suggestion, glanced into the house and said:</p><p>\u201CThat could be tricky. I promised my daughter I\u2019d read a book to her, so I can\u2019t go far.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, just down the street would be fine.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. In that case . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki\u2019s father left his family\u2019s property with no real resistance and followed Sigma to a little park nestled in the residential district.</p><p></p><p>\u201CIt really was coincidence that we ended up at your house, but I recognize you, Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh . . . Have we met somewhere before?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy employer\u2019s name is Francesca. I have a deal with a man called Faldeus.\u201D</p><p>At that, Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku\u2019s face took on a gloomy look.</p><p>\u201CI guessed you were a magecraft-user when I saw your equipment. I see I was right. . . . But as I told Faldeus, the Grail War is the farthest thing from my mind right now. I can\u2019t give you any . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019m not asking you to cooperate with us,\u201D Sigma cut in dispassionately. \u201CCould you please tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201D</p><p>His tone was polite, but there was no emotion in it.</p><p>Sigma showed the face of a magecraft-using mercenary faced with a mage and tensed himself for a sudden attack.</p><p>Assassin was hiding in a corner of the park, keeping a watch on the area.</p><p>Given that conversation was possible, they planned to gauge the intentions of the person exerting the mental control by the information they were able to get from Kuruoka\u2014or conversely, by the information he was unable to tell them\u2014in his mind-controlled state.</p><p>However . . .</p><p>\u201CYes, I can do that. As far as I can see, the Servant protecting my dear little Tsubaki intentionally created this world. It\u2019s outside my area of expertise, but I think it may be a type of Reality Marble.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTsubaki\u2019s Servant is probably the embodiment of a concept. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the concept of death, nothingness, or disease intentionally given a personality. In Japan, my home country, a y\u014Dkai called a \u2018yanari\u2019 was created to explain houses creaking. That was a type of folk magecraft, deciding that it was a conscious being, giving it form, and taking mental measures against it. . . . Considering that Servant\u2019s power, however, I believe it must be an entity recognized on a global scale. I think I could analyze it more accurately if I examined it carefully, but since I dropped out of the Grail War to live quietly with my daughter, I don\u2019t have time for that.\u201D</p><p>Calmly, casually . . . as if it were of no importance, Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku began to give his opinion as a mage.</p><p>But despite that, his way of speaking made it clear that he was still subject to mental control.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t been prevented from talking about magecraft . . . not even from speculating about the Servant\u2019s identity?</p><p>Or is he being controlled to feed us false information?</p><p>But if that were the case, wouldn\u2019t they make the extent of their control more ambiguous?</p><p>Sigma was confident that he could see through an ordinary person\u2019s lies using his experience and technique as a magecraft-user.</p><p>But discovering the lies of a mage\u2014especially one who had used autosuggestion to convince themselves they were telling the truth\u2014would require more experience, talent, and specialized magecraft.</p><p>If I were connected to Watcher, I could compare it to information from the shadows to reach a conclusion . . .</p><p>Sigma\u2019s Servant, Watcher, which was supposed to be gathering all visual and auditory information from across the city, but he was currently unable to contact it.</p><p>That was why he needed information that would help him get outside at any cost, but he would need more for that.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t you want to leave this ward?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat for? Our daughter Tsubaki is so healthy here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t it possible that the Servant is controlling your mind to make you think that way?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh yes, it probably is . . . but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201D</p><p>When he heard that, Sigma realized what the goal of the mental control was.</p><p>If Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s Servant was causing the situation, then in all probability that Heroic Spirit was not acting to win the Holy Grail War.</p><p>Its behavior was genuinely centered on Tsubaki.</p><p>But he is technically a mage participating in the Grail War. He must have taken at least some precautions against mental control . . . Sigma thought, but he also knew that those precautions were not perfect.</p><p>There was a case in which skilled mages assembled for an auction of historical artifacts with mystical value had been betrayed and manipulated by one of their allies.</p><p>The mages in question had apparently been rescued by a Lord of the Clock Tower and, ashamed of their own blunder, had enrolled trustworthy members of their family in the Lord\u2019s classes.</p><p>Sigma remembered the story because the Lord in question\u2019s rise in power due to the connections he had formed with powerful mages in the process had been a hot topic among magecraft-using mercenaries at one time . . . but he dismissed the details as currently irrelevant.</p><p>The important point was that, given the right opportunity, precautions against mental control could be easily broken.</p><p>Encouraging him to escape or freeing him from the mental control . . . seems unfeasible.</p><p>I should ask Assassin later if she has a Noble Phantasm that can undo brainwashing . . . but from what I\u2019ve seen, her Noble Phantasms seemed specialized to kill her enemies. I shouldn\u2019t get my hopes up.</p><p>Sigma decided to try a different approach.</p><p>\u201C. . . Umm, are you aware that your daughter is being targeted outside the ward?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh . . . Is she? That\u2019s unfortunate.\u201D</p><p>Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku started to leave the park, heading for home. He did not seem especially anxious, but his expression did at least darken with concern.</p><p>\u201CThank you for letting me know. Still, Tsubaki\u2019s Servant seems to be in the process of becoming practically unassailable, so I\u2019m sure it will see her through this safely.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s . . . becoming unassailable?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, just a bit before you woke up, it sent us a wonderful guard dog.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D Sigma asked just as Assassin approached them.</p><p>Sigma tried to stop Y\u016Bkaku, who was ignoring him and making his way home, but he saw that Assassin had a grim look in her eyes, decided that something must have happened, and decided to stop to hear what she had to say.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . It appears that your conversation was . . . overheard.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen you said, \u2018Tsubaki is being targeted,\u2019 it began to move.\u201D</p><p>She turned her gaze toward Tsubaki\u2019s house as she spoke.</p><p>When Sigma followed her gaze . . . time froze for him.</p><p>His brain was unable to grasp the situation. For fractions of a second, his mind went blank.</p><p>The thing that did that to a magecraft-user like Sigma, with his long experience as a mercenary . . . was a single large dog.</p><p>Although opinions might be divided as to whether it counted as a \u201Csingle\u201D dog.</p><p></p><p>Sigma had seen the thing that stood in the place Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku was casually walking to once before.</p><p>It took him a moment, however, to realize that it was the same thing.</p><p>He was sure that \u201Cit\u201D had been killed on Main Street and also that \u201Cit\u201D had been at most the size of an adult elephant.</p><p>The thing that Sigma and Assassin stared up at with the beginnings of a cold sweat . . .</p><p></p><p>Was Kerberos, the three-headed guard dog of Hades, grown larger than a house.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nMSaAuX.png" alt=""></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Snowfield, Factory District</p><p></p><p>\u201CAbout your Noble Phantasm . . . Can you still use the birds and the dog?\u201D Bazdilot Cordelion asked, servicing a pistol-shaped Mystic Code while members of the Scladio Family were busy repairing his workshop.</p><p>Alkeides lifted his dematerialization and stared at his own hands as he answered.</p><p>\u201C. . . The birds won\u2019t be an issue but activating Kerberos will prove difficult.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre there limitations on the regeneration of the individual beasts?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. Ordinarily, with your magical energy I should be able to reactivate them after a day. . . . But I can\u2019t do it now. It seems its actual Spirit Origin was scraped away by that \u2018black mist,\u2019 along with three of the horses.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou have a Noble Phantasm that steals Noble Phantasms, but I never expected one of yours to be stolen. Still, the dog or horses falling into enemy hands shouldn\u2019t pose a problem,\u201D Bazdilot said dispassionately.</p><p>Alkeides, however, silently shook his head.</p><p>\u201CNot necessarily.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Does something worry you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey may have been stolen, but the ends of the royal orders I was tasked with are the foundation of my Spirit Origin. Even if they are no longer mine, I know when they undergo a change.\u201D</p><p>The vengeful bowman frowned beneath his cloth as he carefully probed the alterations in the \u201Clinks\u201D of his Spirit Origin.</p><p>\u201CBut . . . this is . . .\u201D</p><p>After a short pause for thought, Alkeides clenched his fists.</p><p>Then, as magical energy mixed with mud and blood trickled from between his fingers, he whispered with quiet rage.</p><p>All the while recalling the familiar darkness of the other side that edged toward him through the faint link of magical energy.</p><p>\u201CCould the one who controls that black mist . . . possibly be a relative of Hades?\u201D</p><p>When he finally relaxed his fists, he murmured with the faintest hint of pity in a voice that not even Bazdilot could hear.</p><p>\u201CIn that case . . . even if I do not harm her . . . its Master is fated to be hunted eventually.</p><p></p><p>\u201CHunted by the true heroes . . . who safeguard the people.\u201D</p><h2 id="chapter-18-as-dream-and-reality-are-both-illusion-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-18-as-dream-and-reality-are-both-illusion-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 18: As Dream and Reality are Both Illusion I</h2><hr><p>A Closed-off Town, Main Street</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>The first person to react to Saber\u2019s question was not one of the police officers; it was Ayaka, who had been listening half-disinterestedly.</p><p></p><p>\u201CBut if that little girl is the cause, will you be able to kill her?\u201D</p><p></p><p>She understood what Saber meant.</p><p>If the girl turned out to be the reason they had been pulled into this deserted world, there was a good chance that \u201Cdealing with\u201D her would enable them to return to their original world.</p><p>The instant that thought took shape in her head . . . something pulsed.</p><p></p><p>Ayaka blinked slowly, steadying her breathing.</p><p>When she quietly opened her heavy eyelids . . . she was there.</p><p>Far across Main Street, visible through a gap in the officers.</p><p>She was too far away to make out her face, but Ayaka recognized her instantly.</p><p>A little girl with her face covered by something like a red, red\u2014simply red\u2014hood.</p><p>She looked like she might be three years old and seemed liked she might be about six, and Ayaka had a feeling that she was much older.</p><p>Ayaka could not be sure of her height or age.</p><p>Only the perception of the color red passed through Ayaka\u2019s eyes and rampaged through her brain.</p><p>How could . . .?</p><p>An instant later . . . Red Riding Hood had drawn nearer.</p><p>She had not run over\u2014before Ayaka knew what was happening, she was right behind the group of officers.</p><p>She had only been distantly visible before, but now Ayaka could see her clearly.</p><p>\u201CRed Riding Hood\u201D\u2014the object of Ayaka\u2019s ongoing terror and one of the reasons she had come to the United States.</p><p>There\u2019s no elevator, so why . . .?</p><p>Red Riding Hood was only supposed to appear inside elevators. Ayaka was not even sure if she was real or a hallucination.</p><p>Since her arrival in Snowfield, however, the rules had begun to shift.</p><p>It seemed to Ayaka that she could feel Red Riding Hood\u2019s presence closer to her every time she was on the verge of remembering something in this city.</p><p>Her whole body broke out in a cold sweat, but she could not look away.</p><p>She could see Red Riding Hood\u2019s hood move as she slowly turned her head to face her.</p><p>Oh no. No.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019ll end. If I see the face under that hood, I\u2019ll be finished.</p><p>Even if she wanted to scream, her lungs were taut, and she could hardly breathe.</p><p>She was so paralyzed by fear that she could not even shut her eyes, let alone look away. Red Riding Hood lifted her hood even more. When it reached the point that Ayaka could see her sneering lips, Red Riding Hood vanished from her sight.</p><p>Blotted out by Saber, who had leaned over to look at her face.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Ayaka? You\u2019re pale as a ghost.\u201D</p><p>At the same time, Ayaka\u2019s body was freed from its paralysis.</p><p>She hurriedly moved to look behind Saber, but there was no longer anything there.</p><p>\u201C. . . Oh, nothing. Just a bad daydream.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou do get like that sometimes. Are you under a curse? I might be able to dispel it if you are.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Thanks, but it\u2019s nothing like that . . . I think.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka declined Saber\u2019s offer and then took another look at his face . . . and decided to pursue the discomfort that had probably caused her to see \u201CRed Riding Hood.\u201D</p><p>The discomfort and unease that had suddenly grown within her reflexively made her vocal cords squirm.</p><p>\u201C. . . More importantly, Saber, the, umm . . . girl you were just talking about is the one in the coma, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but it\u2019s apparently confirmed that she somehow became a Master, so . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. . . . That\u2019s not what I mean. . . .\u201D Ayaka asked somewhat uneasily, reeling in the source of the discomfort that had sprouted within her.</p><p>\u201CWhy did you ask, \u2018will you be able to\u2019 . . . and not \u2018will you\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell . . . I don\u2019t know how to put it, but . . . it sounded like you weren\u2019t asking whether they\u2019d kill her or not. . . . Sorry if I\u2019m wrong . . . but it sounded more like you were saying, \u2018If you can\u2019t kill her, I will.\u2019 . . .\u201D Ayaka asked, choosing her words carefully.</p><p>Saber fell silent for a moment . . . then answered with a troubled smile.</p><p>\u201CHonestly, Ayaka, you can be quite perceptive sometimes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, hang on. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not trying to say that killing the girl is the right choice, and I don\u2019t want to kill her if I can avoid it. I want to save her as much as you do.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-I see . . .\u201D</p><p>Ayaka was somehow relieved, but as she steadily calmed herself, she asked:</p><p>\u201CThen why did you ask . . .\u201D</p><p>Ayaka had difficulty framing her question, but Saber intuited her intent and answered, choosing his words carefully.</p><p>\u201COf course I want to save the girl, and I have no intention of giving up. But if they try to kill her to save someone else, even if I try to stop them . . . in the end, I won\u2019t be able to hold them back. Not unless I overcome them by force.\u201D</p><p>He looked like a different person than the Saber who had spoken light-heartedly even about matters of his own life and death.</p><p>Saber continued to speak not as a knight nor as a Saber, but as the embodiment of something else that Ayaka did not recognize.</p><p>\u201CSo . . . if by some twist of fate, we\u2019re put in a position where someone has to kill her . . . when the time comes, I\u2019ll do it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy?!\u201D Ayaka shouted in spite of herself.</p><p>She understood his reasoning.</p><p>If a \u201Csacrifice\u201D became absolutely necessary, someone would have to do it.</p><p>Even when it came to herself, she was not sure what she would do if she were told that she could save the girl but would be left behind in this deserted city as a result.</p><p>No, I . . . I\u2019d probably . . . sacrifice that little girl . . . who I\u2019ve never even met.</p><p></p><p>No, I\u2019m sure I would.</p><p>Stained red.</p><p>After all . . .</p><p>Stained red.</p><p>I even let . . .</p><p>Stained red.</p><p>. . . a girl I knew die.</p><p>Stained bright, crimson red.</p><p></p><p>The color of \u201CRed Riding Hood\u2019s\u201D hood was indelibly seared into the insides of her eyelids.</p><p>She wanted to scream but was unable to.</p><p>If she collapsed here, she would no longer be able to talk with Saber.</p><p>She would no longer be able to stop him.</p><p>At that thought, she wrung words from deep in her throat even as the world seemed to spin around her.</p><p>\u201CWhy . . .? You don\u2019t have to do that. . . . You don\u2019t . . . so why would you?\u201D</p><p>Her words came out brokenly, barely forming her question.</p><p>\u201CYes. . . .\u201D</p><p>Saber, however, did his best to grasp Ayaka\u2019s intent and answer.</p><p>\u201CI suppose it means that, in the end, I wasn\u2019t able to become like the knights I admired.\u201D</p><p>Saber then turned back to face the police officers, who were more than a little confused, although not as confused as Ayaka, and proudly declared:</p><p>\u201CBut you are different. You are splendid knights.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you . . .?\u201D</p><p>Cutting Vera short, Saber, who had been a king in life, praised the officers as if extolling the virtues of his own followers.</p><p>\u201CYou fought honorably against that fearful bowman and survived! All to save a girl who is no relation of yours and who you have never even seen! Thus, you should continue to be defenders of the innocent! No, you must! You should never harm them, even to shield the rest of the people or society itself.\u201D</p><p>Saber lowered his eyes and after a momentary silence, as if he were looking at somewhere else, continued.</p><p>\u201COnce you\u2019ve done that once, you lose control. . . . I should be the one to bear that responsibility.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber!\u201D Ayaka shouted again. \u201CNo! That\u2019s not right! You\u2019re not like that. . . . You always smile, and you never abandon anyone!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka could not understand why she was shouting so emotionally.</p><p>But it was not rational.</p><p>She had a feeling that if she did not shout now, Saber\u2014the Heroic Spirit who had been able to laugh with her until a moment before\u2014would vanish before her eyes.</p><p>She did not know the first thing about the Holy Grail War, and she thought that what she had to say was probably just the whining of a sheltered na\xEFf . . . but she still forced out the words that welled up from deep in her chest.</p><p>\u201C. . . You think too highly of me, Ayaka. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m your substitute Master. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d save even a passing kid on the street. I can at least tell that much! You\u2019re not like me! You\u2019re not! I won\u2019t tell you to never kill anyone\u2014it\u2019d be selfish, and I don\u2019t have the right\u2014but . . .\u201D</p><p>At that point, Ayaka was briefly lost for words but gritted her teeth and spit out her shout, her raw emotion, along with the reservations that had lodged themselves in the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter if you get your hands dirty in the end. It won\u2019t erase the fact that you saved me! But . . . at least don\u2019t talk like you should be the bad guy . . .\u201D</p><p>Finally, she concluded her display of passion with a declaration that crossed a line.</p><p>\u201CSo . . . if someone has to be the bad guy . . . I\u2019ll do it.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Saber listened to Ayaka, who sounded as if she were condemning herself and not him, and looked at her sorrowful face . . . and found himself seeing his subordinates from when he was alive in her.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhy, Your Majesty?! Richard?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou didn\u2019t need to bear those sins! Why didn\u2019t you leave it to us?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou should have become a hero! Why didn\u2019t you have us do it and pretend not to know?!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, oh, Your Majesty . . . your lion\u2019s heart has grown to great. You are too fearless!\u201D</p><p></p><p>The words of the man who had followed him as his court mage came back to him, interrupting his reflections.</p><p></p><p>\u201CGood grief. I knew it would come to this, of course.</p><p>\u201CStill, I did try to stop you. And this is the result.</p><p>\u201CThen again, if it hadn\u2019t turned out this way, it\u2019d probably be a case for pruning.</p><p>\u201CThat said, even I, Saint Germain, am a bit appalled. Even the mahatma is shocked.</p><p>\u201CYes, that\u2019s right! Exactly! You are wonderfully daring! Lion-hearted!</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s precisely why you had no fear! No fear of anything at all!</p><p>\u201CNot ten thousand foes, not generals who outrank you, not mystical retaliation, not superhuman fiends . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201CNot even staining your own hands . . . with the blood of countless innocents.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Finally . . . like a curse cast out of the distant past, he recalled the words of his younger brother by blood.</p><p></p><p>\u201COh, what are you worried about, brother?</p><p>\u201CNo matter how much blood you have on your hands, the people of this land are in your thrall.</p><p>\u201CFor some reason, it seems as though it\u2019s my job to take on your disgrace and have stones thrown at me.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you think? Aren\u2019t I quite the clown? Go ahead and laugh, brother!</p><p>\u201C. . . Laugh. You\u2019re lucky. You\u2019re a national hero, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re a hero . . . then laugh.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CI see. . . .\u201D</p><p>Saber lowered his eyes and fell silent for a moment.</p><p>When he opened them again, the resignation-tinged gleam, like dim fire, had left them, and they were his usual eyes again.</p><p>\u201CYou notice the smallest things, as usual, Ayaka . . . or so I\u2019d like to say, but that\u2019s not quite right, is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not. Meeting you isn\u2019t small to me anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . All right, I\u2019ll withdraw this time. But be warned\u2014I won\u2019t lose next time.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?! . . . Was this a competition?\u201D</p><p>Saber affectedly ignored the confused and wide-eyed Ayaka and announced with his usual manner:</p><p>\u201CI can hardly force Ayaka to do the dirty work, and she won\u2019t allow me to do it . . . so I\u2019ll just have to save the girl, even if it costs me my life! Then, we\u2019ll all leave this place safely!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber . . .?\u201D</p><p>Saber beamed at Ayaka, who was confused by his sudden return to his usual attitude.</p><p>\u201CIt won\u2019t be a problem. The church was our starting point in this ward-world. What do you say we shelter the girl who\u2019s dropped out instead of the priest and steal the overseer\u2019s thunder?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Good idea. I\u2019ll help.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka flashed a relieved grin . . . when a sudden vague apprehension brought a look of confusion to her face.</p><p>\u201C. . . Church . . . Shelter . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D Vera, who had kept silent up to that point, asked the troubled Ayaka, realizing that the pair\u2019s conversation had finished for the moment.</p><p>\u201CI think,\u201D Ayaka said haltingly, deep in thought, \u201CI\u2019ve met that guy in the gold armor . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut . . . where . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>Ayaka was trying to remember something.</p><p>She could not help feeling that she recognized that golden Heroic Spirit who had tried to kill Richard from his vantage point on the roof of the church.</p><p>And the keywords \u201Cchurch\u201D and \u201Csheltering a child\u201D began to violently shake her brain, which had been locked with a timeworn key.</p><p>But at each jolt she could vividly sense \u201CLittle Red Riding Hood\u2019s\u201D presence, and the fear that she \u201Cmust not remember any more\u201D kept the doors of her memory shut.</p><p>I know I have to remember . . .</p><p>So, why . . .?</p><p>Ayaka struggled desperately to reach her own memories.</p><p>She had a feeling that \u201CLittle Red Riding Hood\u201D was right behind her.</p><p>She had a feeling that she was trying to tell her something.</p><p>She had a feeling that she could hear Red Riding Hood\u2019s voice.</p><p>Ayaka tried to endure the terror and still keep thinking . . . until she saw Saber and the police officers being looking around and realized that her brain was not the only thing shaking.</p><p>\u201C? . . . What?\u201D She muttered suspiciously just as the soles of her feet began to clearly feel the earth pulse.</p><p>\u201CA-An earthquake?!\u201D</p><p>No, not an earthquake.</p><p>Something\u2019s coming toward us . . .</p><p></p><p>Then . . . as the vibrations grew steadily stronger, \u201Cit\u201D emerged from behind a building.</p><p></p><p>An enormous, pitch-black dog, easily over fifteen meters tall.</p><p>Its entire body gave off a miasma-like smoke, and black flames, the same color as its coat, perpetually dripped from its jaws\u2014the jaws of the three-headed monster blessed by Hades.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Several Years Earlier, Somewhere in Europe</p><p></p><p>\u201CSo, you\u2019ll accept the offer? I plan to refrain, myself.\u201D</p><p>The mage, whose way of speaking gave an impression of cunning, had the outward appearance of a young girl.</p><p>While the elegant clothes she wore suggested a sheltered young lady from a good family, the crow perched on her shoulder seemed strangely at home, giving rise to a sense that she was something out of the ordinary.</p><p>She was a mage who, despite belonging to the Clock Tower, kept her distance from it out of dislike for its power struggles.</p><p>Her somewhat elderly way of speaking in contrast to her sweet voice was said to be because she was actually over eighty years old, or a result of inheriting her Magic Circuits complete with the knowledge of their previous owners, but the truth was kept a mystery.</p><p>That mage with an air of experience was speaking to a girl magecraft-user whose youthful air matched her appearance.</p><p>\u201C. . . Is that because you want to protect mage society?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHa ha! If a single ritual was enough to destroy our society, it would be long gone by now. . . . Or so I\u2019d like to say . . . but lately rumor has it that a ritual in the far east stepped into fairly dangerous territory. I thought it was odd that this \u2018Holy Grail War\u2019 didn\u2019t attract much attention despite a Lord dying in one ten years ago, but it looks like someone\u2019s been finessing the flow of information.\u201D</p><p>The Holy Grail War.</p><p>It had been known as a minor ritual in the far east, but it had not attracted serious notice until a few months previously, when the \u201Cfifth ritual\u201D had been performed.</p><p>They had not managed to learn the details of what had been done or achieved in it.</p><p>Still, plausible rumors had it that if things had gone badly, it could have become one of the \u201Cends\u201D that the hermits of the Atlas Institute spoke of.</p><p>\u201CNo respectable mage would accept a proposal as absurd as recreating that Holy Grail War in America, especially not without the backing of the Mages\u2019 Association. They reached out to you because of your grudge against the Association despite the quality of your bloodline . . . or so I\u2019d guess. I have a healthy respect for your talents, but when it comes to that monster\u2014Francesca\u2014individual ability is secondary at best.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . That doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201D</p><p>The girl who stood before the mage with the crow on her shoulder was not yet even fifteen years old.</p><p>Despite that, her gaze was filled with resignation toward the entire world, and the faint gleam deep in her eyes came from the dark flames of hate.</p><p>At least, the crow-tamer mage was convinced that it was so.</p><p>\u201C. . . Just between us, once, when I was participating in an auction on the Rail Zeppelin, I caught a glimpse of a Ghost Liner . . . one of these \u2018Heroic Spirits.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t on the level of a familiar\u2014it was a shadow of the human order engraved into the Earth itself. Don\u2019t think that you can use one for a personal vendetta and come out unscathed.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you want to destroy something big, you need to pay the price,\u201D the mage with the crow continued to the girl, who lightly clenched her fists and dropped her gaze. \u201CDestroying the Mages\u2019 Association is tantamount to making an enemy of mage society itself. There are any number of people prepared to be destroyed in the end themselves, but don\u2019t forget\u2014your grandfather who gave up his humanity was one of them . . . and the order is backwards. The bigger the thing you want to destroy is, the sooner you\u2019ll be destroyed first. Call it \u2018advance payment.\u2019</p><p>\u201CJust look at mages,\u201D the crafty lady mage with the youthful appearance continued to the girl magecraft-user whose legal guardian she had become. \u201CThey strive to break the laws of nature and reach the Root, and isn\u2019t every last one of them broken?\u201D</p><p>After a slightly self-deprecating smile, the mage\u2019s face became expressionless, and she asked the girl who had become her ward:</p><p>\u201CHaruri Borzak, will you break as a person, or as a mage?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNeither, ma\u2019am,\u201D the girl called Haruri plainly answered the mage who far outranked her.</p><p>\u201CI was already broken a long time ago. Broken by those people from the Clock Tower . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CFather and mother were both ordinary mages. . . but they were branded heretics and had everything taken from them, all so the Clock Tower could get its hands on the research results they inherited from my grandfather, who abandoned his humanity!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Your life wasn\u2019t taken, was it? It was the Borzaks quick perception that allowed them to pass on their Crest\u2014albeit only partially\u2014to you and let you escape. If you conspire with that thing\u2014with Francesca\u2014that will all have been for nothing.\u201D</p><p>She made her tone slightly graver as she spoke, but there was no change in Haruri\u2019s expression.</p><p>When the mage who was Haruri\u2019s guardian saw that, she let out a faint sigh and shook her head.</p><p>\u201CIf you were a mage, you would resign yourself to usurpation by the Clock Tower as a \u2018matter of course\u2019 . . . but the instant you wished for revenge for your parents instead of restoration as a mage, you were no mage. You aren\u2019t broken yet. You could still start over. You could stay hidden while using magecraft to make your life a little easier.\u201D</p><p>She said that, but she made no further effort to stop Haruri.</p><p>Haruri was only her ward, not her apprentice, and their relationship was not enforced by magecraft. She must have decided that it was not her path to get more deeply involved.</p><p>She had a duty to a descendant of her acquaintances, the Borzaks, but that duty would not easily change to compassion.</p><p>She might distance herself from the Clock Tower, but she was still that much of a mage.</p><p>\u201CI believe that the Lord I caught a glimpse of on the Rail Zeppelin\u2014El-Melloi II, I believe\u2014would be willing to accept even someone at odds with mage society like you at his school, but I suppose it would be rude to detain you further.\u201D</p><p>The crow\u2019s eyes flashed eerily as the mage walked off into the darkness.</p><p>She walked like a girl of her apparent age who had lost her way at night, but the gaze of the crow on her shoulder was almost frighteningly sharp and remained fixed on the girl called Haruri.</p><p>\u201C. . . Never forget, Haruri.\u201D</p><p>Did the voice that rang out an instant before they melted into the darkness come from the girl\u2019s mouth or the crow\u2019s plumage?</p><p>The girl whose eardrums and spine shivered was no longer able to tell.</p><p>\u201CNo matter how prepared you are to break . . .\u201D</p><p>Those last words, however, became a lingering echo in the mind of Haruri the magecraft-user.</p><p></p><p>\u201CPreparation won\u2019t mean a thing in the face of someone who was broken from the start.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Present, Snowfield, a Luxury Residential District</p><p></p><p>\u201CHmm . . .\u201D</p><p>A woman\u2019s voice rang out in the real Snowfield. There was a somehow unreal beauty to it.</p><p>\u201CI was sure he\u2019d come rushing to track me down right away . . . but Utu is high in the sky and there\u2019s still no sign of him. He\u2019s surprisingly cautious, considering his best friend just got crushed.\u201D</p><p>A luxury residential area in the Snowerk district.</p><p>Its largest mansion belonged to the owner of the casino building in the city center.</p><p>Publicly, at least.</p><p>The owner was a proxy put in place during the city\u2019s construction\u2014a businessman who had died from illness at a young age and was merely made to appear alive.</p><p>The casino building was actually managed by one of the mages \u201Con the inside,\u201D who used magecraft to disguise himself as the late businessman to fool the eyes of the public when it was absolutely necessary for the owner to put in an appearance.</p><p>As a result, this elegant mansion, which looked like it might belong to a minor Hollywood star, had no real owner\u2014its only visitors were servicepeople who performed the bare minimum of maintenance necessary to keep up appearances.</p><p>And yet . . .</p><p>A group was currently using the mansion as if it belonged to them.</p><p>A woman lounged on a pure white sofa so luxurious that it probably cost as much as a small house on its own. She was just sitting casually, but she gave the impression that she would make a perfect picture no matter who looked at her or from what angle, as if she were the very definition of beauty.</p><p>\u201COh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I want to let Gugalanna do the honors of wiping out that piece of junk, anyway.\u201D</p><p>The person stuck having that impression seared directly into her eyes was a girl still in her late teens.</p><p>Haruri Borzak, the girl who was watching that goddess from a corner of the enormous room, was staring at Filia, the woman on the sofa, with a somewhat gloomy look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s got you looking so down?\u201D</p><p>Haruri answered Filia\u2019s question in a tone of mingled caution and fear.</p><p>\u201C. . . Would you please tell me your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re still hung up on that? Didn\u2019t I tell you\u2014if you\u2019ve realized how charming I am, you don\u2019t need to know anything else.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight now . . . it isn\u2019t just charm. I feel afraid, too. I know I said that all I cared about was that you\u2019d saved me . . . but since we\u2019re going to fight together, I\u2019d at least like to know your name.\u201D</p><p>Haruri was terrified, but she still looked Filia in the eye as she spoke.</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D Filia answered with a faintly bewitching smile. \u201CI see you\u2019ve gotten awfully assertive.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou told Bazdilot and his Servant that you were a goddess. As a mage, it\u2019s hard to believe . . . but at the very least, you\u2019re not a mage. You\u2019re something much \u2018higher\u2019 . . . aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s such an obvious question I don\u2019t even know how to answer it. I mean, all I can say is \u2018of course,\u2019 and that\u2019s boring.\u201D</p><p>Filia shrugged, taking a sip from her glass. Even that gesture seemed so beautiful that it almost convinced Haruri that she was looking at the ideal form of relaxation.</p><p>\u201CStill, I suppose you have a point. Now that I\u2019ve practically finished off Gilgamesh, there\u2019s no real point hiding my name . . . is there? And I was the one who told you to get away from the hospital because you\u2019d probably get dragged in and die.\u201D</p><p>After a brief pause for thought, Filia rose leisurely from the sofa and continued speaking to Haruri.</p><p>\u201CWhat I told that Avenger and his Master wasn\u2019t a figure of speech. I\u2019m not a human who was called a goddess, either. I\u2019m a genuine goddess.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m a goddess of beauty who governs abundant harvests, bestows fortune, glory, and ruin on warriors with the radiance of Venus, and protects people . . . That\u2019s enough to give a mage like you at least an idea, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Haruri gasped at the declaration that \u201Cgoddess\u201D was meant literally.</p><p>Still, she had half expected it and did not fall into doubt or confusion.</p><p>She would have liked to be wrong, but she had already put her life in Filia\u2019s hands, and it was too late to refuse.</p><p>And the numerous fragmentary hints Filia had dropped lead her to a name.</p><p>\u201CA goddess of Venus . . . Aphrodite . . . Venus . . . Astarte. No . . . Closer to the source . . . Inanna?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s \u2018me\u2019 too, but I prefer my Sumerian name. Although that depends on my mood when I manifest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe goddess . . . Ishtar.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou got it. Good thing you didn\u2019t get it wrong, huh?\u201D</p><p>Filia left her glass, which was still partly full, on a marble table. Walking casually, she picked up the TV remote and pressed the on button.</p><p>She flicked through several channels before a jeweler\u2019s segment on a shopping channel caught her eye, and she began to mutter with great interest.</p><p>\u201CThe cuts are gorgeous. Magecraft has declined, but if this is the result of specializing in technology, that may not be such a bad thing. In terms of taste, the artisans of Uruk suit me better, but . . . Oh well. I\u2019ll respect this era\u2019s sensibilities when it comes to that, at least,\u201D she said, toying with the jewelry she had found around the house and smiling happily.</p><p>\u201CAfter all, in the end, all techniques and tastes come down to whether or not they suit me.\u201D</p><p>They had probably been prepared either as camouflage or as mystical catalysts for the mansion\u2019s real owner, but any of them might still have cost over fifty thousand dollars in an ordinary jewelry shop.</p><p>Still, Haruri could not shake the feeling that price had nothing to do with it.</p><p>Even if they had been cheap gems, or even glasswork or marbles, the mere act of her holding them seemed enough to make them standards of beauty and enhance their inherent value.</p><p>\u201CA goddess of beauty . . .\u201D</p><p>It was true that she was so beautiful that it seemed disrespectful to even look at her directly.</p><p>At the same time, that frightened Haruri.</p><p>Genuinely perfect beauty could become great magecraft\u2014nearly Magic\u2014in and of itself.</p><p>For instance, Haruri had heard rumors of the \u201CGold and Silver Princesses\u201D of the Iselma family, powerful mages of Valu\xE9, the School of Creation, at the Clock Tower. Those twins were ultimate beauty, the arbitrary product of generations of magecraft research. They were supposed to project a \u201Cbeauty\u201D so perfect that it blotted out the consciousness of anyone nearby just by existing. Haruri had never seen their faces, but she surmised that the goddess of beauty in front of her was something else entirely.</p><p>If the Iselma princesses were the result of generations of mages studying to approach the Root from the perspective of \u201Cbeauty\u201D and achieving a height at which their forms seemed to reflect the universe itself, then what this goddess had ought to be described as a completely different category that just happened to also use the word \u201Cbeauty.\u201D</p><p>The goal of the Iselma family\u2019s \u201Cbeauty\u201D was ultimately a method to reach the Root. If they ever did reach it, it would be a domain worthy of the name \u201Cotherworldly beauty.\u201D</p><p>Ironically, what the goddess possessed was the opposite\u2014otherworldly \u201Cbeauty\u201D befitting of the heavens applied to earthly forms. You could call it the end goal of \u201Cbeauty\u201D as it is meant near the human sphere. The kind of \u201Cfinished product\u201D that fell from an unreachable height and painted over its surroundings with itself.</p><p>The self-proclaimed goddess before her eyes was like if the golden ratio defined everything it wore as fashionable and fixed that conception on its surroundings. Her way of being broke the rules.</p><p>If the human sense of beauty is a type of crisis avoidance or pleasure mechanism developed for survival, then her beauty was the opposite. Her beauty was something that gave to humans.</p><p>The goddess was aware that she possessed perfect beauty and that she was the standard of beauty. As a result, she must regard beauty as something that inevitably belonged with her and the act of studying herself as totally alien.</p><p>Haruri could not help surmising as much, even though the goddess was just standing in front of her. That was why Haruri admired her freedom and also why she feared that she would be eliminated if she deviated even slightly from the aesthetic sense of this entity beyond human understanding.</p><p>A feeling worthy of the name \u201Cawe\u201D welled up within Haruri. She fought the urge to fall to her knees as she expressed a doubt that had suddenly occurred to her.</p><p>\u201CI thought it wasn\u2019t possible to summon a divinity in a Holy Grail War . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s normally impossible for a Holy Grail. There are a handful of nearly heretical ways to do it, but it would be impossible to summon a divinity of my caliber with a localized ritual like this, and especially not with a fake Holy Grail that\u2019s lost its proper function. Oh, but . . . if you used the Holy Grail as a wish-granter at the end of the ritual, for example, you could probably at least get me to listen to you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen, how . . .\u201D</p><p>Haruri persisted in her question.</p><p>\u201CI only manifested here,\u201D the goddess within Filia answered carelessly, \u201Cbecause power I\u2019d left in this world from the start activated.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPower?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. A blessing I bestowed on this world.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>Her existence here was the result of a blessing to the world.</p><p>Haruri\u2019s face made it plain that she did not understand what the goddess meant. Filia shrugged and continued.</p><p>\u201COf course, it would probably be a curse to those blasphemers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean . . . the goddess Ishtar\u2019s power resides in that \u2018vessel\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot just my power; my personality too. Although they\u2019re basically the same thing to beings like us. . . . This body just had a program in it, you know. It was easy to overwrite. I think she\u2019s a sacrificial priestess prepared as a final terminal to receive the Grail\u2019s power, or something like that.\u201D</p><p>The goddess seemed uninterested in her vessel\u2019s origins. She returned the topic to herself as she stared happily at jewelry.</p><p>\u201CThere was a time when we could manifest in our proper forms, but if this were back then, the humans in this town would have burst and died a long time ago.\u201D</p><p>\u201CModern human bodies can\u2019t withstand the magical energy of the Age of Gods. . . .\u201D</p><p>Haruri had heard something like that before.</p><p>The age when gods and humans had coexisted was over, and magical energy was vanishing from the world. Humanity had adapted to that environment, and their bodies could no longer withstand their original one.</p><p>Haruri did not know if it were evolution or regression, but just as humans could not survive in too high an oxygen density, they had already begun to part ways with the world of magecraft. And not at the societal level\u2014with the exception of mages and magecraft-users who actually continued to use magical energy.</p><p>\u201CWell, the environmental changes and my inability to manifest are for different reasons. Even if you recreated the same environment and tried to summon me . . . I suppose it would be noble if I thought of it as a sacrifice, but there\u2019s really no point if there aren\u2019t any humans to praise me in exchange for protection.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen why go to the trouble of manifesting in an era like\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201CI told you, I bestowed a blessing on the world. It just activated successfully.\u201D</p><p>At that point, the goddess narrowed her eyes and flashed a bewitching smile.</p><p>\u201CI can hardly believe that something like this could really happen. . . . I\u2019d like to applaud the me back then.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou see, when I was insulted by a blasphemous king and that piece of junk threw my divine beast\u2019s entrails at me, I seared a blessing into the world. I kept going until I dissolved into the human order and vanished.\u201D</p><p>Fear is beauty, and beauty is primordial fear.</p><p>That was how it seemed to Haruri when she looked into Filia\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Her keen features made Haruri\u2019s blood run cold. They were just too beautiful\u2014if she had been the object of their hatred, Haruri felt sure that not only would she be unable to resist, she would actually feel grateful.</p><p>The perfected rage and hatred of a goddess of beauty.</p><p>To be precise, a \u201Cvestige\u201D of the passions of the deities who once ruled this planet were reigniting an ancient wrath within the vessel called Filia.</p><p>\u201CIf those two ever returned to this planet and reunited . . .\u201D</p><p>Faced with a miracle she had arrived at amid an infinite expanse of possibilities, the being who called herself a goddess wore a smile so beautiful that it would freeze the heart of anyone who saw it.</p><p>\u201CI would devote my divinity and soul . . . to protecting humans.\u201D</p><p>Then, as if in answer to those words, a grating sound came from the mansion\u2019 courtyard.</p><p>Haruri did not turn to look.</p><p>She knew that she would see nothing if she did.</p><p>Haruri\u2019s Servant, rendered invisible by magecraft, had stationed itself in the courtyard.</p><p>Because it had absorbed rubble from Bazdilot\u2019s workshop, which it had destroyed, it actually put more strain on it to dematerialize, so they were getting by with invisibility magecraft and magical-energy concealment.</p><p>The woman who called herself Ishtar seemed to still be able to perceive the Servant clearly, because she looked up into the courtyard through a glass wall and said:</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t you think so too?\u201D</p><p>In response, a sound like the grating of a massive ship\u2019s propeller rang out from the courtyard.</p><p>\u201COh, honestly. It sounds like she thinks those tall stone towers are the cedar forests of Lebanon,\u201D the goddess said with a shrug and a wry smile, as if to a pet dog.</p><p>\u201CAll right, I\u2019ll take you to a real forest later. That piece of junk is probably there . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201CBut now that Gilgamesh is out of the picture and he\u2019s gained reason, he won\u2019t pose a threat.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Distant Past, in a Forest of Gigantic Trees</p><p></p><p>You need to learn.</p><p>To learn about humans.</p><p>Utu created a \u201Ccomplete human\u201D in the forest of Enlil.</p><p>Behold her, tell of her, and mold yourself in her image.</p><p>Ninurta will then share his power with you.</p><p>Before we loose you into the forests of Uruk, you must spend time with the \u201Chuman\u201D Utu has raised.</p><p>Complete yourself and become humanoid.</p><p></p><p>For you are a lump of clay that imitates all life.</p><p></p><p>The will of the gods.</p><p>When the lump of clay that had had that \u201Cduty\u201D carved into it as an irresistible, comfortable slumber awakened in this world . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201C\u2014<strong><em><strong>\u2014</strong></em>\u2014_\u2014</strong>\u2014___<em><strong><strong>\u2014</strong>\u2014</strong></em>\u201D</p><p></p><p>The world was engulfed in a scream that rent heaven and earth.</p><p>It had no meaning as words.</p><p>It was just a whirling vortex of pure, undirected emotion.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that the \u201Ctool\u201D called Enkidu observed in this world was an everlasting series of screams.</p><p>The chain of sounds alone destroyed nearby objects and soon reduced everything to dust.</p><p>In the \u201Cprocess\u201D of being created by the gods, he/she was discarded into the heart of that vortex of shrieks.</p><p>However . . . \u201Cdiscarded\u201D was merely an objective description.</p><p>In reality, it would be fair to say that the gods were pouring all their efforts into making that weapon supreme.</p><p>He/she was a divine homunculus\u2014a tool, a weapon, and an independent processing mechanism\u2014that the gods of Mesopotamia had created to rebind a child who had degenerated into a human to the gods.</p><p>That was why, as a necessary step, Enkidu has been placed in the midst of the calamitous voice.</p><p>He/she had been dropped there with something akin to love, like an infant into its first bath, as a final precaution.</p><p>Enkidu recognized the series of thunderous roars as a \u201Chuman voice\u201D after eighty days in the noise.</p><p>The processor had been dropped into the world in a state of innocence, input only with the role the gods had bestowed on him/her and a bare minimum of information. He/she had to begin building up everything by choosing what would be necessary and what types of knowledge to accumulate.</p><p>And intellectually, Enkidu had already been given the answer, defined by the gods, to what the source of the screams was.</p><p>It was a being called a \u201Chuman.\u201D</p><p>It was, the gods claimed, the apotheosis and perfection of the human species that Enkidu must go on to confront.</p><p>In his/her initial state, Enkidu did not yet know what words were. From his/her perspective, the mighty words of the gods were imprinted as \u201Csensations.\u201D</p><p>Even so, Enkidu continued to face that \u201Cperfect human\u201D and to expose him/herself to its cries.</p><p>As a result, in order to answer the voice, Enkidu was transforming into something like a gargantuan clay doll.</p><p>If that automaton had been completely suffused in the \u201Cscreams\u201D then . . . he/she would not have been able to achieve mutual understanding with the sacred prostitute Shamhat.</p><p>Enkidu might not even have been able to recognize Shamhat as \u201Chuman.\u201D</p><p>That was how greatly the \u201Cperfect human\u201D that he/she had encountered through the gods\u2019 guidance differed from the humans who walked on two legs in Babylonia.</p><p>The thing that would link Enkidu to human society at the last possible moment . . . was a young girl\u2019s voice that rose amid the endless screams like bubbles from seaweed.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWho is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs someone there?\u201D</p><p></p><p>Before Enkidu was aware of it, little flowers were blooming around him/her.</p><p>The gods\u2019 processor would learn.</p><p>The storm of screams calmed as if it had never been, and a series of delicate sounds that seemed to mean something rang out, but only for the brief time that those flowers continued to bloom.</p><p>After a long time, Enkidu realized what those sounds meant\u2014what \u201Cwords\u201D were.</p><p>And the independent processor learned.</p><p></p><p>Enkidu learned that while it was true that the cries like ceaseless thunder had no meaning as words . . . they were continuing to carve the emotion called \u201Cresentment\u201D into the world in the form of a curse.</p><p>They never ended. They never reached a destination. The \u201Chumans\u201D just continued to scream.</p><p>To scream a curse that would never conclude in a place that was, to Enkidu, the beginning of the world.</p><p></p><p>When Enkidu realized that, however, he/she was unfazed.</p><p>If these were the beings called \u201Chumans\u201D that the gods spoke of, then this must be how humans were. Enkidu dispassionately recorded the fact as a basis for calculations.</p><p>Caught between the endless screams and the gentle girl\u2019s voice that occasionally surfaced, the processor\u2014who could not even distinguish \u201Cgentleness\u201D\u2014accumulated knowledge about humans with complete detachment.</p><p>Only the mission that the gods had given him/her continued to echo within Enkidu\u2019s hollow soul.</p><p></p><p>Converse with humans.</p><p>Pierce them and stitch them fast.</p><p></p><p>A calculating lump of clay that was not yet even a doll.</p><p>Enkidu simply judged that it was necessary for his/her mission and attempted further communication with the \u201Cperfect human.\u201D</p><p>At that point, Enkidu had merely memorized \u201Cher\u201D whispered words and grasped the situation.</p><p>He/she had not yet reached the level of conversation.</p><p>Groping for a way to fulfill the role that he/she had been given, Enkidu attempted various forms of communication with the \u201Cperfect human.\u201D</p><p>In the process, one day . . . Enkidu made flowers broom.</p><p>Enkidu retained no record of memory of why he/she thought to do that. It may have been a coincidence, or some factor that the then-incomplete Enkidu could not identify may have been involved.</p><p>But the result, at least, was burned into Enkidu\u2019s circuits.</p><p>The cries of resentment calmed for just an instant, and \u201Cshe\u201D brought her body to the surface.</p><p>\u201CThank you.</p><p>\u201CPretty . . . aren\u2019t they?\u201D</p><p>Enkidu did not notice the slight tremor in his/her system at the sound of that voice.</p><p>Later, however, the weapon understood.</p><p>That had been the first moment that he/she had succeeded in a mutual exchange of \u201Cwills.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Time, and words, flowed on.</p><p>Enkidu remembered the precise number of days, but he/she saw no meaning in it.</p><p>To the weapon, it did not matter how much time had passed, only how it had come to understand \u201Chumans.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CHey.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re your friends, Enkidu.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut soon, we won\u2019t be friends anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBecause we can\u2019t go anywhere anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe won\u2019t be able to see the same things as you anymore.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re sure to forget about you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo us, you were like a flower, Enkidu.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou saved us from being lonely.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe hope that you\u2019ll meet someone like a flower one day too, Enkidu.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomeone who will bloom again, even if they wither and die.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomeone like a flower . . . that blooms anywhere before you know it.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Before Enkidu knew it, \u201Cshe\u201D had begun to form a tiny individual body when she rose from the swarm of resentful voices.</p><p>The sound-emitting apparatus and visual and auditory sensors packed into that \u201Clittle body\u201D caught Enkidu\u2019s attention.</p><p>Cranium, face, head.</p><p>Enkidu matched the images that the gods had given him/her with the words that he/she had learned from \u201Cher.\u201D</p><p>The top of that head that seemed as if Enkidu could crush it with the slightest exertion was decorated with a flower that he/she had made bloom a few days before.</p><p>Then . . . she picked up a different flower in her hand.</p><p>It was one of the tiny flowers that \u201Cshe\u201D had made bloom when she first surfaced\u2014on the day that Enkidu had first encountered her.</p><p>When \u201Cshe\u201D used that flower to decorate Enkidu\u2019s head, which was just a massive lump of clay, she twisted the visuals sensors and speech emitter on her head into odd shapes.</p><p>It was much later that Enkidu learned that it was called a \u201Csmile.\u201D</p><p></p><p>And so, at the time, Enkidu was more concerned with the things that floated around her.</p><p></p><p>They were seven little rings of light that shone like rainbows just after the rain and seemed to guard \u201Cher.\u201D</p><p>Enkidu judged that those rings of light were \u201Cperfect things\u201D and etched their radiance into his/her soul.</p><p>The gargantuan lump of clay, which was massive enough to take all the cries of resentment that \u201Cthey\u201D let out when the girl\u2019s form was submerged and had tuned his/her mental makeup for that purpose, allowed something like what humans call \u201Chope\u201D to well up in his/her soul for the first time.</p><p>Even when he/she obeyed the gods\u2019 commands and left the forest.</p><p>Even if he/she destroyed humans for the sake of his/her duty . . . he/she had to see that perfect, beautiful radiance again.</p><p>Enkidu etched that wish into his/her system without even analyzing the reason why.</p><p></p><p>The weapon would get his/her wish a long time later.</p><p></p><p>But</p><p>the next time Enkidu saw \u201Cher\u201D</p><p>that radiance . . .</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Present, Snowfield, Crystal Hill, Upper Floors</p><p></p><p>The flowers that bloomed the first time he met \u201Cher.\u201D</p><p>What color had they been?</p><p></p><p>The upper floors of Crystal Hill.</p><p>The direct elevator to the top-floor suite was currently only usable by a select group of people, the official reason being damaged glass due to high winds.</p><p>Enkidu suddenly found himself reflecting on events from his life as he walked the red-carpeted hallway one floor below that led to the suite.</p><p>Reflecting on the flowers that had grown thickly deep in the forest where he had spent time with the being called Huwawa.</p><p>He remembered the color of the flowers that he had made bloom later.</p><p>He had made clusters of pale blue flowers bloom for \u201Cher.\u201D</p><p>Enkidu would never recreate them on his own because there was no need, but if someone asked to see them, he could do so easily.</p><p>In the end, however, he could not remember the color of the flowers that had been with \u201Cher\u201D\u2014the personality that called itself Huwawa.</p><p>Why did Enkidu try to think of those flowers, which existed in a realm that was neither a record for his \u2018completion\u2019 nor a memory?</p><p>Enkidu self-analyzed the reason, immediately arrived at two answers, and lowered his gaze with a faint smile.</p><p>It was less a smile of self-derision than of pure nostalgia.</p><p>One reason was that he had learned that his former sibling\u2014Huwawa\u2014was manifesting in the world.</p><p>The other . . .</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not about personality or the color of their souls. . . . Their transience might be a little similar.\u201D</p><p>Enkidu continued to advance, sensing the presence of a girl in the inner recesses of the top floor.</p><p></p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>He turned a corner and found several men and women in black eyeing him with confusion and alarm.</p><p>\u201CHey, who are you? Stop right there!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis area is off limits to . . . Wait. Bare feet . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CCan this be real . . .? He\u2019s not a mage. His magical energy is like . . . the Earth itself . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CA Servant . . .? Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s Lancer!\u201D</p><p>Only a select few members of the organization occupying the suite were familiar with Enkidu\u2019s appearance.</p><p>Only the ones who had used their familiars to watch his battle with Gilgamesh on the first day.</p><p>They had been told his distinguishing features, but none of them had expected him to just walk up to them in the hallway in broad daylight.</p><p>The magical energy that coursed through the Heroic Spirit\u2019s body was both of the same type as the magical energy that flowed through the earth\u2019s leylines and as peaceful as a calm sea. Many magecraft-users and mages would not be able to detect it, even at close quarters.</p><p>That was why, now that they had detected it, they understood.</p><p>It was like they had caught a whiff of seawater by the shore and suddenly realized that there was a massive whale in front of them.</p><p>It was too late to launch an attack. They doubted that anything they tried would have worked, even if they had struck first.</p><p>There was almost nothing that they, who had not made contracts with Heroic Spirits, could do. Their superiors had even given them strict orders never to engage a Heroic Spirit if one appeared.</p><p>They remained keenly aware of their holstered guns and offensive Mystic Codes, but not one of them reached for one.</p><p>The Heroic Spirit saw that and spoke with a smile.</p><p>The voice could be taken for male or female, but the Heroic Spirit\u2019s sex didn\u2019t matter to the black-suited guards.</p><p>Not only his physical beauty, but everything, including the magical energy they sensed from within him and the way he moved as he walked toward them, told them that this was a \u201Cperfect body.\u201D</p><p>In the face of that fact, age and sex were trivialities. Types of curse or magecraft that varied according to sex would be meaningless before this mighty being regardless.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going through.\u201D</p><p>The Heroic Spirit calmly said that short sentence.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>The black-suited group, every inch of their skins breaking out in cold sweat, were powerless to do anything. They stood petrified.</p><p>As the Heroic Spirit passed by them, he lowered his gaze slightly as if in thought, paused, and said:</p><p>\u201CYou can relax. I haven\u2019t come to fight. In fact, if you had chosen to fight, the thing you ought to be protecting might have ended up as collateral damage.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>The looks on the guards\u2019 sweat-drenched faces said that they did not understand what Enkidu was trying to say. He, still smiling, dispassionately stated the facts to them without a hint of irony or approbation.</p><p>\u201CI mean that you didn\u2019t make the wrong decision. So, you don\u2019t need to feel responsible. . . . I hope that you will continue to make correct choices.\u201D</p><p>Correct choices for whom?</p><p>They wanted to ask, but they could not get the words out.</p><p>They felt that the Heroic Spirit, who had done nothing but walk past them, had grasped their entire beings, and it terrified them\u2014and then that Heroic Spirit glanced back at them and said:</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s all right, Master. I\u2019ve disarmed all of the security systems in this hallway. . . . That means it\u2019s safe.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?!\u201D</p><p>Master.</p><p>At that word, the guards\u2019 tension reached its limit.</p><p>They were shocked to discover that the Heroic Spirit had disarmed all of their defensive magecraft without appearing to do anything, but the reason he had done so was even more troubling.</p><p>The fact that it was not just a Servant\u2014a Master had marched in on them as well.</p><p>The leader they were supposed to be guarding had currently as good as lost her Servant.</p><p>If this Master had come to propose an alliance, would they just eliminate her once they realized the situation?</p><p>The worried group shifted its attention to the corner of the hallway.</p><p>A moment later . . . with slow, cautious steps, sniffing as it went, a sleek, silver-coated wolf rounded the bend.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Crystal Hill, Top Floor Suite</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Have you come to slay His Majesty?\u201D The girl\u2014Tine Chelk\u2014quietly asked Enkidu when he opened the door.</p><p>There were more than ten of her black-clad subordinates in the room.</p><p>Like the group in the hallway, however, they were unable to make any careless moves when suddenly confronted with a Servant.</p><p>A nervous thrill ran through the room at Tine\u2019s question.</p><p>The tension, however, was relieved by a few mild words from Enkidu, who stepped into the room with the silver wolf.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s a correct inference for a Master in a Holy Grail War, but it doesn\u2019t match the facts.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen . . . have you come to execute me? I\u2019ve disgraced His Majesty, your best friend.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not right either,\u201D Enkidu shook his head, still smiling but somehow dispassionate.</p><p>Tine\u2019s attention was focused on Enkidu, but she was not looking at him.</p><p>She was in the middle of what was, in a sense, a sumptuous \u201Cmage\u2019s workshop\u201D furnished with the King of Heroes\u2019 personal possessions, continuously channeling vast quantities of magical energy into the being who lay supine at its center.</p><p>\u201CYour Magic Circuits . . . no, you yourself are linked to this land, aren\u2019t you?\u201D Enkidu sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201C. . . I see. No wonder you have a similar aura. . . . Your people tried the same thing as the old gods.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>Tine looked slightly confused by Enkidu\u2019s strange remarks, but it seemed that she could not spare the time to pursue the question because she continued to direct magical energy into the center of the room without giving him so much as a glance.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ORgLVwI.png" alt=""></p><p>\u201CDo you know about me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHis Majesty calls you his friend.\u201D</p><p>Tine still did not look at Enkidu. Every inch of her body was drenched in sweat as she manipulated extraordinary quantities of magical energy.</p><p>Nevertheless, she responded in a firm voice, apparently determined not to show weakness.</p><p>\u201CI can only think of one Heroic Spirit that His Majesty would call a friend and who could also compete with him in raw power.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wonder. That was probably true while I was alive,\u201D Enkidu answered evasively.</p><p>The black-suited subordinates near Tine gradually began to move again.</p><p>\u201C. . . If you don\u2019t intend to fight, what are you doing here?\u201D An elderly man warily asked Enkidu.</p><p>The suspicion in the man\u2019s voice was faintly tinged with hope.</p><p>Enkidu guessed his meaning and shook his head apologetically.</p><p>\u201CIf you believe I have come to save King Gilgamesh, I\u2019m afraid you will be disappointed.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Most of the room\u2019s occupants looked discouraged by the Heroic Spirit\u2019s words, and Tine\u2019s shoulders trembled slightly.</p><p>The thing in the center of the room\u2014the thing Enkidu was staring at\u2014was indeed the King of Heroes\u2019 \u201Ccorpse.\u201D</p><p>The Einzbern homunculus who Gilgamesh had called \u201CIshtar.\u201D</p><p>Thanks to her interference, Gilgamesh had been pierced by Alkeides\u2019 arrows, and then impaled by the gargantuan \u201Csomething\u201D that had appeared immediately afterward.</p><p>It was undeniably a fatal blow.</p><p>Worse, his body was being eaten away by some force, and his wounds continued to rot even while he was alive.</p><p>The only reason that his physical body still existed was that Tine was drawing massive quantities of magical energy from the leylines to hold his Spirit Origin in its human shape and keep it from disintegrating by brute force.</p><p>Surveying Gilgamesh in that state, retaining only the form of a Servant, Enkidu dispassionately stated his opinion.</p><p>\u201CThere are two venoms eating away at Gil\u2019s body. If it were just the hydra venom, I could force open Gil\u2019s treasury and probably find an antidote. He used to say that he was going to hunt the vipers at the world\u2019s end one day, after all. His treasury might even yield a cooking utensil or two made just for them in addition to corpses and antidotes.\u201D</p><p>Enkidu continued to speak casually, as if he were telling everyday jokes.</p><p>Tine gritted her teeth and responded with a tinge of anger, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201CAren\u2019t you . . . His Majesty\u2019s friend . . .? How can you speak so calmly when . . .?!\u201D</p><p>Her shout was too dignified to be the temper of a girl who was in some ways still a child.</p><p>Enkidu accepted it at her side. He stopped smiling, but his expression remained composed as he replied.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s because I\u2019m his friend.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGil and I spent irreplaceable days together. We\u2019ve already finished our eternal parting and the grief that came with it. The \u2018current\u2019 us are shadows burned into the Human Order. We may rejoice at our reunion, but we don\u2019t need to grieve at parting again. I don\u2019t believe that Gil would shed a tear if I were the one lying here on the verge of death, and I wouldn\u2019t ask him to.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Confusion suffused Tine\u2019s profile.</p><p>She glanced at Enkidu just once, but her experience of life was too short to judge the truth of the Heroic Spirit\u2019s words by his expression.</p><p>\u201CI believe it will be difficult for you to understand, and I can guess your reason for directing your anger at me. So, if it will make you feel better, feel free to curse at me as much as you like.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>When she heard that, Tine turned her face fully toward Enkidu for the first time. Her eyes showed a range of emotions\u2014anger, sadness, fear. Then, after a momentary look that might have been begging for help, she lowered her head and said frustratedly:</p><p>\u201CNo . . . it wouldn\u2019t. . . . I\u2019m sorry. . . . I\u2019m . . . truly sorry. . . .\u201D</p><p>A clear apology to Enkidu spilled from the lips of the mage, who was in some ways still a child.</p><p>\u201CYou aren\u2019t the one I hate. . . .\u201D</p><p>Massive quantities of magical energy coursed through Tine\u2019s Magic Circuits. Every nerve in her body was beginning to groan in protest.</p><p>As she spoke, however, her face was twisted not with pain but with regret.</p><p>\u201CI . . . couldn\u2019t do anything. . . . I didn\u2019t do anything. . . .\u201D</p><p>Tine fell silent.</p><p>\u201CYou used two Command Spells, didn\u2019t you?\u201D Enkidu asked calmly, neither comforting nor blaming.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Enkidu was looking at the back of Tine\u2019s left hand.</p><p>The majority of her Command Spells, the mark of a Master, were faded. Just one remained.</p><p>\u201COne to summon him back here, and another to attempt to heal him. . . . That was a good decision for a Master. Without it, there would have been no chance that Gilgamesh could maintain the form of his Spirit Origin.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou said that . . . there are two types of venom?\u201D Tine asked without slackening her efforts to maintain Gilgamesh\u2019s Spirit Origin. She seemed to be grasping Enkidu\u2019s personality, because the side of her that had been built up as a mage began to show on her face.</p><p>\u201CYes. The other is closer to a curse than a toxin.\u201D</p><p>Enkidu narrowed his eyes as he surveyed the wound gouged in Gilgamesh\u2019s torso.</p><p>\u201C. . . I suppose this is what they call \u2018irony.\u2019\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t suppose it was a rainbow-colored light that impaled King Gilgamesh\u2019s body?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .! Do you know what that was?\u201D</p><p>The scene of Gilgamesh being struck down replayed in Tine\u2019s mind.</p><p>The seven-colored halo, distinct from the titanic mechanical \u201Csomething.\u201D</p><p>The way it had twisted into a shape like the tip of a rock drill and impaled Gilgamesh through the belly.</p><p>\u201CThat was the protection of the gods. It\u2019s also a curse to the human race. . . . The light that was poured into Gil was one of them, a curse descended from Pestilence.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPestilence . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe should probably be grateful for the hydra venom. It and the pestilence are competing with and consuming each other. . . . That\u2019s why the plague hasn\u2019t spread from Gil\u2019s body. If not for that, there\u2019s a high probability that all of you, and probably me, would also be trapped in the abyss of death by now.\u201D</p><p>Tine and her subordinates gasped at Enkidu\u2019s casual statement.</p><p>\u201COh, there\u2019s no need to change his treatment. In my estimation, both the venom and the curse will disappear along with the Spirit Origin of the body called Gilgamesh. It\u2019s not \u2018his\u2019 Spirit Origin anymore. The only thing here now is the corpse of an ancient human.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat was that thing . . . that metal giant? What do you know about . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet me see. Where should I start . . .?\u201D</p><p>Enkidu lowered his gaze as if lost in thought, and then began to tell his reason for coming there little by little.</p><p>\u201CI came here because I wanted to know a little more about all of you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAbout us?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI mean, you tried to use Gil, and he spared your lives. I was curious what you were like. Gil was also curious about my Master, but . . .\u201D</p><p>Enkidu smiled at Tine and continued without stating what his own judgment had been.</p><p>\u201CNothing would please me more than if we could work together. I also want to do all that I can . . . to remove that wicked deity from this stage.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . What deity? Do you mean that steel monster that stabbed His Majesty?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I mean\u2014. . .?\u201D</p><p>The next instant, Enkidu raised his head as if he had noticed something.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s . . . someone here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D<br> Enkidu slowly surveyed the surrounding space without answering Tine\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201CIs this . . . a human? No . . . it\u2019s like a human, but . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you mean that someone is hiding in this room?\u201D</p><p>Tine probed the nearby magical energy in confusion, but she could sense nothing of the kind.</p><p>Enkidu, however, seemed certain of its presence and wiped the emotion from his face as he said:</p><p>\u201CNo . . . they aren\u2019t hiding. . . . It\u2019s probably the opposite.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CIt seems . . . that something is trying to probe this place from the reverse side of the world.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off Town, Crystal Hill, Top Floor Suite</p><p></p><p>\u201CI knew it. This room looks like it has the \u2018thinnest walls.\u2019\u201D</p><p></p><p>The Snowfield recreated inside the mysterious ward.</p><p>In the top floor suite of its Crystal Hill were Flat Escardos, Berserker Jack the Ripper, and the Holy Church personnel led by Hansa Cervantes.</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . But what is this place? It\u2019s the top floor of a hotel, but it doesn\u2019t look like guest accommodations. It reminds me of a mage\u2019s workshop, but the furnishings are too needlessly extravagant for that.\u201D</p><p>Flat responded to Jack\u2019s question by looking around the room in growing excitement.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s kind of like a museum?! There\u2019s pretty jewels and gold dishes and all kinds of amazing things!\u201D</p><p>The space, which ought to have been the hotel\u2019s most luxurious room, was decorated with countless sparkling treasures that looked brand new despite their antique style. The assortment really could plausibly be some kind of exhibit.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve seen these in the professor\u2019s lectures. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re treasures from somewhere around Mesopotamia, but . . . hmm . . . The way they\u2019re made, they should have some magical energy stored inside, but I don\u2019t sense any. . . . They don\u2019t seem like fakes, but it\u2019s like they\u2019re empty shells. It\u2019s weird,\u201D Flat commented as he stared intently at the furnishings.</p><p>\u201CBut if the walls are thinnest here,\u201D Hansa cut in from behind him, \u201Cdoes that mean that altitude is the key?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. . . . I\u2019ve got a feeling that this place is uniquely in harmony with the world outside the barrier. Like both sides are connected, or . . .\u201D</p><p>At that point, Flat shifted his focus to a point at the center of the suite.</p><p>To the middle of the largest room.</p><p>What looked like a magic circle of a system unfamiliar at the Clock Tower was drawn on the floor there, but the target of that magecraft was missing from its center.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s this? I think it\u2019s a circle for stabilizing something . . . but there\u2019s nothing here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFrom the looks of things, this must be some faction\u2019s workshop after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m technically neutral. I can guess who it belongs to, but I decline to comment.\u201D</p><p>Hansa went out of his way to explain something he could have easily left unsaid with a shrug.</p><p>Jack maintained the bare minimum of cautious attention on Hansa and the nuns who were inspecting the room as he continued.</p><p>\u201CCould the circle be empty simply because they haven\u2019t begun their ritual yet?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. . . . It\u2019s strange. I\u2019ve got a feeling that something is already happening here, but . . . This circle really isn\u2019t active . . . but this is definitely the place.\u201D</p><p>Flat waved his hand over the center of the empty circle with a look of confusion.</p><p></p><p>\u201CThe reason this place has the strongest connection to the world \u2018outside\u2019 the ward\u2014to the real city\u2014is . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Snowfield, Crystal Hill, Top Floor</p><p></p><p>Enkidu\u2019s voice rang out outside the ward, on the top floor of the \u201Creal\u201D Crystal Hill.</p><p>\u201CYes, something is definitely here, but I can only sense its presence.\u201D</p><p>When Tine\u2019s subordinates heard that, each of them seized a weapon or Mystic Code and frantically looked around the room.</p><p>There faces, however, showed confusion. It seemed that they could not find even traces of magical energy.</p><p>Enkidu\u2019s high Detect Presence Skill, however, was certainly detecting the \u201Cfluctuation.\u201D</p><p>And when he found its center, he looked with faint surprise at the face of his half-corpse friend.</p><p>\u201CThis . . . wasn\u2019t accounted for, I suspect.\u201D</p><p>There\u2019s was something human about the grin that quietly spread over his face, in contrast to his usual nearly expressionless smile . . . but no one in the room saw it.</p><p>\u201CStill . . . you really haven\u2019t changed, Gil.\u201D</p><p>Guessing what had befallen the venom- and curse-ridden Gilgamesh, Enkidu quietly accepted its \u201Ccourse.\u201D</p><p>All the while allowing a light of hope, unbecoming of an arithmetic logic unit, to flicker in his heart of hearts.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m amazed that you still pull the fate of the world to yourself even after your functions have been halted.\u201D</p><p>Countless gleaming, golden chains sprouted from the hem of his robe and instantly spread to all sides of the room.</p><p>\u201C! What are you\u2014\u201D</p><p>Tine cried out, and her black-suited guards tensed.</p><p>Enkidu, however, reassuringly spread his arms in a gesture of defenselessness and said:</p><p>\u201CPlease don\u2019t be concerned; this isn\u2019t an attack against you, although I\u2019m sorry to say that it isn\u2019t to protect you, either.\u201D<br> Enkidu winked like a mischievous child while erecting several layers of defensive measures only around the silver wolf sprawled at his feet\u2014his Master\u2014and wistfully recalled his \u201Cadventuring days\u201D as he continued.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m just going to become someone\u2019s tool, as always.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CIn this case . . . I suppose that in your terms, I\u2019ll be a \u2018booster.\u2019\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off Town, Crystal Hill, Top Floor</p><p></p><p>\u201CHuh?!\u201D</p><p>Flat let out a cry of surprise, and the others turned to stare at him.</p><p>\u201CWhat is it? Something wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not exactly a problem,\u201D Flat answered Hansa with a look of confusion. \u201CMaybe more like a problem got solved . . .\u201D</p><p>Flat manipulated magical energy with the fingertips of both hands and began overwriting the magic circle inscribed on the floor.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you intend to do?\u201D</p><p>Flat continued to work while he answered Jack.</p><p>\u201CSince asphalt that was torn up in the real world is fine here . . . I think it can probably ignore major damage and decide not to copy-paste it. But an enemy faction\u2019s magic circle still being here means that the range of \u2018things it would be inconvenient to copy\u2019 must be pretty narrow.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRecreating the real city inside a ward is copy and pasting? I see young Clock Tower mages are even up-to-date in their expressions.\u201D</p><p>Hansa shrugged and watched Flat work with interest.</p><p>\u201CThank you very much! I may not look it, but I\u2019m in the School of Modern Magecraft! It\u2019s all thanks to the professor that I\u2019m up-to-date!\u201D</p><p>Flat, meanwhile, shot back a slightly off-base answer and continued to survey the surroundings.</p><p>\u201CI knew it. The closest thing to this place is probably a Reality Marble. . . . But still . . . No, I doubt anyone but the professor could put it into words well. And I only saw it before; it\u2019s not like we covered it in class.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaw what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve seen something like this once before, in Wales. That was in a cemetery . . . but if that was \u2018a ward-world that recreates the past,\u2019 this must be \u2018a ward-world that recreates the present.\u2019\u201D<br> \u201C. . . In Wales? Don\u2019t tell me you mean the Blackmore Cemetery, founded by a clan with strong ties to Dead Apostles? A priest I know and a nun I never got along with nearly died in some trouble over there . . . but I never figured you\u2019d be mixed up with that place too.\u201D</p><p>Hansa sounded surprised. For some reason, Flat\u2019s eyes shone with delight.</p><p>\u201COh, you know about that! Yes, this world inside the ward is like a massive stage set made to be a whole fake city. . . . You see that as a setting in games sometimes. I think there was a Jim Carrey movie like that too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m pretty sure that was a city set built from the ground up, not a reproduction. . . . That last scene was great, though. It was a good movie.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWasn\u2019t it?! I want to teach my liquid mercury Mystic Code friend the greeting from it next time I see her!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSave that talk for later. You won\u2019t be able to see that Mystic Code again if we don\u2019t get out of this world first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. S-Sorry. . . .\u201D</p><p>Snapped back to reality by Jack, Flat dejectedly returned to the subject at hand.</p><p>\u201CSince the cars are all stopped and the slot machines don\u2019t work, I think it might not be continuously mirroring the real city but regularly singling out and copying \u2018worlds\u2019 one moment at a time. There are parked cars here too, so I\u2019d guess objects whose position data is changing drastically in the \u2018isolated moment\u2019 aren\u2019t reflected.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . In that case, something is being done in the real-world suite that this magic circle corresponds to. Or could they be trying to open a way into this place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm. It didn\u2019t look like it from the way the magical energy was distorting until just now . . . but that just changed. How should I put it? It\u2019s like my phone suddenly got three bars even though we\u2019re in a subway tunnel, or . . . That\u2019s it! My phone!\u201D</p><p>Flat hurriedly pulled out his cell phone and placed it on a nearby marble table and began to rummage through the nearby objects.</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s see. I\u2019ll just borrow this . . . and this and this . . .\u201D</p><p>He was selecting several of the historical artifacts of apparently Mesopotamian origin with which the room was decorated and filling them with his own magical energy, restoring their power as ritual tools.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you intend to do?\u201D<br> \u201CWell, some of the decorations looked like they\u2019d be useful as Mystic Codes, so I thought I\u2019d set up a simple altar with them. Then, how should I put it? It\u2019s like knocking on a wall to get a response. If I\u2019m lucky, I might be able to get my phone to connect to the \u2018outside.\u2019\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . No, wait, I said I see, but is that really possible?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve done similar things plenty of times. My classmate Caules and I used to convert between magical energy and radio waves all the time, so I think it\u2019ll work out.\u201D</p><p>Flat was moving ahead with a carefree attitude.</p><p>Jack was uneasy after his rough explanation, but he considered that Flat had accomplished several advanced feats of magecraft with the same approach and decided to wait and see.</p><p>When my thoughts blended with Master\u2019s due to that Caster\u2019s power . . . I somehow grasped the nature of his magecraft.</p><p>It\u2019s similar to Eastern ideas. He doesn\u2019t limit his magecraft to a single system by defining the boundaries of his self. . . . Or rather, he can\u2019t.</p><p>He constructs and performs most of his magecraft on the spot by sense alone. Even if you told him to construct the same magecraft again, Flat could probably only make a rough approximation.</p><p>He isn\u2019t mold-breaking so much as he never had a mold to begin with. I\u2019m astonished that that mage, El-Melloi II, could raise an enfant terrible like him.</p><p>As he watched Flat work, Jack thought that, given such an apprentice, a typical mage would either break in some way, or else try to break Flat.</p><p>He possessed a basic knowledge of magecraft thanks to traditions that Jack the Ripper was a mage, but even from that perspective, and even from the perspective of a unique Servant who had been partially mixed with his Master by Caster, Flat was an anomaly.</p><p>I know it\u2019s an odd question to ask when I don\u2019t even know who I am myself . . . but just who is my erratic-yet-dependable Master?</p><p>In the background of that back and forth between Master and Servant, Hansa was surveying the city from the top floor.</p><p>\u201CIt just looks like an ordinary city from up here. . . . Still, it looks like there\u2019s no question we really are in a closed-off world.\u201D</p><p>When he stared into the distance from the top floor of the skyscraper, he could see something like a dense mist rising a considerable distance outside the city.</p><p>He doubted that the world continued beyond that mist. Recreating the entire world had to be beyond the realm of simple magecraft.</p><p>\u201CAt that point, it\u2019d be less a recreation of the world than transportation to a parallel one. . . . Not that this situation isn\u2019t crazy enough already.\u201D</p><p>Hansa shrugged as he surveyed the quiet cityscape. One of the nuns approached him at a brisk walk.</p><p>\u201CHansa.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s something strange over there.\u201D</p><p>Once Hansa turned to look in the direction that the nun unemotionally indicated, the other three nuns gathered to look down on the city from windows on the same side of the building.</p><p>\u201CHas something happened?\u201D</p><p>\u201C . . . Father Hansa, there\u2019s been activity. Over there.\u201D</p><p>Hansa looked where the polite nun with the eyepatch indicated and saw what looked like a rising cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s . . .\u201D</p><p>Lights and burst of flame occasionally flashed inside the dust cloud.</p><p>It looked a lot like the battle in front of the hospital that they had been able to see from the church the night before.</p><p>Soon there was a particularly intense burst of light . . . and a gigantic form reared into view.</p><p>\u201C. . . Kerberos. We saw it yesterday . . . but was it always that big?\u201D</p><p>The three-headed monster was larger than the average house.</p><p>The sight of it made Hansa suspicious even before it put him on his guard.</p><p>\u201CIs the Archer wearing a cloth who used that thing here too? No, if that were it . . . If he could make it that big, I\u2019m guessing he would\u2019ve done it last night. . . .\u201D</p><p>A number of theories raced through Hansa\u2019s head.</p><p>I\u2019m sure that demonic beast\u2019s body was left lying on the road.</p><p>So, was it just pulled in like the rest of us?</p><p>Did the Servant who created this world give it strength . . .?</p><p>At the very least, the Servant\u2019s probable Master, Kuruoka Tsubaki, would not know that kind of magecraft.</p><p>That narrowed down the possibilities.</p><p>It was either a Servant, one of the people trying to exploit the situation in the city, or a dangerous being that just wanted to rampage regardless of the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the plan, Hansa? If we\u2019re going, I\u2019m going to change my clothes.\u201D</p><p>The blonde nun\u2019s question caused Hansa to reflect for a moment.</p><p>Then, after a look at Flat and Jack behind him, he removed his own eyepatch and said:</p><p>\u201CNo, this is our chance. We can observe the widest area from here.\u201D</p><p>From beneath the eyepatch appeared an artificial eye Mystic Code packed with variety of Mystic Codes\u2014biological, mechanical, and even electronic\u2014inside mystically treated crystal.</p><p>The lens inside the crystal rearranged themselves with a whirring sound like a robot in a sci-fi movie.</p><p>Then, with vision enhanced to dozens of times that of a normal human, Hansa began to observe not the battle but the buildings around it.</p><p>\u201CIf a Servant is using that thing, they may be nearby watching the fight. If I can at least find traces of magical energy . . .\u201D</p><p>At that point, Hansa stopped speaking.</p><p>He had spotted a small human figure standing atop a building a short distance away from the uproar.</p><p>\u201CIs that . . .?\u201D</p><p>That figure . . . was familiar.</p><p>Hansa immediately fished where he had seen it before out of the sea of his memories.</p><p>In the hallway of the hotel he had leapt into in pursuit of a hematophage after the incident at the police station.</p><p>That\u2019s where \u201Che\u201D had been.</p><p>It was the boy who was supposed to have been attacked in passing by that monster\u2014the hematophage Jester Karture.</p><p>\u201C. . . He got me.\u201D</p><p>The corners of Hansa\u2019s mouth curled upward even as he followed the figure with an angry glare.</p><p>If he had been using the type of farseeing magecraft that operated directly on its target\u2019s space, the figure would have noticed that he was watching.</p><p>At present, however, Hansa was only using his artificial eye to directly enhance his vision.</p><p>In a sense, it was like he was just looking through binoculars . . . as he observed the boy-shaped thing happily watching the conflict in the city.</p><p>He could not tell whether it was controlling the giant beast.</p><p>But he was certain at least that the hematophage was involved in the current situation.</p><p>\u201CA transformation ability . . .? It must be pretty impressive to turn even his presence completely human.\u201D</p><p>Not only Hansa but most Executors could see through transformations and disguises that relied on ordinary magecraft or hematophage peculiarities.</p><p>But the sight of that transformation, which was almost like the creature had swapped out its very soul, reconfirmed for Hansa that Jester was an \u201Cenemy\u201D he could not afford to underestimate.</p><p>\u201CChange gear. We\u2019re going to slay that hematophage while we\u2019re in here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat child is the hematophage from before?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCouldn\u2019t he just be under his control?\u201D</p><p>The nuns sounded skeptical about their orders, but Hansa gave a little shake of the head.</p><p>All the while glaring at the look on the distant boy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201CHe may be able to change the color of his soul . . . but he can\u2019t change that twisted smile.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cheerful voice rang out from behind them.</p><p>\u201CI got through!\u201D</p><p>Hansa and the others turned to find Flat grinning from ear to ear and dancing for joy in front of the bizarre altar he had constructed with his phone in one hand.</p><p>The signal from Flat\u2019s cell phone and the magical energy he had used to transmit it had just connected to \u201Cthe outside world\u201D\u2014the real Snowfield.</p><p>In other words, a hole had been made in the walls of the ward for that magical energy and signal to pass through, even if it were a small one.</p><p>For Flat and the others, it was only a steppingstone on their way to \u201Cthe outside\u201D . . .</p><p></p><p>But the small change caused big changes in the world of Snowfield.</p><p>It was a single ant tunnel in a massive dam.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, you could say that this minor change was the trigger that ended the deadlock between the factions vying for control of Snowfield . . . although no one knew it yet at the time.</p><p></p><p>But whether anyone knew it or not, the city\u2019s fate began inexorably to change.</p><p>As if to show that once cracks had begun to spread, they would eventually bring everything crumbling down.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Above Snowfield, Airborne Workshop</p><p></p><p>\u201CFound it.\u201D</p><p></p><p>High above the real city.</p><p>Inside a massive airship floating so far above the earth that it was not even reproduced inside the ward, Francesca grinned ecstatically as she whispered:</p><p>\u201CYay! There\u2019s finally a \u2018hole.\u2019 I don\u2019t know who did it, but I want to give them a Nobel Prize or something! The Nobel Me Prize!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe what?\u201D</p><p>Francesca flapped her legs on the bed as she cheerfully answered her shadow, Caster.</p><p>\u201CI give the money from a Nobel Prize to whoever helped me out! I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to get it, and I\u2019ll be happy since I won\u2019t have to pay out of pocket. The people at the Nobel Foundation will lose out, but there are two sides that benefit, so in terms of pluses and minuses it works out to a positive! That\u2019s how the world becomes a nicer place!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I was wondering what a Nobel Prize is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Didn\u2019t you get that kind of knowledge from the \u2018Grail\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, it sounds like it\u2019s clearly unrelated to the Grail War. Of course, it\u2019s case-by-case, so I don\u2019t know how it would work in a proper Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>Francesca turned to look with interest at the boy Prelati, who was stuffing his face with expensive chocolate truffles.</p><p>\u201CHmm. That does make you wonder, huh? How much do you think the people in Fuyuki knew? They were active in Japan, so I\u2019m guessing they at least got its political system and laws in their heads. Hey, do you know who the current U.S. president is?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNope. But I do kind of know what the presidency is. I know how TV works, too, and I can use a cell phone no problem. I don\u2019t know the names of any phone brands, though.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Hmm. I wonder if the Other Heroic Spirits are the same way. You\u2019re me, so you might have connected to my knowledge when we made a contract and established a magical energy connection.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDoes that really matter? Whatever I started out knowing, I can just pick up any cards I need later, and betting the farm on my current hand and going down in flames would be pretty fun too. Don\u2019t you think?\u201D</p><p>Prelati slumped against Francesca\u2019s back and softly brushed her lips with a fingertip covered in melted chocolate.</p><p>Francesca grinned, ran her tongue coquettishly over the finger . . . then flashed a malicious smile and leaned her head against Prelati\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201CYes, yes. It\u2019s no use trying to corrupt yourself, you know? I\u2019m already corrupted.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you sure you\u2019re not the one trying to tempt me? Am I right in thinking that this qualifies as narcissism?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wonder. I\u2019d love to summon Narcissus and ask him. Not that I have a catalyst that eccentric, of course.\u201D</p><p>Francesca tried to change the subject with a few offhand remarks about the Greek boy who lent his name to narcissism, but Prelati\u2014her own shadow\u2014was undeterred and turned the conversation back to its original subject.</p><p>\u201CBut you are working to make the world a more fun place, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, only by leaving things to others and cutting as many corners as I can.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t wait. How much do you think we\u2019ll be able to lay the world bare once we let the Grail take care of that \u2018great labyrinth\u2019\u2014it\u2019s risky to even look for the entrance\u2014and get our hands on the \u2018microcosm of the world\u2019 in its depths?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell first thing\u2019s first; the door to this city\u2019s \u2018little labyrinth\u2019\u2014a weird world made by a weird Servant\u2014just turned up!\u201D</p><p>Giggling, Francesca traced lines in the air with her fingers and caused several floating mirrors to rise.</p><p>\u201COut of the group trapped inside, I\u2019m most interested in . . . The Lionheart, I guess. Although it really is a mystery why that fanboy turned up instead of little Artoria.\u201D</p><p>Francesca, who like the police force was already certain of Saber\u2019s identity, stared at his image in one of the mirrors, which showed him delivering his speech from atop the police car, as she licked her lips.</p><p>\u201CYes, he\u2019s wonderful. A real kingly king who\u2019s lit by legend of the past and magnifies their light to shine several times as bright.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre your guts aching?\u201D</p><p>Prelati leered, and Francesca smiled innocently back.</p><p>\u201COf course! That Saber\u2019s been giving me butterflies this whole time! I couldn\u2019t help becoming a fan! Not quite as strong as with Jeanne or Gilles, but really close. Does that make sense to you? Of course it does!\u201D</p><p>Francesca gestured animatedly as she spoke, like a low-teen girl talking about her favorite pop star.</p><p>Prelati watched her and continued calmly.</p><p>\u201CYes, it does. You\u2019re me, after all. That\u2019s why I know just what you want to do to that oh-so-wonderful king you\u2019ve become a fan of.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWill you come with me? I can\u2019t cast illusions as well as you can right now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure I will. Should we do it inside the ward?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Faldeus will never shut up about it if we do it here!\u201D</p><p>The boy and girl chatted conspiratorially.</p><p>Outwardly they appeared to be young humans, but writhing within those vessels were indides so utterly dark that they could only be called monsters.</p><p></p><p>Reflected in the mirrors that hovered around them were records of the past.</p><p>Vestiges as images, which were factual but did not reflect the truth.</p><p>While she wondered what truth she should add to them to thrust on The Lionheart, Francesca gazed absentmindedly at an image of more than ten years earlier.</p><p>An image of a holy-sword-wielder clad in blue cloth and silver armor . . . who had once overcome everything and yet lost everything.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>In a Dream</p><p></p><p>The city was kind of noisy.</p><p>The wind was kind of humid.</p><p></p><p>Kuruoka Tsubaki was still too young to be able to put her apprehension into words.</p><p>By all rights, she should not even have been able to sense the change . . . but thanks to her Magic Circuits and the influence of Pale Rider linked to the magical energy they generated, changes in the \u201Cworld\u201D around her and the Heroic Spirit who was its ruler echoed vividly within her.</p><p>The girl sensed it in the midst of an afternoon nap. She lay on the family sofa in a dream within a dream\u2014a troubled sleep that was hers alone.</p><p></p><p>I\u2019m scared, daddy.</p><p>I\u2019m scared, mommy.</p><p>I don\u2019t really understand, but I think something scary is coming.</p><p></p><p>\u201CGirl.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Where did Mr. Black go?</p><p>Jester hasn\u2019t come to play today either.</p><p>Is everyone going to go away again?</p><p></p><p>\u201CGirl.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Will I be alone again?</p><p>Because I couldn\u2019t do it right.</p><p>Is everyone going to be mad at me again?</p><p></p><p>\u201CCan you hear me?\u201D</p><p></p><p>How can I do a good job?</p><p>Daddy and mommy are smiling at me.</p><p></p><p>\u201CCan\u2019t you hear me?</p><p>\u201CZheng noticed immediately . . .</p><p>\u201CBut perhaps humans change in two thousand years.\u201D</p><p></p><p>What can I do so they\u2019ll keep smiling forever and ever?</p><p>Will they stay with me?</p><p></p><p>\u201CPerhaps you don\u2019t understand my language?\u201D</p><p></p><p>I\u2019m scared.</p><p>I\u2019m scared.</p><p></p><p>\u201CHello, girl.</p><p>\u201CZaoshanghao, n\xFChai.</p><p>\u201COhay\u014D?

Hello, girl who wanders in dreams.</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>A clearly audible voice brought Tsubaki to a halt.</p><p>Have no fear; I will not harm you, nor will I be angry with you.</p><p>The voice of someone she could not see.</p><p>An ordinary girl in her situation might easily wailed in terror, but Tsubaki was strangely unafraid of the voice.</p><p>Just like when she had first met \u201CMr. Black\u201D . . . she was strangely certain that the voice was on her side.</p><p>With \u201CMr. Black\u201D\u2014Pale Rider\u2014her dormant mage instincts had told her that the Heroic Spirit was \u201Ca connected part of her.\u201D</p><p>This time, something like warmth that she sensed from the voice itself caused Tsubaki\u2019s human instincts to accept its owner as \u201Csomething she could be safe with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho are you? I\u2019m Kuruoka Tsubaki,\u201D Tsubaki asked, just as she had when she first met Pale Rider, and the \u201Cbeing\u201D with the beautiful, androgynous voice quietly explained itself.</p><p>Thank you, girl. I have no name. I had one long ago, but I lost it.</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki looked confused, not understanding what the words meant. The \u201Cowner of the voice\u201D calmly told her about itself.</p><p>I am . . . what was once called a \u201Cdeity\u201D in a certain place.</p><p>Now, however, I am merely a remnant. . . .

My daughter seems safe. She\u2019s sleeping peacefully,\u201D Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku stated, watching his daughter through the window from the courtyard.</p><p>Sigma, who had followed him back, considered the situation.</p><p>Assassin had declared that she would investigate the giant, three-headed dog and was acting independently.</p><p>Sigma had followed Tsubaki\u2019s father Y\u016Bkaku in order to obtain more information, but the all-important Tsubaki appeared to be taking an afternoon nap, and he could learn nothing definite.</p><p>In that case, why don\u2019t I try getting to the heart of the Kuruokas\u2019 magecraft? The child Tsubaki must be rooted in it.</p><p>\u201CWhat type of magecraft do you study?\u201D</p><p>The expression vanished from Kuruoka\u2019s face as he answered.</p><p>\u201CYou expect me to tell an outsider that?\u201D</p><p>It was what any mage would say.</p><p>At the Clock Tower, you could tell the direction of a mage\u2019s interests by the school they belonged to, and many announced their work to gain influence.

That practice was not limited to the world of magecraft; ordinary businesses and researchers did the same thing.</p><p>Nevertheless, Sigma deliberately pushed ahead to confirm his guess.</p><p>\u201CI want to know so that I can secure Tsubaki\u2019s safety.\u201D</p><p>He did not lie.</p><p>Sigma\u2019s current objective was to escape from this ward-world, but before being sent there, it had been to accompany Assassin and secure Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s safety.</p><p>He did not know what kind of abilities that pitch-black Servant possessed, but if it had the power to detect lies or hostility, deceiving Y\u016Bkaku could prove to be fatal.</p><p>More importantly, his question was also intended to confirm something.</p><p>Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku\u2019s eyes glazed over for a moment, then, after a few seconds, he broke into a placid smile.</p><p>\u201CI see. If it\u2019s for Tsubaki, then I guess I\u2019ve got no choice.\u201D</p><p>With that, Sigma was certain.</p><p>As I thought, this world, including the personalities of the people being controlled, exists to protect its Master. That pause must have been the time it took for the Servant controlling Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku\u2019s mind to make a decision and guide him.</p><p>And it\u2019s probably not the type to doubt what I say, as long as I don\u2019t lie.</p><p>He said that it\u2019s probably a conceptional entity related to death and disease, but . . .</p><p>As Sigma speculated about the Servant that had produced this world, he remembered Mystic Codes made with pseudo-personalities.</p><p>He had both fought them as enemies and worked alongside them to complete missions.</p><p>Among magecraft-users, the woman-shaped, liquid mercury Mystic Code used by the heir to the El-Melloi family was particularly famous. They were essentially like loyal robots that carried out their users\u2019 orders, but many were capable of more adaptive autonomous thought than current AI.</p><p>Still, this is a Servant we\u2019re talking about. Maybe I should assume it thinks more like a human than the El-Mellois\u2019 mercury Mystic Code.</p><p>. . . I pray it doesn\u2019t think like a mage.</p><p>While Sigma was lost in thought, his own face resembled that of an emotionless android.</p><p>He remained oblivious to that as he continued solemnly questioning Y\u016Bkaku.</p><p>\u201CWhat does your family\u2019s magecraft specialized for? I\u2019d like you to tell me if you\u2019re using it to perform any special treatment on Tsubaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, treatment . . . Treatment . . .? That\u2019s right. Of course I am.\u201D</p><p>The girl\u2019s father did not hesitate to admit it. He began to explain before Sigma could even ask a follow-up question.</p><p>\u201CI . . . Yes, I found a guidepost.\u201D</p><p>Ecstasy tinged Y\u016Bkaku\u2019s expression despite his brainwashed state.</p><p>His words to Sigma were charged with emotion, as if he were proud of what he had accomplished.</p><p>\u201CI couldn\u2019t beat the Makiris by being decent. Their actual bloodline is basically a swarm of insects at this point. . . . Their perfect use of insects is beautiful. . . . But my objective was symbiosis with the magecraft I use. A more natural form of symbiosis than parasitic insects. . . . I know\u2014how many bacteria do you think a human body hosts? More than several hundred different types of bacteria function alongside human cells to form an intelligent lifeform. Compared with the number of bacteria, the number of human cells is half at best.\u201D</p><p>Sigma recognized the family name Makiri.</p><p>They were a family of mages in the Far East and one of the three families that created the original Holy Grail War.</p><p>He recalled Francesca saying that they employed an efficient but heretical technique of implanting Crest Worms and other insects in their bodies and merging them with their internal organs to create pseudo-Magic Circuits.</p><p>Sigma had personally had other things implanted in him as a child, although never insects, so he decided it must be similar.</p><p>Both methods shared the fact that, from the perspective of a non-mage, they were inhumane.</p><p>The mage continued to expound his life\u2019s accomplishments, even while his listener was busy dwelling on the past.</p><p>Being a mage, he had not announced them publicly, but he must at least have the desire to show the world what he had done.</p><p>\u201CI shivered when I saw those microorganisms I collected near some ruins in South America. I never imagined any bacteria could be so mystically compatible with humans. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re a remnant of evolution that took place in the Age of Gods, or if those microorganisms have a completely different origin from normal Earth species. . . . I couldn\u2019t develop them from scratch, but I was able to modify those bacteria and adapt them to our magecraft.\u201D</p><p>It sounded as though he had mixed the magecraft of the Makiri family with peculiar microorganisms he had discovered in South America to create something that might be called a \u201Cbacterial familiar.\u201D</p><p>It could also be a virus, even smaller than bacteria, but the effect that difference would have was outside Sigma\u2019s area of expertise, so he decided to disregard it for the moment.</p><p>\u201CI caused the microorganisms I\u2019d modified using magecraft to enter a symbiotic relationship with Tsubaki\u2019s Magic Circuits. I didn\u2019t anticipate that they would spread to her brain, but Tsubaki\u2019s Magic Circuits showed major changes for a single generation. Do you realize how valuable this is in magecraft?!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . That\u2019s true.\u201D</p><p>Magic Circuits, the source of mages\u2019 power, like blood vessels for circulating magical energy, ordinarily took many generations to develop. The number of Magic Circuits a mage possessed was set in stone\u2014it was possible to open dormant circuits, but not to add more.</p><p>With the exception of methods like the Makiris\u2019 technique of implanting insects as substitute circuits.</p><p>But Kuruoka claimed that he had done it.</p><p>That\u2019s impossible.</p><p>\u201CYes, it is.\u201D</p><p>It was like Y\u016Bkaku had read Sigma\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t give her more Magic Circuits. I changed their quality and capacity. The microorganisms I created automatically awaken Magic Circuits and utilize them in the most efficient way. All to make their habitat as comfortable as possible.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs a benefit, Tsubaki is able to circulate magical energy through her body far more efficiently than someone else with the same number of Magic Circuits. Those revitalized Magic Circuits should make Tsubaki an excellent mother in the future. The actual number of Magic Circuits will probably increase dramatically in her children\u2019s generation.\u201D</p><p>Y\u016Bkaku sounded much more like a mage than when he had been speaking as a \u201Cfather\u201D earlier, but Sigma was mostly unmoved by the change.</p><p>He was a magecraft-user who had been born as a result of government experiments.</p><p>Since childhood, he had been subjected to numerous experiments with little concern for his life. He had not known about the concept of human rights until after the fall of his country.</p><p>So, when Sigma heard how Tsubaki\u2019s parents had used her as a test subject, he felt neither sympathy for her nor anger at Y\u016Bkaku.</p><p>But, although he did not feel anything, he still thought and asked more questions.</p><p>\u201CAre those bacteria in your bodies as well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but only at the trial phase. The latest version we infected Tsubaki with will only take root in infants whose organs haven\u2019t fully developed yet. It was hell to tune. We were frantic when she lost consciousness, but relieved to hear that her ability to leave descendants was intact. . . . Hmm . . . No, Tsubaki is awake now. . . . Isn\u2019t that the best we could hope for? Who cares about her children . . .? Yes, Tsubaki is perfect. . . .\u201D</p><p>Y\u016Bkaku gradually descended into muttering to himself. Sigma decided that he must be confused by the contradictions between his past actions and current mental state.</p><p>If this were the worst his confusion got, he really must not have any negative feelings about experimenting with his own child\u2019s body.</p><p>That train of thought suddenly reminded Sigma of his own parents.</p><p>He had never seen his parents\u2019 faces.</p><p>His father had never been identified, and Francesca had told him that his mother died in a distant country.</p><p>She had had a boy\u2019s body and called herself Francois then. Still, why had Francesca already known about his mother when she had only just met him?</p><p>He had asked her, but,</p><p>\u201CD-Don\u2019t get the wrong idea! Just because I was interested in your ancestry doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m interested in you! . . . Would you like it if I said that? You don\u2019t feel anything? Oh, OK then. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say about that!\u201D</p><p>Had been the only answer he got, and it made no sense to him.</p><p>Sigma, who did not know what his parents looked like, did not know how to act in front of Tsubaki, who was being raised by hers, but he was able to grasp one thing from his conversation with Y\u016Bkaku\u2014being raised by your parents did not necessarily mean a higher standard of \u201Chappiness\u201D than being raised by a government agency like he had been.</p><p>There was probably a difference in percentages, but mages were far removed from human sentiment to begin with.</p><p>When he thought what it would be like to be in Tsubaki\u2019s place, would he welcome the loss of freedom, or being treated as a \u201Cfactory\u201D for Magic Circuits, always asleep and unable to even carry out orders?</p><p>Not long before, he had reached the vague conclusion that he \u201Cdidn\u2019t think it would be much different.\u201D</p><p>In that sense, Kuruoka Tsubaki was probably similar to him, Sigma thought.</p><p>In this fake world, she might have found the \u201Csound sleep\u201D he wanted.</p><p>Defeating her Servant would mean destroying her peace.</p><p>What should I do, then?</p><p>He had no orders about this situation, and unless he escaped from this world, he would not receive any.</p><p>He remembered what Francesca had told him right before the start of the Fake Holy Grail War.</p><p>\u201COnce you\u2019ve called up a Heroic Spirit, do whatever you feel like.\u201D</p><p>Whatever I feel like, huh?</p><p>Cut off from Francesca and Faldeus and forced to think and act on his own, Sigma stared at his hands as he began to seriously consider the question.</p><p>At that moment, there was nothing he could do but think.</p><p></p><p>What should I do?</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>While Sigma was busy questioning himself, Assassin activated one of her Noble Phantasms.</p><p>\u201CSink into a dark prison . . . Meditative Sensitivity: Zabaniya.\u201D</p><p>A perception-type Noble Phantasm that attuned her to the surrounding space as if she were the world\u2019s shadow and sensed nearby currents of magical energy and wind.</p><p>Using those currents, she attempted to locate either the \u201Cgiant black shadow\u201D that seemed to be controlling the giant, three-headed dog, or the hematophage who must be connected to this world.</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>What she found, however, was a different current of magical energy.</p><p>It was giving off a strange current, as if to disturb the balance of magical energy throughout the entire city.</p><p>It was an infinitesimal current. Without her Noble Phantasm, she would not have been able to detect it.</p><p>Is this . . . magical energy leaking out?</p><p>No, leaking in? Or is it . . .</p><p>The flow was like the whole world was breathing magical energy through that one airhole.</p><p>She paused briefly, wondering whether to pursue the giant, three-headed dog, but ultimately decided to follow fluctuation of magical energy.</p><p>She thought that where it led was simply too symbolic and might even offer a hint to escape that world.</p><p></p><p>She headed toward the source of the strange current of magical energy in that balanced world.</p><p>Toward the top of Crystal Hill.</p><h2 id="chapter-19-as-dream-and-reality-are-both-illusion-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-19-as-dream-and-reality-are-both-illusion-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 19: As Dream and Reality are Both Illusion II</h2><hr><p>Ayaka Sajou</p><p></p><p>Why had she visited this city just as the \u201CFake Holy Grail War\u201D began?</p><p>That was something . . . that even she did not know for certain.</p><p>While wandering around her hometown of Fuyuki, she had stumbled into a castle-like building in the forest.</p><p>There, she had been captured by a beautiful, white-haired woman, and something had been done to her.</p><p>Looking back on it, she thought it must have been some kind of mind-control magecraft, but Ayaka did not know much about magecraft and was not sure of the specifics.</p><p>The next thing she knew, however, she had been put on a ship to the United States with only the order to \u201Cparticipate in the American Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><p>She was not sure why she had had to go by ship, but considering she had no passport, she had almost certainly entered the country illegally.</p><p>She had actually been given a fake passport and visa on the ship but had never gone through customs.</p><p>Her memories of the voyage were also hazy. Before she knew it, she had been able to speak English.

We are living men who will one day meet our deaths as we walk the righteous path! You may judge me, a Heroic Spirit, to be a soul escaped from death if you will!

He was showing a different side of himself than when he had discussed whether to kill a little girl or when he had sworn to protect Ayaka.</p><p>If she had to compare it to something, it was closer to when he had given his speech on top of the police car, but the fact that he was giving a speech in such a dangerous situation and to a titanic beast that might not even understand words set it apart.</p><p>Despite that, Saber\u2019s attitude was so dignified that it almost forced Ayaka and the police officers to believe that it was the only proper thing to do.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Kerberos stared suspiciously at Saber and slowly brought its faces closer to him.</p><p>\u201CHey, it stopped attacking.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t tell me it really understands language . . .\u201D</p><p>John and the other officers muttered to each other as they watched the situation play out.

I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki was confused by the words. The \u201Cvoice\u201D fell silent for a moment, seemingly troubled by her lack of comprehension, before continuing.</p><p>\u201COh, pardon me. . . . I\u2019m in a fix. Would you help me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHelp you how?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet\u2019s play hide and seek! If you find me, you win. OK?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHide and seek!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll right. One, two, three, four . . . I\u2019m ready now. If you find me, I\u2019ll give you sweet, sweet syrup, all right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C! . . . OK!\u201D</p><p>From a normal perspective, it sounded like nothing so much as a shady kidnapper.</p><p>Tsubaki might not know much of life, but even she would normally have been frightened and gone to call her parents. For some reason, however, she obeyed the \u201Cvoice.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki still felt certain that the voice was a \u201Cfriend.\u201D</p><p>It was a gentle voice that enveloped her.</p><p>Almost like the voices of her parents that she had been longing for all this time.</p><p></p><p>Tsubaki walked around the house as she was guided and ended up standing in front of a wall.</p><p>\u201C? But you sound like you\u2019re over this way . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki perceived the \u201Cpresence\u201D of the voice\u2019s owner by mistakenly believing that she could hear the voice coming from its direction. She came to a stop there, confused, when . . .</p><p>\u201CYes, it\u2019s fine. . . . Try asking the wall to let you through.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Umm . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. Your mommy and daddy can use magecraft, can\u2019t they? You can use it to.\u201D</p><p>\u201C! Yeah!\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki gave a firm nod, then faced the \u201Cwall\u201D and made a wish.</p><p>\u201CUmm . . . Please, open sesame!\u201D</p><p>She shouted words from a folk tale from a far-away land that she had read in the past few days.</p><p>Then, Tsubaki felt her whole body grow hot.</p><p>It ran along her back\u2014right where she had felt intense pain a long time ago, when her parents had done something that they called an \u201Cexperiment\u201D with her. Tsubaki was surprised for a moment, but there was no pain, just a warmth like gentle sunshine that coursed silently through her body.</p><p>Magical energy began flowing out of Tsubaki and into the wall without her even realizing that the feeling was her Magic Circuits responding.</p><p>The next instant, the wall squirmed like a living thing and spread open, revealing a staircase down into the house\u2019s basement.</p><p>\u201CWow. . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki\u2019s eyes sparkled at the mysterious scene before her.</p><p>\u201CNow, do you think you can find me, princess?\u201D</p><p>Guided again by the voice, Tsubaki slowly began to descend the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Then, after passing through several more wards, all of which were automatically lifted in the same way, she found . . . a mage\u2019s workshop decorated with numerous books and Mystic Codes and a variety of experimental apparatus.</p><p>\u201CAh . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki shivered with surprise.</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>She remembered this place.</p><p></p><p>This place is . . .</p><p></p><p>Deep inside this room was where she had always gone to \u201Chelp out.\u201D</p><p></p><p>No. No.</p><p></p><p>To \u201Chelp out\u201D with her mother and father\u2019s \u201Cexperiments.\u201D</p><p>The memory of pain raced through her brain again.</p><p></p><p>\u201CEee . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>I have to hold it in.</p><p>I have to be a good girl. I have to hold it in . . . or Mom and Dad won\u2019t smile at me.</p><p></p><p>It was like a backlash.</p><p>For the past few days, she had experienced the \u201Chappy times\u201D that she had childishly continued to dream of.</p><p>The pain that the young girl had only been able to forget because of those joyful experiences came back to her.</p><p>Tsubaki\u2019s negative memories and emotions flooded out like a dam had burst and her eyes filled with tears, when . . .</p><p>\u201CHi.\u201D</p><p>A voice.</p><p>A voice sounded in the room where she was on the verge of being consumed by her past trauma.</p><p>It was just one word.</p><p>But that one word was enough to make the fear welling up out of Tsubaki\u2019s heart dissipate like mist.</p><p>It was the voice that, until just then, Tsubaki had only heard in her mind.</p><p>But now it was different.</p><p>The clear voice definitely making the air in the room vibrate.</p><p>\u201CIt looks like you found me. Here, have some candy syrup.\u201D</p><p>The graceful hand stretched out to Tsubaki held something like honey stored in a bivalve shell.</p><p>The owner of the hand was . . . a beautiful being.</p><p>They had an androgynous appearance and Tsubaki could not tell if they were a man or a woman.</p><p>If she had seen Enkidu, she might have gotten a similar impression.</p><p>Unlike the plainly dressed Enkidu, however, this being was shrouded in an aura of opulence produced by their distinctive makeup and glamorous red clothing. The moment Tsubaki laid eyes on them, she wondered if they were the king or queen of some foreign country.</p><p>\u201CUh, umm . . . Are you an important person?\u201D Tsubaki could not help asking in the face of the dazzling being who was so out of place in that room.</p><p>\u201CNot quite,\u201D the beauty answered. \u201CI was important a long time ago, and I\u2019m not a person, either. You see, I was in a place divorced from questions of social status and . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I started talking about difficult subjects again. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been two millennia and a few centuries since I spoke with a human, you see. Actually, I\u2019m something like an echo, so that\u2019s not strictly true. . . . Oh, I said something you probably can\u2019t understand again! Things like this are why I could never get along with humans and ended up being driven both from dreams and from the water and ebbing away . . .!\u201D</p><p>The beauty made a show of collapsing in a corner weeping.</p><p>\u201CU-Umm, are you OK?\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki forgot her fear and rushed to the beauty and patted their back.</p><p>\u201CThank you, human child. You\u2019re kind.\u201D</p><p>The beauty regained their composure and steadied their breathing as they addressed Tsubaki.</p><p>\u201COh, but you needn\u2019t be so concerned. I can only speak with you for a short time. Still, it\u2019s only you, the ruler of this world, with whom I can make a connection. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s a \u2018ruler of this world\u2019?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s . . . something like the main character of a fairy tale. . . . Oh, this won\u2019t do. The clumps of \u2018death\u2019 are becoming active. . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki stared worriedly at the beauty\u2019s look of anguish as she continued to stroke their back.</p><p>The beauty forced themselves to smile at the young girl as they pointed to a section of the room.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. You just need to get that thing.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki saw what their finger was pointing at and looked confused.</p><p>Tsubaki could not tell what it was for.</p><p>She thought it looked a lot like the \u201Cbows\u201D that people used in picture books.</p><p>It had a more complicated shape, though. She thought that the hunter who beat the wolf at the end of her picture book of Little Red Riding Hood might have had one.</p><p>\u201CThat thing there is called the God-Felling Crossbow. It\u2019s a scary, scary weapon that belonged to a whimsical human who was a very important king a long time ago. . . . Actually, he was the first one to call himself a king among kings, an \u2018emperor.\u2019\u201D</p><p>\u201CA weapon. . . . Did he beat bad guys with it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m the one he beat with it . . . but I suppose he did, according to the values of humans at the time.\u201D</p><p>The beauty answered, sounding embarrassed and looking away from Tsubaki, who was staring bright-eyed at the crossbow.</p><p>\u201CWell, that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D they continued, as if to gloss over the point. \u201CAs long as you keep it with you, I\u2019ll be able to help you for the brief time until I disappear. I just want to know what\u2019s happening. If you bring me outside, I\u2019ll grant you a wish as thanks.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . OK!\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki did not understand what everything they had said meant, but she did understand that a strange person who made her feel safe, like family, was saying that they would grant her wish.</p><p>Memories of picture books like Cinderella danced through Tsubaki\u2019s head as she innocently tried to lift the crossbow . . . but it was heavier than it looked, and she staggered and fell on her bottom.</p><p>\u201COh, that was a close one! You\u2019re not hurt, are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . No,\u201D Tsubaki answered with a little difficulty.</p><p>She tried to stagger to her feet, but Tsubaki was small even for her age, and it looked like it was all she could do just to drag the crossbow behind her.</p><p>\u201CYou can\u2019t walk carrying it . . .? Ugh . . . I hadn\u2019t counted on how weak humans are. . . . Damn Zheng! He piled on too many Mystic Codes and decorations to shoot me! This is clearly overkill! Between this, the Great Wall, and the Epang Palace he was building, did he think everything needed to be big and showy? Honestly . . .\u201D</p><p>The beauty was lambasting someone or other when they suddenly seemed to get an idea.</p><p>\u201CWait. In this world, you\u2019re the \u2018ruler\u2019 . . . so if you believe it\u2019s light, you should be able to carry it easily. . . . But still, does this girl not realize she\u2019s in a dream yet . . .?\u201D</p><p>The beauty kept their last words to a whisper so that Tsubaki would not hear them.</p><p>\u201CI know, you should call someone to help you. It can be your father or mother. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help you if you ask them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you sure . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLook, someone\u2019s here. Try asking them,\u201D the beauty proposed, hearing footsteps from the direction of the stairs.</p><p>\u201COK. . . . Ah.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki expected her mother or father, who had been very nice to her for the past few days, and was ready to ask them . . . but the person who appeared on the stairs was neither of her parents.</p><p></p><p>\u201CSo, this is where you were. . . . Is this your family\u2019s workshop . . .?\u201D</p><p>The mercenary dressed all in black, Sigma, first caught sight of Tsubaki . . .</p><p>\u201C. . .! Who are you?\u201D</p><p>And then noticed the beauty behind her and assumed a defensive posture and watched to see if they were hostile. After seeing their magnificent red outfit, however, he doubtfully muttered:</p><p></p><p>\u201CThe inquisition . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The City in the Ward, Crystal Hill, Top Floor</p><p></p><p>\u201COh, hello, Professor! It\u2019s me! You know, me!\u201D</p><p>\u201CFlat?! This response is . . . What\u2019s going on?! Where are you calling from?!\u201D</p><p>A cell phone rested atop a makeshift \u201Caltar.\u201D</p><p>It was on speaker mode, and a man\u2019s voice, in tones of mingled relief and confusion, emanated from it.</p><p>\u201COh, sir! Sorry I took so long to call you. I\u2019m, umm, not really sure. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m in a dream, or . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . What? Don\u2019t tell me you actually overslept and forgot to call me?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat?! No! What do you mean?! That\u2019s not what I meant! I meant I\u2019m, umm, in a ward. Yes, I\u2019m inside a ward! It\u2019s kind of like the \u2018repeat of the past\u2019 you and Gray got trapped inside in that cemetery in Wales, only this one is a \u2018repeat of the present.\u2019 . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .? Wait, hold on a moment! Calm down and explain the situation from the beginning.\u201D</p><p>Flat broke into a delighted grin when he heard the voice of the man\u2014Lord El-Melloi II\u2014return to the normal tone he used to reprimand students.</p><p>He smiled because he knew that despite the situation\u2014or because of the situation\u2014he would be able to hear an El-Melloi School \u201Clecture\u201D in top form.</p><p>He also smiled because he had faith that the lecture would lead to a way out of his current predicament.</p><p>Of course, whether Flat could make that way succeed or not would depend on him.</p><p></p><p>Once he had heard the whole story, the Lord of the Clock Tower made an enigmatic pronouncement.</p><p>\u201CMost likely . . . an underworld.\u201D</p><p>Flat was visibly confused by El-Melloi II\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201CH-Hang on, sir! Wouldn\u2019t that mean we\u2019re already dead?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CBe quiet for a moment, Flat. And . . . may I take it that you will be cooperative with regard to escaping, overseer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, although I won\u2019t interfere in factional conflicts. Besides, the Holy Church owes you a few favors. You saved Sister Illumia, who I seem to be stuck with, and . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, if we\u2019re talking about personal debts, I was also saved by Father Karabo. But it would be unbecoming of both of us to discuss those as obligations between our organizations. In this case, I will be satisfied if you assist my student in your capacity as overseer. I have no intention of asking you to put yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201D</p><p>Hansa answered with a wry smile and a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201CFlat, the rumors about your teacher were right\u2014he doesn\u2019t act much like a mage. I can\u2019t believe he survived in that den of demons you call the Clock Tower acting like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I was simply blessed with good fortune and connections. I don\u2019t need anyone to tell me how lacking my own powers are.\u201D</p><p>\u201CExcuse me, I didn\u2019t mean to insult you. That was a compliment. That attitude of yours is probably what convinced some of my colleagues and predecessors to lend you a hand. A debt is a debt, even if you try to deny it. I\u2019ll pay back what I can on my own. If you ever turn into a hematophage, I\u2019ll try to look the other way as long as you don\u2019t do any harm.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I see you\u2019re a bit atypical for a priest of the Holy Church yourself. Although of course, I have neither the inclination nor the ability to become a hematophage,\u201D El-Melloi II answered in apparent exasperation before resuming his explanation.</p><p>\u201CWhen I said \u2018underworld,\u2019 I of course did not mean that you really died. I was describing the nature of the area within that ward.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean? It doesn\u2019t seem much like hell or heaven to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m well aware that you didn\u2019t pay attention in class, Flat. Now, get rid of those commonplace preconceptions. Remember that this is partly guesswork, but I believe that area has its origins in the Magic Circuits and mind of the girl Kuruoka Tsubaki. If the demonic\u2014or possibly divine\u2014beast that Father Cervantes saw at a distance, that Kerberos, was invigorated in that world, then it probably has the \u2018nature\u2019 of an underworld.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou mean, they match each other?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhen Flat said it was like he was \u2018in a dream,\u2019 he hit the nail on the head. There are also cases in which dreams are perceived as an afterlife, in a mystical sense. The Servant of the comatose girl Kuruoka Tsubaki created a pseudo-underworld using her dreams as a catalyst. . . . There are other conceivable explanations, of course, but adding the information I\u2019ve gathered to what you told me, I think it\u2019s fair to say that that\u2019s the most likely.\u201D</p><p>At that point, Hansa, who had kept silent thus far, asked a question.</p><p>\u201CHmm . . . Given my position, I can\u2019t discuss the plurality of \u2018afterlives\u2019 . . . but do you mean that this is an underworld that mirrors the real city?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere are any number of underworlds that resemble the living world. In fact, the tombs of pharaohs, emperors, and the like are themselves rituals to carry a city with them to the underworld. There are numerous accounts of people who saw their ancestors engaged in an identical way of life in identical locations after death. And the fact the creator of this ward-world made it an exact duplicate of the place inhabited by the living suggests that it is an extremely systematic entity, even for a Servant. The fact that it took Kerberos into that world suggests that it may be continuing to evolve as we speak.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEvolve? What do you mean, sir?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat Heroic Spirit is likely the concept of death itself. An embodiment of the underworld. A deity of the underworld such as Hades, Hel, Nergal, or Ereshkigal . . . No, it\u2019s not possible to summon a Spirit Origin of that caliber . . . or it shouldn\u2019t be. Besides, the ruler of an underworld would make that ward-world more closely resemble their own domain. It\u2019s probably something less tied to an underworld . . . and closer to the concept of death itself.\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II then proceeded to dissect the ward-world he had never seen as smoothly as if he were reading a predetermined conclusion off a blackboard.</p><p>\u201CThat Servant\u2019s personality has likely continued to learn since the moment it was summoned by adapting to its Master Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s reactions. It\u2019s possible that it could become a completely different entity each time it\u2019s summoned. Given that the summoning of a Ghost-Liner is already a rare event, however, we have no basis for comparison. But now that you have entered its world as new, foreign entities, it may display a different type of learning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut why aren\u2019t we brainwashed, sir?\u201D Flat interjected.</p><p>They had passed people in an apparently brainwashed state on their way to that building.</p><p>Both Flat and Hansa had been wary of them and prepared defensive measures, but there was as yet no sign of a brainwashing spell being directed at them.</p><p>\u201CThere must be some difference. There are so many different methods of brainwashing that it\u2019s impossible to guess, but we can narrow it down by focusing on the question of why it doesn\u2019t brainwash you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes! A whydunit, right?! It\u2019s your catchphrase!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, a \u2018whydunit,\u2019 huh? True, we already know \u2018whodunit,\u2019 and as long as magecraft is involved, \u2018howdunit\u2019 is pointless. Still, if that\u2019s your catchphrase, you sound like more of a detective than a mage.\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II stammered for a moment at Hansa\u2019s remark, then coughed and continued:</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t. I\u2019m simply using the knowledge I\u2019ve acquired for analysis. If I had a detective\u2019s insight or inspiration, my life would be rather different. . . . In any case, I believe that the reason you haven\u2019t been brainwashed lies in the reason you were taken into that world.\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II proceeded to highlight the phenomenon of people who left the city returning while behaving strangely, the mysterious disease infecting animals, and other strange occurrences.</p><p>According to information from Flue, a mage of his acquaintance, while there were individual differences, there were cases of symptoms resembling internal bleeding among both humans and animals.</p><p>Based on that information, El-Melloi II theorized that there was \u201Ca distinction between those infected with a disease-like curse, who had only their minds brought to that world, and those who were dragged into it by force, body and all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s highly probable that the latter is the result of treating you as enemies. The former also appears to be a hostile act . . . but those affected suffer no physical harm, and there\u2019s no indication that it\u2019s using them in the Grail War. It\u2019s probable that it\u2019s simply using unusual means and has no hostile intent.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you see that all the time at the Clock Tower. People who think they\u2019re doing the right thing when, from everyone else\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s just a huge nuisance.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019d like to yell that you\u2019re one to talk, but I\u2019ll refrain for the time being. In any case, there are several conceivable ways to exit that world . . . but I suppose waiting for it to run out of magical energy isn\u2019t realistic. Judging from the circumstances, defeating the Servant and Master should be the quickest option. But given that you\u2019ve formed an alliance with the police to take the girl Master under your protection, you can\u2019t do anything that would endanger her.\u201D</p><p>Even if there weren\u2019t an alliance, wouldn\u2019t he have found some excuse to eliminate that option? Both Jack and Hansa wondered. Even if they tried to point that out, however, they felt certain that El-Melloi II would just dodge the question, so they simply shrugged and continued to listen. Half of the nuns, on the other hand, were wondering, far more logically than El-Melloi II, why they didn\u2019t just eliminate the Master.</p><p>\u201CNegotiating with the girl Tsubaki without harming her and convincing her to open a way out for you herself . . . is a possibility, but the question is whether she\u2019s even aware that she\u2019s a Master. If you use suggestion or other means to force her, her Servant may perceive it as a hostile act and make a more active attempt to eliminate you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShould we negotiate with the Servant, then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI already told you\u2014it\u2019s mostly likely closer to a system than a being with a distinct personality. Whatever it is, it would be best to avoid making contact with it before we can be certain of the result. That also applies to combat, of course. You got a good look at how frightening that Servant can be last night.\u201D</p><p>After reminding them not to be reckless, El-Melloi II was far more wary of the being that controlled the space Flat and the others currently occupied than anyone actually present.</p><p>He had, after all, accompanied the Heroic Spirit who had once fought alongside him into his Reality Marble, and the awesome sight was seared into his memory.</p><p>\u201CIf that world corresponds to the underworld and the Servant is something associated with it, then you have nowhere to run, at least within that ward. Death is everywhere, not just in the land of the dead. Mystically speaking, the concept of death exists even in air, water, stone, and earth. That room is no exception.\u201D</p><p>Once he had finished that grave pronouncement, El-Melloi II drove his point home by urging Flat and the others to be cautious.</p><p>\u201CIn other words, that place has always been inside the Heroic Spirit\u2019s body. You\u2019re like Pinocchio swallowed by the whale.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn a whale\u2019s belly, huh? That\u2019s great!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s \u2018great\u2019 about it?!\u201D</p><p>Flat\u2019s wild remark drew a shout from El-Melloi II, but Flat continued, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>\u201CDidn\u2019t you tell us in class that a hero\u2019s return from certain death is a kind of return to the womb? And about the ritual themed around death and rebirth that everyone goes through when they reach the rank of Pride. And about someone who got eaten by a giant fish then spit out and awakened to faith and became superhero and saved a city . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t tell me you mean the prophet Jonah and Leviathan. It\u2019s true that heroic tales such as giant fishes, labyrinths, and the land of the dead have frequently been linked to return to the womb . . . but I hope you don\u2019t plan to turn in a report with that sloppy understanding! Oh well, your supplemental lecture on that can wait.\u201D</p><p>The exasperated El-Melloi II changed the topic to concrete examples of escape.</p><p>\u201CThe fact that the room you\u2019re in is linked to the outside probably means that there\u2019s something that harmonizes well with that world in the same location in reality. The most likely possibility is a corpse, but I doubt the influence of an ordinary corpse would extend inside the ward. It must be a corpse under some kind of mystical influence . . . or else the conditions must be right to make it harmonize better with the Servant that\u2019s creating this world. You said that room looks like a workshop. What are its characteristics?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, there are a lot of decorations and things that look Mesopotamian.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .! I see. If that workshop does belong to that Heroic Spirit\u2019s faction, then asking the chief of police to go there for us would be asking him to go to his death. . . . In that case, we should investigate the Heroic Spirit\u2019s characteristics from within. I don\u2019t like using them as decoys, but if you\u2019re right that a hero from another faction is doing battle with Kerberos in the city, then I suggest you take the opportunity to visit the girl\u2019s hospital room or the home of the mages called Kuruo\u2014\u201D</p><p>When the voice from the speaker reached that point, one of the nuns keeping watch in all directions shouted:</p><p>\u201CHansa!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomething\u2019s climbing from below! I think it\u2019s a Servant!\u201D</p><p></p><p>An instant later . . .</p><p>One of the glass walls shattered into tiny fragments and a figure stole into the room from outside.</p><p></p><p>\u201CUwawah?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it, Flat?! What happened?!\u201D</p><p>A frantic shout came from the speaker.</p><p>Hansa neatly cleared away the flying shards of window glass by striking with his arms at high speed, then addressed the figure that had appeared through the window.</p><p>\u201CWhoa there. . . . So, you ended up here too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI saw you in the guardhouse. . . . Are you a foreign priest?\u201D</p><p>The newly arrived Assassin shot a glance at Hansa, then surveyed her surroundings as if to say that she would deal with him later before focusing on Flat, who had what looked like Command Spells on his right hand.</p><p>\u201CI ask you.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, um, hi! Oh, are you a Servant, by any chance? Wow!\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre you another of the mages who seek the Holy Grail . . .?\u201D</p><p>The question puzzled Flat for a moment. He pondered briefly before answering.</p><p>\u201CHmm. I\u2019m not sure. At first, I wanted it because it was cool, but now . . . my Servant is in trouble, so I guess it would be nice if I could use the Grail to fix that. I wonder what I should do in the end. It\u2019s supposed to be valuable, so do you think I should donate it to a museum or something?\u201D</p><p>Getting a question for an answer, Assassin narrowed her eyes and scrutinized Flat.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>He did not look like he was lying or trying to provoke her.</p><p>It was difficult to believe, but he appeared to be genuinely wondering if he ought to donate the Grail to a museum.</p><p>\u201CAre you . . . a mage?\u201D</p><p>Assassin glared at Flat for a short while with an expression that said she could not decide if she ought to eliminate him.</p><p>As if to help Flat out of that predicament, Hansa loudly clapped his hands and drew her attention to him.</p><p>\u201CI believe you seek the way of another faith than mine. I\u2019m here to oversee this Holy Grail War, but it doesn\u2019t look like they have any intention of fighting it. Not until we make it out of this ward-world, at least. I told you that to mediate in my role as overseer, but of course that doesn\u2019t limit your actions,\u201D Hansa said with a shrug.</p><p>If Assassin seriously came after him with the intent to kill, then he was probably doomed. He could take on hematophages due to affinity. Against a martial Heroic Spirit, however, he would be the one at a disadvantage.</p><p>Nevertheless, he made no move to shrink or hide. He boldly addressed Assassin in order to carry out the orders of the master who had been like a father to him and do his duty as overseer.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin eyed Hansa warily, but not with enmity.</p><p>Fortunately for Flat and Hansa, she currently felt indebted due to having manifested using the magical energy of an \u201Cevil fiend\u201D and had made a pact with someone who was not one of her brethren\u2014with \u201CThe Lionheart\u201D of all people. Those circumstances must have made her view others with greater tolerance than she had had on the first day.</p><p>Even so, there was a line that she was unwilling to cross.</p><p>\u201C. . . One question: How do you plan to open a way to the outside?\u201D</p><p>Her question was posed in a solemn tone.</p><p>Even flat sensed that this was \u201Cone of those questions that raises a death flag if you get it wrong.\u201D He hesitated to answer for a moment . . .</p><p>But the answer came from the phone on the altar, which had been left on speaker mode.</p><p>\u201CWe had just agreed on a policy of avoiding violence as much as possible. If you want to escape even if it means harming a young girl, we have no means of stopping you, but allow me to explain that there is another way.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Who are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomething like that boy\u2019s guardian. I realize that it\u2019s selfish of me to ask you to believe what I say when I\u2019m not there myself, but . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin considered for a while, then, still somewhat warily, asked:</p><p>\u201CIf there is a way for her life to be saved, then that is the Lord\u2019s will. I will at least hear you out.\u201D</p><p>Flat and Berserker, who was in his wristwatch form, were relieved to see that Assassin was willing to listen.</p><p>But as if to smash that atmosphere, a young voice wafted into the room on the mild breeze.</p><p></p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s hopeless, Miss.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>They all turned to face the voice.</p><p>They saw a cloud of smoke, like a black mist. It soon began taking the shape of a human figure as a variety of colors emerged from it.</p><p>\u201CThat \u2018way\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist in this world that little Tsubaki made.\u201D</p><p>It was the slight form of a young boy.</p><p>The sinister magical energy that surrounded his body, however, showed that he was not what he seemed.</p><p>When Hansa saw that, he affectedly clicked his tongue and then raised the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201CWhat have we here? Are you sure you don\u2019t want to hide your magical energy, like you did at the hotel? You must be confident to come here in person and spoil your trick.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI had a feeling I was being watched earlier. I won\u2019t let down my guard with you, executor. I doubt the same trick would work twice. Besides . . .\u201D</p><p>The boy stifled a sinister chuckle and shifted his gaze to Assassin before continuing with a look of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201CI want to see all sorts of looks on Miss Assassin\u2019s face as soon as possible. . . . See?\u201D</p><p>By the time he said that, Assassin was already in motion.</p><p>One look at his expression and the magical energy that surrounded him told her that he was the hematophage who had summoned her\u2014Jester Karture.</p><p>Her black cloak glided around the ground. A knife-hand shot out of its folds, aimed at the boy\u2019s neck.</p><p>But while her blade-like fingertips did indeed pierce Jester\u2019s body, she could feel no resistance.</p><p>\u201C?!\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s body dissolved into mist and reformed a short distance away.</p><p>When it reformed, however, it was no longer the boy, but the young man hematophage who had appeared at the police station and in front of the hospital.</p><p>\u201CHahaha! Did you really think I\u2019d come to meet my enemies in person like a simpleton? You\u2019re adorable, Assassin. Of course, I did want to come myself! You\u2019re correct! You might even say our hearts are in sync. I\u2019m sorry to let you down, my dear Assassin! But can\u2019t you understand that heartache it cost me to send a false body to see you?\u201D</p><p>Jester continued to ramble narcissistically with a mixture of ecstasy and sorrow.</p><p>Hansa guessed that it was not just provocation\u2014he probably meant it. From behind him, the concerned voice of El-Melloi II sounded over the phone.</p><p>\u201COi, Flat, what am I hearing right now?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not really sure . . . but I think it\u2019s a confession of love!\u201D</p><p>Jester did not seem to hear the banter between teacher and student. He kept his attention fixed on Assassin as he excitedly spread his arms wide with the broken window behind him.</p><p>Jester bowed deeply with the air of a conductor greeting his audience before a performance. Just then . . .</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the world twisted.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off World, Central Intersection</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat happened?!\u201D</p><p></p><p>Surrounded on all sides by Kerberos and black grotesqueries, Saber and the police officers found themselves locked in a stalemate.</p><p>They had been holding the line against the beasts that repeated what sounded like an eerie chant, now advancing, now retreating. Ever since Saber had asked his questions, however, the things had stopped actively attacking them and shifted to preventing them from leaving the intersection.</p><p>But less than a minute earlier, that situation had changed.</p><p>It was not just their circumstances\u2014the whole world seemed to be starting to transform.</p><p>Hordes of rats burst out of every nook and cranny in the brand-new concrete cityscape, and what looked like clouds of black dust became visible in the gusts of wind between the tall buildings.</p><p>Murders of crows flew around the area. Symbols of death were overtaking not just the intersection, but the entire cityscape.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic beasts\u2019 attacks intensified . . . and the groups of words chanted out of every shadow in the city was becoming a deafening roar in Ayaka and the other\u2019s ears.</p><p>It was as if that whole world were screaming in pain.</p><p>Or as if it were a newborn letting out its first cry.</p><p></p><p>\u201CThis is\u201D \u201Cthe path of death.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe underworld.\u201D \u201CThe road to Hades.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIts judgment,\u201D \u201CIts gospel,\u201D</p><p>\u201Cis eternal peace.\u201D \u201Cis suffering.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off World, in the Sky</p><p></p><p>The ward-world linked to Kuruoka Tsubaki.</p><p>It was a closed-off, limited space on the scale of a city. Even its sky had a boundary.</p><p>The blue of its sky was merely the real world projected on the border of the ward. Anyone on the ground who attempted to escape in an airplane or helicopter should have been turned around by the same distorted space that stopped anyone who tried to leave the city on foot.</p><p>But that \u201Csky\u201D was being silently invaded.</p><p>Like a stain spreading on the ceiling of an old house with a leaky roof, that \u201Cabnormality\u201D continued to spread slowly but steadily.</p><p>Soon, a section of sky was cut away . . . and a man and woman emerged from it hand in hand.</p><p>They immediately entered freefall.</p><p>\u201COh! Were we a smidgen late? Hurry up!\u201D</p><p>\u201CTrue, true! It looks like the party\u2019s already underway!\u201D</p><p>The two new figures\u2014the True Caster faction, Francesca and Francois\u2014were clasping each other\u2019s hands like lovers as they continued to plummet upside down.</p><p>Before their eyes was a Snowfield recreated like a mirror image.</p><p>But that world was already in the process of becoming completely detached from Snowfield.</p><p>Beginning in the city center, it was gradually losing its color, and a jet-black darkness was beginning to spread across it.</p><p>Black shadows that rose from the ground became black clouds that began to cover the city.</p><p>The two Prelatis continued to laugh with delight as they plunged into the midst of the rising jet-black cumulonimbus clouds.</p><p>As they laughed within the cloudbank, instead of thunder, they heard the cries of the ward-world itself.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FrBIB8U.png" alt=""></p><p>\u201CBe at peace.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSuffer torments.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith the road to Hades in my thrall.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI shall defend my master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDeliver it to my master.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo my friend.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t it wonderful?! This sounds like a world worth tricking!\u201D Francesca shouted amid the clouds, her eyes blazing.</p><p>Before long, the pair\u2019s fall abruptly slowed until at last they were floating lightly in midair.</p><p>Using the highest caliber of illusion wielded by Heroic Spirits, they had performed the nearly rule-breaking feat of fooling the world\u2019s physical laws.</p><p>\u201CAhaha! Fooling this world\u2019s a piece of cake! I knew it must be built on a dream!\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you\u2019d better not get careless,\u201D Francesca answered Prelati with a smirking word of warning. \u201CIf it\u2019s based on a dream, then that means it can turn into anything depending on the girl who\u2019s having it.\u201D</p><p>They burst out of the clouds, and Francesca laughed with the face of a child looking forward to an event as she looked down on the night-dark world below.</p><p>\u201CI hope the Lionheart\u2019s still alive and kicking! That big King Arthur fanboy!\u201D</p><p>The pair spoke their last lines in perfect unison.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWill you just despair, or will rage consume you? . . .

Flat\u2019s eyes sparkled as he kept up a shouted conversation with the wristwatch and the cellphone. Hansa directed the nuns into formation with gestures as he grimly muttered:</p><p></p><p>\u201CThe way it talks . . . I can\u2019t believe it, but . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>Given his position, Hansa could not help but think of a certain passage from The Book of Revelation.</p><p>He also considered that it might be a historical person associated with a similar anecdote, but what El-Melloi II had just said about \u201Cconcepts\u201D flashed through his brain, and he arrived at a guess.</p><p>\u201CAn embodiment of death . . . Could it be the Pale Rider, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>Assassin, meanwhile, shouted at Jester\u2019s double, who continued to laugh happily.</p><p>\u201CWhat did you do . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Oh, this isn\u2019t something I did. You must realize by now. I didn\u2019t create this world. Therefore, the one responsible for this beautiful transformation must be . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not asking about that!\u201D</p><p>Assassin already knew what Jester was getting at.</p><p>The fact that he was there naturally meant that he understood and wanted to provoke her.</p><p>Even knowing that it was provocation, however, Assassin could not help directing her rage at him.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat did you do to that girl?!\u201D</p><p></p><p>At the sound of her angry roar, Jester touched one hand to his chest and made a respectful bow, his eyes brimming with desire.</p><p>\u201COh, thank you. . . . I am truly, truly delighted! Your emotions, your true feelings as a human being, were in that cry. It doesn\u2019t matter that it was hatred. Right now, beyond a doubt, you are looking at me. You seem to be glancing at Kuruoka Tsubaki, but I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t last much longer.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m asking you what you did!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing much,\u201D Jester told Assassin with an unpleasant curl of his lips.</p><p>He delivered his answer with all the emotion of a declaration of love. All the while, he watched her every movement.</p><p>\u201CI just gave her a little encouragement.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CTo help her chase grand dreams, like a child should.\u201D</p><h2 id="interlude-a-beauty-and-the-sea-a-girl-and-a-mercenary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interlude-a-beauty-and-the-sea-a-girl-and-a-mercenary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interlude: A Beauty and the Sea; A Girl and a Mercenary</h2><hr><p>Ten Minutes Earlier, A Closed-off Town, The Kuruoka Residence</p><p></p><p>Sigma was perplexed.</p><p>He had gone to find Tsubaki, hoping to speak with her before taking action. It appeared that she had woken up from her nap, however, because she was gone from the living room.</p><p>Sigma had been searching the first floor while her father Y\u016Bkaku went to search the second . . . when he spotted a mystically concealed door left open and went through it.</p><p>As a result, he caught sight of Tsubaki in the underground workshop, but there was a strange being in the room with her.</p><p>A being dressed in a red costume that was clearly out of place in the present-day United States.</p><p>\u201C. . . The inquisition?\u201D</p><p>He wondered if this could be the true form of \u201CMr. Black,\u201D but the impression it made could not have been more different, so ended up saying the first word its red appearance brought to his mind.</p><p>Once he had said it, Sigma was reminded of the face of one of his childhood fellows.</p><p>Lambda.</p><p>Sigma remembered that he had seen that comedy film that dealt with the inquisition after killing Lambda, who had called him \u201Cbest friend.\u201D He ran his hand over the Mystic Code on his right hip, feeling uneasy, as if there were sand in his heart.</p><p>\u201C. . . Who are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I see you aren\u2019t \u2018captured.\u2019 Tell me one thing\u2014Are you this girl\u2019s friend or foe? Naturally, the two can\u2019t be neatly divided into Yin and Yang, and your answer may change depending on circumstance . . . but if, for instance, I were to go berserk, would you protect this child or not?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . At present, I intend to protect her,\u201D Sigma answered honestly, but remained wary.</p><p>He mentally reaffirmed that his reason was to maintain a smooth alliance with Assassin and slowly maneuvered into a position where he could guard Tsubaki.</p><p>At that, the red-clad beauty let out a relieved exclamation.</p><p>\u201COh, thank goodness! I was nervous because, if I had to say, you have the eyes of one who kills rulers rather than defends them, but you\u2019ve set my mind at ease! Have no fear; I am her friend as well. Now it will be smooth sailing. I was actually more associated with sinking ships, but don\u2019t let that bother you! Some sunken ships reach the temple of the sea god. Or is the Dragon Palace better known now?\u201D</p><p>Something about seeing the beauty talk with the speed and energy of a comedian inspired a sense of kinship in Sigma.</p><p>If this were a normal job, I\u2019d either eliminate them just to be safe or make my escape at this point, Sigma thought, but right now, my mission is to act freely.</p><p>He decided to hear the beauty out without completely relaxing his guard.</p><p>He thought that he would need more information if he wanted to act freely.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll hear you out. Who are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re wise! Unfortunately, however, it\u2019s about time for me to submerge again.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA monster will come here. When he does, the embodiment of sickness will automatically focus its attention on Tsubaki. Once that happens, I won\u2019t be able to conceal myself completely.\u201D</p><p>Sigma started to ask the beauty what this string of bizarre statements meant . . . when he noticed that they had begun to fade like a mirage and drew in his breath.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I\u2019m all right,\u201D the beauty assured the shocked-looking Tsubaki with a comforting smile. \u201CWe\u2019re just going to play hide and seek for a little bit longer.\u201D</p><p>After reassuring the girl, the beauty turned to Sigma, pointed to the crossbow in Tsubaki\u2019s arms, and continued.</p><p>\u201CEither carry that crossbow yourself or get someone else to do so and keep it with Tsubaki at all times. You must not take it away from her. As for myself, call me . . . Yes, call me \u2018Jiao.\u2019 As long as that crossbow is with that girl, I may be able to come to her defense if something threatens her in this world.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t understand. Who are you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a long story, but put simply . . . . . .? Wait, why can I sense traces of its presence from you? Do you by any chance linked to that thing fluttering in the sky in the outside world?\u201D</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>Sigma drew in his breath again.</p><p>Do they know about Watcher . . .?</p><p>\u201COh no, I\u2019m at my limit. Try showing that crossbow to an intelligent mage. Do that, and you . . . will . . . Oh, yes, I\u2019m relying on you! Fulfill my request to keep Tsubaki safe and . . .\u201D</p><p>Before they could finish their sentence, the beauty who called themselves Jiao vanished without a trace.</p><p>Tsubaki stared around the room in puzzlement, but Sigma looked troubled and wondered:</p><p>Who were they? They seemed to know something about Watcher, but . . .</p><p>Sigma thought that he might have been able to obtain important information about his Servant, who even he did not really understand, but there was no use crying over spilled milk.</p><p>I guess I should hold onto this crossbow for now. . . .</p><p>Sigma flashed a forced smile at Tsubaki, offered to carry the crossbow, and took it from her hands.</p><p>He did not know that it was the catalyst that the Kuruokas had prepared for the Holy Grail War . . . or that it had been one of the triggers that summoned Tsubaki\u2019s Heroic Spirit in a very different way than the mages had intended.</p><p>Snowfield was now densely packed with a diverse assortment of entities. Fates there were complicated and sometimes became entangled.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D</p><p></p><p>Good fates and bad fates alike.</p><p></p><p>\u201CTsubaki, who\u2019s that guy?\u201D</p><p>An innocent voice came from the direction of the stairs.</p><p>Sigma turned to look and saw a young boy.</p><p>?</p><p>Who\u2019s he? He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s under mind control. . . .</p><p>Sigma warily observed the boy.</p><p>Someone not being under mind control in this world was enough of a reason to be cautious of them.</p><p>Tsubaki, in contrast, sounded relieved.</p><p>\u201COh, Jester! You came to visit!\u201C</p><p></p><p>Shudder.</p><p>Sigma\u2019s accumulated experience as a magecraft-user sent a tremor through his body before his memory could catch up.</p><p>An instant later, a voice echoed in the back of Sigma\u2019s mind.</p><p>A voice that he had heard the night before, right before he had been dragged into the ward-world.</p><p>\u201CMy name is Jester, Jester Karture!\u201D</p><p>The boy\u2019s voice and appearance were different, but Sigma was not optimistic enough to dismiss it as a coincidence.</p><p>By the time Sigma remembered that name, which had been announced to Assassin, the boy was already right beside him.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re lucky. I can\u2019t just kill you in front of Tsubaki,\u201D Jester whispered in a voice that only Sigma could hear. His smile never faltered.</p><p>\u201CKeep your mouth shut, OK? I\u2019m that girl\u2019s \u2018friend.\u2019 If you attack me, \u2018Mr. Black\u2019 will eliminate you immediately, and who knows what I\u2019ll do,\u201D the smiling, young Jester warned Sigma while listening to Tsubaki introduce Sigma and explain the course of events.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Sigma kept silent as his whole body broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Watcher had given him advance warning that Jester could take the form of a boy.</p><p>Now that he actually saw it, however, the \u201Ctransformation\u201D was more complete than he had imagined. If Tsubaki had not called Jester\u2019s name, it would have taken him time to make the connection.</p><p>That single detail was enough to bring home how much the boy outclassed him.</p><p>What is he after?</p><p>Sigma could not guess young Jester\u2019s intentions. Jester surveyed the workshop with a fresh-faced smile.</p><p>\u201CWow, this place is cool. It\u2019s like a secret base.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah, it\u2019s my mom and dad\u2019s room,\u201D Tsubaki answered bashfully.</p><p>The sight puzzled Sigma.</p><p>Hasn\u2019t she been placed under suggestion to stop her from talking about the workshop?</p><p>Was it removed because she fell into a coma, or is there another reason?</p><p>He felt that his thoughts were wandering, but also resented that thinking was all he could do.</p><p>This situation would not affect the outcome of his mission, but it would significantly affect his chances of survival.</p><p>Sigma wished for sound sleep and food\u2014in other words, a pleasant existence. He wanted to avoid being brutally murdered by a hematophage.</p><p>Even so, he was convinced that he could not afford to make a move when he was not even sure what Jester wanted.</p><p></p><p>The hematophage\u2019s actions, however, were extremely simple.</p><p>He talked with Tsubaki.</p><p>Purely in terms of the results, that was all he did.</p><p></p><p>And the results of that simple action guided that world to an end.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>What did Mr. Sigma stop talking for?</p><p>Where did that pretty person hide?</p><p>I know; I\u2019ll go look for them with Jester later!</p><p></p><p>\u201CHey, Tsubaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it, Jester?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy dad told me that your parents are really important mages.\u201D</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p></p><p>What should I do?</p><p>What\u2019s the right thing to do?</p><p>Oh, \u201Cmagecraft\u201D was supposed to be a secret, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p></p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry.

Opinions on it as a familiar would be divided.</p><p>But precisely because it had no will of its own and was an embodiment of a portion of the world\u2019s logic, it was capable of wielding immense power, and it had just formally received a wish from its Master.</p><p></p><p>I want to become a Magician.</p><p></p><p>The Heroic Spirit that protected Tsubaki registered that wish.</p><p>That was the long-term wish of its Master, Kuruoka Tsubaki.</p><p>I want to live happily with my parents.</p><p>I want to spend time with animals.</p><p>I don\u2019t want anyone to leave town.</p><p>I want to help the people caught in the fire evacuate.</p><p>The Heroic Spirit had been able to address such short-term \u201Cwishes\u201D using its own power.</p><p>\u201CBecoming a Magician,\u201D however, was a wish that far exceeded the capabilities of its systems.</p><p>Magecraft would be possible, but Magic was a different story.</p><p>An ordinary familiar, no matter how intelligent, would have answered, \u201CThat\u2019s impossible.\u201D</p><p>But the Heroic Spirit that was Tsubaki\u2019s Servant and guardian\u2014Pale Rider\u2014was different.</p><p>Because it had been given knowledge as a Heroic Spirit, it possessed a possibility.</p><p>The possibility called \u201CThe Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>It was hardly a certain method.</p><p>No matter how low the probability, however, Pale Rider, the Servant of the concept of death, would present that method.</p><p>The Third Magic, which had been lost to the world with the creation of the Greater Grail.</p><p>Magic was outside natural law and was therefore impossible to reproduce using a wish-granter within the bounds of natural law.</p><p>But in the case of the Third Magic, which was linked to the Grail, and only in that case . . . there was a possibility.</p><p>By incorporating the Holy Grail into Tsubaki via itself, it would cause a flux in natural law.</p><p>If it could recreate the Magic Circuits of the \u201Cvessel\u201D that had become the blueprint for the Greater Grail, then perhaps . . .</p><p>The chance was infinitesimally slim.</p><p>Practically a pipe dream.</p><p>But Pale Rider registered it.</p><p>As a \u201Cpipe dream\u201D of Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s.</p><p>And from that moment on . . . Pale Rider used every resource at its disposal to recompose a world founded on \u201CTsubaki\u2019s wish,\u201D which had fused with itself.</p><p>For a means to its end.</p><p></p><p>Win the Holy Grail War and obtain the Greater Grail.</p><p>That first Heroic Spirit to descend on Snowfield . . . finally signaled that it was joining the battle.</p><p></p><p>All the while enveloping the entire world in the presence of Death.</p><h2 id="chapter-20-fantasy-becomes-reality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-20-fantasy-becomes-reality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 20: Fantasy Becomes Reality</h2><hr><p>Francesca Prelati first became involved with the Holy Grail War after an American organization commissioned her to analyze it in the midst of the Second World War.</p><p>A member of the Dioland family, who had already embedded themselves in the Clock Tower, entered the war, and although he was defeated, the resulting report concluded that the Holy Grail War was far too unique to be merely a local ritual in the Far East. There was a plan underway to build a city on a plot of land that had been requisitioned for the nation\u2019s mystical development. After the report on the third Holy Grail War, that plan shifted into an attempt to recreate the ritual there.</p><p>In order to carry out concrete investigations for the sake of that plan, a group of mages who were both skilled and had no ties to the Clock Tower was assembled, and Francesca ended up working with them due to a recommendation from a person she could never seem to cut ties with.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou bombed Fuyuki from the air for your investigation. Talk about overdoing it. You\u2019re really going to go that far?\u201D Francesca had griped at first. She had not been enthusiastic. Once she\u2014he at the time\u2014actually observed the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki, however, her attitude had changed completely.</p><p>The fourth Holy Grail War.</p><p>An event with a dubious history which saw the brutal murder of a Lord of the Clock Tower and the loss of several assets unrelated to the world of magecraft, such as fighter jets. The Holy Church had a hell of a time covering it up.</p><p>Francesca\u2019s \u201Chobby\u201D was observing places where interesting things seemed likely to happen through her far-reaching information network and then hurling that information into events unfolding in other places to cause chaos. Even among the data that she (or he, depending on the body) had spent many years accumulating, that Far-Eastern ritual was exceptionally out of the ordinary.</p><p>One Ghost-Liner after another was observed.</p><p>There were schemes that involved mages, magecraft-users, and even the Holy Church.</p><p>And there were two beings with \u201Cfamiliar\u201D faces.</p><p>One was the figure of the king said to have been guided by her teachers\u2019 teacher, the incubus-man who the spirits who had taught her magecraft had taken an interest in. Francesca had never had anything to do with her, but she had seen her in her teachers\u2019 water-viewing whispers.</p><p>That one, however, had been of no particular interest to Francesca.</p><p>She had been surprised that the ritual could even summon the wielder of the Holy Sword of the Planet. Given that the being would vanish when the ritual ended, she had not been able to confirm whether her personality had really been reproduced as well.</p><p>When she spotted her other acquainted\u2014Gilles de Rais, the \u201Cnoble knight of Bretagne\u201D\u2014through her far-seeing spell, however, Francesca was bowled over and set out on a trip from Antarctica to Japan with only the clothes on her back.</p><p>She dropped all her other projects to rush to the scene . . . but paid for her lack of preparation. The Grail was apparently destroyed before she had a chance to intervene. In the end, Francesca never got a chance to meet her sworn friend face-to-face.</p><p>The fact that she had underestimated the power of the head of the Makiri family and the insects he commanded might also be to blame.</p><p>Her familiars had probably been deliberately overlooked. Numerous insects had been stationed along her route, and Francesca had ultimately been forced to discard her body at the time after being intercepted by a fiend in the form of an old man.</p><p>\u201CIllusions don\u2019t work too well on bugs.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf only I\u2019d had more time to prepare, I could have fooled the whole region and slipped in that way. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, Gilles, Gilles, I hope you managed to enjoy the War.\u201D</p><p>She had been spotted grumbling by Faldeus before he made his way to the Clock Tower.</p><p></p><p>She was determined to interfere in the fifth War, but a number of factors coincided to prevent her.</p><p>First, Mat\u014D Z\u014Dgen, who had obstructed her during the fourth War, had strengthened his wards against outsiders, meaning that she could not observe the War at all.</p><p>Second, the priest from the Holy Church was extraordinarily skilled at handling external threats.</p><p>Third, when she had tried to investigate Fuyuki during the preparatory period, she had sensed the uncanny presence of at least seven Mystic Eyes focused on the same line and could not afford to approach the city carelessly.</p><p>The last straw was that she had been in the middle of having her bodies repeatedly murdered by a Grand mage named Aozaki T\u014Dko.</p><p>As a result, Francesca did not know how the fifth Holy Grail War ended.</p><p>Word of the result had leaked out, but she had been unable to learn what sort of \u201Cwar\u201D had taken place in Fuyuki, or what factions had met with what fates.</p><p>But that had been enough.</p><p>Francesca had patiently observed the workings of the Grail, brought together a variety of components, such a fragment of the Greater Grail\u2019s magical energy that she had barely managed to obtain before the start of the fifth War, or the \u201Cmud\u201D she had unearthed from the ruins of the \u201CFuyuki disaster\u201D that had occurred during the fourth, and constructed a fake Holy Grail in Snowfield.</p><p>But a fake was still a fake.</p><p>Without the complete, intact Magic Circuits of Justeaze, the founder of the Holy Grail War, as a component, perfectly recreating the Greater Holy Grail was impossible. No matter how close she came, it would never be more than a fake.</p><p>And yet . . . Heroic Spirits, Servants, Ghost-Liners.</p><p>By some miracle or caprice, the land on which the fake Holy Grail War was built had reached the point of manifesting several of those \u201Cforces\u201D known by many names.</p><p>In which case, Francesca thought, the rest would be simple trial and error, relying on pure chance.</p><p>If she repeated it thousands, tens of thousands of times until the human race went extinct, she might eventually achieve the results her employers hoped for in addition to her own wish\u2014the elimination of Magic through the advancement of human technology.</p><p>It could be said that Francesca Prelati was more of a demon than a mage, with no thought to spare for logic.</p><p>That was why she had the idea.</p><p>Since she was going to summon Heroic Spirits, she had better have as much fun with them as she could.</p><p></p><p>And right now, she was thrilled.</p><p>She had heard that for some reason, the legendary wielder of the Holy Sword had manifested in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War several times.</p><p>In this fake Holy Grail War, a king who idolized that hero had appeared in her place.</p><p>Francesca Prelati was therefore dying to taint his adoration.</p><p>When she stole the light from someone radiant, what exactly would be left?</p><p>Just to find that out, the Prelatis continued to fall in a dream.</p><p>However ugly, pitiful, or wretched the result turned out to be . . . they at least were determined to love it as a form of humanity.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Past, 1189, Western France</p><p></p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re one of those. You really like King Arthur, right?\u201D The man in the out-of-place outfit asked as he tinkered noisily with the bizarre horseless carriage under which he was lying.</p><p>Richard responded with a boyish grin.</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re wrong, Saint Germain! I don\u2019t just like King Arthur; I also like the Knights of the Round Table, and I love the legends of Charlemagne! King Beowulf slaying Grendel thrills me to my core, and I\u2019ve wanted to go train in the Land of Shadows more than a few times!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t forget Alexander the Great. I bet he\u2019d fight you to the death on the battlefield with a smile on his face.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTruly?! That would be an honor! . . . Still, it\u2019s true that if I pledged myself to any legend, it would be to the songs of King Arthur, the first king of my heart.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEven though he gets betrayed by his kin and overthrown in the end?\u201D The man\u2014Saint Germain\u2014asked sarcastically, poking his head out from under his carriage.</p><p>\u201COf course,\u201D Richard answered nonchalantly. \u201CI love Sir Mordred too, you know? He\u2019s a great knight who slew the great King Arthur. He who ends a legend deserves to be a legend in his own right.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I see. I suppose you\u2019re right,\u201D Saint Germain surveyed their surroundings and agreed with a wry grin.</p><p>Amid the well-ordered rows of knights and foot soldiers, the con man, whose position was akin to that of a court mage, muttered too softly for Richard to hear:</p><p>\u201CAnd it\u2019s because you\u2019re like this . . . that you\u2019re on your way to slay your own father.\u201D</p><p></p><p>The life of Richard I \u201Cthe Lionheart\u201D was spent in adoration of King Arthur.</p><p>The episodes demonstrating his attachment to legends were too numerous to mention, and his wild disposition aside, it would be no exaggeration to say that the standard called \u201Cchivalry\u201D was fostered among those numerous legends.</p><p>He often set out in person to collect relics of bygone heroes. There is no way of knowing whether the Excalibur he is supposed to have discovered at Glastonbury was genuine, or a mirage that his obsession with legends showed him.</p><p>Whatever the blade inside was, however . . . he did at least find the genuine scabbard. Or so someone told the royals and aristocrats of the French court several centuries later.</p><p>According to them, Richard had paid his respects to that great scabbard which had kept the holy sword safe from the world\u2019s corrosion by placing the greatest of seals upon it and restoring it to a site associated with King Arthur with his own hands.</p><p></p><p>That story went out into the world as just another rumor, and several more centuries passed. . . .</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Present, A Closed-off World, Central Intersection</p><p></p><p>\u201CHey . . . They\u2019ve got a new look in their eyes,\u201D one of the officers said, cold sweat running down their back.</p><p>\u201CCalm down. That doesn\u2019t change the plan. We\u2019re going to look for an opening while shoring up our defenses.\u201D</p><p>Vera was the one holding them together. Her face was calm, but even she realized how dire their situation was.</p><p>\u201CAn opening? That\u2019s easy to say . . .\u201D</p><p>Another officer put Vera\u2019s anxieties into words for her.</p><p>\u201CBut is there anywhere to run?\u201D</p><p>Every part of the city they could see had already been corroded by the black mist. Swarms of rats scurried over the ground while black-winged crows blotted out the sky.</p><p>And the Kerberoses, which had been on the defensive up to that point, went on the attack.</p><p>The fact that the police officers were still intact in the face of the ferocious onslaught was probably due to the fact that John was still able to use the \u201Cpower\u201D that Caster had given him to fend them off bare-handed, and to the fact that the Kerberoses and other demonic beasts took little notice of them.</p><p>The demonic beasts\u2019 attacks seemed to be focused on the Heroic Spirit Saber. Up to that point, their attacks had been robotic, but some were now charged with obvious hostility.</p><p>\u201CSomething must have happened! I hope that the girl is unharmed!\u201D</p><p>Saber fended off the grotesque creatures attacking him from all sides with the Kerberos\u2019s claw.</p><p>The gigantic beasts\u2019 jaws closed in, looking for an opening.</p><p>Jaws far larger than his whole body snapped shut with incredible speed, but Saber dodged them by a hair\u2019s breadth.</p><p>But Kerberos had three heads.</p><p>A series of three deadly guillotines.</p><p>Saber kicked a log-thick fang to avoid the second, and then changed direction in midair to slip past the third set of jaws.</p><p>Another Kerberos, however, seized the chance to approach from behind and sent Saber\u2019s body flying with a swipe of its claws.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Saber\u2019s body slammed into a building shrouded in black mist. Chunks of glass and concrete flew in all directions.</p><p></p><p>\u201CSaber!\u201D Ayaka yelled.</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>Saber is moving slower than usual!</p><p>I knew it! He\u2019s still hurt from last night!</p><p>Ayaka cursed her own carelessness.</p><p>She knew that Saber had been able to keep dodging the Noble Phantasms that the golden Heroic Spirit had fired like a machinegun, but his movements were obviously stiffer than they had been then.</p><p>He said that he had been healed using magecraft, but he must not have been able to fully recover from nearly fatal wounds.</p><p>Ayaka was unfamiliar with magecraft. She had not really understood, but she had assumed that it had healed him completely.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, Saber had not sounded quite like himself earlier when he had offered to do the dirty work if it came to that. Was that because he knew that he did not have much time left?</p><p>Ayaka linked one negative thought to another as she started running through the swirling dust toward the building that Saber had been flung into.</p><p>But the next thing that the Kerberoses\u2014or that \u201Cworld\u201D\u2014focused on after Saber was his source of magical energy. In other words, Ayaka.</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>One of the titanic beasts closed in on Ayaka.</p><p>Its jaws, however, were stopped by police officers who cut in between the beast and Ayaka with shield and halberd Noble Phantasms.</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t stop! Keep moving!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy . . .?\u201D</p><p>Truce or not, she was still supposed to be their enemy. Why would they save her?</p><p>\u201CThis sort of thing is our real job,\u201D one of the officers answered the question in Ayaka\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201C. . . Thank you!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka forced out a reply at the last second and kept running into the building.</p><p>She shot a brief glance behind her . . . and saw the officers being mowed down by the monsters.</p><p>Some of them had sustained serious injuries, while others were lying collapsed on the ground.</p><p>In the few seconds that Saber had been gone, the balance had collapsed.</p><p>John and Vera were putting up a fight, but at the rate things were going, they would all be dead within a few minutes.</p><p>Having seen that, Ayaka raced up the stairs into the dark interior of the building with tears in her eyes and made for the floor that she thought Saber had been flung into.</p><p>Why me . . .?</p><p>I can\u2019t do anything.</p><p>I\u2019m not even one of those \u201CMasters,\u201D or whatever they\u2019re called.</p><p>I could never be a . . .</p><p>No. No, no, no.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t be one. I chose not to.</p><p>I ran away again.</p><p>But there\u2019s nowhere left for me to go!</p><p>Infuriated by her own cowardice, Ayaka just kept running, ignoring the protests of her leg muscles.</p><p>Ayaka knew that she was just a weakling compared to Heroic Spirits or mages.</p><p>She also knew that she was weak even compared to other humans, and she knew why.</p><p>Sex and age had nothing to do with it.</p><p>Ayaka understood that differences like those were irrelevant to what strength meant here.</p><p>The reason she was weak was simple.</p><p>I never tried to become strong. . . . I never wanted to be strong. . . .</p><p>It was so, so much easier to run away.</p><p>Then . . . just as Ayaka was about to reach the floor she thought Saber must be on, she caught sight of a red figure on the stairs.</p><p>Ayaka gasped.</p><p>This was an ordinary building.</p><p>Of course, it had an elevator.</p><p>Every inch of Ayaka\u2019s body trembled in the face of \u201CLittle Red Riding Hood.\u201D Was she a hallucination? Was she a ghost? Ayaka did not know.</p><p>I\u2019m scared.</p><p>Scared, scared, scared, scared, scared, scared. No, no, no, no, no.</p><p>Her bones creaked. Her insides twisted like they were burning. Nausea rose from the back of her throat.</p><p>But . . .</p><p></p><p>She still did not stop.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Move.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka\u2019s legs were at their limit, but she forced them up one stair at a time as her joints and muscle fibers groaned.</p><p>She shed tears as she glared upward at \u201CLittle Red Riding Hood.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can kill me or curse me if you want. I\u2019m sure you have the right to.\u201D</p><p>This world within a ward had filled to bursting with every kind of death in an instant.</p><p>As a result, it\u2019s excessive atmosphere of death may have numbed the fear that had driven Ayaka to keep running.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m afraid of you, but . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2014\u201D</p><p>The one bit of face barely visible under the shadow of the hood\u2014Little Red Riding Hood\u2019s mouth\u2014opened tried to say something to Ayaka.</p><p>Ayaka, however, kept advancing in spite of that and tried to pass right by Little Red Riding Hood.</p><p>\u201CRight now, I\u2019m more afraid of running away from Saber.\u201D</p><p>The next instant . . .</p><p>Little Red Riding Hood\u2019s mouth moved and whispered in a voice that only Ayaka could hear.</p><p>\u201C. . . _____.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka turned to look in spite of herself, but Little Red Riding Hood was no longer there.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Ayaka clapped both hands to her face and directed her steps toward a shattered wall in search of Saber.</p><p></p><p>\u201COh . . . What, you came all the way here, Ayaka?\u201D</p><p>Saber was there.</p><p>He was standing majestically, like he had when she first met him at the opera house.</p><p>Unlike then, however, he was covered with blood.</p><p>He had not fallen on his face like he had in the church, but part of his armor was split, probably torn by Kerberos claws, and fresh blood was dripping from the gash.</p><p>\u201CSaber . . .!\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease, don\u2019t look at me like that. This is only a scratch. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ve had this talk three or four times already. I\u2019ve made up my mind, so shut up and listen!\u201D</p><p>\u201CCertainly.\u201D</p><p>The sight of Ayaka\u2019s ghastly appearance made Saber forget his own injuries and nod in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201CSaber . . . you\u2019re hesitating to use my magical energy and holding back, aren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t run from you or the Holy Grail War anymore. I\u2019ve made up my mind to fight with you! I only made up my mind just now, though! Sorry about that!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, yes. . . . Certainly.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka somehow managed the trick of angrily delivering a sincere apology, and Saber responded with another instinctive nod.</p><p>Ayaka had been thinking it over for the past few days, but now she understood.</p><p>She understood what running in fear from everything would lead her to.</p><p>That question was meaningless in the situation she found herself in. This was the place she had run away to.</p><p>If she were going to find anything at the end of her flight, she would have to find it here.</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t even mind if you\u2019re going to suck up all my magical energy and kill me! I mean, I would mind, but it\u2019d be way better than dying with you in a place like this without even knowing what\u2019s going on! So, I\u2019m going to do what I can!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka seized Saber\u2019s hand and pressed it to one of the Command-Spell-like marks on her body as she listened to the sounds of the battle outside.</p><p>\u201CIf you\u2019re willing to give me something in exchange for my magical energy . . . I want you to teach me how to fight. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s just how to throw rocks. If you think I\u2019ll get in your way, it can even be how to make more magical energy or how to use it!\u201D</p><p>Saber lowered his eyes from Ayaka\u2019s earnest expression for an instant, then answered with an earnest look of his own.</p><p>\u201CI appreciate the sentiment, and you\u2019re strong. However . . . right now, it\u2019s me who can\u2019t respond to you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve resolved to fight for me, but I still haven\u2019t found a reason to seek the Grail if it means risking my life and my chivalry and trampling the wishes of others. Therefore, this life of mine isn\u2019t for winning this war. I should use it to keep you safe. Until yesterday, I thought that I could balance that with my own curiosity . . . but that gaudy fellow taught me better.\u201D</p><p>I knew it, Ayaka thought, Saber did get hurt. Not just physically, either. His fight with that golden Heroic Spirit drove a wedge into his heart.</p><p>Saber was not afraid of others. Defeat certainly had not made him afraid that that golden hero would kill him.</p><p>Even Ayaka could understand that, and she doubted it had changed.</p><p>But even if he were not afraid, without a wish for the Grail, he had no reason to turn his lion\u2019s heart to the Holy Grail War.</p><p>He must not be able to fight with all his passion as a result.</p><p>Ayaka had only known Saber a few days, but she had been forced to learn more than she would have liked about his temperament.</p><p>\u201CTherefore, I don\u2019t care if I vanish. I got you involved, and your survival is my prime objective. Although ideally, once I\u2019ve ensured your safety, I\u2019d like a chance to challenge that golden king again with whatever magical energy I have left.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter what your wish is! I wouldn\u2019t care if you wanted to sell the Grail for cash! Didn\u2019t you say you were going to take music back with you to heaven or \u201Cthe Throne\u201D or wherever? A childish whim like that is good enough!\u201D</p><p>Saber lowered his eyes again and flashed a wry smile.</p><p>\u201C. . . The Throne is one thing, but you won\u2019t find me in heaven.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m a Heroic Spirit\u2014just a shadow burned into the world\u2014so I don\u2019t know the truth, but if there\u2019s a heaven, then my soul must be . . . burning in purgatory until the day the human race comes to an end.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>She was about to ask what he meant when more of the wall of the building collapsed.</p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>The pair turned to see a row of three massive, bestial mouths.</p><p>Kereberos had grown again while they were not looking. Its appearance recalled a three-headed beast out of a giant monster movie.</p><p>Poisonous plants sprouted wherever droplets of its drool hit the floor.</p><p></p><p>\u201CSleep. (Die.)\u201D</p><p></p><p>All three heads spoke in unison. They seemed about to bite off the whole room with Saber and Ayaka inside it. Before either had a chance to move, however, a tiny fragment tumbled between them and the beast.</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka was puzzled.</p><p>All three of Kerberos\u2019 heads had suddenly frozen in place.</p><p>All six of the monster\u2019s eyes were fixed on the little lump that had tumbled to the floor.</p><p>When Ayaka realized what the thing was, she could not hold back an exclamation. It was just so out of place with the life-threatening situation.</p><p>\u201C. . . A cookie . . .?\u201D</p><p>It was a single cookie, sweetly redolent of honey, that might be found for sale in any supermarket.</p><p>Everything fell silent, Kerberos included.</p><p>\u201CTaking in Kerberos was neat, but it was a bad move.\u201D</p><p>Cheerful voices rang out. They were definitely out of place.</p><p>\u201CI mean, it\u2019s weakness is just so famous!\u201D</p><p>The boy and girl sounded like they were having the time of their lives, like an audience watching Ayaka and the others\u2019 predicament as a scene in a slasher movie.</p><p>When they actually appeared, they were indeed munching on store-bought cookies and chocolates like popcorn.</p><p>A gaping hole opened in the ceiling, and through it two figures descended with an open umbrella like characters out of a movie.</p><p>\u201CHi there. Should I say nice to meet you? Mr. Lionheart and . . . I don\u2019t know who you are, but you\u2019ve got some impressive magical energy!\u201D</p><p>The girl in a gothic-Lolita dress flashed a smile as she twirled her umbrella.</p><p>Beside the spinning, open umbrella, a boy with similar features made a polite bow.</p><p>\u201C. . . I have a lot of questions,\u201D Saber asked the pair as if he spoke for the bewildered Ayaka, \u201Cbut tell me, what are you holding up an umbrella indoors for?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that really important?\u201D Ayaka frowned when the question failed completely to speak for her.</p><p>The girl twirling the umbrella, however, puffed up with pride, her eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m glad you asked! I knew you were a real find! I love people who give me reactions like that!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe answer is simple,\u201D the boy continued for her, spreading his arms wide.</p><p></p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s about to rain here!\u201D</p><p></p><p>The next instant, a downpour of cookie and candy packages began inside the building, painting over the gray floor in a deluge of pop coloring.</p><p>It was an unbelievable scene out of a fairy tale or comic book.</p><p>Ayaka found herself at a loss for words amid scenery that was divorced from reality in a completely different sense than the pervading atmosphere of death a moment before had been.</p><p>The candy packages falling in place of raindrops began to grow larger. Mountains of sweets was piling up toward the room\u2019s high ceiling like piles of scrapped cars in a junkyard.</p><p>And the most surprising thing of all was that the immobile Kerberos sniffed loudly and then immediately began to wolf down the now-gigantic sweets packaging and all.</p><p>\u201CWho are you . . .?\u201D Ayaka asked the boy and girl from her position beside Saber, unable to process the situation.</p><p>\u201CYou know, we\u2019d like to ask you the same thing,\u201D the girl answered while deflecting the rain of sweets with her umbrella. \u201CWe\u2019ve been wondering where Filia managed to dig up someone like you.\u201D</p><p>\u201C! You know her?! Where is she now?!\u201D</p><p>The white woman who had led her to this city against her will.</p><p>Ayaka grew warier at the revelation that the pair had something to do with her. They, however, answered her question with a statement she could make no sense of.</p><p>\u201CAh ha ha! I don\u2019t think she\u2019s anywhere anymore. Her body\u2019s still around, though! You\u2019d better be careful you don\u2019t talk to her by mistake. She might turn you into a gemstone for being insolent or shabby or something!\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m Francesca. This is Francois. In this Holy Grail War, we\u2019re the True Caster faction, the masterminds, the bookies, and the troublemakers all rolled into one. . . . Is that enough for you to go on? It is, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201C???\u201D</p><p>Ayaka was more confused than ever, but Saber nodded.</p><p>\u201CI see. I don\u2019t understand at all, but thank you for rescuing us. I had heard that Kerberos is fond of honey cakes, but I had none to hand.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCrazy, isn\u2019t it? People have kept on telling stories about a guard dog who lets criminals go for sweets all this time,\u201D Francesca guffawed and looked outside.</p><p>Ayaka gave a start and turned to look at what was happening while keeping a cautious eye on the Kerberos gobbling sweets.</p><p>Outside, the same rain of sweets was falling, and every Kerberos was glued to a mountain of cookies.</p><p>\u201COh, I almost forgot. No need to thank us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAfter all, we\u2019re here to defile you.\u201D</p><p>The mysterious pair announced with cheerful smiles.</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka frowned, watching to see what they were up to.</p><p>\u201COh?\u201D Francesca said, watching Ayaka right back. \u201CYou\u2019ve gotten a whole lot tougher since Cashura almost killed you on the first day.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Cashura . . . Are you friends of that guy at the opera house?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou got it. Back then, you had a look on your face like you couldn\u2019t even be bothered with living. Did getting dragged around by a hero like Mr. Lionheart here toughen you up? Or are you a little vixen who got full of herself once she cozied up to someone strong? Which is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ayaka stammered at the sudden change of subject. She could not be certain that she was not the latter.</p><p>Saber, however, voiced his honest, unvarnished opinion in her place.</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean? Ayaka has been strong since the beginning, and it\u2019s natural to get a big head when you\u2019re close to someone you can trust, no matter how strong or weak you are. Also, while Ayaka does have imposing eyes like a fox, she doesn\u2019t disturb gardens or farms, nor does she deceive people by pretending to be a cat.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou can say that from the heart? Great! I knew you were a real find!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see, I see. He\u2019s a fine king indeed! He acts entirely on his own principles in the moment!\u201D</p><p>Francesca\u2019s sarcasm had missed its mark, but for some reason the pair sounded satisfied.</p><p>They turned their attention back to Ayaka and said, with twirling, dance-like movements:</p><p>\u201CLucky you. I\u2019m jealous. Ayaka, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou managed to bump into a good king! No wonder you\u2019re toughening up! No wonder you can trust him!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to apologize while we have the chance. Sorry!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, not that we mind if you hold it against us. Let\u2019s be friends if you don\u2019t, though! Oh, we\u2019re not going to hurt your bodies, so don\u2019t worry about that. Yay!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka could not help being irritated after that string of provocations and started to say something to the pair.</p><p>\u201CHey, what the hell are you talking a\u2014\u201D</p><p>An instant later, however . . .</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re just going to trample on His Majesty\u2019s adoration a bit.\u201D</p><p>Francesca brandished her umbrella, and the world turned inside out.</p><p></p><p>It was a beautiful castle.</p><p>It was not policed like a tourist attraction, but the nearby doors and the gardens visible within showed signs of being well maintained. Its time-worn stone walls lent it an air of solemn grandeur and harmonized fantastically with its location in the deep forest.</p><p>\u201C. . . Wh-What?\u201D</p><p>The cry that escaped Ayaka\u2019s mouth were high pitched and quavering.</p><p>She knew that they had been inside a building until a few seconds earlier.</p><p>Now, however, the cold concrete, the glass shards, and most of all the mountains of sweets and the monsters feasting on them had vanished without a trace.</p><p>It was as if none of those things had ever existed in the first place.</p><p>But Ayaka\u2019s voice was not shrill because the scenery around her had been replaced.</p><p>She had only just seen the world turn inside out, after all.</p><p>Why was her pulse skyrocketing and her whole body breaking out in sweat?</p><p>Because she recognized this scenery.</p><p>\u201CNo way. This is . . . the castle in Fuyuki. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhere?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka startled at the voice from beside her and turned to look.</p><p>She found Saber standing in exactly the same position he had been until a moment before.</p><p>\u201C! . . . Thank goodness! Are you all right?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but I am surprised. This is . . . even more incredible than the \u2018projection mapping\u2019 that rascal Saint Germain showed me. It\u2019s an illusion. It\u2019s perfectly fooling our perception\u2014not just what we can see, but even the smell of the breeze and the temperature of the soil.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIllusion . . .? Not teleportation, or anything like that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I doubt we\u2019ve gone anywhere physically. The police aren\u2019t here, so they must be deceiving our senses, not the space itself. My mage companion knows a lot about this sort of thing.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh really? I\u2019m interested in this mage friend of yours.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka heard the voice of the boy who introduced himself as Francois and looked around.</p><p>But while she could hear his voice, he was nowhere to be seen. Next came a jibe from Francesca.</p><p>\u201CRats. I wanted to make you think it was teleportation and have a little fun. What a letdown.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, it\u2019s quite a feat. I certainly never saw an illusion of this caliber while I was alive. I\u2019m impressed. How would you like to be my court mage? It\u2019s supposed to be Saint Germain\u2019s job, but I called him, and he wouldn\u2019t answer, so I could appoint you as his replacement.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Hey, I thought my ears were playing tricks on me, but I keep hearing a name I don\u2019t like.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo do I. You know, this king does seem like just the type that no-good, deviant con man would visit.\u201D</p><p>Francesca and Francois sounded obviously less delighted than they had moments before.</p><p>\u201COh, I wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201D Saber continued matter-of-factly. \u201CAt worst, he\u2019s the oddest of layabout petty aristocrats.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t that worse?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka, who had seen \u201CSaint Germain\u201D in her dreams, did not press the point further, but it relieved her nervousness just enough to think calmly.</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . What are you showing me a hallucination of my hometown for?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Oh, so you\u2019re from Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Since they seemed to know Filia, Ayaka had assumed the illusion was targeted at her, but apparently not.</p><p>In which case, why Fuyuki?</p><p>As Ayaka wondered, a change occurred behind her.</p><p>No sooner did she hear the sounds of something massive approaching than \u201Cit\u201D passed by Ayaka and Saber, trampling through the forest with a peal of thunder.</p><p>The thing speeding straight toward the large doors that led into the castle was a cart pulled by large oxen.</p><p>\u201CCart\u201D was the only way Ayaka could describe it, but Richard recognized what it was at a glance.</p><p>\u201CWas that . . . a chariot? Oxen surrounded by lightning . . . Could those be the divine oxen?! Then, that must be King Gordias. No . . .\u201D</p><p>Saber, who had a fondness for numerous hero tales, instantly realized what that chariot was and who must be driving it.</p><p>Two men were riding in that chariot which had raced across ancient battlefields.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t believe it. . . . Saint Germain told me that he was far larger than his legends say, but I assumed he was exaggerating. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou recognize him?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. . . . If I\u2019m right . . . that\u2019s the conqueror who began in Macedonia and went on to dominate the continent\u2014Alexander the Great . . .!</p><p>Alexander the Great? I think I\u2019ve heard of him. . . .</p><p>Ayaka did not know much about legendary heroes. She was only aware of Alexander, like Richard the Lionheart, as a name she\u2019d heard of before. The sight of Saber beaming with childish delight, however, told her that he was a historical figure and a hero who had lived even longer ago than Saber.</p><p>Then, is he a Servant too . . .?</p><p>Ayaka had sensed an extraordinary presence from the red-haired man, but the memory of the shrieking young man beside him made her feel a little relieved.</p><p>That may have been sympathy, because she sensed that the black-haired, baby-faced young man was, like her, \u201Cun-mage-like.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off Town, Crystal Hill, Top Floor</p><p></p><p>\u201CDid you say it\u2019s raining packages of sweets . . .?\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II\u2019s confused voice echoed from the cell phone speaker.</p><p>He had heard about what was happening from Flat, but he quickly grasped the situation and voiced an opinion.</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . Kerberos is a foreign element in that faceless underworld. They must have taken advantage of its characteristics. . . . Still, whatever school of magecraft they employed, it would take quite a high level of mage to cause such a ridiculous phenomenon over such a large area. . . . There\u2019s a strong possibility that we\u2019re dealing with a Servant.\u201D</p><p></p><p>In contrast to El-Melloi II\u2019s calm analysis, Jester\u2019s grimacing double was shouting angrily.</p><p>\u201CIllusionists?! Damn them! This is none of their business!\u201D</p><p>That divine beast ought to get closer to its original strength if it takes in multiple dead people, Jester mused to himself. It depends on the magical energy resources available in this ritual site, but if I\u2019m lucky, it\u2019s combat abilities could be a match for a powerful Servant. . . .</p><p>The corners of his mouth crept upward again.</p><p>\u201CAfter all this effort to set the table, I suppose I\u2019ll lend a hand. Just a little.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat are you plotting, fiend?!\u201D Assassin bellowed as she cut through the grotesqueries that had come through the windows.</p><p>\u201CNothing fancy. For starters, I\u2019ll just murder all the cops at the intersection down there, then stuff them into Kerberos\u2019 belly instead of all that candy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI won\u2019t let you . . . Ngh . . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin rushed at Jester, but the countless smoky, black grotesqueries blocked her path.</p><p>\u201COh, it looks like these things\u2014this whole world, really\u2014are going after Servants first. Be careful, now. And the same goes for the renowned murderer over there,\u201D Jester added, looking at Flat\u2019s wristwatch. There was a hint of something like respect and affection in his voice, but Jack himself was the only one to notice it.</p><p>\u201C. . . I appreciate the warning.\u201D</p><p>What\u2019s our next move, Flat? Can you do it? Jack called out telepathically to Flat, mentally clicking his tongue over having been discovered.</p><p>Hmm. I\u2019ve almost got it.</p><p></p><p>Jester, who had no idea what Berserker and his Master were saying to each other telepathically, continued to taunt Assassin with a look of ecstasy on his face.</p><p>\u201CHee hee. Would it bother you if I killed those cops? Didn\u2019t you fight them yourself, at the police station? So, why try to stop me from having a little fun with their lives? It doesn\u2019t look like your problem is with me giving Kerberos a power-up.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I won\u2019t let you have your way. That\u2019s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I don\u2019t think so! You found out that those cops are trying to protect Kuruoka Tsubaki, and now you show them some respect, even if they are your enemies. Am I wrong? Yes, I know. I know everything about you. You, however, don\u2019t understand mages yet.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSilence!\u201D</p><p>She threw a concealed dagger, but it just passed through Jester\u2019s body like it had before, serving only to reconfirm that Jester\u2019s main body was not there.</p><p>\u201CMages are the ultimate pragmatists. In the end, they\u2019ll choose to kill Kuruoka Tsubaki. But that\u2019s the right choice, Assassin. This ward-world is out of control, and before long it will spread outside the ward . . . into the real Snowfield! Any hero that sides with humanity ought to choose the option with the fewest sacrifices, and quickly! Sacrificing just one girl could save 800,000 people\u2014maybe even the whole human race!</p><p>\u201CYes,\u201D Jester\u2019s double continued gleefully, \u201Cthat mercenary you had your eye on might kill little Tsubaki before anyone else gets the chance! That has its charms! I\u2019d love to see you bound for anger and despair, betrayed by the man you trusted!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>She was already showing him anger, Assassin\u2019s murderous glare seemed to say as she hurled the last of the grotesqueries clinging to her out a broken window.</p><p>The wrathful, silent Assassin and the gleeful, loquacious hematophage faced each other. The two of them were almost in their own world.</p><p>Hansa, however, disregarded the mood and broke his silence.</p><p>\u201CHey, corpse.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . What, executor? Stay out of this. It\u2019s just getting good.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBack at the police station, you said you\u2019d deny the human order,\u201D Hansa continued in spite of Jester\u2019s obvious irritation. \u201CThat Dead Apostles exist to defile human history.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? And? Something that obvious should be common knowledge to an executor like you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat Assassin\u2019s part of human history. Aren\u2019t you going to deny her? You are defiling her, but that contempt doesn\u2019t come from denial. You\u2019re trying to defile her with that twisted lust of yours because you were charmed by her, because you couldn\u2019t deny her. You\u2019re trying to corrupt her. Am I wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . What\u2019s your point?\u201D</p><p>Jester erased all trace of expression from his face. Hansa ignored his question and coolly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201CBy the way, I told you before that bringing down you high-level Dead Apostles takes consecrated weapons, a singularity-user, or a high-level mage. . . . Remember that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo what? What are you buying time for? You\u2019re the ones who are short on\u2014\u201D</p><p>A Black Key sailed through Jester\u2019s double.</p><p>Just as it embedded itself in the wall behind him, Hansa said:</p><p>\u201CMy consecrated weapons can\u2019t reach your main body when it\u2019s not here . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CBut luckily . . . I\u2019ve got a high-level mage to help with that, Dorothea.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C\u2014\u201D</p><p>For an instant, time stopped for Jester.</p><p>Flat slipped into that momentary blank and activated his magecraft.</p><p>\u201CBegin interference!\u201D</p><p>The next moment, magical energy raced through the room in all directions, reflected off the Mystic Codes of the nuns hiding in scattered positions, and created a simplified current of magical energy.</p><p>It finished by concentrating into the Black Key that Hansa had thrown, and the spell activated.</p><p>\u201CGah?! . . . Wha . . . Gwaaah!\u201D</p><p>In an instant, Jester shuddered from head to toe. He was supposedly just a double, but he groaned with a look of agony on his face.</p><p>\u201C?!\u201D</p><p>Assassin was the one confused.</p><p>Not by the spell itself, and not by its ability to actually damage Jester.</p><p>The moment the priest called Jester \u201CDorothea,\u201D the hematophage had taken his attention off her completely with a look of obvious shock.</p><p>Jester fell to his knees and glared at Hansa with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201CDamn you. . . . What did you . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh . . . Flat, give us the rundown.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight! You\u2019re a double, so I just followed the currents of magical energy and attacked the real you!\u201D</p><p>\u201CImpossible,\u201D Jester spat at the nonchalant Flat, his face still contorted in pain. \u201CMy doubles are no ordinary . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201COh yes, I know that! You prepare a soul, or maybe I should say a core, for each one and transform by wearing them on your real body like Mystic Codes, right? So, you also make each double think and act independently, right? Then, you switch between them in a complicated way while basically running jamming\u2014or you do something like jamming to confuse us, and . . . Man, I had a hard time spotting the pattern! It took a while, but it was really fun!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou . . . saw through it? In this short a time . . .?\u201D</p><p>Consternation trumped pain on Jester\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201CWho the hell are you? No mage should be able to . . . Damn it. First that mercenary knew about my transformations, now this. . . . I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect a Holy Grail war to be easy. . . .\u201D</p><p>If the double\u2019s in as much pain as he looks, Hansa decided, the real one might be immobilized by now.</p><p>He was curious about what kind of spell Flat had sent the main body, but it was not the time for questions. He held his peace and observed.</p><p>As he did so, Jester shifted his attention to him.</p><p>\u201CBut that\u2019s not important. . . . What matters now is you, priest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat did I do? It\u2019s an honor to get such a shocked reaction just for calling your name. Oh, you don\u2019t have to hide it anymore: You were getting just a little full of yourself, weren\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t play dumb!\u201D Jester roared in a voice deeply tinged with hatred and agitation. \u201CYou bastard. . . . How did you know . . .?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, that info was legit,\u201D Hansa answered with a sigh. \u201CWill I have to give official thanks for this? . . . That wouldn\u2019t look good if it got out, considering my position.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>Jester looked confused. A moment later, however, a different voice filled the room.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWe have no need of your gratitude, bitter foe of ours.\u201D</p><p></p><p>The voice came from the pocket of Hansa\u2019s cassock.</p><p>He reached into it and pulled out a cell phone.</p><p>It was not the phone connected to a Lord of the Clock Tower; it was Hansa\u2019s own.</p><p>It must have been taking a call on speakerphone the entire time, and the caller whose voice issued from it must have remained silent throughout.</p><p>The owner of the voice, which was elegant but gave an impression of incredible depth, stated their reasons for working with Hansa.</p><p>\u201CI merely invested in a descendent of an old friend, not in you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat voice . . .\u201D</p><p>A dizzying array of expressions flashed across Jester\u2019s face.</p><p>Confusion, agitation, anger . . . and then despair.</p><p>\u201CAs compensation, I request the disposal of waste. That\u2019s all there is to it. You have no cause to thank me.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Mentally breaking out into a cold sweat at the \u201Cvoice\u201D that paid him no attention whatsoever, Jester could not help muttering:</p><p>\u201CWhy . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet me introduce you,\u201D Hansa coolly explained by way of pouring salt in his wounds. \u201CThis is the \u2018high-level mage\u2019 who agreed to lend me a hand.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t believe it. . . . Why would you do this . . .?!\u201D</p><p>Jester groaned at the agony coursing through every inch of his body, his face a mask of confusion.</p><p>\u201COh, that\u2019s simple!\u201D Flat answered without a hint of tension on his face.</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI figured a hematophage as strong as you must be pretty famous among other hematophage people, so I figured I\u2019d ask one I know!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Huh?\u201D</p><p>Jester let out a dumbfounded exclamation. Flat\u2019s tone was so carefree that he even forgot the pain he was in.</p><p>\u201CAnd there was only one hematophage I know that I\u2019d exchanged phone numbers with.\u201D</p><p>Flat gave a thumbs up, delighted that his prediction had been correct, and announced the name of the person on the other end of the phone call.</p><p></p><p>\u201CAnd . . . bingo! I just knew Mr. Van-Fem would know about you!\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Same Time, Fuyuki (Illusion)</p><p></p><p>\u201C? . . . What could that be? I had a feeling I just sensed something nasty.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSure it\u2019s not just your imagination?\u201D Prelati chimed in from beside the confused Francesca as he stuffed his face with sweets.</p><p>They had activated two illusions inside Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s ward-world using the Noble Phantasm Grand Illusion.</p><p>First, they had tricked the ward-world itself in order to trap Saber and Ayaka in an isolated space.</p><p>Second, they had cast an illusion to trick Saber and Ayaka\u2019s five senses.</p><p>Saber and Ayaka were currently seeing a vision of Fuyuki. It was as if they were decked out in VR gear from head to toe.</p><p>The Prelatis chatted happily as they watched Saber and Ayaka in Fuyuki through a mirror.</p><p>\u201CCome on! What do you like to eat while you watch movies, popcorn or churros? Whichever it is, you\u2019d better get it ready now! Donuts and hotdogs are good choices too! Don\u2019t you think so too, me (Francois)?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNow you\u2019re just showing off, me (Francesca). You know we didn\u2019t have any of those back when I died.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI hear popcorn\u2019s been around way longer than we have. On this continent, anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re kidding! Couldn\u2019t that have been the Age of Gods? Popcorn\u2019s incredible! Divine, even!\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CThis \u2018popcorn\u2019 sounds impressive. . . . I\u2019d like to try any dish with such a history.\u201D</p><p>Saber swallowed to keep his mouth from watering as he healed his wounded belly with his \u201Ccompanion\u2019s\u201D healing magecraft.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll treat you to as much as you want if we ever make it out of here.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka had given up on playing the straight man to Saber and was surveying their surroundings.</p><p>The large, red-headed man and the black-haired youth who seemed to be his Master who had charged into the castle still showed no sign of emerging from the door they had smashed.</p><p>Given that even the nearby flowers had stopped swaying, Francesca and Francois must have paused their illusion.</p><p>\u201COh well,\u201D a voice came from overhead again. \u201CYou might be better off skipping the snacks so you can focus! I mean, you\u2019d never get a chance to see a show this good while you were alive!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? I can hardly wait! Are you going to have me fight Alexander the Great in this illusion of yours?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat would be fun too, but it loses a lot of the impact when you realize it\u2019s an illusion. Of course, I can guarantee you an even more entertaining performance. I mean, the whole point is to show you something you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201D</p><p>As Francesca\u2019s voice spoke, the scenery began to move again.</p><p>After a short wait, the towering, red-haired man emerged from the large, broken door with a big barrel on his shoulder.</p><p>After him came the young man, who did indeed look nervous. Other figures followed.</p><p>\u201CIs that . . . Filia?!\u201D Ayaka could not help exclaiming. \u201CNo, she looks a little different. . . .\u201D</p><p>One was a beautiful woman with the same swaying, snow-white hair as Filia.</p><p>Beside her was a smaller woman a stern expression dressed in silver plate mail over a blue dress.</p><p>\u201C? Who\u2019s she? . . . She looks like a Heroic Spirit, but . . . a lady knight . . . Jeanne d\u2019Arc, maybe?\u201D Ayaka turned and asked Saber, suggesting a name she dredged up from somewhere in her memory.</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>She gasped in spite of herself.</p><p>Saber\u2019s usual, nonchalant grin was gone from his face. It was suffused with pure awe that precluded any other emotion, like he had just witnessed the beginning of the end of the world.</p><p>\u201C. . . Is this . . . a dream?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s an illusion. You said . . . Huh? Do you . . . know her?\u201D</p><p>Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s his wife, or sister, or daughter, or something. . . .</p><p>Ayaka worried that she might be someone close to him. Saber gave a little shake of his head without ever taking his eyes off the woman.</p><p>\u201CNo, I\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201D</p><p>\u201C? What do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait,\u201D the dumbfounded Saber managed to answer the confused Ayaka. \u201CI\u2019m checking with my companions. . . . Oh . . . I can\u2019t believe it. Oh . . .\u201D</p><p>Saber stood rooted to the spot, his fists clenched.</p><p>\u201CThere are only two reasons I\u2019m still on my feet and not on my knees right now,\u201D he told Ayaka.</p><p>\u201CWhat would you kneel for . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFirst, for all my faults, I\u2019m still a king myself. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people who acclaimed me if I bent the knee so easily.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka could not tell if Saber was speaking calmly or not. The next instant, however, she settled on \u201Cnot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSecond . . . I don\u2019t want to take my eyes off the legend I\u2019ve spent my whole life chasing, even for a second.\u201D</p><p>He did not even want to lower his gaze for the time it would take to kneel.</p><p>Saber\u2019s attitude told Ayaka who the girl in blue and silver was.</p><p>It told her, but she had trouble accepting it.</p><p>As far as she could remember, that hero, who even she had heard of, was supposed to be a man.</p><p>But Ayaka failed to think of any other solution and said the name aloud.</p><p></p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t tell me . . . that\u2019s King Arthur . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>The central hero of the legends of the Round Table who Richard\u2019s mother had told him so many stories about in Ayaka\u2019s dream, and who Saber had called \u201Cthe first king of my heart.\u201D</p><p>It was not easy for Ayaka to believe, but she could sense the woman\u2019s majestic bearing, and she exuded a quality that was not overshadowed by the massive Alexander the Great walking ahead of her.</p><p>\u201CHuh? But she\u2019s a girl. . . . Why?\u201D</p><p>\u201CArtoria Pendragon,\u201D a voice that only Ayaka and Saber could hear rang out from the sky, as if in answer to her question. \u201CThat\u2019s King Arthur\u2019s real name, you know. Make sure you never write it on a history test, though; you won\u2019t get credit for it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCould this be . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYup. Part of the Holy Grail War that happened in Fuyuki. It was about 15 years ago, though. Man, you wouldn\u2019t believe how lucky I am! You see, that lightning chariot just happened to break the castle\u2019s wards back then. I got a look at three kings all together!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThree?\u201D</p><p>Did that mean yet another king would be coming?</p><p>Ayaka only had a moment to wonder before that final king appeared before King Arthur and Alexander the Great with an air of displeasure.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>It was the golden hero who had beaten Saber in the church.</p><p>\u201CAh ha ha! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201D Francesca laughed at Ayaka\u2019s caution. \u201CI\u2019m just recreating scenes my familiars saw!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat for? . . . Why are you doing this?!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka glared angrily at the sky, and the boy and girl\u2019s voices answered.</p><p>\u201CWe just want to show you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah! And then we want to see how His Majesty reacts! It\u2019s what you call fifty-fifty! A win-win relationship!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ll fill you in as a show of respect for the Lionheart who was so popular with the masses. You\u2019ll get to know what the great \u2018King Arthur,\u2019 more famous than the Lionheart and above all his mental support and the foundation of his chivalry, is really like.\u201D</p><p>For an instant, noise ran through the world.</p><p>The scenery blurred in a way that made Ayaka imagine she could hear the buzz of static, and the world was instantly repainted.</p><p>No.</p><p>It continued to be repainted.</p><p>There was a view of the large bridge in Fuyuki.</p><p>There was a view of King Arthur fighting a spearman at the harbor.</p><p>There was a view of Heroic Spirits battling a giant monster in the river and a bizarre knight fused with a fighter jet.</p><p>There was a view of a mage mowing down a man in a wheelchair with a gun.</p><p>There was a view of a collapsing hotel.</p><p>Fantastic scenes set amid scenery that Ayaka recognized were flashing by in few-second increments.</p><p>But none of the humans or Heroic Spirits noticed Ayaka or Richard. Some of the figures even passed right through them.</p><p>They probably really were just \u201Cspectators\u201D\u2014unable to interfere or to be interfered with.</p><p>The dizzying, shifting scenery simply unnerved Ayaka.</p><p>The scenes included views of the Kurokizaka area, which she did not want to see.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of the Semina Apartments out of the corner of her eye for just an instant. That glimpse was enough to make Ayaka hallucinate that her heart was being crushed, and her breathing spontaneously grew ragged.</p><p>Just as she instinctively looked down, Francesca\u2019s voice rang out.</p><p>\u201CThat was just the preview! Don\u2019t you just love previews?! OK, time to show you our feature presentation! It\u2019s a fragmentary record of the fourth War . . . but we\u2019ve edited it into a nice documentary for you to enjoy! Well, spoilers, but it doesn\u2019t have a happy ending!\u201D</p><p>The footage shifted again, and this time it lasted more than a few seconds.</p><p>The woman who looked so much like Filia was getting off a plane at the airport, accompanied by a black-suited King Arthur.</p><p>It was like the opening scene of a movie. Letters floated in the air so that Ayaka could see them.</p><p>It was a charming logo that read, \u201CEditor: Francesca Prelati,\u201D in both Japanese and English.</p><p>The poor taste made Ayaka\u2019s cheek twitch, but a glance to her side revealed that Saber was still expressionless and still intently watching the scene unfold.</p><p>Saber . . .</p><p>Is that girl really the King Arthur you look up to so much . . .?</p><p>Saber\u2019s tense attitude was infectious, and Ayaka decided against looking away from the illusory world.</p><p>\u201CI hope you enjoy seeing your dear King Arthur\u2019s true colors,\u201D Francoise announced maliciously, perhaps realizing that his audience was hooked, as he played the unnatural sound of an intermission bell in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>\u201CAnd the moment her Master betrayed her and trampled on her wish.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off World, Crystal Hill, Top Floor</p><p></p><p>\u201CThat was a fascinating listening experience, Flat.\u201D</p><p>Flat responded to the voice from Hansa\u2019s cell phone speaker with a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201CThank goodness! You never said anything even though you were on speakerphone, so I thought you might be bored. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CI even got to hear a lecture from a Lord of the Clock Tower while I was at it. It was a deal with no downsides.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, Flat,\u201D the Lord in question\u2019s voice came from the cell phone on the altar. \u201CWhose voice was that? Unless my ears are playing tricks on me, I heard a name that came up a lot in connection to your hometown. . . . Did you call him even before you called me?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-Sorry, sir! I took turns calling both of you, but the connection to Monaco stabilized before the one to London, and . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was an excellent lecture, my Lord. It seems my fate is entwined with your students\u2019.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . My apologies for that occasion.\u201D</p><p>That was all El-Melloi II managed to say before he fell silent. The man on the other end of Hansa\u2019s phone, meanwhile, addressed Flat in a rich, deep voice, as if reminiscing about the past.</p><p>\u201CStill . . . this reminded me of the first time I heard an audio drama on the radio, about 80 years ago. I believe it was Le Comte de Monte-Cristo. Of course, today\u2019s villain was terribly stale in comparison.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>The voice was all Jester needed to realize that the last words were aimed at him.</p><p>That much was clear from the meaning of the words, but Jester had felt the speaker\u2019s gaze on an even more basic level.</p><p>He might not actually be watching, but he could probably grasp Jester\u2019s every move. Jester knew that he was dealing with a being on that level.</p><p>That being made a single request, as casually as he might order a morning coffee at a hotel.</p><p>\u201CFlat. This is a good opportunity, so dispose of it for me while you\u2019re at it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Jester\u2019s nerves froze.</p><p>He could immediately tell what the \u201Cit\u201D he could hear from the phone referred to.</p><p>That realization melted the shock and awe gripping his heart, and he finally spoke to the man on the other end of the call.</p><p>\u201CAre you . . . Are you really going to get in my way, Lord Vandelstam?!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>Jack was inwardly a little taken aback by the conversation.</p><p>I see.</p><p>It\u2019s not as though I doubted Flat\u2019s word . . . but he really does seem to be a hematophage of consequence.</p><p>He speaks like an amiable old gentleman, but behind that is the intimidating air of a powerful king.</p><p>Valery Fernand Vandelstam.</p><p>Alias, \u201CVan-Fem.\u201D</p><p>He was the \u201Chematophage acquaintance\u201D that Flat occasionally mentioned to Berserker, but it seemed he was a far more important figure in the underworld than Jack had imagined.</p><p>According to Hansa, he had been designated as one of just under thirty special, superior Dead Apostles and also possessed a \u201Chuman face\u201D as the head of one of the world\u2019s leading corporations.</p><p>He was a unique creature who had built up powerful connections to human society not through hematophage or Dead Apostle abilities, but through economic power and influence\u2014a terrifying hematophage who was powerful both as a human and as a Dead Apostle.</p><p>Of course, as far as Flat was concerned, he was just \u201Ca super-rich, super-strong hematophage who runs a casino on a fancy cruise ship back home.\u201D</p><p></p><p>That Dead Apostle, who had earned the nickname \u201CThe Devil,\u201D fell silent for a moment. When his voice came from the speaker, it sounded as if he were talking to himself more than answering Jester.</p><p>\u201CDead Apostles are those who deny human history. . . . Is that it?\u201D</p><p>He may have already decided that Jester was not worth talking to.</p><p>\u201CI see. That\u2019s quite right,\u201D he continued dispassionately, as if for Flat and Hansa\u2019s benefit. \u201CThat\u2019s precisely why you\u2019re repulsive. You say that you deny the human world, and all the while you\u2019re in love with a Ghost Liner\u2014a Heroic Spirit\u2014arguably the apotheosis of human history. It\u2019s what they call a double-standard.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t mind you having your fill of humans in bad faith. Conversely, you might fall for a fanatic with beautiful convictions, and it\u2019s only natural that you would treat individuals differently. But changing your stance as a Dead Apostle\u2014your way of being\u2014based on who you\u2019re dealing with? That\u2019s an unnecessary bug in the world.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Hansa was certain.</p><p>If Jester had defiled Assassin purely out of warped desire without making any claims to \u201Cdeny human history,\u201D this Dead Apostle called Van-Fem would not have done much, if anything.</p><p>He had no idea what Van-Fem would have done if Jester had claimed to seal away his nature as a Dead Apostle for the sake of love, but for the moment, at least, that was purely hypothetical. Hansa decided to shelve the question.</p><p>When Flat had told Van-Fem about Jester before he made contact with Lord El-Melloi II, Van-Fem had initially spoken warmly of him and called him a fellow affirmer of humanity. He might be decadent and inclined to destructive doctrines, but he was a Dead Apostle who at least saw humanity as worthy enough to plan a murder-suicide with.</p><p>But as soon as Hansa described the events at the police station\u2014how Jester had used his power to deny human history while claiming to love Assassin\u2014Van-Fem\u2019s demeanor had abruptly cooled.</p><p>That was when he had said Jester\u2019s true name, Dorothea.</p><p>It seemed clear that this powerful Dead Apostle governed himself according to strict rules and that Jester had broken them.</p><p>If Jester hadn\u2019t done that, I guess Van-Fem might have sided against us. This is why I hate dealing with Dead Apostles.</p><p></p><p>Van-Fem was the kind of big name that the Burial Agency, the organization that Hansa held in such high regard, would take on.</p><p>Hansa remained on his guard, not knowing when Van-Fem might intervene, but the Dead Apostle seemed to see right through him.</p><p>\u201CHansa, I believe you said your name is? Have no fear. Like the Lord of the Clock Tower, I\u2019m merely a spectator speaking on the front lines from a safe place. You have nothing to worry about.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMuch obliged. Speaking for the Church, I eagerly await a contribution from you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you take checks?\u201D The champion of finance replied calmly, unmoved by Hansa\u2019s jibe. \u201CI\u2019ve grown ecologically conscious lately. I\u2019d rather not consume any more energy with this long phone call.\u201D</p><p>Van-Fem said a brief goodbye and ended the call before Hansa was even sure if he were joking.</p><p>He had never conversed with Jester directly, and that more than anything showed that Van-Fem had severed ties with him.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, umm . . . Mr. Fem seemed really angry. Are you OK? If you\u2019re going to make up, I think you\u2019d better start with an email. Even if he won\u2019t take your calls, I\u2019m pretty sure his secretary checks all his emails.\u201D</p><p>Flat landed a critical follow-up hit on Jester, who was still on his knees and motionless.</p><p>Hansa concluded that this double was no longer a threat and directed the nuns with a gesture.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s too bad, but if you\u2019ve got the time to write emails, write the Church a confession. We\u2019re about to go hunt down your main body.\u201D</p><p></p><p>That was one of the fiends\u2019 leaders.</p><p>I could tell just from his voice. He\u2019s a dreadful enemy . . . but I\u2019ll worry about him later.</p><p>Assassin briefly hesitated about her course of action, then apparently decided that she did not have the time to fight a double and made to leave out a broken window\u2014toward where Kuruoka Tsubaki was.</p><p>But a massive form covered the broken window, standing in her way.</p><p>It was neither a smoke-like demonic beast nor a Kerberos; it was an even more pure symbol of death: a complete skeleton scorched and carbonized by jet-black flames.</p><p>One other notable feature was its height, which rivaled the building\u2019s.</p><p>\u201CWhoa! A giant\u2019s ghost?!\u201D</p><p>Flat was startled like an elementary schooler. Jester, meanwhile, slowly rose from his knees.</p><p>\u201CWhoa! A vampire\u2019s ghost?!\u201D</p><p>Flat was even more startled.</p><p>\u201CThe spell should still be effective,\u201D Jack chimed in, still in wristwatch form.</p><p>Jester might be a double, but that did not necessarily mean that he could not attack them.</p><p>The people around the room tensed while Jester remained downcast and silent. Then . . .</p><p>\u201C. . . Hee hee.\u201D</p><p>A soft chuckle escaped him.</p><p>\u201CI see. . . . So, I\u2019ve been scrapped as a Dead Apostle.\u201D</p><p>Jester\u2019s face was still ghostly pale as he broke into a grin with more than a hint of madness in it.</p><p>\u201CThen we\u2019re a perfect match now, my dear Assassin.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D</p><p>Assassin furrowed her brows, sensing something ominous.</p><p>\u201CYou were abandoned by your chiefs despite holding the strongest faith of anyone, and I was abandoned by the mainstream of the pro-humanity faction because I turned toward a stronger love than anyone. Yes, I see! So, this is the view you saw! Now I understand it in my soul! We truly were destined to be drawn to each other!\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop. You sound like a stalker who lost his job after the he got the cops called on him.\u201D</p><p>Hansa looked disgusted, but he did not have time to listen.</p><p>He turned his attention to the giant skeleton and considered whether he ought to destroy it or make his escape.</p><p>Then, a loud shock shook the building.</p><p>\u201C?!\u201D</p><p>It was obvious what had happened.</p><p>The giant skeleton had raised its arms and begun to punch the building.</p><p>\u201COh! This is beyond my wildest expectations! That\u2019s a world built on dreams and death for you; it\u2019s as if there\u2019s no end to its nightmares!\u201D</p><p>Jester became even more excited as he continued to smile through the pain wracking his body.</p><p>\u201CHave it your way, Lord Vandelstam! I\u2019ll prove it to you! I\u2019ll seize the Grail with my beloved Assassin, and we\u2019ll use its power to wake up the spider and wipe out the human race! I\u2019ll go back to affirming humanity when Assassin is the last remnant of the human order! When that time comes, I\u2019ll have you throw a party to bless us, Lord Vandelstam!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs it me, or has this guy stopped making sense?! Maybe I made the spell too strong. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D Hansa answered Flat\u2019s shout. \u201CHe was always like this.\u201D</p><p>Assassin, who also knew how Jester had been broken all along, planned her counterattack on the skeleton without hesitation.</p><p>Suddenly, the flames that spilled from the giant skeleton\u2019s mouth leapt toward Assassin.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>She deflected them with one of her Noble Phantasms, Capricious Fleeting Shadow: Zabaniya.</p><p>She held it at bay with writhing blades of hair, but then realized that another, equally gigantic skeleton had appeared on the opposite side of the building and her escape routes were almost totally cut off.</p><p>\u201CHa ha ha! Well now! It\u2019s on course to bring the whole building down! Oh, don\u2019t worry; no matter how much of the city it destroys, one wish from the master of this dream, and it will all go back to normal! Of course, that only goes for the buildings. . . . Oh, what a shame. This poor priest and nuns and mage are all going to die just because you came here!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDamn you . . .!\u201D Assassin snarled. Jester basked in her animosity and contentedly screwed up his eyes.</p><p>\u201COh, not good, not good! The altar!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey, Flat?! What\u2019s\u2014\u201D</p><p>Lord El-Melloi II\u2019s voice cut off. At the same time, the building let out a loud creak.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Crystal Hill tilted, and the skyscraper, a symbol of the city, loudly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>And Flat and the others on the top floor were . . .</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p></p><p>Fuyuki (Illusion)</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the Fuyuki Hyatt hotel was lavishly depicted within the illusion.</p><p></p><p>The event had taken place in the early stages of the fourth Holy Grail War, but thanks to Prelati\u2019s editing, it was overlapped with visuals of its climax, the \u201CGreat Fuyuki Fire,\u201D to close out the illusion with a more disastrous presentation.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>The illusion came to an end, and the visible world reverted to the Fuyuki forest.</p><p>No one else appeared, and there was no sign of anyone in the castle.</p><p>As a cold wind blew, Ayaka felt that she had to say something, but she could not even turn to face Saber.</p><p>The \u201Cillusion\u201D that the boy and girl had shown them had been a series of comically staged scenes, prankish in the extreme, but even she could understand that the presentation had been calculated to grate on the viewer\u2019s nerves.</p><p>She did not know about King Arthur the person.</p><p>But when she looked at Richard, whose upbringing had been founded not on King Arthur but on stories of him, she could sense how noble, brave, and majestic a figure he must have been in those legends.</p><p>Ayaka had only heard Richard speak about his admiration over the past few days and did not actually know the legend of King Arthur, but even she had begun to develop a mental image of him as someone who \u201Cmust be pretty incredible,\u201D even if she did not really know why.</p><p>But that was precisely why . . .</p><p>Ayaka had not been able to bring herself to check the look on Richard\u2019s face when he saw King Arthur in that illusion.</p><p></p><p>All in all, you could say that it had not been made to idly slander \u201CKing Arthur.\u201D</p><p>It had not depicted King Arthur as a vicious murderer or a cowardly weakling. Even Ayaka had been able to grasp that she really must be noble.</p><p>But what they had ultimately been shown was the reality that even with her nobility and aspirations to justice, some things were still beyond her.</p><p>The other kings had refuted her principles, and she had major disagreements with the Master in whose hands she placed her fate.</p><p>Ultimately, she had destroyed the Grail using her own holy sword in a betrayal by her Master.</p><p>As a result, the city of Fuyuki had suffered an unprecedented disaster.</p><p>Ayaka had been unable to bear the final scene of the illusion, which placed them standing in the center of a mountain of charred corpses, and had no choice but to keep looking down.</p><p>Ayaka thought about one scene that the illusion had rubbed in their faces.</p><p>The words that each of the three kings had said when they drank together.</p><p></p><p>The golden King of Heroes said:</p><p>\u201CA king\u2019s principles ought to be the laws that he himself laid down.\u201D</p><p>The red-haired King of Conquerors said:</p><p>\u201CA king is someone who conquers and overruns all riches and all reason, starting from his own body.\u201D</p><p>And the blue and silver King of Knights said:</p><p>\u201CA king should be someone who sacrifices himself to the path that leads to righteous ideals in order to grant his people salvation.\u201D</p><p>The King of Knights went on to declare her own wish for the Grail.</p><p>\u201CI will turn time back to the ritual of the sword of selection, and if there is a more fitting king than me, I will start British history over again by entrusting it to them.\u201D</p><p>She had heard about that ritual at the beginning of Richard\u2019s mother\u2019s bedtime story. It had supposedly decided that Arthur would be king.</p><p>It seemed like the King of Knights had thought that since she had ultimately destroyed her kingdom, if there were anyone better than her, that person should rule it.</p><p>But when they heard her declaration, the King of Conquerors grew quietly angry, and the golden king laughed at it.</p><p>The King of Knights said that she would \u201Canswer her people\u2019s prayers for salvation.\u201D The King of Conquerors had angrily disagreed, saying, \u201CA selfless king can\u2019t lead his people. The people will never admire a slave to righteousness.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CSacrificing everything you are on the altar of righteousness is no way for a human to live.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CKing of Conquerors, how can you be so certain that a reign that abandons humanity is worse than a human one?\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CHehe. King of Knights, someday that attitude will uplift you from humanity to divinity.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhy do you laugh, King of Heroes? If that were humanly possible, why hesitate?\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou think so? The goddesses I know were unreasonableness personified, always forcing their own ideas of righteousness onto the people.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CListen, King of Knights, I know I\u2019m one to talk, seeing as legend has it I\u2019m a descendant of Zeus . . . but chasing godlike righteousness is a path that ends in culling your people.\u201D</p><p></p><p>The debate had continued for a little longer, and then assailants had appeared, signaling an end to the discussion before the King of Knights had a chance to make a final retort.</p><p>The argument had actually gone on longer, but Ayaka did not remember all of it.</p><p>She had been beside herself, overwhelmed by pressure from the red-haired king and a strange terror of the golden king.</p><p>If there had not been an attack, maybe the King of Knights would have made an effective retort.</p><p>Ayaka and Saber had not been able to see her face from their position.</p><p>They could only imagine what her expression had been.</p><p>They had no way of knowing if Francesca and Francois had deliberately hidden it from them, or if they had not been able to see the King of Knights\u2019 face either.</p><p>Had she been bowled over by the King of Conqueror\u2019s angry speech like Ayaka?</p><p>Or had she been unperturbed, convinced that there was no flaw in her kingship?</p><p>The golden king had said, sadistically, that he \u201Cenjoyed the King of Knights\u2019 look of agony,\u201D but had she really looked distressed? And if so, what had she been distressed about?</p><p>Ayaka did not know.</p><p>Would Saber know?</p><p>As she wondered, the scenery changed. In the end, Ayaka would never be able to learn if the King of Knights could have said something to the other kings in her own defense.</p><p>But Saber\u2019s words about living for the people had seemed right to Ayaka, so she had been more than a little shocked to hear the other kings meet them with anger and scorn.</p><p>It felt like a rejection of the Lionheart, who had saved her, although she was not one of his people.</p><p></p><p>The scenes conjured up in the illusion really were recreations of events observed by familiars.</p><p>They also included reproductions of information obtained from a master of Mystic Eyes that could see the past, who had been hired at great expense.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Fuyuki Holy Grail War was overseen by the Makiri, and the ward created by their insects was powerful. Francesca had not been able to see everything.</p><p>Of course, she could not see what each participant felt about it in their own minds.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there were many parts that she had known about but deliberately kept from the Lionheart.</p><p>Francesca knew that Fuyuki\u2019s Grail had been contaminated by \u201Cmud.\u201D</p><p>She had not been able to observe events immediately before or after its destruction, so she did not know what had been going through the mind of Saber\u2019s Master.</p><p>She could, however, guess that destroying the grail had, in a sense, been the correct decision.</p><p>And the illusion she had edited together gave no hint of that.</p><p>The Lionheart and Ayaka had only seen a film.</p><p>The flash at the moment the Grail was destroyed, seen from the perspective of a familiar far outside the city, and the vision of hell that had overflowed into Fuyuki as a result.</p><p>The detail that Command Spells had been used for the destruction of the Grail was only narration, inserted as speculation.</p><p>But given that it was hard to imagine King Arthur choosing to destroy the Grail voluntarily, there was no reason not to accept it.</p><p>And Ayaka\u2019s honest impression was that the \u201Cpath\u201D King Arthur had just walked was a frighteningly raw vision of \u201Cwar,\u201D a far cry from the \u201Ctales of chivalry\u201D that Richard\u2019s mother had told him.</p><p>She had seen fierce sneak attacks.</p><p>She had seen the king rejected by her Master.</p><p>She had seen the king\u2019s allies take a woman hostage and gun down unresisting opponents.</p><p>And . . . she had seen the king lop off the heads of those half-dead mages.</p><p>You could say that that was normal in war and leave it at that.</p><p>But even so, it had been far from Ayaka\u2019s mental image of a \u201Cbattle of heroes\u201D and rubbed her nose in just what kind of fight she was currently caught up in. It was all she could do to resist the urge to vomit out of fear.</p><p>Are you telling me that someone about my age fought through that kind of horrible treatment . . .?</p><p>What expression had King Arthur worn as she raced across that battlefield?</p><p>Her face had not been shown in any of her difficulties, and Ayaka could not tell if she had been shocked or totally unfazed.</p><p>But . . . she thought that either one might distance her from the hero tales that Richard had admired.</p><p>Wavering in the face of a cruel fate would be one thing, but if she were calmly accepting a cruel fate . . . then, as the other kings had said, that would not be human; it would be a mechanical \u201Csystem.\u201D</p><p>And even though she had gone that far, in the end she had been betrayed by her Master and failed to gain anything.</p><p>\u201CAll this happened in Fuyuki . . .? I\u2019ve heard about the great fire, but . . .\u201D</p><p>It was certainly a tragic sight on its own, but what concerned Ayaka was that it had been edited to look as if King Arthur were a pitiful loser.</p><p>That was why, even as she fought her growing urge to vomit, Ayaka glared at the direction the Prelatis\u2019 voices had come from even before she tried to say anything to Saber.</p><p>\u201CYeah, OK. For starters, I\u2019ve learned that you two are the worst.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh ha ha ha! Hold back on the praise; you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Don\u2019t let them get to you, Saber. It\u2019s an illusion, right? I bet they made it all up! That argument between the kings is all lies for sure!\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Are you sure?\u201D Francesca teased. \u201CIf it\u2019s all lies, then everything the King of Knights had to say for herself is made up too.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka was at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201CW-Well . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell? How about it? What do you think? They say people only believe what they want to . . . but you never even had an image of King Arthur you wanted to believe in to begin with, did you? If you had to say, I guess it\u2019d be a perfect, cool, irrefutable King of Knights that wouldn\u2019t disappoint your bodyguard Lionheart. Am I wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s not . . . Anyway, that ending makes no sense. Her Master had no reason to destroy the Grail! Maybe the King of Knights did get the Grail! And such a great king would never wish to redo history and make someone else king in the first\u2014\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, that\u2019s good! I love that reaction! That\u2019s the kind of opinion you can only get from a complete outsider who doesn\u2019t know the first thing about the Holy Grail War! Talk about exciting! But that\u2019s true. . . . I\u2019d love to find out what would\u2019ve happened if Artie had gotten her hands on that Grail! Worst case scenario, the mud would time slip and . . . No, that could never . . .\u201D</p><p>Francesca started mumbling incomprehensibly. Ayaka was irritated but fell silent for a little while.</p><p>Then, she looked Saber, who had kept silent up to that point, in the face.</p><p>Just then, Francesca and Francois started jeering tauntingly at Saber.</p><p>\u201CSo, what\u2019d you think, little Lionheart?! The heroic king you idolized all that time wanted a redo of her legend going all the way back to the start of her kingdom. . . . How\u2019d it feel to find that out? How\u2019d it feel to see that she was a tyrant who would\u2019ve tried to scrap your history if she\u2019d gotten the Grail?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s your impression of the pitiful story of how your precious, legendary King Arthur kept fighting and winning but still couldn\u2019t get anything in the end?! How did you feel seeing the other kings completely deny her?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CShut up! You set it all up! You can\u2019t fool Saber with . . .\u201D</p><p>Ayaka was frightened.</p><p>Frightened because Saber, who was always so talkative, had not said a word since the appearance of that king in blue.</p><p>No cries of admiration or surprise. She could not even tell that Saber was right next to her.</p><p>He had been shown a king who failed to gain anything, who had been treated as a mage\u2019s tool, had slaughtered helpless people on the verge of death, and ended up having even the wish she had gone that far for betrayed.</p><p>When Ayaka thought about the state his heart must be in, she felt like she had to say something to him, but she had never managed to find the right words.</p><p>But while she worried, Saber broke his silence.</p><p>\u201CFrancesca Prelati.\u201D</p><p>Ayaka instinctively looked over at Saber\u2019s face and found it completely expressionless. But was it her imagination, or was there a gleam in his eyes?</p><p>Or maybe, Ayaka began to think, he was so shocked that he had been crying in despair . . .</p><p>But it was actually the opposite.</p><p>Without moving from his spot, Saber honored the illusory world with his finest bow.</p><p>\u201CIf you are the compiler of this illusion . . . then you must know how much it means for one who calls himself a king to bow to another.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber . . .?\u201D</p><p>While Ayaka stared at him in bewilderment, Saber delivered a ringing speech straight from his soul.</p><p>\u201CBut I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for telling me . . . a new tale of the great King of Knights\u2019 heroism . . .!\u201D</p><p>When they realized what emotion that growing flow of words was charged with, not only Ayaka, but even Francesca and Francois showed signs of confusion.</p><p></p><p>It was overwhelming delight.</p><p></p><p>If the gleam in his eyes had been tears, they must have been tears of gratitude and joy.</p><p>\u201CSaber . . . what are you . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAyaka . . . did you see that King of Knights . . . and think that she was not a hero?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Ayaka . . . I know all about the king being betrayed, or unreasonable, or ending up battered and losing everything in the legends of the Round Table. But I adore it all, including that.\u201D</p><p>Richard slowly began to explain to the confused-looking Ayaka like a little boy talking about his favorite baseball team.</p><p>\u201CAnd . . . in that argument at that drinking party, the other two didn\u2019t reject the King of Knights.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? But . . . the way they shouted and . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CThink about it. Alexander the Great just shouted. I\u2019m certain he doesn\u2019t reject the King of Knight\u2019s kingship. He called her a figurehead, said that she was tied down by an idol of a king, and more besides, but he never actually rejected the idol. He was just saying, \u2018I recognize what you accomplished, but I don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally?\u201D Ayaka said, surprised that Saber, far from losing his cool, was speaking more calmly than usual.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m just parroting my mother, but \u2018a king doesn\u2019t walk a noble path; his people call the path he\u2019s walked noble.\u2019 It\u2019s easy for right and wrong to shift depending on time and place and the moods of subjects and vassals. So, that argument never had a right answer, and the three arguing must have known that better than anyone. They were trying to gauge sense, not righteousness.</p><p>\u201CBut you know, our King of Knights did lag behind the other kings in one thing!\u201D Richard, still standing proud, joked to Ayaka. \u201CHer voice just wasn\u2019t as loud! I agree with all the kings, and I disagree with them too! It\u2019s only natural for kings who lived in different times and different places from me to each have their own ideas about kingship! But people who loudly declare that they\u2019re the one who\u2019s right in the end are strong. Phillip was like that on crusade.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re taking it that way?\u201D There was a hint of confusion in the Prelatis\u2019 voices. \u201CI was sure you\u2019d either lose it and trash-talk the other two kings or lose hope in Artie and have to drop the happy-go-lucky act.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Hang on, is he even surprised that King Arthur was a girl?\u201D</p><p>The pair dropped the emotion from their tones and asked:</p><p>\u201C. . . I knew it. You know, don\u2019t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomehow or other, you found your way to the real legend of King Arthur\u2014I mean Artoria Pendragon\u2014involved with magecraft. . . . Am I wrong?\u201D</p><p>Richard ignored the Prelatis\u2019 questions and did a big stretch in place.</p><p>\u201CI thought so. So, that\u2019s what you were really after. You wanted to find out how deep I penetrated into the King of Knights\u2019 history, didn\u2019t you? Well, I\u2019m sorry to say that I never managed to find the tower Merlin was imprisoned in.\u201D</p><p>Then, he made his expression blank and lost himself deep in thought, staring up at the sky.</p><p>\u201COh . . . but they truly were magnificent. . . . Alexander the Great, and that gaudy one, and our first king were all \u2018kings\u2019 beyond anything I imagined.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber?\u201D Ayaka called to him, concerned that he was talking to himself and worried that he might be in shock after all.</p><p>At that, Saber slowly lowered his face and said, with downcast eyes:</p><p>\u201CAyaka.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWh-What?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka looked confused.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve decided . . . to accept the resolve you showed earlier after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka stared blankly at Saber, who spread his arms wide in front of her, making no attempt to hide his damaged armor.</p><p>\u201CPlease . . . allow me to try meeting you one more time.\u201D</p><p>Richard made a theatrical bow and smoothly took Ayaka\u2019s right hand.</p><p></p><p>\u201CI ask you:\u201D</p><p></p><p>The king and girl harmonized beautifully with the magnificent castle in the forest behind them and blended into the scenery.</p><p>It was just like a scene out of a tale of heroism recounted in numerous legends.</p><p></p><p>\u201CAre you my Master?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>A Closed-off Town, Central Intersection</p><p></p><p>\u201CHang in there! The Kerberoses aren\u2019t moving! Push through!\u201D</p><p>Now that the Kerberoses were pinned down by the rain of sweets, John and the other police officers were making a desperate effort to regroup, but their situation was dire.</p><p>The smaller grotesqueries kept coming from somewhere in the city no matter how many they took down.</p><p>Some of the officers were trying to cast healing spells on their seriously injured comrades, but rats swarmed the open wounds, hindering their efforts.</p><p>And as if to add insult to injury, a sound like the earth shaking engulfed the area.</p><p>\u201C! What the . . .\u201D</p><p>Vera looked up and spotted them.</p><p>Giant skeletons as tall as Crystal Hill had pushed the building over, collapsing it with sheer brute force.</p><p>Fragments of the building rained down. The officers who could still move did their best to fend them off, but it seemed that they could not keep that up forever, and one by one they collapsed to the asphalt.</p><p>\u201CShit. . . . Is this it for us . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot yet! Don\u2019t throw in the towel while you can still move!\u201D John answered another officer with a shake of his head.</p><p>It was true that that world had been undergoing one metamorphosis after another for some time.</p><p>If they could hold out a little longer, something might change again.</p><p>Although up to that point, everything but the rain of sweets had been a change for the worse. . . .</p><p>A shadow fell on John and the other officers. It was cast by the foot of one of the giant skeletons that had just toppled the building.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>So, this is it.</p><p>John and the other officers glared disappointedly up at the jet-black skeleton shrouded in black flames.</p><p>Above their heads, the skeleton\u2019s gargantuan foot stamped down . . . when a band of light shot out from somewhere and blasted the bony foot to smithereens.</p><p>\u201C?!\u201D</p><p>The band of light fired through the gaps in the buildings a second and then a third time.</p><p>Just a few seconds later, the skyscraper-sized skeleton had been reduced to black bone dust on the wind.</p><p>And some of the officers recognized those bands of light.</p><p>They came from the Noble Phantasm that Saber had used in his battle with Gilgamesh on the church roof.</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . Sorry, I took a little nap.\u201D</p><p>With that, Saber appeared from behind a building.</p><p>At the sight of him, John cracked a wry smile and said:</p><p>\u201CYou sure look like you\u2019re in a good mood. Pleasant dreams?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come true,\u201D Saber replied with a shrug, then called to Ayaka, who was walking behind him.</p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t that right, Master?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2019Ayaka\u2019 is fine,\u201D Ayaka said with a shrug. \u201CSo, what is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m truly sorry,\u201D Saber explained. \u201CI\u2019m about to make a childish demand.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSelfish how?\u201D</p><p>The pair looked up at the sky as they talked.</p><p>Their eyes were locked on the towering, jet-black skeletons that had appeared to replace the Kerberoses busy gorging themselves on sweets.</p><p>More skeletons than the city had skyscrapers, all every bit as gigantic as the one Saber had just blown away, had appeared and were closing in on them.</p><p>But Saber was beaming, and even Ayaka, although visibly nervous, showed no sign of running away and stared down that swarm of monsters head-on.</p><p>\u201CI want to use the Holy Grail for something incredibly selfish.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGo ahead. Is it bringing songs back with you to that \u2018Throne\u2019 place?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not quite.\u201D</p><p>Saber shook his head, and then announced in a clear voice:</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s a place that I want to use the Grail\u2019s power . . . to fill with song.\u201D</p><p>John and the other officers, who were watching Saber from behind during the conversation, widened their eyes in surprise.</p><p>Before they knew it, there were five figures following behind Saber and Ayaka.</p><p>Two of them were the lance-wielding knight and the archer that they had seen earlier.</p><p>Another was a man dressed like a hunter hiding his face with a hood who must have been hiding in the shadows at that time.</p><p>There was also a strangely dressed knight carrying countless swords on his back and a sphere of water floating close beside him.</p><p>\u201CWho are they . . .?\u201D</p><p>They were slowly walking toward the grotesque swarm, ignoring the police officers\u2019 questions.</p><p>\u201CSorry, I used up the Kerberos fang just now. . . . Would you lend me a sword?\u201D</p><p>At Saber\u2019s request, the knight with countless swords on his back gave a listless shrug and tossed him a decorative sword that was beautiful but seemed well-worn, sheathe and all.</p><p>\u201CThank you.\u201D</p><p>Saber caught the sword, and as he drew it, said:</p><p>\u201CWe\u2019re probably up against the Grim Reaper, and this whole world is his forces.\u201D</p><p>Saber grinned broadly and broke into an energetic run.</p><p>\u201CIt will be a worthy opponent!\u201D</p><p>As if in answer, the knights and archers behind him fanned out, and the hooded man vanished before anyone knew what was happening.</p><p>The sphere of water floated lightly around Ayaka, looking as if it were guarding her.</p><p>And then . . . their \u201Cwar\u201D began.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>\u201CWow! It\u2019s getting crazy down there! Do you think those are all Heroic Spirits?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CPipe down. You\u2019ll defeat the purpose of the concealment spell.\u201D</p><p>Watching Saber\u2019s group fight from the air were Flat and Jack, who had supposedly been left behind on the top floor of Crystal Hill.</p><p>Flat was wearing something like a bizarre parachute and falling at a much slower rate than a normal parachute would allow.</p><p>Beside him, Hansa and the nuns were descending on identical parachutes. If not for Flat\u2019s concealment spell, it would have looked like a midair show.</p><p>\u201CStill, Hansa, it\u2019s a good think we searched the room in advance.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah,\u201D Hansa answered one of the nuns, \u201CI can\u2019t believe there were so many parachutes in there. And these aren\u2019t ordinary commercial models; they\u2019re practically Mystic Codes with special magecraft built in. They needed charging with magical energy, though. . . . Did the faction using that workshop plan for the whole building getting taken down?\u201D</p><p>The parachutes were copies of objects in the real-world suite.</p><p>The King of Heroes, who had once said, \u201CI shall at least lend you a parachute,\u201D had put his words into practice and had outfitted the suite with enough for Tine and her subordinates in addition to his furnishings and decorations, but of course Flat and the others had no way of knowing that.</p><p>Then, surveying the battle between Saber and the swarm of \u201Cdeath\u201D unfolding below them, Hansa calmly stated:</p><p>\u201C. . . We\u2019d better land a good distance from them so we won\u2019t get caught in that.\u201D</p><p>Noting that the cityscape he could see from the air was being steadily overrun with darkness, he added:</p><p>\u201COf course, it doesn\u2019t look like anywhere in this city is \u2018out\u2019 of that anymore. . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>As he raced through the city full of \u201Cdeath\u201D made manifest, Saber\u2019s heart was filled with delight.</p><p>I knew that King Arthur would be just as the legends said.</p><p>If he relaxed at all, his trembling heart would bring tears of joy to his eyes.</p><p>Her conduct is praiseworthy. Whether she was entrusted the thread by another or spun it herself, she would spin it over again as many times as it takes to raise a flag that will never fall over her land.</p><p>His body moved instinctively, cutting down a second skeletal grotesquery and then a third.</p><p>It\u2019s true that I might have taken a different path, and that I might not choose to start over.</p><p>His movements picked up speed with each one he dispatched. By the time his body count passed ten, he had already reached his top speed from his battle with the golden Heroic Spirit.</p><p>But what does that matter? Those are trifles. We just have different values.</p><p>Matching pace with Saber\u2019s struggle, his retinue of knights and archers were bringing down the surrounding monstrosities one after another.</p><p>\u201CWhen you praise conviction, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s right or wrong!\u201D</p><p>Before he knew it, he was shouting.</p><p>Unable to contain his overflowing emotions, he gave voice to his joy as he raced up buildings at high speeds.</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s why I praise her! No matter how the King of Conquerors shows his anger! No matter how the oldest King of Heroes scoffs!\u201D</p><p>To be frank, Richard did understand why the King of Conquerors had been angry.</p><p>He had a good impression of Alexander as well, but that did not mean he objected to King Arthur\u2019s intentions.</p><p>After all, the Lionheart had walked a completely different path of kingship from all three.</p><p>That was why he celebrated.</p><p>Celebrated the King of Knights\u2019 ideals and convictions that had shaped his own chivalry.</p><p>\u201CI approve her chivalry, her drive to realize her own ideals even if it meant undoing what her subjects accomplished! That tyranny is just another proof of kingship!\u201D</p><p>Richard declared that the King of Knights\u2019 desire to sacrifice herself for an ideal was \u201Ctyranny\u201D and that he approved of it for that very reason.</p><p>The police officers who heard him looked confused. Ayaka heaved a big sigh and grinned that it was \u201Cjust like him.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C. . . But great King Arthur, you\u2019re caught in one misconception,\u201D Saber said, his face clouding slightly with anxiety.</p><p>Then, he expressed his feelings as if advising someone who was not there.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/esPkVVk.png" alt=""></p><p>\u201CFirst king of our chivalry! You can\u2019t see! The country built by the Round Table and destroyed by the Round Table doesn\u2019t need a fresh start!\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CKing Arthur really did lead us to Avalon!\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>\u201CUgh. Just listen to him rattle on. Artie has it rough with people piling expectations on her even after she\u2019s dead. What would our teachers think?\u201D</p><p>Prelati poked his head out of a building whose sides had partially collapsed and stared at Saber in exasperation.</p><p>\u201CDarn. Still, I figured he\u2019d show us something uglier, but it\u2019s hopeless; he\u2019s incurable,\u201D the girl who popped up beside him said cheerfully, twirling her umbrella. \u201CHe\u2019s the type that\u2019s seriously convinced he\u2019s living in an epic. If he were set on one goal, he might end up like dear little Jeanne.</p><p>\u201CBut what\u2019s the problem? I get a kick out of that king! I bet he\u2019ll keep stirring up all kinds of trouble! It\u2019d be no fun if he got crushed by gods or whatever and this turned into a one-sided slaughter! As promoters-slash-spectators, we\u2019ve got to keep things entertaining and provide a top-notch bloodbath!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI never said I don\u2019t like him. That\u2019s why I wanted to see his face crumple up as he bawled his eyes out.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I\u2019m with you there!\u201D</p><p>Francesca narrowed her eyes and stared raptly with a devilish grin.</p><p>\u201CBesides . . .\u201D</p><p>Stared not at Saber, but at Ayaka Sajou, who had accepted her position as his Master.</p><p>\u201CI bet it\u2019d be fun to switch things up and go after that girl next time . . . right?\u2729\u201D</p><p></p><p>Prelati looked at Francesca, shrugged, and then looked up at the sky with a grin of his own.</p><p>\u201CSo, what now? The hematophage\u2019s presence is weaker now; want to go finish him off?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood point. Either way, no matter how many big skeletons they beat up, it won\u2019t get them out of this . . .\u201D Francesca began to say, looking out over the dark-stained world, when she spotted a change and trailed off in mid-sentence.</p><p>\u201CHmm? What\u2019s that?</p><p></p><p>\u201CNo way! Oh wow! I know it\u2019s just one city . . . but don\u2019t tell me Lionheart\u2019s gonna overwhelm a \u2018world\u2019?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Having raced up to the roof of the tallest building in the city after Crystal Hill, Saber paused to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201CGreat first king of ours! I will prove it!\u201D</p><p>An especially large, jet-black skeleton stood blocking his path.</p><p>It was the product of multiple skeletons fused together, and countless bones sprouted wildly from its back like a thousand-armed Kannon.</p><p>Faced with that grotesque monster, Saber continued carve his panegyric to King Arthur into the world without the least fear.</p><p>\u201CThe path of kingship you walked was no mistake!\u201D</p><p>Then, Saber kicked the roof and soared high into the air.</p><p>\u201CThe kingship and pride that the Round Table left behind gave birth to us! Tragedy and ruin polished our souls! I will show you and the Round Table that the splendor of humanity\u2014of chivalry\u2014will never fail!\u201D</p><p>Slipping past the jet-black flames that closed in on him, Saber unleashed a shining slash with all his might.</p><p>\u201CIt was you we saw something to admire in! And we\u2019ll go on seeing it, Arthur, our first king!\u201D</p><p>All the while singing out the wish he held up at the top of his lungs.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve already lost the right . . .\u201D</p><p>Then, after smiling in self-mockery for just a moment, he set a radiance that sent hope to some unknown person in his eyes and in his voice as he shouted:</p><p>\u201CBut someday, someone else will reach you in paradise! I know they will! The planet\u2019s history that you wove will send a wind of peace to you! I have only to play notes to bless it!</p><p></p><p>\u201CWith the power of the Holy Grail . . .

Jester! What\u2019s wrong?!\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki ran over to the young Jester when she saw him suddenly collapse.</p><p>Sigma, who was looking on, inspected Jester\u2019s body.</p><p>Is this a mystical attack?</p><p>It probably disrupts the target\u2019s Magic Circuits directly by unleashing out-of-control, foreign magical energy inside their body.</p><p>He had not noticed any projectile spell like Gandr.

Could I finish him off now?</p><p>But it would be better to move Tsubaki somewhere else first.</p><p>It was less that Sigma did not want to show Tsubaki anything gruesome and more that if she perceived him as a murderer, \u201CMr. Black\u201D\u2014presumably her Servant\u2014might target him.</p><p>\u201CTsubaki,\u201D Sigma told her, \u201Ccall your mom and dad.\u201D</p><p>\u201CO-OK!\u201D She answered, trembling, and dashed off up the stairs.</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Once he had watched her leave, Sigma took a mystic tool from his belt.</p><p>It was a syringe of a liquid drug useful only in encounters with hematophages and certain summoned beasts.</p><p>The drug\u2019s effects were on par with holy water. It would normally have no effect on a hematophage of Jester\u2019s level.</p><p>But in his current state, Sigma decided, it was worth a try.</p><p>He looked over the boy Jester as if giving him a medical examination and placed a hand on the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201C. . . Heh . . . Ha ha ha. It won\u2019t work, mister. That stuff will only kill this child\u2019s conceptual core.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaybe, but it\u2019s worth a try.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHang on.

I need full consent to load them. . . .\u201D</p><p>Jester explained his own magecraft through his pain, but Sigma doubted that any mage would show his hand. The information was probably either nonsense or nearly worthless.</p><p>Sigma decided that Jester must be playing for time and coolly began to stab the syringe into him, when . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201C\u2014\u201D</p><p></p><p>A young child\u2019s scream rang out from the room above.</p><p>\u201C?!\u201D</p><p>The young Jester took advantage of that brief opening to kick Sigma in the gut as he continued to groan.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Sigma put distance between himself and Jester, but the scream had not stopped.</p><p>He saw that Jester was on his feet, although he appeared to be in pain, and decided that he could not finish him off at present.</p><p>Sigma immediately changed course, grabbed the crossbow off the table where he had left it, and leapt straight for the stairs.</p><p>If push comes to shove, will I be able to use it?</p><p>The crossbow was well-maintained, but he did not know if he could fire it immediately.</p><p>Even so, the strange beauty in red had made a point of entrusting it to him, so he thought that it would be useful for some future decision and decided to take it with him.</p><p>It could be a trap . . . but the more information, the better.</p><p>It was partly a gamble, but most of his jobs from Francesca had included an optional objective to \u201Cbring back stuff that looks like it might be fun if you see any,\u201D so he did not feel much reluctance.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t look like it contains any spells that curse the holder to death.</p><p>. . .

There\u2019s blood and . . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin saw that Tsubaki was on the verge of tears and spoke to Tsubaki in a gentle, reassuring voice as she shifted her clothes to hide her injuries.</p><p>\u201CYes, I\u2019ll be fi\u2014\u201D</p><p>She was sent flying by a shadowy grotesquery that appeared from beside her.</p><p>\u201CNgh . . .\u201D</p><p>Assassin fought back using the shadows that stretched from the gaps in her clothing, but the monsters appeared one after another and attempted to overwhelm her with numbers.</p><p>If her enemies had had a main body or a core of some kind, Assassin would be able to turn the tables on them using the appropriate Noble Phantasm.</p><p>But Sigma had already realized that the entire ward-world was fused with their enemy\u2019s main body.</p><p>Meaning that its \u201Ccore\u201D could only be Kuruoka Tsubaki.</p><p>\u201CMiss!\u201D</p><p>A panicked Tsubaki tried to run to Assassin, but her parents\u2019 arms held her back.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s not safe, Tsubaki.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right. You wouldn\u2019t want to be caught up in that.\u201D</p><p>Their voices were kind, but their expressions were clearly out of place in the situation around them.</p><p>That sense of discomfort drove a wedge deep into Tsubaki, who was after all a child.</p><p>Her unease grew, and she looked like she was about to cry as she shouted:</p><p>\u201CWhy?! Aren\u2019t they Mr. Black\u2019s friends?! Why are those monsters hurting Miss Assassin?!\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CWell . . . that\u2019s because she\u2019s trying to kill you.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201C!\u201D</p><p>A boy\u2019s voice came from behind the group.</p><p>It was Jester, who had climbed out of the underground workshop.</p><p>He was still in the form of a young boy and tormented by Flat\u2019s spell, but he forced himself to smile and speak to Tsubaki.</p><p>\u201CThat lady says you being alive is a problem.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop,\u201D Sigma quietly ordered.</p><p>But Jester continued, even as his whole body shook with pain.</p><p>\u201CYes! That goes for Mister Sigma there too. . . . They\u2019re bad people who want to kill you to help themselves.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . You\u2019re wrong.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe? . . . What for?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don\u2019t have to care. You\u2019re the queen of this world; just do whatever you feel like. You want to become a Magician and get your parents to praise you, right? Don\u2019t worry; you can do it. I\u2019m on your side.\u201D</p><p>Jester was taking every opportunity to emphasize that he was a \u201Cfriend.\u201D</p><p>He was probably trying to avoid being attacked by making Tsubaki see him as an ally.</p><p>Assassin was currently not drawing on magical energy from Jester, but from a Master called Ayaka via Saber. Taken another way, that meant that it was hard for \u201CMr. Black\u201D to identify Jester as Assassin\u2019s Master.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m a queen?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, you are. People who are jealous of you are trying to bully you, and Mr. Black is going to protect you from them. Forever and ever.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Jester tried to stroke the girl\u2019s ego and indulge her childish sense that she could do anything.</p><p>But he made one miscalculation.</p><p>Maybe if he had not suffered Flat\u2019s attack and the shock of being abandoned by his superior as a Dead Apostle, he might have been able to understand and control Tsubaki\u2019s feelings with a cooler head.</p><p>He did not realize.</p><p>He assumed that Tsubaki was a typical, simple-minded girl of her age suffering from illness.</p><p>In a sense, Tsubaki really was simple-minded.</p><p>In this world, Tsubaki was the very picture of a typical girl of her age.</p><p>But he failed to realize that Tsubaki\u2019s simple-mindedness was really the product of her struggle through a plethora of suffering.</p><p>And because that was what it really was, even though she did not understand why everyone was upset, even though she was afraid, even though she was on the verge of tears, even though she wanted to be happy, she had a revelation.</p><p>\u201COh . . .\u201D</p><p>The experience she had spent her whole life accumulating lead her to a single conclusion.</p><p>\u201CI \u2018failed\u2019 again. . . .\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki sadly hung her head, then slowly raised it again.</p><p>Then, desperately fighting back tears, she said to everyone around her:</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry . . . Dad, Mom.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for, Tsubaki. You should just relax. You don\u2019t need to do anything.\u201D</p><p>Nothing to be sorry for.</p><p>Even as young as she was, Tsubaki instinctively understood.</p><p>That did not mean, \u201CYou didn\u2019t fail; nothing is your fault.\u201D It meant, \u201CYou failed, but I\u2019m not angry.\u201D</p><p>So, it really was her fault that Sigma and Assassin were in trouble. Most importantly, it was her fault that those black skeletons were smashing things.</p><p>Tsubaki heard the noise of the city still being destroyed as she practically sobbed:</p><p>\u201CB-But . . . if there are people in the buildings, everybody in the city will . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people die in the city. They\u2019re just like batteries\u2014consumable.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, Tsubaki. Those nice skeletons will kill all the people who are mad at you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, and it\u2019s your world, Tsubaki, so Mystery will stay concealed no matter how many people die.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s wonderful. Now we just have to think about how to hide the effects on the outside world.\u201D</p><p></p><p>. . . What?</p><p>What are they talking about?</p><p>Assassin could not help frowning as she fended off grotesqueries.</p><p>They were supposed to be brainwashed to protect Tsubaki.</p><p>There was no sign that they were under Jester\u2019s control.</p><p>That would mean that they normally talked to their daughter that way.</p><p></p><p>After hearing what her parents had to say, Tsubaki looked imploringly at Sigma and Assassin.</p><p>But they did not know what to think, and the only answer they could give was silence.</p><p>Then, Tsubaki realized that she was not mistaken.</p><p>She could not help it.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki was shaking, but she still smiled at the \u201Cgrown-ups\u201D around her.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll do my best.\u201D</p><p>Just like that, \u201CMr. Black\u2019s\u201D smoke clung to her body like it was being sucked into her.</p><p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p><p>Even Jester was confused, unable to read Tsubaki\u2019s intentions.</p><p>But first Assassin and then Sigma guessed what she was trying to do and shouted to stop her.</p><p>\u201CStop!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWait, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201D</p><p>But their words never reached her. The monstrosities that sprang out of \u201CMr. Black\u201D blocked their attempt to run to her.</p><p>As a result, Tsubaki was able to carry out her whim.</p><p></p><p>\u201CPlease, Mr. Black.\u201D</p><p></p><p>The girl\u2019s Command Spells glowed faintly.</p><p></p><p>\u201CPlease, put everything back the way it was.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha\u2014\u201D</p><p>Ignoring the young Jester\u2019s look of shock, Tsubaki made her Command Spells shine.</p><p>\u201CPlease make me all alone forever and ever.\u201D</p><p>For just an instant, it looked like \u201CMr. Black\u201D made a gesture of surprise.</p><p>\u201CThink this through!\u201D \u201CStop!\u201D</p><p>Assassin and Jester shouted at the same time.</p><p>Sigma could do nothing but watch the scene play out.</p><p></p><p>Soon, \u201CMr. Black\u201D shook intensely, like it was screaming.</p><p>The next instant, the world turned over again.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Snowfield, the Kuruoka Residence</p><p></p><p>\u201CNgh . . .\u201D</p><p>When Sigma woke up, he was exactly where he had been before he lost consciousness.</p><p>He was in a corner of Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku\u2019s house that connected to the garden.</p><p>But the sky was blue, and the lawn was lush and green. The destroyed buildings were also completely restored.</p><p>Sigma realized that he was not in the ward-world. He had been returned to reality.</p><p>As proof, only Kuruoka Tsubaki had vanished from the house without a trace.</p><p>When he looked around, he saw that Assassin appeared to have come to as well. She was clenching her fists and shouting:</p><p>\u201CWhy would that little girl choose that here, in the midst of all this?!\u201D</p><p>She staggered to her feet and glared at the Kuruokas, who were also struggling to rise, with unmistakable rage in her eyes.</p><p>\u201CWhat kind of life did that child lead\u2014did you force her to lead\u2014for her to choose that?! What . . . What did you do to that child, to your own daughter?! What have you done?!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but can you afford to waste time on us?\u201D Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku chuckled, holding his head, and looked at what was behind Assassin and Sigma.</p><p>\u201CWhat a spoilsport. . . . I never guessed she was that broken. I was looking forward to Miss Assassin sobbing as she lopped off Tsubaki\u2019s innocent little head while Tsubaki screamed that she wanted to live. . . .\u201D</p><p>The irritated-looking boy opened the front of his clothes, revealing a tattoo reminiscent of a revolver\u2019s chamber near his heart.</p><p>When he brushed a hand over the design, which appeared to be inked onto the flat surface of his skin, the tattoo spun, and a different design was loaded into the uppermost chamber.</p><p>Instantly, the boy Jester\u2019s body swelled into a redhaired werewolf over two meters tall and leapt.</p><p>\u201CSee you, Assassin! I\u2019ll have fun tormenting you with my love next time!\u201D</p><p>The creature, whose speech had become coarser, climbed straight onto the roof of the house and flipped, speeding through the air away from Assassin.</p><p>\u201C. . .! You won\u2019t escape me!\u201D</p><p>Assassin kicked off the ground and vanished in pursuit of Jester, ignoring her own injuries.</p><p>That left only Sigma and the Kuruokas.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWe\u2019ve had a rough time of it. I can\u2019t believe the Command Spells ended up in our daughter instead of us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, but we should see that as proof. The Command Spells chose Tsubaki because, as young as she is, the quality of her Magic Circuits has surpassed ours.\u201D</p><p>The couple\u2019s matter-of-fact conversation made Sigma uneasy.</p><p>? What\u2019s this feeling?</p><p>Were they still being manipulated by Tsubaki\u2019s Servant?</p><p>No, Sigma decided, what felt out of place to him was nothing like that.</p><p>\u201COh, you\u2019re . . . Sigma, right? You\u2019re supposed to work for Faldeus. Can you get in touch with him?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDear, we have to get to the hospital first.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . You\u2019re right. I guess we\u2019ll pick up something to cut her right hand off with over there.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCut off . . . her right hand?\u201D Sigma could not help asking.</p><p>\u201CYes, that\u2019s right. It looks like that little brat Tsubaki went and used two Command Spells, but as long as there\u2019s one left, we can reestablish a contract with that Heroic Spirit. With a Heroic Spirit that powerful, we\u2019ll be able to secure a considerable advantage if we cooperate with Faldeus.\u201D</p><p>Sigma understood.</p><p>This couple remembered everything that had happened while they were being controlled.</p><p>In spite of that, the first words out of their mouth were not concern for Tsubaki but plans to cut off her right hand and steal her Command Spells.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right. This is how mages are.</p><p>The Magic Crest must still belong to one of the parents. I doubt they\u2019d be too disappointed even if Tsubaki died. All that they care about is a blood-related individual to make inherit their magecraft.</p><p>Blood-related.</p><p>\u201C. . . You\u2019re going to cut off Tsubaki\u2019s hand?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, it will be fine. She\u2019s unconscious anyway; we don\u2019t have to worry about her screaming. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t want her to lose the ability to bear children one day, so we\u2019ll need to take the utmost care with her heart and nerves. Ask Faldeus and Chief Reeve to handle the hospital staff while we work. I don\u2019t want to ask Francesca, but in a worst-case scenario, her magecraft would make it possible to preserve at least Tsubaki\u2019s reproductive capabilities even with her head removed.\u201D</p><p>Y\u016Bkaku seemed to be speaking dispassionately, without exaggeration or sarcasm.</p><p>Then, Sigma realized.</p><p>His strange feeling did not come from without.</p><p>It was an \u201Cemotion\u201D welling up from deep inside him.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou there, you there. Listen closely, my little brothers and sisters.\u201D</p><p></p><p>Inside Sigma, a voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou must destroy anyone who tries to take something from us.\u201D</p><p></p><p>A voice from the past. Words that no longer meant anything.</p><p>But it was that voice that stirred Sigma\u2019s heart.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I see. Is that it?</p><p>I thought that . . . Kuruoka Tsubaki and I lived in different worlds.</p><p>She\u2019s a mage, but she has parents. Blood-related parents.</p><p>That had nothing to do with it.</p><p>Tsubaki\u2019s smile, the way he and the others had been treated in the past, and the face of the brother he had killed with his own hands flashed through his brain one after another.</p><p>What is it? What is this weird feeling?</p><p>Suddenly, Sigma realized that he was holding something.</p><p>It was the crossbow he had carried out of the basement in the dream.</p><p>\u201CHmm? . . . Why do you have that? It\u2019s difficult to use as a weapon, and now that all the Heroic Spirits are assembled, it can\u2019t be used in this War. Would you return it to us?\u201D</p><p>As he listened to Y\u016Bkaku speak, Sigma suddenly had an idea.</p><p>\u201C. . . I said I\u2019d protect Tsubaki, didn\u2019t I? With my own lips?\u201D</p><p>And that mysterious being in red had trusted him immediately.</p><p>\u201CHe\u2019s mumbling something. . . . Dear, is this mercenary safe?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, he can\u2019t do anything inside the house.\u201D</p><p>Tsubaki\u2019s father must have had a lot of confidence in the house\u2019s defenses, because he seemed entirely unafraid of Sigma.</p><p>But he was not careless or conceited either; Sigma could tell that his fingers were ready to cast a spell that would be the end of Sigma at any time.</p><p>Sigma drew in a short breath and resumed the inhuman expression of the magecraft-using mercenary as he said:</p><p>\u201CExcuse me. Mr. Kuruoka Y\u016Bkaku, I will report the particulars to Mr. Faldeus.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, please do. I won\u2019t mind if you tell him about our Heroic Spirit\u2014as much as you were able to understand, anyway.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, sir. And one more thing, Mr. Kuruoka. I ought to notify you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNotify me?\u201D Y\u016Bkaku looked suspicious.</p><p>\u201CThis is a Holy Grail War,\u201D Sigma stated dispassionately, \u201Cand I am one of the participants.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd? I assume that Assassin is your Heroic Spirit?\u201D Y\u016Bkaku asked suspiciously, unaware that he was making a fatal error.</p><p>He was under the mistaken impression that Sigma was a low-level magecraft-user separated from his Heroic Spirit.</p><p>That even if something went wrong, all he had to do was finish Sigma off before he could use a Command Spell to recall Assassin.</p><p>\u201CMy direct superior is Francesca, not Faldeus . . . and I\u2019ve been given permission to conduct the War as I see fit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey . . . Don\u2019t get any funny ideas.\u201D</p><p>Before Y\u016Bkaku, who sensed a threatening atmosphere, could move his fingers, Sigma finished his last sentence.</p><p>Even going out of his way to say it was part of his plan to incite Y\u016Bkaku to act.</p><p>\u201CThis is a declaration of war from me to you.\u201D</p><p></p><p>\u201CI\u2019m impressed. True, we told where the spells were, but I didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d manage to intercept them all.\u201D</p><p>Several minutes later.</p><p>One of the \u201Cshadows\u201D\u2014the elderly captain\u2014grinned from where he stood beside Sigma.</p><p>\u201CI managed it because your information was accurate. Otherwise, it would have been me who went down. . . . Thank you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t be so quick to thank your Servant. It\u2019s give-and-take between us,\u201D the captain chuckled and looked at the two masses lying on the floor.</p><p>\u201CAh . . . Ngh . . . Gah . . .\u201D \u201CHow . . .?\u201D</p><p>Human-shaped lumps of meat, their eyes rolled back in their heads, that simply continued to groan meaninglessly.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019re you going to do with them? If you leave them be, they\u2019ll recover thanks to their Magic Crest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve blocked their means to recover. Given the quality of their Magic Crest, they should remain in this state for half a month.\u201D</p><p>They were Mr. and Mrs. Kuruoka, their arms and legs numbed and the majority of their Magic Circuits burned out using a specialized Mystic Code.</p><p>Faced with the couple, who were just barely able to breathe but nothing else, Sigma said:</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m hesitating. If I had orders to kill them, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate, and if I had orders not to kill them, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201D he continued expressionlessly, without any feeling for the couple lying in front of him. \u201CBut I don\u2019t have orders this time. I don\u2019t even have a long-term goal.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut you have decided where you should go. Am I wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI said that I\u2019d protect Tsubaki,\u201D Sigma answered the \u201Cshadow\u201D with artificial wings tonelessly as ever, \u201Cbut I think she would be sad if she learned that her parents were dead after she woke up. . . . She might even blame herself for it and commit suicide. But if I let them live, the same thing will just happen again.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, you leave them technically alive? Honestly, that technology\u2019s incredible. It paralyzes every Magic Circuit and nerve in the body. It\u2019s definitely more of a magecraft-user\u2019s approach than a mage\u2019s.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFrancesca made me learn all about this kind of thing.\u201D</p><p>Then, he looked at Kuruoka Tsubaki\u2019s mother and told the shadow:</p><p>\u201CMy mother is gone. Francesca told me that she died in a Holy Grail War in Japan.\u201D</p><p>The \u201Cwords that no longer meant anything\u201D ran over and over through Sigma\u2019s head.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYour parents were taken by people who came from outside.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll of your fathers were killed by invaders filled with outside corruption.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour mother was kidnapped by a terrible demon who came from outside.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, destroy. Destroy anyone who tries to take from us.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, fight. Fight so that one day we can take your mother back.\u201D</p><p></p><p>When those voices had dwindled, the shadow spoke, as if he had gauged the timing.</p><p>\u201CYes, you were saying that before.\u201D</p><p>The boy with serpent staff and half his face petrified looked at Sigma\u2019s face, stepped a little closer to him, and asked:</p><p>\u201C. . . Do you have any thoughts about parents?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI just thought . . . that I hope my mother wasn\u2019t like them.\u201D</p><p>Sigma knew that it no longer meant anything, but he still wished for it.</p><p>\u201CSo, what are you going to do now?\u201D</p><p>Sigma looked up at the sky as he answered the female \u201Cshadow\u201D dressed like an aviator.</p><p>\u201CI was told that I could act freely. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll do. Faldeus will probably try to kill me, but I think Francesca will be happy.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut \u2018being happy\u2019 is all she\u2019ll do. I doubt that monster will do anything to help you.\u201D</p><p>Sigma answered the captain with a silent nod.</p><p>\u201CI know. But if it makes her happy, that should pay her back for taking care of me until now.\u201D</p><p>Still holding the crossbow, Sigma made a declaration to himself and to his Servant \u201CWatcher.\u201D</p><p>A declaration that he was about to take center stage.</p><p></p><p>\u201CI\u2019m going . . . to destroy this system, the Holy Grail War.\u201D</p><h2 id="bridge-clink-clank" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bridge-clink-clank" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Bridge: Clink Clank</h2><hr><p>\u201C. . . Huh?\u201D</p><p>The next thing Ayaka knew, she was in the middle of an intersection.</p><p>It was the intersection in front of Crystal Hill, near the hospital and the police station.</p><p>The nearby asphalt was badly torn-up, and in the distance, she could see blockades indicating no entry as well as police cars and construction vehicles parked to hide the street from view.</p><p>Nearby, police officers were looking around like she was. She could not see Saber, who had gone a considerable distance away to fight, but at least the orb of water floating around her was still there.</p><p></p><p>\u201CWe came back . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Coalsman Special Corrections Center</p><p></p><p>\u201COh . . .? So, they made it back in one piece. It\u2019s a good thing I had the street cordoned off,\u201D Faldeus said with a shrug, then informed his trusted assistant Aludra while he watched the footage through the surveillance cameras placed throughout the city.</p><p>\u201CNow, we\u2019ve had one nerve-wracking day after another, but there are only a few more to go. We\u2019ll have to start arranging events in earnest. . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat first?\u201D</p><p>Faldeus answered her with a wry smile and a wink.</p><p></p><p>\u201CFor now, let\u2019s see about getting some stomach medicine.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Central Intersection</p><p></p><p>\u201COh! There she is! That\u2019s her, Jack! That girl is Saber\u2019s Master!\u201D</p><p>Flat was excited that he had found Ayaka.</p><p>\u201CApproach with caution,\u201D wristwatch Jack admonished him. \u201CYou saw how much power Saber wields. We won\u2019t last a second if she turns out to be hostile.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s true, but I just can\u2019t stop thinking about that Master. . . . I know. Jack, can you turn into a white flag?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI was able to become a watch thanks to the inanimate object theory, but I\u2019ve never heard anyone suggest that Jack the Ripper was actually a white flag.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey\u2019re out there if you look! I just know it! Human possibilities are kind of close to infinite, so you must have about five thousand true identities!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat\u2019s considerably fewer than infinite. . . .\u201D</p><p>That typical exchange helped Jack to feel that he and his Master really had returned to their original world.</p><p>\u201CBut,\u201D Jack told Flat again, all the while keeping an eye out so that he could protect Flat if a mage or Servant attacked as they approached Saber\u2019s Master, \u201CI doubt I\u2019ll be much use in combat from now on. The bowman in front of the hospital stole my Noble Phantasm, and he\u2019s not the only Heroic Spirit to show how great the difference in our capabilities is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t worry. I told you, if we think of it as hard mode, we can work around the difference in stats somehow.\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . I suppose I should be grateful that you put concern for me before yourself when that Assassin questioned you about the Holy Grail.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?!\u201D Flat exclaimed, his eyes bright. \u201CI want to find out who Jack the Ripper really was too, you know!\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . You might just end up disappointed,\u201D Jack continued. \u201CThere\u2019s a good chance that some piece of trash just happened to not get caught. . . . In any case, stop idolizing a thing like me. When my identity is finally revealed, I\u2019ll merely gain the right to atone for my crimes. Learning my true identity would be salvation for me, but not atonement. And it\u2019s not healthy to idolize a criminal in the first place.\u201D</p><p>Once he was done lecturing Flat, Jack\u2019s tone softened.</p><p>\u201CBut the days I spend like this with you . . . What remains in your memory will be undeniably \u2018me.\u2019 If I settled the question of my identity with the power of the Holy Grail, I will most likely disappear, and that genuine Jack will stand before you. If they try to kill you, show no concern. Kill them or escape them at once and forget them as soon as you can.\u201D</p><p>\u201CJack . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut . . . I\u2019d be grateful if you would remember the \u2018me\u2019 who is talking to you now.\u201D</p><p>Jack spoke like they were his last words. He must have been certain that it would be difficult for him to win through the battles to come.</p><p>Flat turned to him with his usual smile.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m the same way. Whatever your identity turns out to be, it\u2019s a separate issue. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Jack is the Jack that I\u2019m talking to right now. If someone told you to atone for the crime of murder, I\u2019d testify for you! I\u2019d tell them, \u2018This Jack is a genuine fake; he doesn\u2019t need to atone for anything!\u2019\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . . Hehe . . . Ha ha ha! You\u2019ve got that backwards in more ways than one!\u201D</p><p>Jack laughed out loud.</p><p>The un-mage-like young mage and the serial killer laughed cheerfully together.</p><p>They walked with a spring in their steps, as if they were not afraid of anything, and decided to make contact with the girl who was Saber\u2019s Master immediately.</p><p></p><p>\u201CHey there, Ayaka!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?! Who are you?!\u201D</p><p>Ayaka turned to look in the direction of the sudden greeting and saw a young man in his late teens, maybe almost twenty, standing and waving to her.</p><p>\u201CHow do you know my name . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, so you really aren\u2019t the same person,\u201D the young man said, seeing Ayaka\u2019s wary reaction. \u201CThat makes sense. I mean, your flow of magical energy is totally different! But is your name really Ayaka too?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh . . .?\u201D</p><p>Ayaka stared at the young man, confused.</p><p>\u201CWho are you?! Do you know about me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m Flat. Nice to meet you. There\u2019s another girl with the same name and face as you, and I\u2019m friends with her. But . . . your magical energy currents. I thought so. . . .\u201D</p><p>The young man looked at Ayaka and started saying something to himself.</p><p>\u201CWait,\u201D Ayaka asked, nervously backing away. \u201CTell me! If you know about me\u2014if you know who Ayaka Sajou is\u2014tell me . . .!\u201D</p><p>Flat answered Ayaka\u2019s strange request with a nod. He looked serious.</p><p>\u201CSure. . . . I understand. Like I thought, you don\u2019t really know what you are, do you?\u201D</p><p>\u201C. . .\u201D</p><p>Ayaka fell silent.</p><p>Flat took that as a yes and started to say something to comfort her.</p><p></p><p>\u201CYou see, your body\u2014\u201D</p><p></p><p></p><p>First came the whistle of something slicing through the air.</p><p></p><p></p><p>An instant later, just as the red that blossomed from the torso of the young man who called himself Flat tinted Ayaka\u2019s view, came the crash of shattering asphalt.</p><p></p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Did the sound come from Ayaka, or from Flat?</p><p>Flat thudded to his knees on the spot.</p><p>\u201C. . . Flat?\u201D</p><p>Jack\u2019s voice filled the area.</p><p>He had been wary of the mage called Ayaka.</p><p>He had also been on the alert for attacks from Saber and other Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Both Flat and Jack trusted the nearby police officers, their allies, but this was still their first contact with Saber.</p><p>But Flat had been pierced by a long-range attack that did not rely on magical energy from a faction that had nothing to do with Saber.</p><p>Jack, having lost the greater part of his strength, had no way to defend his Master from that kind of modern warfare.</p><p></p><p>\u201CAh . . .\u201D</p><p>As Flat looked at the hole torn in his gut, he was able to analyze with complete calm that he had probably been shot from diagonally upward\u2014from the roof of a building.</p><p>He raised his head to look.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s so bright. . . . I can\u2019t quite see,\u201D Flat instinctively raised a hand and muttered as if nothing was out of the ordinary. The sun, which had begun to sink westward, was in his eyes.</p><p>\u201CSorry, Jack. . . . I screwed up.\u201D</p><p>He thought he could hear Jack shout.</p><p>He felt him trying to turn into something incredible and do something in the direction the bullet had flown from.</p><p>But Flat knew.</p><p>He was probably already too late.</p><p>Flat\u2019s reinforced eyesight had spotted multiple snipers stationed on buildings in multiple directions.</p><p>\u201C. . . Sorry, Professor.\u201D</p><p>Then, with a faintly lonely smile, he said his last words.</p><p></p><p>\u201CSorry . . . everyone . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p></p><p>A second high-pitched whistle sped in front of Ayaka, and another red flower bloomed.</p><p></p><p>It bloomed about a meter above the first one.</p><p>In other words, where the young man who called himself Flat\u2019s head had been.</p><p>\u201CEee . . . Ah . . .\u201D</p><p>It was not the first time she had seen a person die before her eyes.</p><p>But it was the first time she had seen the head of a person who had been smiling and talking to her until a few seconds before disappear.</p><p>While Ayaka Sajou screamed, the body of Flat Escardos collapsed in the sea of red it had poured out.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Somewhere</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat is it, Svin?\u201D</p><p>The young man questioned by the mage walking beside him looked confused and sniffed several times before speaking with a sense of unease that he could not explain.</p><p></p><p>\u201CNo. I just had a feeling like . . . a smell that was all over disappeared. . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Coalsman Special Corrections Center</p><p></p><p>\u201CConfirmed destruction of target\u2019s head. Beginning additional assault.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood. Don\u2019t hesitate to destroy the Magic Crest as well. It belongs to the decrepit Escardos family.\u201D</p><p>Faldeus sipped black tea and checked his monitors as he listened to the reports over his radio.</p><p>Additional gunfire was making the young man\u2019s corpse lying on the asphalt dance.</p><p>Unlike Rohngall, it was not a puppet but a real body.</p><p>\u201CYou know, I think that people who inspire others are the most dangerous of all,\u201D Faldeus told Aludra as he elegantly sipped his tea.</p><p>\u201CIn this case, I\u2019ve been wary of Flat and Saber, who have been making one new ally after another. If there\u2019s any chance that the two of them made contact in the world inside the ward, we have to eliminate them immediately or my stomach will be the one to die.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSaber\u2019s Master as well, then?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAfter Flat if possible . . . or so I\u2019d hoped, but that\u2019s no longer an option.\u201D</p><p>The girl who was Saber\u2019s Master was already surrounded by a water-like dome of magical energy, and Saber, who had rushed to her side, was carrying her indoors in his arms.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m also interested in that Master\u2019s identity. We\u2019ll investigate her a bit before we eliminate her.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs this your \u2018stomach medicine\u2019?\u201D Aludra asked as the gunfire on the monitors finally came to an end and the sound from the radio died down.</p><p>\u201CYes, that\u2019s exactly what it is,\u201D Faldeus answered with a shrug and a smile.</p><p></p><p>\u201CThe best cure for stress is to eliminate each of its causes.\u201D</p><p>Just as Faldeus was about to finish the last sip of his tea, one of the monitors in front of him went dark.</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>At the same time he realized that it was the camera showing Flat Escardos\u2019 corpse, he received a radio message from his sniping team.</p><p>\u201C. . . Please respond. This is Spade. . . . om . . . ard!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong? Has something . . .\u201D</p><p>When he tried to respond, the radio went dead.</p><p>Then, another monitor surveilling the central intersection went dark.</p><p>\u201C. . .!\u201D</p><p>Faldeus decided that this was an attack and automatically switched to mystical communication with his teams scattered around the scene, but . . .</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat is it?! What the hell is it?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CCome on, fire!\u201D \u201COh . . . It\u2019s hopeless.\u201D \u201CDamn it! Why is this . . .\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s a monster!\u201D \u201CJust shoot it! Hurry up and kill it!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo . . . Why . . .\u201D \u201CA mage . . .?\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop!

Aaah!\u201D</p><p></p><p>The monitors continued to go dark one after another, and the screams of the sniper team continued to ring out, as if in harmony.</p><p>Soon, a team that had been monitoring the situation from a short distance away reported in.</p><p>\u201CJackal here! Faldeus! What the hell is that thing?! You never told us about this. . . . You told us Flat Escardos was a mage! What the hell is going on?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease calm down! A monster . . .? It could be Flat\u2019s Servant transformed. It should run out of magical energy and dissipate soon. Please hold your ground!\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo! Something I think was a Heroic Spirit did transform, but it disappeared, just like you said! That thing\u2019s a different . . . Shit! Oh, oh, that thing\u2019s not human, and it\u2019s not a mage either! What the hell is it?! Forget hematophages and Heroic Spirits! It\u2019s an honest to God m . . . m-m . . . maaararaarabyah!\u201D</p><p></p><p>With an ensemble performance of screams and sounds like something being folded, the line went silent.</p><p>And it did not stop there. One after another, the surveillance systems that Faldeus had installed throughout the city were going dark.</p><p>In just a few dozen seconds, every surveillance camera in Snowfield had stopped working.</p><p></p><p>Faced with that situation, Faldeus dropped his teacup. He did not even hear it shatter on the floor as he muttered:</p><p></p><p>\u201CWhat in God\u2019s name is going on . . .?\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in Monaco</p><p></p><p>\u201CI see. . . . So, Flat Escardos has come to an end.\u201D</p><p>That man, the owner of a certain casa who had until recently been conversing with Flat over the phone, offered a silent toast to someone who had long since vanished from the world.</p><p>\u201CI will give my blessing to the great achievement of my old neighbor, Messara Escardos.</p><p></p><p>\u201CHowever . . . if the thing you gained at the cost of a young man with a future is \u2018the past,\u2019 then I certainly don\u2019t consider it cause for celebration.\u201D</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>Clink, clink, clink.</p><p>When I realized that was the sound that accompanied the end of everything, I thought, Oh, it\u2019s begun.</p><p></p><p>I soon realized what the clinking and clanking was.</p><p>It was the sound of empty shell casings ejected from the sniper rifles that had put an end to Flat Escardos falling from the tops of buildings to the ground.</p><p>It was a sound that tumbled dozens of meters down through the air to finally arrive beside the flesh that had been Flat Escardos.</p><p></p><p>\u201CI\u201D kept waiting for a long, long time.</p><p>The time had finally come for \u201Cme\u201D\u2014born for the sole purpose of \u201Cexisting\u201D\u2014to be meaningful.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right. \u201CI\u201D have to move. \u201CI\u201D have to move on to the next phase.</p><p>I already understand.</p><p>I understand what I ought to accomplish.</p><p>The greatest and final purpose bestowed on me by the Escardos family.</p><p>The purpose for which I was born.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that right, Flat?</p><p></p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>It\u2019s over.</p><p>It has come to a close.</p><p>I have fallen to ruin.</p><p>I have arrived.</p><p>I am complete.</p><p>Loss was always the final piece.</p><p></p><p>Following the principles of my birth, I rebooted myself.</p><p></p><p>I recalculated the duty I had been tasked with.</p><p>Would my path be difficult or easy?</p><p>There was no point in speculating.</p><p>In either case, I had no choice but to see it through.</p><p>Nothing else would give me meaning.</p><p>Continue to exist. Continue to exist.</p><p>I need only become a true human and continue to exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>Yes, I promise you, Flat.</p><p>I\u2019ll do your share of continuing to exist in this world as well.</p><p></p><p>Even if that means . . . wiping the species defined as \u201Chumans\u201D from the face of the earth.</p><p></p><p>X\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0\xA0X</p><p></p><p>The Clock Tower</p><p></p><p>\u201CShit. . . . I still can\u2019t get through. . . .\u201D</p><p>An area of the Clock Tower.</p><p>In the preparation room of the School of Modern Magecraft, Lord El-Melloi II was muttering impatiently as he made call after call on his cell phone.</p><p>Since their last call had abruptly cut off with the sounds of shouts and what might have been a building collapsing, he had been completely unable to get in touch with Flat.</p><p>\u201CShould I try calling the chief of police instead . . .? No, I don\u2019t know his personal number. . . . I doubt I could reach him by calling the stations, but . . .\u201D</p><p>He laid his hands on his desk and considered for a short while, then stood up as if he had come to a decision.</p><p>\u201CI have no choice. . . . This really does call for\u2014Gwah.\u201D</p><p>No sooner had he opened the door than his body was shoved into the room.</p><p>On closer inspection, he saw that there was a powerful ward modeled on a white snake over the entrance.</p><p>\u201C. . . The obstinate weave of this spell . . . It\u2019s one of Adashino\u2019s wards! Damn the School of Political Science and Law. . . . They never know when to stop!\u201D</p><p>He looked out the window and saw that several homunculi in the service of Goredolf Musik of the School of Political Science and Law were standing watch. It was apparent that they meant to keep Lord El-Melloi II under house arrest.</p><p>\u201CWhat now? . . . Should I contact Reines or Melvin to . . .\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II was pondering the issue when he realized that there was an unfamiliar noise in the room.</p><p>It came from a small vanity case lying in a corner of the preparation room.</p><p>The case ordinarily held his spare cigars, but there was an electronic sound coming from inside it.</p><p>\u201C. . .?\u201D</p><p>El-Melloi II suspiciously opened the case and looked even more confused when he saw what was inside.</p><p>\u201CWhat\u2019s going on . . .? This wasn\u2019t here a moment ago. . . .\u201D</p><p></p><p>The thing that had appeared inside the case while he was not looking and was playing an old ringtone . . . was a cell phone colored a blue deeper than even lapis lazuli.</p><h2 id="afterword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#afterword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Afterword</h2><hr><p>Hello, Narita here. It\u2019s been a while.</p><p>So, I delivered a new book of Strange Fake for the first New Year\u2019s of the Reiwa era.</p><p>I somehow managed to get two books out in fiscal year 2019! I hope I\u2019ll be able to maintain this pace. . . .</p><p></p><p>I hope that those of you who watched the end-of-year FGO special enjoyed seeing Fake in motion, hearing the beautiful music, and most of all getting to hear Saber speak . . .!</p><p>A variety of circumstances led to the decision to produce an animated ad for the novels. As I write this afterword, it\u2019s still in production and waiting for Saber\u2019s voice actor, Ono Y\u016Bki, to record his lines . . . but the character designs, storyboards, music, and other information I keep getting already has me convinced that it\u2019s going to turn out great, so I hope you get to enjoy this book before the excitement dies down!</p><p></p><p>Now, first of all, I\u2019m sure that fans who have read the original Fate and a lot of the other spinoff series were quite surprised by part of this book.</p><p>Yes, the \u201CHoly Grail Debate\u201D that was depicted in Urobuchi Gen\u2019s Fate/Zero\u2014The exchange I depicted in this book doesn\u2019t exist in Zero.</p><p>I already decided to stage an \u201Cencore performance\u201D of the fourth Grail War in front of Saber when I started writing. Mr. Urobuchi graciously gave me permission, but I was worried that writing too much would turn into spoilers for Zero, and I was wondering how to handle the different nuances of the slightly different worldlines that all the spinoffs take place in (except for The Lord El-Melloi II Case Files, which is set in exactly the same worldline as Fate/Stay Night) when I got a heaven-sent blessing from Mr. Nasu.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Nasu: \u201CRy\u014Dgo, that\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to make all the worldlines consistent. Think about it the other way around. Think, \u2018I can write a Holy Grail Debate just for the Fake worldline.\u2019\u201D</p><p>Mr. Nasu spoke with the air of an English aristocrat in a horror tale full of crimson secrets.</p><p>Me: \u201CWhat?! An original conversation with the same kings, just for the Fake worldline?!\u201D</p><p>I wavered for a little while, and then, without thinking too hard about it, shouted:</p><p>Me: \u201CDone!\u201D</p><p>I wrote the scene in the heat of the moment, but I originally made it longer before it hit me: \u201COh no! Forget Zero; this will spoil a ton of other books.\u201D Then, I shortened it quite a bit. So, it ended up as a conversation with a hint of the King Arthur who sometimes turns into a bunny and so on, but I hope you\u2019ll look at it as one of the elements that makes of the Fake worldline!</p><p>There\u2019s also a scene in which a pro-humanity character that I think long-time TYPE-MOON fans will be familiar makes an appearance. It was Mr. Nasu who showed me the guiding principle of \u201Cwhat will he do when he hears about Jester,\u201D and he also supervised all of his lines . . .!</p><p>That said, I was extremely nervous! I couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u201CWait, what? Am I really allowed to write this?\u201D</p><p>By the way, the Stay Night and Case Files worldlines don\u2019t have the framework of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, so he ends up having a slightly different atmosphere . . . but I\u2019m sure TYPE-MOON will show how he\u2019s different when they show his casino one day! (Killer pass.)</p><p>On the subject of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors existing or not, the events in Wales that Flat mentions played out essentially the same as in Case Files, except that one particular character might have been replaced by someone else. At this point, I\u2019ll leave that to your imaginations!</p><p>Now, with book six, the Holy Grail War in Snowfield has hit its second half. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it going at this pace, so please bear with me . . .!</p><p></p><p>I\u2019d like to thank the following:</p><p>First, Aniplex, TYPE-MOON, and Kadokawa, for planning the animated commercial. Also, A-1 Pictures and all the animators who produced the incredible animation, Ono Y\u016Bki who narrated it, Sawano Hiroyuki who created the music, and Yosh who provided the vocals. And everyone involved with the ad as well.</p><p>My editor Anan, whose life I made harder by letting this book get so thick. Also, everyone at the publisher and everyone at II V who adjusted their schedules for me.</p><p>Mr. Urobuchi, who gave me permission to incorporate the \u201CHoly Grail Debate\u201D and all the other writers and manga artists involved with Fate.</p><p>Miwa Kiyomune and Team Barrel Roll, who researched the backgrounds of certain Servants for me.</p><p>Sanda Makoto, who checked the Case Files-related characters, looked up setting details, and gave me advice about a lot of things. He really helped me out this time by supervising the dialogue for El-Melloi II\u2019s long \u201Clecture\u201D . . .!</p><p>Morii Shizuki, whose comic book adaptation is on its fourth volume and who also provided more incredible illustrations for this book. (The quality of the comic really is incredible. Please check it out!)</p><p>And most of all, Nasu Kinoko and everyone at TYPE-MOON, who created Fate and supervised my work, all the Fate/Grand Order staff, who allowed me to be involved in Enkidu\u2019s interludes . . . and all of you who picked up this book and read it.</p><p>Thank you very much!</p><p>November 2019, while re-watching Kin\u014Dbi P\u2019s \u201CBonn\u014D Jihen\u201D, Narita Ry\u014Dgo</p>', 4335);
