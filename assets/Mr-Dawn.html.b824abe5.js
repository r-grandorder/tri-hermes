They are traveling together on a visit to the country town &quot;Aylesbury&quot;.</p><p>Dawn has no means of attack or self-defense, so the work demon exorcisms is performed exclusively by the &quot;other demon exorcism specialist&quot; who he transports.</p><p>He has the appearance of a sword, but he is actually a gentle and sociable character.</p><p>He looks more like a school teacher than an exorcist.</p><p>According to Dawn, he is not qualified to teach others, and it is better for someone to live a leisurely life by themselves to be happy.</p><p>Quiet pacifist. While he has agreed to go to the battlefield called Aylesbury, he doesn&#39;t carry firearms, even for self-defense.</p><p>Dawn is weak to blood, violence and even horror movies. He instantly panics at the sight of massacres caused by heretics, ending up as a liability, so other agents fear him as &quot;the last person you&#39;d ever want to go on a mission with&quot;.</p><hr><h2 id="memo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#memo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Memo</h2><p>The sixth member of the Burial Agency (tentative title).

A bible rests within his desk drawer, a level of piety that has not changed since the incident.</p><p>He is considered to be a valuable type of exorcist, currently, no exorcist can replace Dawn under certain conditions.</p><p>In the Holy Mother&#39;s prophecy, Dawn will exorcise three demons within his lifetime, according to divine revelation.</p><p>He is the only one from the church to exorcise a <strong>fully-formed</strong> victim of demon possession.</p><hr><h2 id="source-the-dark-six-alias" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#source-the-dark-six-alias" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Source/The Dark Six (Alias)</h2><p>He is the character on the side of the Holy Church in Tsukihime 2, the game inside Kinoko&#39;s brain.</p><p>Since he is an agent without a Magecraft background, supernatural powers, nor the ability to perform sacraments, he understands the perspective of ordinary people.</p><p>He is a seasoned and hardworking individual, having been bossed around by those aligned with the Holy Church, who tell him &quot;If you&#39;re not going to take part in the killing, go work yourself to death as an errand boy.&quot;</p><p>He is mainly active on weapons transportation and procurement duty.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qhIpXjv.jpg" alt="Source page"></p><hr>', 30);
