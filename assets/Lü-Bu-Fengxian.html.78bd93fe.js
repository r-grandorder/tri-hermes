However, he has an appearance that makes one think of a long-marching, indomitable, and brave general with a gorgeous armor. Moreover, having strengthened his parameters in exchange for losing his reason, because he\u2019s in the peculiar state of the Berserker class in which most of the techniques cultivated in life become unusable, his expertise in all martial arts from when he was alive is in a damaged state.</p><p>That influence appears in his Noble Phantasm as well and drastically powers it down, but in exchange, the skill Nature of a Rebellious Spirit is sealed[3]. Since this \u300CNature of a Rebellious Spirit\u300Dindicates the disposition to go against the lord, the Heroic Spirit won\u2019t betray the Master as long as it\u2019s sealed. Though a Berserker Servant whose reason has been stolen is more loyal to their Master, this is a rare case of the characteristics of the Berserker class being used right.</p><p>When summoned as a Berserker in the Moon Holy Grail War, he goes through thought equalization with his Master, and becomes more machine-like in comparison to other Berserkers.</p><p>That appearance purports a living fortress that is half-man, half-machine. Furthermore, he recognizes all the other Masters and Servants as enemies and thinks they must be destroyed, and sometimes leaves his Master\u2019s control. In the battle with Lancer, that became an extended development due to the difference between the enemy Master and the own Master. In this time in which it came to a situation of crisis due to the actions taken by the Master, he bought time through movements that could only be described as self-judgment, and moved to protect his Master. That was impossible as a Berserker, but it was the obvious behavior as a warrior.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>As the Berserker class shows, he has an attitude that makes him nothing but a loyal Servant to the Master that has summoned him. A Servant without reason that is loyal to his Master has no words to say, exists only as one weapon, and only slaughters the enemy.</p><p>However, he also does sometimes things, like voluntarily protecting his Master without being ordered, that are unexpected for a Servant of the Berserker class.</p><p>If in life he was one to repeatedly betray, he was also one to dedicate his lifetime to love one woman. Tigers and wolves[4] cry, but don\u2019t talk. L\xFC Bu Fengxian only shows his circumstances through actions. And whichever his true feelings are, there is no falsehood in his reputation as \u300EPeerless\u300F.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300E\u2585\u2585\u2583\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2583\u2583\u2585\u2585\u25AC\u25AC\u2014\u2014\u2014!!!\u300F[5]</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>A mysterious Servant whose identity can\u2019t absolutely be known at first glance.

What a surprise.</p><p>A person that performed deeds unbelievable in a China that respected Confucian morality, like cutting down his foster fathers twice, and repeating the act of betrayal several times. But his exploits and deeds of arms didn\u2019t allow others to catch up with him, and he\u2019s reasonably counted as the strongest above the rest in the world of the Three Kingdoms. Roaming about the Central Plain while repeating treason, he went through many battles, but in the end he was betrayed by a subordinate, and was attacked and defeated by an enemy general, Cao Cao. He was executed. His greed was strong, boasted about being the strongest, and only depended on himself, but in the end he could only let his guard down with the strategist Chen Gong, who \u201Ceffectively\u201D made use of him for tactics.</p><h2 id="scenario-in-past-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario-in-past-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scenario in Past Works</h2><p>Appears in \u300EFate/EXTRA\u300F.

Nevertheless, in spite of being under the effects of Mad Enhancement, he takes action to protect his Master, and is just like the Berserker of the \u300EFate\u300Fseries.
