Given that this goddess is a happy-go-lucky person, Artemis has almost no regard for human life. Fundamentally, Orion has a role to keep her in check, and Artemis personally hates more than anything the words called \u201Cpatience\u201D and \u201Cperseverance\u201D. A faddist because of sweets, she also uses all her energy for every fad she follows\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014She especially uses all her energy wholeheartedly towards her Darling, aka Orion.</p><p><strong>Orion</strong></p><p>A notorious playboy in the olden days and even now in the present time.

Characteristically, he is quite lazy, yet he is shrewd, occasionally evading even Artemis\u2019 accusations of unfaithfulness splendidly. In relation to Artemis, if there is an opportunity for him, one can assume that Orion is nearby having an affair, and it gives the impression to others that they are a married couple who are constantly in a crisis of one being unfaithful to the other, seeing that they are like lovers who can, yet cannot, avoid each other or that situation. However, in the case where Artemis falls into an emergency, Orion has the resourcefulness to a degree to come to her aid to the point of being truly reckless in doing so.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Artemis basically takes up a neutral position towards the Master. However, because she is a \u201CGoddess\u201D, in spite of how great the Master is, she always takes up the higher position in their relationship standing. Orion\u2019s role is to pacify the relationship between Artemis and the Master.

She is the virgin goddess who governs over hunting and chastity, and her eyes towards the opposite sex were unusually relentless, such as when she killed a hunter who was thoughtlessly peeking at her bathing.</p><p>Artemis is like that, of all things, for some reason. She fell in love with the hunter Orion, a child of Poseidon who won fame as a playboy in those days. Usually if circumstances allow it, no matter if she was a goddess or someone other than a goddess, and if he was charmed by a woman, Orion would take her on a one-night stand at once, but when it was regarding Artemis, for some reason or another, why does his defensive instincts come into play? He refrained from taking her hand immediately.</p><p>Nonetheless, even the rumours of Orion and Artemis\u2019 rendezvous ascended to the heavens, and the talk of whether these two were getting married or not was being spread around too.</p><p>The one who did not permit their marriage back then was Apollo, the Sun God and Artemis\u2019 elder brother. Apollo was aware. Of the nature of, \u2018It can\u2019t be helped\u2019, belonging to the man named Orion. And yet, Artemis did not even lend her ear to Apollo\u2019s warning. So Apollo drafted a plan, perceiving from afar a swimming Orion, and he provoked Artemis by saying \u201COver there is a scoundrel named Candaon. Aim and bring down that person.\u201D It is natural that Artemis merely aimed at Orion\u2019s head\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014and magnificently shot through him. The next day, Artemis became aware of Orion\u2019s death and grieved, for Artemis had attempted to restore him back to life, but that wish was not granted, so with no other option left, Orion was raised to the heavens and became a celestial body there.</p><p>And yet, Orion really did not learn his lesson, quarrelling with his companion Artemis, who came to visit him occasionally, and being exposed by Artemis for being unfaithful to her, before he would be beaten half to death.</p><p>This time, sensing an uncommon crisis where the Holy Grail Wars would be held for the sake of the Human Order Restoration, Artemis accomplished the materialization of her form by forcing herself into Orion\u2019s summoning\u2026 Although that is just half the reason, for this other remaining half is to express the feelings of her as a girl bravely, said to be her wanting to make out with Orion to her heart\u2019s content when the opportunity arises.</p><p>\u2026 Wait, bravely?</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Atalanta</strong></p><p>A heroine who believes in Artemis.</p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s okay, because I\u2019ll give you full of blessings, alright?!

Sure, he is a stuffed (male) bear who is not cute enough to be liked by everybody, but nonetheless, one cannot conclude that he is not cute enough to the point that he would be dumped away all the time. Because of Orion\u2019s overblown individuality at the occasion of him being a stuffed animal, everybody is saying that those clothes on the stuffed animal are his, and they are probably imagining that his original appearance is viewed as being right in the center of \u2018that\u2019 archetype. Although it is justified, he does not wear lower-body clothing.</p><p>And then, at first for Artemis, I thought of making her a flat-chested girl because of the occasion where she was named the virgin goddess who made up one element of Meltryllis, but in the first place, since there would be no reason for the current Artemis to materialize in a body that would not be liked by Orion, I did her design over again for a voluptuous body, saying \u201CYou\u2019re kidding, someone like that is a virgin in this body?\u201D So one can conclude that, \u2019If by some chance, there may be a loli goddess Artemis also existing in some dimension.\u2019 Although, unless there is a change in the settings I heard about, her original form is planned to be in a boring figure that is not that of a loli\u2019s, nor does it have huge breasts.

To explain the context behind the pun, the root word of Mikotto is Mikon (the one Tamamo says), which can mean \u2018unmarried\u2019 in English. One can say Mikon if they\u2019re doing something in a style befitting the unmarried, or one can say Mikon in response to something that happened to them that will cause them to become/stay unmarried. In the case of Artemis\u2019 Second Noble Phantasm being used on a male successfully, the victim saying \u2018Mikotto\u2019 after getting hit in the balls is natural since I don\u2019t think any woman will marry a man who can\u2019t help them produce kids (if that\u2019s part of their marriage goals).</p><p>[2] \u2013 Most stories depict Artemis being born first, therefore being Apollo\u2019s older sister, but there are some stories where Artemis was born after Apollo, therefore making her the younger sister instead.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-190.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-191.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-192.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-193.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-194.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-195.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-196.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-197.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-198.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://github.com/Assets-I/Materials/blob/main/fgo-material-II/i-199.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 84);
