Sees Arthuria as her rival because of it. Also becomes a recurring obstacle to Chaldea because they\u2019re Beryl\u2019s enemies. Is having a lot of fun with what she does, but it\u2019s all for Morgan\u2019s sake.<br> All her actions are dictated by a desire for entertainment. Like Morgan, she\u2019s hated by all Fae in Britain.<br> In the end, she loses all hope in herself and throws herself into the Great Pit.</p><h4 id="melusine-dozmary-pool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#melusine-dozmary-pool" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Melusine (Dozmary Pool)</h4><p>The strongest and fastest Faerie Knight.

In the end, she kills her love (Aurora) and loses her faerie status, ultimately transforming into the remains of a dead dragon.</p><h4 id="woodwose-oxford-will-need-a-unique-sprite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#woodwose-oxford-will-need-a-unique-sprite" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Woodwose (Oxford) *will need a unique sprite</h4><p>The chief of the Fang Clan.<br> (* The Fang Clan is the faerie tribe most fit for combat, and the only ones with the power to repel the Moss colonies. For that reason, they are the cornerstone of the national defense.)<br> An almost 3 meters tall wolfman. Male.<br> Wears a high-brand suit. Make it fancy since he is a clan chief (the fae equivalent to a baron). A woodwose is an England faerie described as a huge man covered in hair who would drown and devour women.<br> Woodwose is as strong as a Faerie Knight, if not stronger.<br> More fae than any other fae, considered an atavistic A-rei.<br> Morgan\u2019s strongest hand-to-hand warrior. The one who slayed the Moss King.<br> The feudal lord of Oxford, the city of restaurants.<br> He\u2019s a glutton and loves human cuisine, but considers humans disposable tools. He\u2019ll drop multiple hints to the idea that he\u2019s always hungry.<br> He publicly claims to be Morgan\u2019s loyal retainer, but at this point, he\u2019s already fed up with her (think of the irritation a son feels at an overly strict mother. Less \u201Caffection flipped into hatred\u201D and more \u201Cbacklash out of worry that she hates him\u201D).<br> As the chief of the Fang Clan, he hates to see how Barghest gets more attention than him.<br> He\u2019s a kind and tolerant pupper in his interactions with other fae.<br> All his actions are dictated by a desire to be loved. After deluding himself into thinking Morgan wouldn\u2019t love him anymore, he was tricked by Aurora\u2019s sham love.<br> (What made it feel like he lost Morgan\u2019s love was her lack of praise. He got a lot of praise during the period of constant war including the Moss campaigns and the caterpillar slaying, but there was no war in the past 100 years, meaning he got nothing. The Faerie Knights hogged all the spotlights.)</p><p>He knows very well how much Morgan hates typical fae behavior, and for that reason, he defies his own nature and skillfully performs typical human behavior. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so annoying over proper manners.<br> The fae\u2019s main criticism of him is that the Faerie Knights are stronger and that he became all bark and no bite, but Morgan and Oberon know that Woodwose is actually the strongest individual in Britain.<br> (In-story, Oberon will say \u201CWoodwose is past his retirement age. Beating that rusty old fart in a fight will be piece of cake.\u201D but that\u2019s an attempt to lower Chaldea\u2019s guard. Oberon can\u2019t let Chaldea get too strong, so he thought this would be a great opportunity to lower their numbers a little. Though Woodwose was ultimately even more insanely powerful than Oberon expected.)</p><p>Falling for Aurora\u2019s honey trap, he ultimately kills Morgan with his own hands.<br> After doing the deed, he realizes how deeply he loved and admired her, so he dies acknowledging his mistake.</p><h4 id="spriggan-norwich-will-need-a-unique-sprite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#spriggan-norwich-will-need-a-unique-sprite" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Spriggan (Norwich) *will need a unique sprite</h4><p>Chief of the Earth Clan.<br> Head honcho of the Knocker Company, which handles all the fashion and architecture in Lostbelt Britain.<br> The feudal lord of Norwich, an advanced port town that uses fae labor.<br> Norwich prides itself in its equality between humans and fae, and might even seem utopic at first glance, but we learn that behind the scenes, the weaker fae and humans are consumed and discarded much like how it happens in modern cities.<br> Appearance-wise, he\u2019s a man with the airs of a gentleman. He claims to have lost his ability to grow giant. Rumors say he\u2019s a low-grade faerie who tricked and killed the real Spriggan to steal his land. That faerie\u2019s name is Capless.<br> \u2026but that\u2019s what he wants them to think. He\u2019s actually human. He\u2019s pretending to be a faerie (he hires fae to preserve his appearance and lifespan).<br> He was a hanshi samurai sent to England as an exchange student at the end of the Edo Period. In England, he was spirited away and wandered into Fairy Britain.<br> His support for Morgan is strong but not absolute.<br> He grew Norwich into Britain\u2019s largest city so it can still survive even if her Camelot is in ruins (in fact, the fall of Camelot wouldn&#39;t even hurt him in any way, he would just gloat about how busy he was about to get).<br> He\u2019s as much of a bystander observing the pieces moving in the board of clan conspiracy as Oberon, but since he prioritized his own profits from beginning to end, he lost sight of the bigger picture.<br> After Britain\u2019s collapse, he is out of means to handle the Beastly Calamity\u2019s invasion. In the end, he gathers all the treasure of Norwich in his finance office and locks himself with it, then dies when the castle collapses.<br> The way he spends his last moments trying to protect his gold and treasure is exactly like the spriggans in Pan-Human folklore.</p><h4 id="ainsel-lake-district" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ainsel-lake-district" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ainsel (Lake District)</h4><p>Mirror Clan. The prophet. A sympathizer to both fae and humans. Everyone\u2019s favorite.<br> People think she chose to remain silent, but in reality, she was already killed by one of Aurora\u2019s stratagems before the start of the story, as Aurora was jealous of her popularity.</p><h4 id="muryan-gloucester-use-a-special-version-of-kazuradrop-s-sprites-story-only-no-battle-sprites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#muryan-gloucester-use-a-special-version-of-kazuradrop-s-sprites-story-only-no-battle-sprites" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Muryan (Gloucester) *use a special version of Kazuradrop\u2019s sprites (story-only, no battle sprites)</h4><p>The survivor of the Wing Clan. The last of her kind.<br> Kazuradrop\u2019s faerie version\u2026 but I think you can just put Kazuradrop\u2019s First Ascension sprite without any alterations. Think of it as a sneak peek.<br> (Muryans are ant fae from Cornwall traditions. The folklore says that their main characteristic is that they start human-sized but get smaller every time use their transformation ability until they\u2019re stuck in ant size.)<br> Always devising and popularizing new ways to use humans for entertainment.<br> First impressions make her look like a cruel and ruthless hedonist, but once you get to know her, you see that she\u2019s a bookworm who takes her job very seriously.<br> Despite her evil, she has no tolerance for laziness and apathy (not in the sense that she acts hatefully toward lazy and apathetic people, but in the sense that she makes them improve their ways).<br> She secretly wants revenge because the Fang Clan ate the Wing Clan to extinction.<br> She gets a flashback to when a human hid her during the Fang Clan\u2019s genocide of her people. Because of that, Muryan has her own form of love for humanity. An evil and twisted form.<br> Her clan is just waiting for extinction since she has no fellowmen left.<br> She takes Koyanskaya as a house guest and they start concocting evil plans together.<br> After manipulating Chaldea into wiping out the Fang Clan, she learns the truth about the British Genesis and what the curses actually are, causing her to be killed by the British Isles\u2019 spokesman. The public never finds out about her death.<br> \u2192 Her losing her Purpose and killing herself here is another good option.</p><h4 id="cnoc-na-riabh-edinburgh-use-a-special-version-of-medb-s-sprites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cnoc-na-riabh-edinburgh-use-a-special-version-of-medb-s-sprites" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Cnoc na Riabh (Edinburgh) *use a special version of Medb\u2019s sprites</h4><p>A <s>honey</s> chocolate faerie.<br> King Clan. Queen. Physically identical to Medb (Cnoc na Riabh is the name of Medb\u2019s grave).<br> I\u2019m pretty sure her battle sprites will be Medb Second Ascension, so how about we differentiate them by having a new jacket over Medb\u2019s Second Ascension outfit?<br> Maybe change the color of her dress (on the battle sprite as well)? Is that a thing we can do?<br> She has higher hero levels than Medb. That\u2019s because Cnoc na Riabh is not in a relationship with anyone and doesn\u2019t have the spare time to afford living for love like Medb did.</p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s obvious I want to fall in love with someone! I love the idea of love! But that can wait until I defeat Morgan and make Britain mine. It\u2019s important to keep your priorities straight, don&#39;t you think?</p></blockquote><p>She and Arthuria Caster grow to become rivals who can openly point out each other\u2019s faults.<br> She loves living in luxury. She desires anything of value.<br> She\u2019s an enemy of Morgan.<br> She hates humans because her predecessor was betrayed by humans (or at least she poses like that. Her predecessor was taken down because she loved humans. Having inherited her soul, Cnoc na Riabh also loves humans at her core. Love flipped into hatred.)<br> The King Clan is a special clan that puts the fae who lost their home and purpose under its control. A second home for refugees, if you will. She can share her power with other fae, but the power she grants doesn\u2019t return to her. Like a faerie version of The Happy Prince.<br> She\u2019s a tyrannical queen, but she follows a creed that her subjects must be granted the bare minimum of joy. That\u2019s Cnoc na Riabh\u2019s Purpose. She has a great ambition to defeat Britain\u2019s newly-arrived ruler Morgan and take back the kingdom.<br> In the end, she learns the name of her Pan-Human History counterpart and dies laughing about it.</p><h4 id="aurora-salisbury-will-need-a-unique-sprite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aurora-salisbury-will-need-a-unique-sprite" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aurora (Salisbury) *will need a unique sprite</h4><p>The face of the Wind Clan.<br> A faerie so charitable and beautiful that the fae say \u201Cour true queen is Aurora, not Morgan or Cnoc na Riabh\u201D.<br> The faerie stereotype taken to its extreme.<br> Physically 20-24 years old.<br> Long wavy blond hair, prim features, and an untarnished white one-piece dress.<br> She ideally would want to look 16, but for some reason, she aged all the way to adulthood.<br> (Fae normally don\u2019t age or grow)<br> Aurora avoids mirrors because she doesn\u2019t want to see her adult form.<br> And her mental state gets pretty ugly every time she looks at Melusine, who takes the appearance of Aurora\u2019s ideal faerie\u2026 her own previous self.</p><p>Pure darkness on the inside. Disturbs the board out of pure vanity to be more popular than anyone else. The embodiment of apolitical narcissism. P Prefers multiple momentary loves over one true love.<br> Something to the effect of</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m ready to run away with you anytime.\u201D<br> \u201CNo, I couldn\u2019t stand to have you as the only one pampering me!\u201D</p></blockquote><p>She spreads the calamities under the excuse that neither Morgan nor Cnoc na Riabh have the resolve to carry the lives of all fae on their shoulders. After killing both of them, the responsibility falls to Aurora, but Aurora refuses all this boring work, completely negating all of Morgan\u2019s and Cnoc na Riabh\u2019s efforts thus far.</p><h3 id="others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Others</h3><h4 id="senji-muramasa" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#senji-muramasa" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Senji Muramasa</h4><p>Alternatively Count Peperon.

She helps the protagonist and Arthuria out of the forest, but upon reaching her limit, she turns to Moss, attacks the party, and is defeated. She was a faerie girl who loved flowers.<br> Draw her unhappy-looking, admirable, a kind of plain.<br> She wasn\u2019t given any name at the time of her birth, but her true name is Hope.<br> A faerie of salvation born before Arthuria Caster.<br> She was meant to be the last autopurification system created by the fae rather than by Britain, but the role was too heavy for her to handle.<br> The last hope in the collapsing Britain.<br> The first act will make her look like a minor tutorial partner who dies early, but she\u2019ll be an ultimately super important character.

He can smile his way through any kind of bullying so as to not worry his brother, the only person who will take his side.<br> His life in Fairy Britain has been nothing but suffering but he never complains.<br> He is like that out of concern for his brother but in his last moments, he drops the lies and voices the true feelings in his heart.</p><h4 id="winky" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#winky" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Winky</h4><p>An aloof and attractive goblin.

For that reason, he can\u2019t forgive himself for opening up to a sales product and makes the choice to return to the petty bandit life alone.</p><h4 id="boggart" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#boggart" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Boggart</h4><p>Fang Clan.

Unshakably meritocratic.<br> He has unusual origins, being a Fang Clan faerie born in Norwich, the city governed by the Earth Clan.<br> He frequently mentions he disliked the noisy Earth Clan blacksmiths and the salty sea breeze but this is the only way Boggart can cope with being driven away from his hometown.<br> He shows intent to revolt against Queen Morgan and is planning to recapture Norwich.</p><h4 id="old-blacksmith-ector" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#old-blacksmith-ector" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Old blacksmith (Ector)</h4><p>An Earth Clan blacksmith.<br> Ector is the name of King Arthur\u2019s childhood foster father in Pan-Human History.<br> His hair is one of those big fuzzy balls.

He\u2019s from the Earth Clan but his beard and mustache are short. He looks like a human in his mid-twenties.<br> He was originally a negative and abject nerd, but meeting da Vinci got him strangely pumped and full of energy every day. He wears an apron since he\u2019s a shopkeeper.<br> Additionally, he figured out that da Vinci\u2019s lifespan is almost over, and that\u2019s another reason why he didn\u2019t want her to overwork herself.</p><p>He appears both in part 1 and part 2 but his main role is in the collapse arc.<br> Before the coronation, when they start talking about how da Vinci is going to leave the next day, he\u2019s there behind the counter going</p><blockquote><p>\u201CDon\u2019t take Davinci away from me.\u201D<br> \u201CWithout Davinci, I\u2019ll go back to being plain old me.\u201D</p></blockquote><p>while he neurotically sharpened his knife.<br> Later, he gets a scene after the start of the world collapse, when Salisbury has gone postal from internal strife.<br> When da Vinci returns to the burning Salisbury bar to pick up something she forgot, Mike approaches her from behind with his kitchen knife.<br> Mike\u2019s self-centered faerie instincts get him saying \u201CYou should stay here. Yeah.
