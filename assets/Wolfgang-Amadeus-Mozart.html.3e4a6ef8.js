Like how one would understand from seeing the drawing of his last ascension, with large influence from the movie Amadeus at first I put up a design that blends in various of homages, like Amadeus&#39; father&#39;s clothes, or his form when returning to the requiem, but midway I went with emphasizing his arrangement, so it feels like the original prototype design has mostly been removed.
