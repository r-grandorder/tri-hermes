The materialization of the Labyrinth where Asterios was confined in. A Great Magecraft exceedingly similar to a Reality Marble, it was created in the Underside of the World.

Even once it disappears, it is possible to rebuild it again when some time passes. However, in doing so, if it is not a labyrinth different from the previous installment, one can probably just downright walk out of it there and then.

Poseidon, who had his promise trampled underneath Minos\u2019 foot, placed a curse on Pasipha\xEB, the wife of the King, having induced her so that she will bear a sexual desire towards bulls. And like that, so was born Asterios, his name meaning \u201CThe One Who Rules the Stars\u201D, but because he possesses the body of a man with the head of a bull, he was given the name \u201CMinotauros\u201D, which means \u2018The Bull of King Minos\u2019. Minos was at a complete loss because of the Queen\u2019s scandal, so he ordered the famous artisan Daedalus to construct \u201Ca place where one can never get out from\u201D\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014namely, the Labyrinth.</p><p>Because of the King\u2019s command, it became a usual custom to offer seven boys and girls each as a sacrifice to Asterios. Understandably, he cannot offer the people of his own country, so King Minos demanded from Athens, the state that he invaded, to offer sacrifices for his compensation.</p><p>On the occasion of the sacrificial group being elected the third time around, Theseus, the Hero of Athens, came forward personally for the sake of defeating Asterios. Ariadne, King Minos\u2019 daughter, fell in love with the handsome Theseus at first sight. Theseus, with Ariadne\u2019s cooperation in securing an escape route from the impossible-to-escape Labyrinth, succeeded in realizing Asterios\u2019 defeat.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014What a wonderful heroic tale.</p><p>It was neither his mother\u2019s responsibility nor his own responsibility that Asterios was a monster. Whereas it was said to be his father\u2019s responsibility, for he valued the bull that should have been sacrificed to the gods. Nevertheless, the boy had never blamed his father, not even with just a single word.</p><p>It is not because Asterios loves his father. But if there is such a strong emotion out there, it can surpass the resentment sealed within himself. His father paid tribute to him with the most important name of all, and he was saved. Someday, with the salvation of being slain by a Hero\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014he can be proud, of the name Lightning (Asterios). To a monster like himself, this beautiful name is, to a degree, more than what he deserves. At only just that time, he could not be even capable of hating his father.</p><p>\u201CI wanted to save you.\u201D</p><p>Theseus, who noticed that Asterios was only a boy, threw these words with his heartfelt thoughts put into it.</p><p>Theseus\u2019 prayer is over there, in the distant future. It will be fulfilled, in the endless Okeanos Sea. For Theseus, that trip by boat, and the chats with his fellow comrades about this tale, were cherished memories where just about everything around him was shining, just like how a gemstone would sparkle.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014If it is for that, one should not even hesitate in any extent to risk their life.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>The Labrys\u2026 A very gigantic axe that can turn into a \u201Cdouble-edged blade\u201D by installing one hatchet used for ritualistic ceremonies to another back-to-back.

The moment the direction became certain, I received a great response, \u201CThis young beast-man, is\u2026 it!!!\u201D, from Mr. Takeuchi approximately at the time when a rough sketch of his current state was revealed. Within the game, his hair tied to his battle sprite fluttering around like a tail is a favourite of mine.
