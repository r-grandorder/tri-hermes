I&#39;m sorry, it seems I spaced out a little.<br> What do you mean by \u201Cnice\u201D?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s nothing, Mash.<br> Just something that crossed my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... \u201CMash\u201D? It is kind of refreshing hearing that from you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> You don&#39;t like me saying your name?<br> I can call you something else if it&#39;s too frank.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, no, it&#39;s not that. I am just a little surprised you would use my name.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh. Well, I&#39;m glad it doesn&#39;t bother you. Ah... Come to think of it, this place is full of things that I&#39;m glad about.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> First and foremost, I&#39;m glad you summoned me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh... What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I mean I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t summon my adult self.<br> It seems something strange is going on this time...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> So there&#39;s a possibility that my adult self would be summoned at the same time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh. I see...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To be honest, we&#39;re not sure how to act around you either... I mean, what should we call you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, wait. Safety first. I have to be careful with my words... My king, how would you like for us mongrels to address you?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh, come on, you don&#39;t need to be so nervous, Doctor. I&#39;m not that me you&#39;re thinking of.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I don&#39;t lash out just because I don&#39;t like something.<br> Geez, that guy is such a man-child.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (I bet the world&#39;s oldest King of Heroes never imagined his childhood self would be dissing him like this...)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> At any rate, you can be casual with me... I know.<br> You can call me Gil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to meet you, Gil.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It&#39;s good to meet you too, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, future King Gil!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh please, Master.<br> I&#39;m just a Servant. An Archer.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Just treat me like any other Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I feel the same. ...I am happy to have you around, Gil.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Likewise. Oh! I just thought of another thing that I&#39;m glad about.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I know I&#39;m repeating myself, but I&#39;m so glad that I got to meet a wonderful person like you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Just so you know, I actually have a good eye for women.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> As for my adult self, however, he probably wouldn&#39;t even notice your beauty...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...Wait, actually... He might be attracted to certain aspects of you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It&#39;s just a feeling, I&#39;m not sure how to probably put that into words...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> But anyway, I for one appreciate how lovely and sweet you are. Although sometimes you can get a little too serious...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Please don&#39;t tease me, Gil...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I agree 100%.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve known that from the beginning!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you too!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. We mean nothing by it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be shy. It&#39;s natural to feel happy when someone compliments you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the issue...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mm? Wait a second. That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enemy attack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess we don&#39;t have the luxury to sit around and chat anymore.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> (Sigh) Just when I was about to enjoy the company of a lovely flower. Take a hint already.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> However, this is also something I&#39;m glad about.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I might look like a child, but since I&#39;m summoned as a Servant, I&#39;ll prove to you that I can be useful in battle as well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> (Besides, there&#39;s something else I want to be sure of.)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> (What made Mash into the lovely flower she is today? Depending on that answer...)</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> And there you have it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Mash, you&#39;ve got potential, but it&#39;s raw and unrefined.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> For your own sake, you should let me give you a helping hand. By all means!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-Come again...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really understand, but I assume that&#39;s the reason we are here by the beach. What do you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Good question. First, we have to do something about that outfit.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if you should be wearing that armor all the time. It adds a rustic feel to your loveliness.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> You should wear something more girly once in a while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Girly...? My Chaldea uniform is made for women...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Nope, that doesn&#39;t count. Mass-produced items are not good. It has to be one of a kind...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Grazie!<br> Grazie molto!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci!? Would you stop hijacking our communication channel!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh hush, Roman.<br> Kid Gil just said something amazing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Actually, I&#39;ve been thinking the same thing.<br> Mash is just squandering away her beauty.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to reiterate it, but research has shown that one&#39;s outfit is an essential element in the pursuit of beauty.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, look at me. This outfit is one of a kind, naturally. I designed it myself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Although I&#39;m a little different since I don&#39;t have a gender, or rather, my gender is Mona Lisa, but let&#39;s leave that aside.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No matter where and when, civilized girls should care about their fashion.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I understand, Mash. You pretend you don&#39;t care, but it&#39;s been bugging you deep down inside, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It must&#39;ve been tough... But it&#39;s alright now.<br> I am an ally to all those who pursue beauty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, actually, I don&#39;t really\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes! To put it simply, I agree with Kid Gil here 100%!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re like a talent agency that records, analyzes, arranges, advises, and creates r\xE9sum\xE9s for auditions!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I, Leonardo da Vinci, promise to do everything in my power as an artist to support you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It seems I have a reliable ally. How reassuring.<br> Thank you, beautiful Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh... The King of Heroes certainly does have a discerning eye. You know, you&#39;re a lot cooler as a child than as an adult.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Hahaha. Now let&#39;s never speak of it again.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Back to business. It&#39;s the first time we&#39;re all here, plus the location is perfect, so...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I think Mash should put this on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, a swimsuit! What better way to show the beauty of the sea!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He did it so casually, but I feel like I just witnessed a Noble Phantasm being utilized in an extremely wasteful way.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about that. I&#39;m not.<br> Here, Mash, put this on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s easy for you to say!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Uh... Senpai, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Honestly, I really want to see it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ll look good in it! I LOVE THE SEA!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Okay. Fine. I&#39;ll go change, so please wait here a couple of minutes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> HURRAY!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Romani, I&#39;m telling you right now, give me the recorder&#39;s control.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There are all kinds of ethical issues if you start recording video of Mash in a swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, those issues don&#39;t apply to me! I am simply recording her to observe and preserve her beauty.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Hmm... I&#39;m only curious since I&#39;m like a father to her... I&#39;m also a doctor...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Therefore I have a responsibility to observe her growth. I&#39;m not interested in her beyond that...)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well, now that Mash has gone to change, let&#39;s talk about something serious.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...Namely, the danger she&#39;s in.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Danger?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Yes. I realized it by watching her in our last fight.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Her fragility is precisely what makes a flower like her so lovely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t follow.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> She always puts her Master&#39;s safety before anything else. In an extremely excessive way.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> In a dangerous situation, she would throw away her life to protect her Master.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> However, there&#39;s not a shred of conviction nor experience as a warrior in her actions.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Mash feels fear and confusion, but risks her life without conquering either.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Do you think that&#39;s how she should live her life?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...? I don&#39;t see a problem.<br> In fact, I think it&#39;s incredibly heroic.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, it just means her dedication to Fujimaru outweighs both those emotions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m envious. I wish I could meet a dependable bodyguard like that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> (Sigh) ...A genius just doesn&#39;t get it. You don&#39;t understand the feelings of an average person.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s rude. I do understand.<br> Mash is a faithful Servant who embodies perseverance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I do worry about her offensive capabilities, but she&#39;s a reliable shield for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> All right, fine. What do you think, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? About what?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> How would you describe Mash&#39;s current state?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um... How indeed... That&#39;s not something I can really say right off the bat...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh. I knew it.<br> You do understand, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Then I won&#39;t point it out. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll atone for your laziness in the end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Ah well. Anyway, Mash is too much like a Servant.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Yes, she&#39;s a Demi-Servant, but ultimately she&#39;s still a human. I think it&#39;s a shame to let that part of her go to waste.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm... Is that why you are trying to draw out the girly part in her? As a way for her to get in touch with her humanity?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Precisely. Displays of emotion are a human strength.<br> It&#39;s a waste that she doesn&#39;t use them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll admit I really just want to see her in a swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Heh... She can&#39;t escape my eyes. That&#39;s right, I can tell she has curves in all the right places!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Anyway, she&#39;ll be back any min\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Emergency! Enemy alert!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> ...Come again? Wait, Mash, how come you&#39;re not in a swimsuit!? Where&#39;s the dynamite body!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, the swimsuit! Where&#39;s the dazzling beauty!? Where&#39;s the dynamite body!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was going to exploit the situation and slip into a swimsuit myself! That will improve my popularity and my presence as the embodiment of beauty! Bravo!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was the perfect plan! Now what&#39;ll become of it!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you were thinking...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That swimsuit... I was going to put it on, but then I had a good look at it and... um, well, it&#39;s not something I could ever wear.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Ahhh... That&#39;s because I got it from my treasury.<br> I guess the style isn&#39;t very modern?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I predicted such a reaction, so I gave you several designs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s not the problem!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All of them had visual defects...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, one was just made of strings, another was semi-transparent, one didn&#39;t have a top half...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or it did have a top half, but I don&#39;t count clamshells as suitable!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s wrong with that? I like that kind of thing. Especially if it means seeing women in a state of embarrassment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is that unintentional or not...? A-Anyway, right now our priority is eliminating the enemy in front of us! Go for it, everyone!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew... Senpai, are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep, not even a scratch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I am, thanks to you, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? I&#39;m glad to hear it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll check the surrounding area to see if there are any enemies left. Senpai, please stay on guard as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Now that you mention it, she does act like a Servant. Probably even more than one...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s because Mash was raised in Chaldea and duty has always been her priority. So she was well-grounded before all this.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t call an aptitude that was forced on her being \u201Cwell-grounded.\u201D That&#39;s called a curse, Archaman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Humph. You&#39;re being argumentative this time around. Were you this compassionate as a Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh, please. Tastes can change, but that doesn&#39;t change the underlying personality.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> If my adult self is cold-hearted, then so am I. The difference is in whether it&#39;s expressed in moderation.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> But it looks like I was being too much of a busybody. Ultimately, what we&#39;re able to do doesn&#39;t amount to much.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> So, Master.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who&#39;s closest to Mash, so please watch out for her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> How did she fight? What kind of fight was it?<br> These are important questions, so don&#39;t forget.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well, you seem to be a sharp person, Master.<br> I don&#39;t really think I needed to say all that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like we obliterated the threat, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, also, I&#39;d like to say something, just so there&#39;s no misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have anything against wearing a swimsuit in front of you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But this time around, the swimsuits Gil prepared for me were...just too advanced for my level...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it were a normal swimsuit...and the occasion arose...<br> I wouldn&#39;t mind...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s all I wanted to say. Pardon me.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Yes, food for thought. Instead of worrying now, it&#39;s like there&#39;s promise for the future.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> So it looks like you don&#39;t need me to stick around. I&#39;ll let Master continue to polish this diamond in the rough.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Ah, but if you ever need a tool to help draw out her girly side, let me know anytime.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I may have just what you need in my treasury!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And where beauty is involved,<br> don&#39;t forget good ol&#39; Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If she seems to be even a little uncertain about her own idea of beauty, don&#39;t hesitate to send her my way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Because nobody surpasses me when it comes to acquiring femininity!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Right. Well, certainly, it&#39;s a matter that deserves some thought.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For me, as long as Mash is healthy, I can&#39;t ask for anything more...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it&#39;s a good thing to have a little color in your life! Maybe I&#39;ll scrape together some funds to make a swimsuit for Mash!</p>', 194);
