I won&#39;t look suspicious walking around now.&quot;</p><p>I finish lunch in a few minutes and go out into the hallway.</p><p>This is no time to complain that I&#39;ve never done anything like this before.</p><p>The battle has already begun.</p><p>So I have to find the &quot;suspicious places&quot; Tohsaka was talking about in my own way.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess I should start with places where there aren&#39;t many people.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well.</p><p>An hour until lunch break ends... I hope I can get good results out of this\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>After checking through the school building, I go outside just in case.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with the ground or behind the school building, but this area is too different.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Could it be here too?&quot;</p><p>...There were several strange places inside the school building as well.</p><p>Unpopular places like behind the stairs or within empty classrooms.</p><p>But this place is different.</p><p>Far from nobody coming here, this is a place people come every day.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why didn&#39;t I notice?</p><p>Talking about strangeness, this place is the strangest\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I mutter, grasping my chest.</p><p>...This place is somehow suffocating.</p><p>The thick wind and moist air aren&#39;t just strange.</p><p>No, once I notice this smell, I actually feel like throwing up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka was saying that there&#39;s a basis point for a boundary field.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how many there are, but this must mean the first basis point is around here...&quot;</p><p>Then there should be some sign of it.</p><hr><p>...</p><p>......</p><p>.........</p><p>...It&#39;s no good.</p><p>As I have no skill in detecting magical energy, there&#39;s no way I can see the sign that&#39;s constructing the boundary field.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew.&quot;</p><p>I guess it can&#39;t be helped. I&#39;ll go and tell Tohsaka about this place and\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;What, are you looking for something, Emiya?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I turn around at the sudden voice. Standing in front of the deserted archery dojo is\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey. What a coincidence. I came because I had business in that area too... did you happen to see it?&quot;</p><p>With a grin,</p><p>Matou Shinji asks this happily.</p><hr><p>&quot;...See... what? There&#39;s nothing here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, so you did see it. ...I see, so that&#39;s why you were with Tohsaka. That&#39;s right, it&#39;s more efficient to join up with other Masters.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015! Shinji, you...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t guard yourself too much Emiya. It&#39;s you and me, let&#39;s not hide anything from each other.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who you have. But you were forced into this ugly role of Master too, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji states it clearly without holding anything back.</p><p>That he, Matou Shinji, is also a Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Could it be? You&#39;re a Master, Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m telling you.</p><p>Oh, but don&#39;t get it wrong. I don&#39;t intend to fight with anyone. Well, I&#39;ll certainly retaliate with deadly force if I&#39;m attacked, but I won&#39;t do anything when nothing&#39;s done to me. See, I&#39;m like you in that regard, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji laughs.</p><p>From his words, there seems to be no doubt that Shinji&#39;s a Master, but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;m also surprised to find out that you&#39;re a Master. Let&#39;s call us equal in that regard. So, do you want to discuss something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Discuss... I don&#39;t mind, but discuss what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;About what we do now.</p><p>Like I said earlier, I have no intention of fighting. But others aren&#39;t the same, right? So I feel uneasy unless I prepare for future misfortunes. It&#39;s troubling alone, but don&#39;t you think something would be possible with the two of us?&quot;</p><hr><p>...</p><p>So in other words, Shinji is asking me to cooperate with him?</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s not talk here. We don&#39;t know if someone might overhear us, so let&#39;s go somewhere else.</p><p>Hmm... yeah, my place would be good. Tohsaka won&#39;t be able to notice and it&#39;s safe even if we&#39;re attacked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you talking about? Lunch break is almost over, so if you have\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you stupid? We can skip classes. Let&#39;s go, Emiya. I&#39;m happy to know that you&#39;re a Master, so don&#39;t alienate me too much.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t do that. People would be suspicious if we skipped classes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn, you&#39;re really stubborn... oh, I see!</p><p>You&#39;re right, people would normally stay safe!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t attack you no matter what. See, do I look like someone who would attack you from behind?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You&#39;re right, I certainly can&#39;t just follow you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.... Well, it&#39;s all right. You have a Servant with you too. I won&#39;t pick a fight against such a dangerous opponent.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>Does Shinji think I have Saber with me?</p><p>No, that&#39;s wrong\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji couldn&#39;t see a Servant in spirit form.</p><p>That&#39;s why he&#39;s wrongly guessing that I have Saber with me right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s just go. It&#39;ll be no good if Tohsaka finds us.&quot;</p><p>Saying that, Shinji starts to walk away.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I guess I have to follow him.</p><p>I&#39;m interested in what Shinji has to say, so I&#39;ll skip the afternoon classes.</p><hr><p>We go up the hill road.</p><p>The Western-style houses, on the opposite side to my house.</p><p>I guess Tohsaka&#39;s house is at the top, but I recall that Matou&#39;s house is on the back, as if avoiding public eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s an amazing building as always.</p><p>I came here to play a few times during middle school, but I haven&#39;t even been near it recently.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been invited since I became estranged from Shinji, and most of all, Sakura didn&#39;t like me coming to this house.</p><hr><p>...Even though it&#39;s daytime, it&#39;s dim inside the house.</p><p>This building is made so that sunlight cannot enter it, and there aren&#39;t many lights in here.</p><p>I&#39;m exaggerating, but you&#39;d walk into the wall if you&#39;re not used to this place.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya, this way. I&#39;m in the living room.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know when he went in, but I can hear Shinji&#39;s voice from the inner room.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s been a year, my body still remembers this place and I make my way to the living room without getting lost.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no kind of light in the living room either.</p><p>The curtains are closed, and the sunlight is blocked off.</p><p>There are no artificial lights and the living room is in the dark.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya, over here.&quot;</p><p>I look over in the direction of the voice.</p><p>There is Shinji sitting in a chair, and\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A figure of a woman like crystallized darkness.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let me introduce her. This is my Servant, Rider.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I feel a chill.</p><p>It&#39;s so bad that the back of my neck hurts like it&#39;s been slashed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Weren&#39;t we going to talk with just the two of us, Shinji?&quot;</p><p>I back up a bit and manage to say that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s just a precaution. I&#39;d be scared if you just came and attacked me, so I have to have Rider by my side.&quot;</p><p>Stretching his hand out, Shinji touches his black Servant\u2015\u2015\u2015Rider.</p><p>He caresses from her waist down to her thighs, as if tasting them.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Rider does not move at all.</p><p>She stands there like a statue, and keeps watch on me with her covered eyes.</p><p>...It can&#39;t just be an illusion that it feels like she sees even my fingertips shivering.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re like this even when you&#39;ve invited someone? Aren&#39;t you being a little too wary, Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on, it was just a joke. I know you can&#39;t do anything like that.</p><p>But your Servant is a different story. Even I had trouble training mine. It&#39;s not unusual for a Servant not to obey its Master, so think of this as just keeping a small check on things.&quot;</p><hr><p>...A Servant that doesn&#39;t obey its Master?</p><p>Certainly, Rider in front of me is different from Saber.</p><p>Saber is quiet, but not coldhearted.</p><p>But I can only feel coldness from Rider.</p><hr><p>A human lacking humanity.</p><p>A black figure like discolored blood.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t seem like a Servant or a heroic spirit. She&#39;s so inorganic with no sense of lightness.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Rider&#39;s a way to keep a check on my Servant? I don&#39;t feel too good about that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry. I&#39;m just a novice, so I&#39;m not experienced like you are. Forgive me for that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Heh. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m experienced either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that so? Then you should summon yours too. We would understand each other better that way, and it&#39;s more fair too.</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;ll be great! Hey Emiya, I showed you mine, so you show me yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>...So Shinji is wrongly guessing that Saber is with me.</p><p>But there&#39;s no need to correct him on that.</p><hr><p>&quot;I refuse. If you&#39;re going to keep me in check, that&#39;s fine.</p><p>This should be enough if we&#39;re here just to talk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...What&#39;s with that? Hey, I&#39;m saying I want to see it. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re being a snob about, but shouldn&#39;t you listen to me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then our conversation&#39;s over. I didn&#39;t come here to show you my Servant. If that was your plan, I&#39;m going home now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn\u2015\u2015all right. You&#39;re useless as always.&quot;</p><p>Shinji comments discontentedly and leans back in his chair.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, let&#39;s get to it. Well, there&#39;s only one thing I want to talk about.</p><p>...Like I said before, do you want to collaborate with me, Emiya? I became a Master, but I don&#39;t know about this Holy Grail War thing. I want to cooperate with someone I know rather than staying on my own.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. I want to ask you something too before that. I&#39;ll answer your question after that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, you want to know why I became a Master?&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>As far as I know, Shinji isn&#39;t a magus.</p><p>I have to know how someone like that became a Master, or I can&#39;t cooperate at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;I heard Masters have to be magi as a basic prerequisite. Even though I&#39;m inexperienced, I know a bit of magecraft. I summoned my Servant by accident and became a Master after forming a contract, but... did you summon your Servant by accident and get dragged into this Holy Grail War too?&quot;</p><hr><p>If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;re the same.</p><p>I won&#39;t easily be able to refuse his proposal of cooperation if that&#39;s the case\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You became a Master by accident, huh?</p><p>...I see, I see. Good, that makes it more understandable.&quot;</p><p>Shinji smiles delightedly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s similar in my case. The fact that I became a Master against my will is the same.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But don&#39;t get me wrong.</p><p>I knew what a Master was, and I&#39;ve known about the Holy Grail War for a long time. The Matou family isn&#39;t like your family. We&#39;re a respected lineage of magi.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>The Matou is a lineage of magi...!?</p><p>&quot;What, I never heard about that...!?</p><p>Hold on. Then, you and\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>His sister Sakura knows magecraft too...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Calm down, Emiya. The Matou family is a family of magi, but we&#39;re already dead.</p><p>I guess the ancestors of the Matou family came to this land with Tohsaka&#39;s family, but didn&#39;t adapt to the land here.</p><p>Down the generations, what&#39;s that thing, the Magic Circuit? That thing faded, and by the time I was born, the Matou blood had returned to that of an ordinary person&#39;s.</p><p>So members of the Matou family aren&#39;t magi. We&#39;re just a family that used to be magi.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You guys were magi... then, only the knowledge remains?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, unfortunately. But even if we don&#39;t have magecraft-Circuits, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that we&#39;re studying magecraft. It was easy to find out about the Masters and the Holy Grail War with a bit of research. I&#39;m able to relax even after suddenly being chosen as a Master, because of the teachings of the previous generations.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>I became a Master and understood the Holy Grail War because of Tohsaka.</p><p>Similarly, Shinji understood his situation because of the literature passed down his family.</p><hr><p>&quot;So in other words, you were taught just the knowledge of magecraft. ...Then, did Sakura learn magecraft as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Geez, you really don&#39;t know anything, do you?</p><p>Look, it probably doesn&#39;t matter to you since your family is a hybrid,[l]</p><p>but a magus of an old lineage only teaches his secret arts to one. If there are two children, you only make the eldest son the successor.</p><hr><p>&quot;You get less power if you separate something into two, right?</p><p>Magi place ten magics into one crystal and leave them behind to create a stronger blood. We don&#39;t make exceptions just because someone is from our family.</p><hr><p>&quot;So a family of magi doesn&#39;t teach magecraft to anyone other than their successors. It&#39;s common for the children who aren&#39;t chosen as the successor to be raised without knowing that their family studies magecraft, or they are to be given out for adoption.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see\u2015\u2015\u2015thank God, then.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m glad.</p><p>Sakura is a girl who should stay in a peaceful world without magecraft.</p><p>I can&#39;t let her get involved in a battle that forces you to kill others without reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, now you know, Emiya.</p><p>Even though I became a Master, I&#39;m not experienced with magecraft.</p><p>You&#39;re... let&#39;s see, you say you can use a bit, but your knowledge is that of an amateur.</p><p>See, don&#39;t you think we&#39;re a good combination? Let&#39;s cooperate since both of us became Masters against our will.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t mind that. But just to make sure, it&#39;s just to protect yourself, right Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. There&#39;s that, but we have to attack the enemy right in front of us first. It seems she considers me her enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Considers you an enemy...? You mean, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course! She wouldn&#39;t be so unkind to me if that weren&#39;t the case...!</p><p>...Look, she&#39;s the type that won&#39;t forgive other Masters. You should know that by now if you&#39;ve been with her.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the reason is, but she lets her guard down when she&#39;s with you. I don&#39;t know why, but that perfect girl has her guard down!</p><p>\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t you see that it&#39;s a great opportunity to defeat her?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying that, Shinji puts out his hand as if asking for a handshake.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-choice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-choice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 - Choice</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I won&#39;t cooperate with such an approach.</p><p>No, I can&#39;t.</p><p>If Shinji really wants to protect himself, he should talk to Tohsaka too and not just me.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji. Do you know that there&#39;s someone who supervises the Holy Grail War?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that priest at the church, I hear. They say he&#39;s a survivor of the last war, but I didn&#39;t go see him because he seems annoying.</p><p>I&#39;m not a magus, so it&#39;s a bother to be forced to follow the magi&#39;s rules.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s contradictory.</p><p>If he wants to really stop fighting, he should go and see Kotomine first.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji. Do you know about the boundary field set up at our school?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I can&#39;t tell, but Rider told me. What about it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Isn&#39;t it your doing? Tohsaka said it was the work of a Master at our school.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s not me. There&#39;s certainly another Master at that school, so it must be him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Tohsaka said there was only one other.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You trust Tohsaka too much. Well, putting that aside, Tohsaka is wrong.</p><p>The presence she can feel is that Magic Circuit thing, right?</p><p>Then I&#39;m not a Master she can perceive, because I don&#39;t have a Magic Circuit to begin with.</p><p>From the beginning, we&#39;re people that go under the radars of the normal Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I see.</p><p>The presence of a magus, the presence of the Command Spell... they are both things activated by magical energy.</p><hr><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015if someone without magical energy becomes a Master, the only way to identify them is to actually see them.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s method of searching for people with magical energy would not only overlook Shinji as a Master, but she wouldn&#39;t even notice him at all.</p><p>It&#39;s because Shinji does not have the presence of a Master that Tohsaka is searching for.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then there must be another Master that Tohsaka is sensing.&quot;</p><p>I should go home and warn Tohsaka about that.</p><p>Then there&#39;s no reason to stay here anymore.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Hey Emiya, what about the cooperation thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I refuse. I won&#39;t participate in beating Tohsaka or anything like that.</p><p>First of all, she hasn&#39;t done anything.</p><p>Eventually... I will end up fighting her, but she can be trusted right now, and I want to trust her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, I think it&#39;ll be too late when something happens. But if you say so, fine. I&#39;ll wait and see.&quot;</p><hr><p>Surprisingly, Shinji seems to have given up.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t try to stop me from going home, and he doesn&#39;t try to make Rider attack me.</p><hr><p>...He&#39;s a really difficult person.</p><p>He acts like this, but he seems to try to be fair in his own way.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey Shinji. I might be persistent, but does Sakura know about you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She doesn&#39;t, and I have no intention of telling her. I&#39;m the successor of the Matou family. I&#39;ll let her be my sister and not know anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;ll help. I want Sakura to stay like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015.</p><p>I see. If you&#39;re worried about Sakura that much, I should thank you as her brother. ...All right then, I&#39;ll tell you something good, Emiya.</p><p>I don&#39;t know who it is, but one of the Masters is nesting at the temple.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!? Temple... you mean Ryuudou Temple!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. As my Servant puts it, there&#39;s a witch up there. She is supposedly collecting souls on a large scale, so it&#39;ll be a problem if we don&#39;t do something about it fast.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>If that&#39;s true, that is the fifth one.</p><p>And if that one is collecting souls on a large scale, there&#39;s a high probability that it is the cause of the story on this morning&#39;s news.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s all.</p><p>Well Rider, see him off. Emiya is on our side, so don&#39;t hurt him.&quot;</p><p>So ordered by Shinji, Rider approaches me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... no, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be so reserved. You&#39;re my responsibility until you leave the house, so it&#39;ll be troublesome if you got hurt.</p><p>Oh Rider, you only have to see him to the front door. He has nothing to do with me once he exits, so treat him well until then.&quot;</p><p>Shinji retreats into the back room.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I look silently at Rider.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Rider, covered in black clothes, doesn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>But surprisingly\u2015\u2015\u2015looking at her closely, I notice that she has clean features.</p><hr><p>The long purple hair reaching to the ground only reminds me of the smell of blood, but at the same time, I understand it&#39;s really beautiful.</p><p>...She&#39;s wearing this outfit, so it&#39;s embarrassing to directly stare at her, but can it be that her outfit doesn&#39;t match her face?</p><hr><p>To put it into a phrase, she&#39;s a shrine maiden covered in blood.</p><p>That contradictory appearance of one who is both holy and evil is this Servant called Rider.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But...&quot;</p><p>Are all heroic spirits beautiful?</p><p>I think so while looking up at Rider&#39;s face out of curiosit\u2015\u2015\u2015hey, Rider&#39;s tall for a girl.</p><p>Rider must be at least 170 centimeters tall.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm&quot;</p><p>This is no time to calmly observe Rider.</p><p>It&#39;s a problem to be alone with Rider, so I should get out of this place quickly.</p><hr><p>Rider really follows me out to the entrance.</p><p>...I wonder.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t feel alive, but she might answer me if I talk to her.</p><hr><ol><li><p>Talk to Rider.</p></li><li><p>...Keep away from dangerous things.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id="scene-02-unused-dead-end" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-unused-dead-end" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 (Unused) / DEAD END ??</h2><p>&quot;Yay, I&#39;ll cooperate\u2014\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course.

There&#39;s something I want to tell you guys.&quot;</p><p>Saber raises her brows a bit.</p><p>...As a Servant, she must prefer battles where she uses her sword to these peaceful days.</p><hr><p>But her wounds shouldn&#39;t have healed yet.</p><p>The wound on her chest made by Lancer&#39;s &quot;Noble Phantasm&quot; isn&#39;t something even Saber can heal quickly.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Thinking about that makes me hesitate telling them about Shinji.</p><p>I feel the same way as Shinji.</p><p>I want to avoid starting fights, and\u2015\u2015\u2015I think the girl in front of me swinging a sword is a disparate image.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. You have something to tell us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh\u2015\u2015yeah. Right, this is something I should tell you guys. ...To put it simply, I went and met with Rider&#39;s Master today.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha... Rider&#39;s Master!? When did this happen!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ridiculous! Meeting with another Master by yourself, what were you thinking!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whoa, hold on, calm down...! It&#39;s all right. I&#39;m not hurt, so don&#39;t get mad.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not get mad!? No, I am not mad.</p><p>I am only stunned by your actions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Me too. Well, it&#39;s no use arguing over what&#39;s done.</p><p>So, what&#39;s going on Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka and Saber glare at me with obvious anger in their eyes.</p><p>...Geez.</p><p>I thought they would say something about me being thoughtless, but I didn&#39;t think they would get this mad.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I met him this afternoon.</p><p>I only went because he wanted to talk to me, and it&#39;s not like we fought.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can tell by looking. So, what kind of a guy was Rider&#39;s Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What kind of guy... well, it&#39;s Shinji.</p><p>He called out to me when I was searching for the boundary field. He said he wanted to talk to me and asked me to follow him, so I went to Matou&#39;s house.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015Shinji? You mean, that Shinji!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Rider was obeying him, and he knew about the Holy Grail War. According to him, the Matou family is a lineage of magi with a history.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015yeah, well, that&#39;s true, but... it can&#39;t be true. The Matou family was exhausted in the last generation. No matter what they do, their children won&#39;t have a Magic Circuit. That&#39;s for certain.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka declares so.</p><p>If so, Shinji and Sakura really should be normal people without magecraft-Circuits.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, Shinji said that too. But he said they still had the knowledge. Something about it being taught only to Shinji, the eldest son, so Sakura didn&#39;t know about it.</p><p>...In short, he&#39;s a Master rather like me. He said he doesn&#39;t have any magical energy, so he wouldn&#39;t be detected by your perceptions.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I messed up. There certainly could be such cases... If they have grimoires remaining, he would be able to become a Master. Then geez, my actions were totally obvious to him! I&#39;m an idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is mumbling, reflecting on her actions.</p><p>...Hm. Tohsaka is close to perfect, but I think there are a few things missing.</p><p>Unfortunately, they&#39;re the most crucial ones.</p><hr><p>&quot;That was a mistake on my part. I should have kept an eye on Shinji. If I&#39;d known, I wouldn&#39;t have let him construct that boundary field.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Shinji said the boundary field at school wasn&#39;t his. He said there&#39;s another Master at school.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s true. It&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s another Master at school who we don&#39;t know about.</p><p>But Shirou... don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re just trusting Shinji&#39;s word that he&#39;s not the one who constructed the boundary field?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, I&#39;m not that good-natured. As long as Shinji goes to our school, I think there&#39;s an even chance it&#39;s his doing. The alternative being the unknown Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Even, huh? ...I think you&#39;re still being very good-natured.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s fine. That good nature is just the way you are, and that must be why Shinji told you his true identity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well. So what did you talk with Shinji about?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He asked me if I wanted to cooperate with him. It seems Shinji has no intention of fighting, so he seemed to want to ally with someone he knew.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015Shirou, then you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, isn&#39;t it natural to refuse? I&#39;ve already joined up with you.</p><p>Even if I were to agree, I&#39;d have to ask you first.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh... yeah. That... is true. But didn&#39;t you say you refused?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Like I said, I answered Shinji on my own. It wasn&#39;t something to debate. ...Oh, was I too hasty?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Not particularly. I think your decision was correct. Well, if you were the one asked, it&#39;s not something I can complain about.&quot;</p><p>The way she mumbles so isn&#39;t like Tohsaka at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;That was it from Shinji.</p><p>From what I saw, Rider isn&#39;t a strong Servant. Even putting Berserker outside of the picture, I don&#39;t think she had the same presence as Lancer. And Rider herself was more normal than I expected.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...If you think so, it must be true. But a Servant&#39;s true power is determined by their Noble Phantasm. Please do not underestimate her until we find out Rider&#39;s true identity.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I couldn&#39;t tell at all which heroine she was. See, Lancer and Berserker feel like heroes, right? But Rider didn&#39;t have that feeling. I felt like she was different from a normal Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Different from a normal Servant?</p><p>I do not understand. Rin, can you explain Shirou&#39;s strange feeling?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? Uh... yeah, I think I understand.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s because the Master influences which heroic spirit is summoned as the Servant. The Master and Servant end up being similar people.</p><hr><p>&quot;So if the Master is a noble person, a heroic spirit similar to them will be summoned. And if a person with a huge scar in their mind summons a heroic spirit, a heroic spirit with a scar in their mind appears as well.</p><p>The strange feeling Shirou had towards Rider must be that.</p><p>A Master with a crooked mind sometimes summons vengeful ghosts almost like heroic spirits instead of a hero.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Vengeful ghost almost like heroic spirits... could that be what you were talking about before\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. A mass murderer that loves the sight of blood and thinks nothing of killing people.</p><p>Actually, there are heroes with only massacres to their legend, so it&#39;s not strange for something like that to become a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Is that so?</p><p>Certainly, I could only smell blood on Rider, but she didn&#39;t seem like a blood-thirsty killer....</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that&#39;s all there is to say about Rider.</p><p>There&#39;s one more thing, but it might be the most important.</p><p>According to Rider, there seems to be another Master at the Ryuudou Temple. I guess this Master is collecting magical energy from everyone in this town. What do you two make of this?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ryuudou Temple...? You mean that temple at the top of the mountain?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. What, does it mean something to you, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. It&#39;s just the opposite. I&#39;ve never been to the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of a Master this person is, but normally, you wouldn&#39;t choose to position yourself in such a remote place.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. I was also surprised when I heard that a Master&#39;s at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Even though it won&#39;t draw people&#39;s attention, there are many monks living there. If they act strangely, I think there&#39;d be an quick uproar.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmmm... I can&#39;t quite trust that story.</p><p>Even if it was the case, the Ryuudou Temple is on the outskirts of the suburbs, right?</p><p>To reach out to Miyama City and Shinto is more like a waste of magical energy than a great magecraft. Such large scale magecraft is impossible even with the magical energy collected from it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Then, Tohsaka starts to think with a troubled face.</p><p>I&#39;m relying on Tohsaka&#39;s opinion, so there&#39;s nothing I can do until she talks again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, that story is very plausible.</p><p>If one takes that temple, such magecraft would be naturally possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Saber by &#39;that temple&#39;\u2015\u2015you know of Ryuudou Temple? I haven&#39;t taken you there yet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Did you forget, Shirou? I have participated in the Holy Grail War previously as well. I am well-informed about the city, and I know that the temple is a fallen ley line.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Fallen ley line!? Hold on, that&#39;s what my house is! Why are there two foci of leylines in one area!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not know, but that temple is a place magi can call sacred.</p><p>I hear it is where the life of the region flows to, so it would be a perfect base to collect souls from. A magus need only to intervene in the natural flow to collect life forces from the whole city.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ve never heard of that.</p><p>But if that&#39;s the case, then it would certainly be possible for someone to steal life forces from all the people in the city...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;In other words, it&#39;s just an area that&#39;s spiritually superior, right? That&#39;s only natural. You don&#39;t build a temple anywhere else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015o-of course. You don&#39;t need to tell me that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought so. Temples and shrines have been built in sacred places to protect the town since ancient times. It&#39;s not that the monks pray to grant happiness. They remove evil by sealing the ill-omened. On that basis, it&#39;s only natural that the mountain Ryuudou Temple is on would be a sacred place.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t want to consider this, but did you think that Ryuudou Temple was just for show?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I did, is there something wrong with that!? Until now, I thought that temple was just for show because it didn&#39;t have any practicing healers!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Practicing healers...? What is that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;People who let ghosts go to heaven without using chants, faith, or prayers.</p><p>Enlightened people try to do so with just Buddhist powers, but monks without enough training haven&#39;t reached that level yet, so they add their own power to create spells like ours.</p><p>There&#39;s some kind of organization of those kinds of people in this country. But they&#39;re incompatible with the magecraft Association, so I don&#39;t know too much about them.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, more importantly, the temple.</p><p>If that temple is a ley line, Masters should try to take it immediately. That&#39;s strange... why are others ignoring that place?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Because the Ryuudou Temple is there, right? They keep watch so it doesn&#39;t get misused.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The monks at the Ryuudou Temple are all pure monks in training.</p><p>They aren&#39;t like us, so it&#39;d be easy for a Master to control them.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, Rin, that is wrong. It would certainly be easy for a Master to gain control of that temple. But that mountain has a boundary field that is inconvenient for Masters.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? A boundary field that&#39;s inconvenient for us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. There is a spell on that mountain that tries to eliminate anything other than natural spirits. It has no effect on normal humans, but it is a dreadful place for us Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eliminates anything other than natural spirits\u2015\u2015then that means Servants can&#39;t enter the mountain!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is possible, but our abilities would degrade.</p><p>It is much like receiving a Command Spell telling us not to go near that place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Then how is the Master at the Ryuudou Temple maintaining its Servant?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There is no boundary field once you enter the temple.</p><p>I hear that the boundary field was originally a border to protect the temple. The boundary field is only something that rejects people from outside, so it has no other powers.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then if we make it inside, there&#39;s nothing that affects the Servant?</p><p>&quot;...But that&#39;s strange. If you close the temple off like that, the ley line itself would stop. You would have to at least keep one way open or it couldn&#39;t be the center of the ley line, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. If you think in terms of the temple, it cannot refuse those visiting through the proper entrance. It may be following on this idea, but I heard that the road leading to the temple does not have the boundary field.</p><p>At that temple, only the main gate does not have the power to command us Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. That must be it. If you close off all the gates, the air inside will stagnate. Hmm, only the main gate, huh...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is all that I can tell you.</p><p>\u2015\u2015So, please come up with a plan. We have proven that there is a Master, so I believe there is only one action to take.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I know what Saber wants to say.</p><p>Her eyes tell me that since the location of the enemy is known, all that&#39;s left is to attack.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to pass on this.</p><p>It seems like a trap, and honestly, I can&#39;t take any action with this little information. If you&#39;re going to go to their homeground, you should at least wait until you find out what kind of Servant they have.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That is unexpected. I thought that you would go and fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go ahead and insult me. Archer isn&#39;t fully healed yet, so I&#39;ll remain a spectator for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand. Then Shirou, let us go to the temple by ourselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber says this as if it is the natural thing to do.</p><p>But that&#39;s...</p><hr><ol><li><p>Fight.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t fight.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id="scene-06-missing-ariadne-dead-end-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06-missing-ariadne-dead-end-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06 - Missing Ariadne / DEAD END 3</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll attack.</p><p>If there is a Master at the Ryuudou Temple and they are sucking magical energy out of people, then I should stop it as quickly as possible.</p><hr><p>&quot;I agree with Saber. I don&#39;t want to be the attacker, but it depends on the enemy.</p><p>We should go to Ryuudou Temple right away, to see what kind of a Master this person is.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then let us go, Shirou. I am glad you are being proactive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. If that&#39;s your decision, there&#39;s nothing for me to say. Just be careful.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to rest. I&#39;m not interested in a fight we&#39;ve no chance of winning. If you don&#39;t come back tomorrow, I&#39;ll go and collect your remains since we&#39;re cooperating.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s with her? Saying such ominous things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That must be Rin&#39;s way of warning us.</p><p>There will be defenses against outside enemies at Ryuudou Temple. We will have to pass through enemy traps and beat the Master.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Mm. Well, that&#39;s true, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s true that I&#39;m not enthusiastic about beating this Master.</p><p>I only want to know who the Master at Ryuudou Temple is and what their motives are.</p><p>Battle might be avoidable, and we&#39;ll retreat if things get dangerous.</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right. I won&#39;t let her look like that again.</p><p>If I judge that it&#39;s dangerous, we&#39;ll retreat immediately.</p><p>Even if Saber doesn&#39;t want to, I&#39;ll have to forcefully pull her back and bring her home\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The clouds are moving fast.</p><p>There is a strong wind way up in the sky.</p><hr><p>&quot;Master, it is almost midnight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. The town&#39;s fallen asleep. It&#39;s a good time to head out.&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod, picking up my shinai bag.</p><p>Inside is a wooden sword I found in the shed.</p><p>It&#39;s not promising equipment for fighting against a Servant, but it should withstand at least one blow if strengthened successfully.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. We&#39;re just going to the Ryuudou Temple to check things out.</p><p>It&#39;s enough if we can find out what kind of person the Master is and which class of Servant it has. There&#39;s no need to start a fight ourselves.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand. But if the enemy desires a battle and if I judge that you are in danger, that will not be the case.</p><p>As long as we are proceeding into enemy territory, I want you to be prepared for the death on either side.&quot;</p><hr><p>The death on one side.</p><p>The scale of fate is divided between the Master at the Ryuudou Temple and us, the intruders.</p><p>The scale is balanced now, but it might tilt towards one side or the other in a few hours\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>We go west from the intersection and run through the empty road.</p><p>Ryuudou Temple is in the opposite direction from the developed Shinto, at the end of the winding mountain path.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>A long set of stairs.</p><p>The road leading up to the remarkably tall mountain in Fuyuki City is engulfed in ominous darkness.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber.</p><p>Can you feel the presence of the Servant...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yes. I cannot perceive it precisely, but I can certainly feel a Servant&#39;s presence.&quot;</p><p>It may be the effect of the boundary field on the Ryuudou Temple, but it seems Saber&#39;s perceptive abilities have deteriorated.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015This is not a good wind. This place was an ominous place last time, but it is worse now. ...Shirou, please do not leave my side even for a moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I answer with a nod and start up the stone steps.</p><hr><p>The air is tense.</p><p>The forest submerged in the black of night is trembling with sounds.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>With every step, a bad premonition settles into my back.</p><hr><p>...The temple gates can be seen now.</p><p>Nothing has happened yet.</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of the enemy, and the temple gates are open as if inviting us in.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, please stop.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! An enemy, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. But it is not a Servant. The presence is too weak. It probably is a familiar for surveillance. We can ignore it, but\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>There must be something wrong about it.</p><p>Saber makes a troubled expression and glares at the temple gates a few steps away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber? Is something wrong...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I do not know. I cannot tell if this chill is because of the familiar or if it is the presence of the one protecting this temple gate.</p><p>There was some kind of a watcher at the gate, but it seems to be absent now.</p><p>...I do not want to admit it, but I consider that fact fortunate. It would be good not to confront the one protecting this gate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015There was a watcher here, but it&#39;s not here now...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. They already know we are here.</p><p>There are two reasons the watcher would depart in spite of that. Which do you think it is, Shirou?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...To hide from us, or to let us inside so we won&#39;t be able to get away.</p><p>...Either way, there will be no more progress unless we go in.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I definitely think it&#39;s a trap. Saber, can you tell what&#39;s going on inside from here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I can only determine that there is some sign of a Servant in there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I guess we won&#39;t know anything until we go inside.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Let&#39;s go. No matter what they do to us, nothing will happen until we see their faces.&quot;</p><p>I approach the temple gate with Saber.</p><hr><p>For a moment, the moon is covered by clouds.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015My vision is engulfed in darkness.</p><p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p>In it, I think\u2015\u2015I see a beautiful snake within the trees.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Hold on, Saber-&quot;</p><p>I stop Saber who is trying to go through the temple gate.</p><p>&quot;Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Her golden hair turns around.</p><p>But that&#39;s-</p><hr><p>&quot;Enforced transference...!?

in front of her has no fearful aspects nor a fearful weapon.</p><hr><p>...That is why it is strange.</p><p>Nothing can be felt from the man.</p><p>There is no doubt that he is a Servant, but there is no sense of any magical energy nor a hero&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p>So beating him should be easy.</p><p>It is true that this match would be over in one blow.</p><p>But her instincts tell her

about five meters between them.</p><p>She would certainly receive that sword before she could run up and rush him.</p><hr><p>...But nothing can be felt from that sword.</p><p>It should be easy to repel it.</p><p>So she should not hesitate and rush in... but Saber instinctively understands she cannot close in without care.</p><hr><p>She adjusts her stance slightly and glares at the enemy in

It is the etiquette of a knight for me to introduce myself if I am given your name.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s voice in reply is heavy.</p><p>For her, it is too risky to state her true name.</p><p>She cannot reveal her true name no matter what torture she receives, and she has no intention of revealing it.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But that is only for the sake of victory.</p><p>She cannot disgrace the faith of the knight for such a thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;You called yourself Kojirou.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Servant Assassin, I am-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop.

Could this be...&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s magical energy?</p><p>But then\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Why is she doing something like this with that wounded body of hers\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>No, should she even be doing this at all?</p><p>Saber cannot replenish her magical energy.</p><p>So she shouldn&#39;t be using her magical energy readily.</p><p>She has to leave the fighting to me and stay as my backup, or her magical energy will run out and\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I get up and run up the stairs.</p><p>This is no time to be crawling.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what Saber is planning to do, but I have to stop her\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>It must be luck that I avoided it.</p><p>Something like a dagger flies across right in front of me as I try to run up to the temple gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Who&#39;s there!?&quot;</p><p>I look toward the trees in the mountain off to the side of the stairs.</p><p>...There&#39;s no mistake about it.</p><p>I didn&#39;t notice because of the strong wind before, but someone else is hiding near here...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t play around\u2015\u2015don&#39;t hide like a coward and come out...!&quot;</p><p>I raise my voice.</p><p>That voice that should have been drowned out by the wind...</p><p>...Echoes through the area, surprising even me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015The wind... stopped?&quot;</p><p>I look up at the temple gate.</p><p>There...[r]</p><p>...is a man in a kimono holding a longsword, and Saber&#39;s back.</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop right there, Saber. Someone is trying to steal a glance at your technique.&quot;</p><p>The man in the kimono says with a faint smile.</p><p>He is staring into the forest like I am.</p><hr><p>&quot;If we continue, this match will not be between just us.</p><p>I do not know if the shameless one hiding there is going to attack the winner or if it is only here to watch.</p><p>...But either way, this is less interesting now.&quot;</p><hr><p>The man says so with disinterest and starts to go up the stairs.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Stop...! Are you not going to settle this match, Assassin...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I will settle this match if you come through this gate. I will not allow anyone to step through this gate.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015that is unfortunately my only role.</p><p>I have no intention of stopping you if you are to retreat. Well, that idiot hiding in the trees is a different story. If it is someone I do not take a liking to, I would not let them through on my life nor would I let them retreat alive.&quot;</p><p>The man called Assassin goes up the stairs.</p><hr><p>&quot;You were manipulated, Saber. Well, the same goes for me as I did not notice the presence of this person. I could have shown you my full secret technique if we continued, but we were interrupted at a bad time. It must be fortuitous for you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber is hanging her head in regret.</p><p>...The killing intent fades away.</p><p>Not because of Assassin&#39;s words, but Saber herself must know it is disadvantageous to fight now.</p><hr><p>&quot;See, your pick-up is here as well. That boy must be your Master. Leave before the idiot sneaking a look at us changes its target to him.&quot;</p><p>And Assassin disappears.</p><p>He must have become a spirit, and it must be his demonstration that he will not attack us unless we advance.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber does not say anything.</p><p>She just has her back to me as she quietly stands there.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey, Saber...?&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no answer even when I call out to her.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I think it&#39;s strange, so I start to go up the stairs...</p><hr><p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p>The armor Saber had on suddenly disappears.</p><p>The girl in her defenseless blue clothes sways without turning around.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I stop Saber with my arms as she falls back down the stairs.</p><p>Saber does not move at all. She is unconscious with her eyes closed in pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Haa... haa... haa... haa....&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m finally home.</p><p>It has taken two hours to carry Saber back from Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>There were lots of problems, but we managed to get home safely.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Haa... haa... ah.&quot;</p><p>I lay Saber down in the hallway.</p><p>Saber was really light. She only weighed about forty kilograms, so I wouldn&#39;t normally have been this tired.</p><hr><p>But that&#39;s only if the weight isn&#39;t moving.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know that it was such a hard task to carry a sleeping human\u2015\u2015a girl too.</p><p>The fatigue is great not physically, but mentally.</p><p>It&#39;s because my attention was disrupted by things like her body&#39;s softness and by having her breathing softly right by me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez... why did she have to suddenly lose consciousness?&quot;</p><p>I look at the sleeping Saber.</p><p>...She must not be completely unconscious.</p><p>She looks like she&#39;ll open her eyes if I call out her name, even though she&#39;s sleeping like a corpse.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Damn.</p><p>There were so many things I wanted to say when I left the house, but I can&#39;t say anything when she makes a sleeping face like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well. I&#39;ll bring it up when you wake up, Saber.&quot;</p><p>I murmur.</p><p>And the instant I reach out to carry Saber again-</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, I don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t concern me what your taste is or what you&#39;re doing.&quot;</p><p>For some reason.</p><p>Tohsaka is in the hallway even though it is past two in the morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-T-T-T-T-T-Tohsaka...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why are you looking at me if you&#39;ve seen a ghost? I don&#39;t have any complaints, so you can continue. I only got up to take a drink.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015uh, you&#39;re wrong! Wrong, completely wrong!</p><p>Um, it&#39;s a long story, but I&#39;m only trying to take Saber to her room... do you understand...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, so it seems.&quot;</p><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t lie to me! It sounds like you don&#39;t understand!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying I do. Saber went to fight by herself and you went and stopped her, right?</p><p>And there was some sort of trouble, so Saber came back unconscious. How about that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh... y-yeah. Amazing, you&#39;re perfectly right. But how do you know?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I can tell. There was a likelihood that Saber would go off to battle by herself, and the Master will be informed of that once the battle starts. That&#39;s why this development is within the scope of my deduction.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. That&#39;s fine, but...&quot;</p><p>...Um, so Tohsaka predicted that Saber would go out to fight by herself?</p><hr><p>&quot;So what are you going to do? Aren&#39;t you going to take Saber to her room? If you let her sleep here, I&#39;m sure even a Servant will catch a cold.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So I was about to take her to her room\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I was going to carry her, but...</p><p>...Um.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to do so when she&#39;s watching.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka. Sorry, but can you carry Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me? Well, that&#39;s fine. Then can you prepare some tea? I&#39;m curious to hear what happened.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka picks up Saber.</p><p>...I&#39;m uneasy about her being so understanding, but as long as I&#39;ve asked her to do so, I have to go prepare some tea.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka takes Saber to my room.</p><p>I am preparing tea in the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015By tea, she must not mean Japanese tea. ...This place only has English tea in teabags though.&quot;</p><p>Well, it can&#39;t be helped if we don&#39;t have it.</p><p>I decide she can complain if she wants and I make the tea with a teabag.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, can I talk to you?&quot;</p><p>Oh, Tohsaka&#39;s back.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, hold on a moment. I&#39;ll be there right away.&quot;</p><p>I put the two teacups on a tray and head to the living room.</p><p>\u2015\u2015There.</p><p>Next to Tohsaka is Saber, changed into her normal clothes.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Saber...!? Why? Weren&#39;t you asleep...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She was. But it&#39;s not a long-lasting sleep, and she just woke up.</p><p>It seems she tried to use a large amount of magical energy at once and her body shut off. It&#39;s like an electrical breaker. The kind that forces the power to be turned off before it shorts out, you know?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber is quiet as Tohsaka explains.</p><p>&quot;Y-You\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Seeing her usual attitude, my complaints return.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber, you...! Do you know what you did!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015There is no reason I would not know.</p><p>I proceeded to Ryuudou Temple and battled the Servant Assassin. We noticed the presence of a third Servant during our battle, so we suspended it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! No, I&#39;m not talking about that!</p><p>What I&#39;m asking is why you fought!&quot;</p><p>&quot;That again? It is only natural for a Servant to fight. How about you, Shirou? Why are you, a Master, telling me not to fight?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I unconsciously hesitate to reply.</p><p>...Well, battles are inevitable as long as I&#39;ve decided to fight as a Master.</p><p>I know I&#39;m contradicting myself by telling Saber not to fight.</p><p>But still...</p><p>I can&#39;t let something like that happen again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I would like to ask you instead. It seems that you dislike battles, but do you really expect to survive the Holy Grail War like that?</p><p>It seems that we will only be defeated by other Masters if we follow your policy.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Of course not.</p><p>I will repel dangers that come at me, and I don&#39;t intend to get killed helplessly.</p><p>But completely aside from that, I don&#39;t want Saber fighting.</p><hr><p>&quot;No.</p><p>I don&#39;t hate the fighting. I just, um\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It must be much simpler than that.</p><p>In short, I...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Um, girls can&#39;t get hurt. As a guy, I can&#39;t let that happen. So if I&#39;m going to let you fight, I&#39;m going to fight myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015you are saying you will not let me fight because I am a woman...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you insane!? Servants are beings that protect their Master. It is natural for us to get hurt as we are beings summoned only to fulfill that task...!</p><p>The sex of the Servant is of no concern, and beyond that, you are treating me, a warrior, as a woman!?</p><p>Please take those words back, Shirou...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber comes at me with a glare.</p><p>But I won&#39;t be pushed back by her pressure.</p><p>What is she saying\u2015\u2015that she is a knight before she is a woman?</p><p>Saying such unreasonable things with that small body of hers that even I can carry...!</p><hr><p>&quot;I would never take my words back! It may be true that you&#39;re strong, but you&#39;re still a girl! Don&#39;t get worked up over such an insignificant thing, you idiot!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Are you not the one getting worked up over insignificant things...!? Are you saying you do not want to be protected by a woman!? My body is that of a heroic spirit. Forget about such trivial aspects!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not trivial at all! Geez, it&#39;s not okay for me even if it&#39;s okay for you! It was a mistake from the beginning to have someone fight in my place. I can&#39;t\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t allow someone to get hurt,</p><p>In place of saving me.</p><p>I should be the one doing the saving.</p><p>I have been working hard to become a person who can help others like my father, so\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Damn. Listen, just don&#39;t fight, Saber.</p><p>It&#39;s the guy&#39;s role to fight, so I&#39;ll be doing the fighting. You shouldn&#39;t have any complaints about that, because I&#39;m saying we&#39;ll fight as you wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015you are absurd...! Do you think a human can match a Servant!? You should already know you are no match for the Servants!</p><p>Please recall what happened when you were attacked by Lancer.</p><p>You would have certainly been killed if I had not appeared. It will be the same against any Servant!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You won&#39;t know unless we try! I was just unprepared that time. Now, we can prepare as much as possible, so I might at least be able to sneak an attack on them!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ridiculous. A shield prepared by you would be no better than paper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whoa, that&#39;s a horrible thing to say, Saber!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You are the one insulting the Servants. You are conceited, thinking that you can defeat a heroic spirit as a mere human.&quot;</p><p>&quot;!!!!&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber and I glare at each other.</p><p>It&#39;s no use. It looks this conversation is going nowhere with no compromise in sight.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong, Saber. Shirou isn&#39;t insulting the Servants. I&#39;m interrupting because the conversation won&#39;t go anywhere if you misunderstand that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rin...? What do you mean by that...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, in short, he just doesn&#39;t want to get you hurt. I don&#39;t know why, but Shirou is full of devotion to others.</p><p>Right? Saber is more important to you than you are, right?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...T-That&#39;s not true...! I didn&#39;t say Saber was important to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a lie. You couldn&#39;t say you&#39;d fight yourself unless you thought so.</p><p>Because you already know you can&#39;t beat a Servant yourself, right? But saying you&#39;ll fight in spite of that means that Saber is more important than you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Ah... um?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s like that if she says so, but\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why you fight even though it&#39;s absurd to do so. You try to win even when you realize you have no chance of winning. You don&#39;t care if you die in the process.</p><p>Because for you, though I don&#39;t know why, other people are more important than yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015No.</p><p>I didn&#39;t mean that at all...</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why. You should understand, Saber. He&#39;s an idiot who will protect you against that Berserker. That&#39;s why he&#39;s saying seriously that he&#39;ll fight.&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know how much of Tohsaka&#39;s explanation Saber understood.</p><p>But Saber takes a deep breath and looks at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will approve of you fighting. But if that is the case, I have something else in mind as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015S-So, what?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sword training. I will teach you as much swordsmanship as is possible in the time allowed. If you will accept that, I will accept your opinion as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Does that mean she will train me in swordsmanship...?</p><p>Um, because she allows me to fight from now on...?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. That&#39;s excess weight on your mind, Saber.</p><p>Teaching Shirou swordsmanship? Cut it out. There&#39;s no way you can match a Servant with something like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is true. But it would be better than not knowing.</p><p>It should at least reduce hesitation in battle.</p><p>I can only gamble on Shirou&#39;s determination after that, but that is how real battles are anyway. There is nothing one can obtain if they are not fit for it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm... well, you&#39;re right when you put it like that.</p><p>Readiness to fight won&#39;t come unless you do so at least once.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, so once... no, not once, but as many times as time allows, I would like for Shirou to experience &#39;death in battle&#39; and become familiar with fighting.&quot;</p><p>The two talk dangerously.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. I didn&#39;t say I would\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll teach him about magecraft.</p><p>If Saber&#39;s going to train his body, I&#39;ll train his knowledge. ...Well, that was the initial promise anyway, so I guess I&#39;ll start proper training for him tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Please. If you do that, I can concentrate on the sword myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. Then since we&#39;re decided, let&#39;s break up for tonight. It looks like we&#39;re going to be busy tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka waves goodbye and disappears into the outbuilding.</p><hr><p>&quot;I will be resting as well. You should rest also, Shirou. I will have you train in the dojo tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>She gives a small bow and goes back to her room.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>In the living room are the untouched teas and myself standing there dumbfounded.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So I never said I would...&quot;</p><p>The words I murmur are ignored.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Well.</p><p>The already confusing situation looks like it will get even stranger.</p><p>I can&#39;t even guess what will happen tomorrow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll sleep. I have to save my energy at the least.&quot;</p><p>Everything starts from my body.</p><p>...Well, um.</p><p>You could say that I can only rely on the hope that if my body is well-prepared, I can overcome any hardships.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12-morning-at-the-emiya-household-festival" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12-morning-at-the-emiya-household-festival" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12 - Morning at the Emiya household: Festival</h2><p>The next day.</p><p>After a normal morning, I enter the living room to find a complicated breakfast table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, Sakura. I can&#39;t eat butter. Pass me that marmalade over there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Tohsaka-Senpai, you seemed like you didn&#39;t like sweet things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nonsense, no such girl exists. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like sugar, but I can&#39;t take it. If I let my guard down, I grow where you can&#39;t see, so I can only eat sweets once a week.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? But you&#39;re still eating marmalade, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I eat sugar in the mornings. I have to eat at least a bit, or the backlash later on could get scary.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Even if you eat only twice a day, it will get worse if you eat twice as much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. ...Hey, I wasn&#39;t going to say anything, but you eat a lot, Saber. You have a small frame, but you&#39;re eating as much as Sakura.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that so? I think I am average. I believe the bread Sakura is eating is much more substantial than mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not true...! You, Tohsaka-Senpai, and I all have two slices of toast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the thickness is different. Ours are one centimeter thick while yours are two, so you are eating a lot. You are in your growing period, so it is good to get energy. How about eating not just one but actually finishing your share, Rin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you I can&#39;t. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m Sakura and all the nutrients go to my chest. If I eat a lot in the morning, it&#39;ll increase. I usually don&#39;t eat breakfast, so I&#39;m compromising already.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Tohsaka-Senpai, um, please don&#39;t talk about that in front of Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. You say &#39;it&#39; will increase, but why do you avoid using specific terms, Rin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s about those things you can&#39;t see. Oh well, you can see Sakura&#39;s, so you can leave her out of this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;S-So please don&#39;t talk about it!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I take a bite of the well-done toast.</p><p>Perhaps my brain just doesn&#39;t follow what&#39;s going in front of me, but I&#39;m eating toast and not joining the conversation.</p><p>...Well, the truth is that there&#39;s no room for me to cut into the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I guess I didn&#39;t need to worry.&quot;</p><p>They seem to have a good relationship for now.</p><p>Tohsaka is the same as always, and Saber is more open than she was last night.</p><p>Sakura is... well, she still seems to be a bit resistant to Saber, but it doesn&#39;t look like she dislikes her.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m worried that Fuji-Nee isn&#39;t here, but she should be here tonight......&quot;</p><p>The shock last night must have been a big one.</p><p>Well, she will probably come and eat dinner, so I&#39;d think she&#39;ll have calmed down by then.</p><hr><p>Breakfast ends, and I start cleaning up.</p><p>&quot;Senpai, is it really okay leaving all the cleaning up to you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll do it. You have a club to go to.</p><p>There was that incident yesterday, so you should go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. Then I&#39;ll go on ahead, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura bows also to Tohsaka and leaves the living room in a hurry.</p><p>That leaves the three of us.</p><p>Which means, once Sakura leaves, the three of us who know the secret remain.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I shall excuse myself as well. Please call for me if you need anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;See ya, Saber. I&#39;ll look after Shirou, so please take care of this place while we&#39;re gone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Please take care of Shirou, Rin.&quot;</p><p>Bowing lightly to Tohsaka, Saber returns to her room.</p><hr><p>...Well, there&#39;s nothing to do here.</p><p>So she must want to save her energy by sleeping, but......</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. Does she only think about fighting?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. You should start to show some willingness or Saber will lose patience with you.</p><p>Even though her wound isn&#39;t healed yet, she&#39;s not one to stay quiet forever, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>A clicking sound.</p><p>As she makes a scary comment, Tohsaka turns on the TV.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm? This news again.&quot;</p><p>The morning news streams from the TV.</p><p>I listen to it while washing the dishes in the kitchen.</p><p>...Well.</p><p>The content is the same as the news I heard a while ago.</p><hr><p>&quot;They&#39;re saying there was another gas leak incident over in the Shinto area.</p><p>...That&#39;s stupid. That kind of thing is happening here too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>Did Tohsaka say something really worrying?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, what do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s that the people are weakening with no obvious cause, right? People that have lost consciousness without an obvious cause, carried off to the hospital in a coma.</p><p>There must be a lot of them by now. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a danger in the victims&#39; lives right now, but what happens in the future will depend on what the instigator decides.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p><p>Not only in the neighboring town, but over here too?</p><p>Comas with no cause?</p><p>Numerous victims?</p><p>No, the problem is\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, are you saying it&#39;s the work of another Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who else could it be? Please get used to it. You are a Master too, you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s\u2015\u2015true. ...But, why didn&#39;t you tell me before, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This incident isn&#39;t as simple.</p><p>The Master that put up the boundary field at school is third class, but this Master is first class. He isn&#39;t killing anyone. He&#39;s just storing power by absorbing half of their lives.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, it is true that the speed is slower, it doesn&#39;t break the rules of magi. And there&#39;s also no need to push oneself. This Master is stealing the simplest form of magical energy, &#39;life force&#39;, out of people in the city from a place far away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;A place far away... can this person collect magical energy from such a distance?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It must be a really skilled magus.</p><p>Both Shinto and Miyama City. Only great magi can create an &#39;absorption&#39; that can cover two towns.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Or maybe the Master has secured a superior spiritual ground. My father was saying something about a ley line in Fuyuki City, so if one took up a position there, it would be easy to collect life force...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Hey, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There weren&#39;t any references to it in Father&#39;s study, so if there is one, it&#39;ll be in the master&#39;s room... Oh man, that place is so weird even now, so I&#39;d like to stay away from it if I can.</p><p>...But then, all I can do is ask Kirei... no, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t be in debt to him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka, hey\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no answer.</p><p>...It&#39;s no good. Tohsaka is immersed in talking to herself.</p><hr><p>I reach the school gate with Tohsaka halfheartedly.</p><p>The front gate has students arriving at school, and the school is starting another normal day.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But still, there is an odd feel to it.</p><p>I went through the front gate without noticing it yesterday, but I can certainly sense it if I look for it.</p><p>...How can I put this... it&#39;s so calm that even my instincts go numb.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. The air is different from outside. It&#39;s like sweet honey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s the way you feel it, huh? ...You&#39;re unskilled at detecting magical energy, but you might be sensitive to disorders in the world.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka ponders.</p><hr><p>&quot;But sweet honey, huh? Speaking figuratively, like an insectivorous plant?</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s a good way of putting it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...An insectivorous plant... that image is really bad.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? I don&#39;t think your instinct is off. Because in this school, everyone will be eaten alive when the lid of the boundary field closes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She sees through the aspect I didn&#39;t say, and I gasp.</p><p>&quot;As I thought. You&#39;re fun because you&#39;re easy to understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whatever. It&#39;s not fun for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t get mad. Don&#39;t worry because I know what you want to say. You&#39;re thinking you don&#39;t want to involve the students here, and I don&#39;t want to use this place as a battlefield. So there&#39;s only one thing to do, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>These are words to test me.</p><p>Tohsaka is telling me...</p><p>The Holy Grail War\u2015\u2015\u2015the &quot;enemy&quot; I said I will fight against, the Master who is willing to drag in innocent people in order to win, is at this school.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. We have to find the Master who constructed this boundary field and do something about it. And if he isn&#39;t willing to remove the boundary field, we&#39;ll just beat him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;m glad you understand.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well then, I&#39;ll look for whoever constructed the boundary field, so you go and check suspicious areas.</p><p>I already looked around, but there might have been something I missed. You seem to be good at finding these points, so I&#39;ll let you do it.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka waves her hand and runs into the school building.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey\u2015\u2015\u2015Even if you say that, I have no idea...! What kind of places are suspicious ones, Tohsaka!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To put it in your words, somewhere where the air is sweet!</p><p>Just look for a place where the honey is really sweet!&quot;</p><p>She yells back, running.</p><hr><p>And Tohsaka disappears into the school building.</p><p>&quot;...What is she? Running away suddenly like that, I don&#39;t get what she&#39;s thinkin\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>The bell for homeroom rings.</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I see\u2015\u2015\u2015hey, why didn&#39;t she tell me that if she knew...!?&quot;</p><p>I hold my bag and run full speed.</p><p>After that incident yesterday, who knows what Fuji-Nee will say if I&#39;m late.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13-everyone-getting-along" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13-everyone-getting-along" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13 - Everyone getting along</h2><p>I descend the hill and return to the intersection.</p><p>If I head up to the residential district on the other side, I will be heading home, but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...There&#39;s a Master at Ryuudou Temple, huh?&quot;</p><p>An hour&#39;s walk to the mountain.</p><p>Taking the mountainside road, one can reach the mountain gate that leads to the Ryuudou Temple.</p><hr><p>The Ryuudou Temple is a large temple up on the mountain, as big as our school.</p><p>Its cemetery is large, but more than that, it&#39;s a small world made up of fifty practicing monks.</p><p>The people of the town are helped by the people of Ryuudou Temple, but they also honor it as a sacred place that is not to be visited lightly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come to think of it, I haven&#39;t been to Ryuudou Temple recently.&quot;</p><p>Ever since I went there last summer to stay there as mental training.</p><p>The temple&#39;s life gets really hard during the winter, so I was thinking about returning there during the winter\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? What is someone who boycotted afternoon classes doing here?&quot;</p><p>Speaking of the devil, or whatever...</p><p>I run into Ryuudou Temple&#39;s successor, Ryuudou Issei.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yo. Is school over already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it&#39;s over. I&#39;m heading home since I don&#39;t have anything to do for the student council, but is something wrong? You seemed to be staring at the mountain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, there wasn&#39;t anything wrong. I just felt like going home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heh. The teachers would be out of business if people skipped class just because they feel like it. \u2015\u2015\u2015So, I&#39;m asking why you were looking at the mountain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well. Issei, it&#39;s a small thing, but has there been anything strange going on recently?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well. Change is common, but nothing has drastically changed. The mountain is always peaceful, and peace makes up ordinary days.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry Issei, I&#39;m being serious here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;H-How rude! I&#39;m serious too!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It looks like it. Then it&#39;s good, I guess it was just overanxiety.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine, if you understand. I wouldn&#39;t joke with you.&quot;</p><p>With a cough, Issei calms down.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But, hmm... There has been a change, but I wonder...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? A change? In the temple...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Not the mountain, but the air at our temple is restless. She&#39;s apparently an acquaintance of my father, but we&#39;ve taken in a bothersome guest. It&#39;s a problem because she is beautiful.</p><p>Geez, why is everyone making so much commotion over one woman?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Woman\u2015\u2015\u2015does Ryuudou Temple have nuns?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. This is a special circumstance, and we&#39;re letting her use a room until the wedding celebration\u2015\u2015\u2015no, but this person is so beautiful that it even captivates me when she&#39;s getting water from the well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean &#39;a special circumstance&#39;... hey Issei? Hey, are you listening to me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm, sorry. That is why women are bad.</p><p>Reject lust, be calm Issei.&quot;</p><p>The student council president starts to recite Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>...Geez, he&#39;s so serious, so he&#39;s hard to deal with when he gets like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heeeey, are you all right Issei?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No problem. My training is insufficient, so I wish to purify myself more.&quot;</p><hr><p>I guess he still didn&#39;t hear me as he disappears into the back of the town.</p><hr><p>The sun is already setting by the time I reach my house.</p><p>I&#39;m home first just like yesterday.</p><p>Sakura and Fuji-Nee will be here soon, and Tohsaka should be back too.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ll talk to her about what I heard from Shinji after Sakura and Fuji-Nee go home...&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no point in talking about it when those two are here.</p><p>That decided, I have to go and prepare dinner.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka got me yesterday, and I have to try to put Fuji-Nee in a better mood.</p><p>Cooking takes time and effort before love.</p><p>If I am to go for a sure win, I will have to spend twice as much time.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>After all that, what happened is...</p><hr><p>&quot;Huumph! What, I didn&#39;t lose! Stupid Tohsaka-san! Bully!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m talking about the taste of the food. Um, it&#39;s the best dinner so far according to Fujimura-Sensei, so I&#39;m saying we should share it among everyone.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;... Hmmm... I think she&#39;s saying something else.</p><p>Tohsaka-san said she didn&#39;t want to eat the food Shirou cooked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s only in the mornings. I eat dinner like normal and we take turns cooking dinner, so it is my right to eat.</p><p>If you don&#39;t like that, please take my place tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ugh\u2015\u2015\u2015that personality that strikes precisely at my weak point. Man, I didn&#39;t think you were such a terrible student.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee reluctantly returns the pot to the table.</p><p>And so, the specially prepared rice returns to the table safely.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on, Fuji-Nee, I cooked a lot so you don&#39;t need to hurry. I made enough for everyone.&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s right... but Senpai, isn&#39;t this a bit too much?&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Two casks for four people is obviously too much.&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not a cask, it&#39;s a pot. And it&#39;s fine. The rice is today&#39;s main dish, so there can be lots of it. If there&#39;s any left over, I&#39;ll make some riceballs and it&#39;ll be lunch for tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, can I have some too? I usually don&#39;t like fried rice, but this is exceptional. There are lots of things in it. What exactly did you use?&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s basically rice mixed with mushrooms, right? There are lots of details, like the way it&#39;s using citrus instead of fried things for its aroma.&quot;</p><p>Munch, munch.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine! I&#39;ll eat it all myself then! You watch!&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee must have given up taking the pot for herself, as she starts to eat really fast.</p><p>She empties her bowl quickly and asks for more in no time.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine, but it won&#39;t run out even if you take it slow, Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s fine! I&#39;m going to eat Shirou&#39;s food, so I won&#39;t give it to some stranger!&quot;</p><p>She snatches away the bowl.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t get it.</p><p>Sakura is smiling awkwardly, Tohsaka is ignoring Fuji-Nee, and Saber is eating her food.</p><p>...I put in a lot of effort to make this, but it might have had the opposite of the desired effect.</p><p>The dinner that was supposed to have Tohsaka admit defeat ends loudly because of Fuji-Nee&#39;s strange actions.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then, see you Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Fuji-Nee, please take Sakura home safely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p><p>Stepping lightly, Fuji-Nee holds Sakura&#39;s hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? Shirou, you look like you&#39;re wondering about something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I&#39;m wondering. Usually, people can&#39;t move after eating that much.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? It was tough, but it&#39;s fine once you swallow it.&quot;</p><p>So you should realize the problem is that there&#39;s no limit to that, Tiger.</p><p>Just as one would expect from a wild tiger. If possible, I don&#39;t want it accidentally trespassing into human society.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then see you tomorrow. Don&#39;t stay up late, you two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, good night Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, night Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="scene-14-demonic-sword-vs-assassin-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-14-demonic-sword-vs-assassin-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 14 - &quot;Demonic Sword&quot;-VS Assassin 2</h2><p>The points of the swords cross.</p><p>The swords are swung many times.</p><p>Numerous blows.</p><p>The sword and the katana repel each other, scattering sparks.</p><p>\u2015\u2015The session of more than a few dozen blows does not change the positions of the two.</p><p>Assassin, positioned above, does not retreat even a step,</p><p>and Saber, trying to ascend the stairs, is unable to draw nearer and uselessly wastes time and spirit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber rushes in again.</p><p>Assassin swings his longsword without difficulty and defends completely against Saber&#39;s charge.</p><hr><p>No, it isn&#39;t as simple as defending.</p><p>If Saber&#39;s sword is lightning, Assassin&#39;s sword is a hurricane.</p><p>Even though it does not match Saber in speed or power, its elastic tracks parry Saber&#39;s every blow.</p><p>And the counter increases speed and flows toward Saber&#39;s neck like a strong wind.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015When Saber steps in again after avoiding that attack, the sword she has avoided comes at her again in no time.</p><p>In contrast to the straight path Saber&#39;s sword takes, Assassin&#39;s sword takes a curved path.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s blade is graceful, but since it moves in an arc, it does not take the shortest route.</p><p>So he shouldn&#39;t be able to make it in time against Saber&#39;s sword moving in a straight line, but there is something about Assassin that reduces that difference to zero.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>The charge stops.</p><p>Her sword won&#39;t make it in time against his sword&#39;s counter-attack.</p><p>She steps back, knowing the only way she can avoid it is to retreat.</p><hr><p>Assassin&#39;s swordplay is fascinatingly beautiful. But at the same time, it is so fast that it is hard to follow.</p><p>Is that contradiction because of Assassin&#39;s skill or the unfavorable position of attacking someone on higher ground?</p><p>Without a definite answer, she avoids the sword pursuing her and parries the point trying to pierce her neck.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>When she notices, she has retreated a few more steps.</p><p>It&#39;s such a long sword.</p><p>It should be easy to go inside on him once she has parried it away once, but she somehow cannot manage to do so.</p><hr><p>The enemy&#39;s excellent skill and the definitely disadvantageous ground.</p><p>Saber bites her lips, thinking she would not have this much trouble with that longsword on flat ground.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015It is indeed hard to fight against. I did not imagine an invisible sword would be this troublesome.&quot;</p><p>Assassin does not move.</p><p>For him, this is only a battle of defense.</p><p>He has no need to chase the retreating Saber without reason nor forsake his advantage of higher ground.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm. I believe this is the first time you&#39;ve even seen a katana, is it not?</p><p>My sword is a heresy, and it will slice the head of one of average skill. I am happy you have blocked this much, Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;And on top of that, your drive is marvelous. You are able to do so much with that small body of yours. Your body must indeed be well-trained.&quot;</p><p>As he has no need to keep attacking, Assassin observes Saber calmly.</p><hr><p>His sword wavers, losing strength.</p><p>She cannot charge as if that is an opening.</p><p>There are no stances for that man.</p><p>He can only use that long a sword if he can swing it from any position.</p><hr><p>&quot;What? It cannot be that this is the end. That invisible sword is not just mere show, is it not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hah, quit your impudent talk\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>The sword and the katana crash.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right, I am correct...!&quot;</p><p>The longsword stops in empty space.</p><p>Assassin smiles and looks at his sword blocking the invisible sword, parries her sword, and\u2015\u2015</p><p>Saber defends herself from the blow to her neck.</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>Even Saber knows.</p><p>That it is because of her invisible sword that she is able to block Assassin&#39;s unfamiliar techniques.</p><p>The invisible sword confuses the opponent&#39;s senses in both offense and defense.</p><hr><p>That is why Assassin does not follow through too much.</p><p>As he does not know how long Saber&#39;s sword is, it is too dangerous for Assassin to close in on Saber.</p><p>If Assassin ever goes to attack Saber, that will be when\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah...!&quot;</p><p>Saber tries to smash Assassin&#39;s head.</p><p>That blow....</p><p>...Is perfectly dodged by Assassin, who merely retreats a bit.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right, I see it now. The blade is roughly three Shaku (ninety centimeters) long and four sun (twelve centimeters) wide. The shape is... hmmm... like your name, Saber, it is a typical western sword.&quot;</p><p>He talks calmly but it does not even need to be said how good his judgment is.</p><p>Saber&#39;s blows are too fast to perceive even if the sword can be seen.</p><p>But not only does he defend against the invisible sword, but he has figured out its shape\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;I cannot believe it. You have measured my sword without using any magecraft nor exchanging blows with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, are you surprised? But this is just a street performance. As I am an unorthodox sword-user, I only improve on such techniques.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I see. It was your way of fighting not to meet any of my blows, but parry them. I see the term unorthodox comes from how much of a coward you are.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ha\u2015\u2015No, no. Forgive my rudeness in not locking blades with you.</p><p>I have this longsword. It will break if I fight off your sword. It must be your style to compete in power, but I cannot do so. I cannot lock blades with you and compete strength with you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Katana is always such a sword.</p><p>Western swords cut with their weight and power.</p><p>But our blades cut with speed and technique.</p><p>It is no wonder our fighting styles are mismatched, is it not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But well... this is somewhat unentertaining.</p><p>Now is a good time, Saber. Stop hiding your true powers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Assassin, are you saying I am going easy on you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you saying you are not? I do not know your intentions, but you are taking me lightly fighting with your sheath on. Are you telling me that I am not worthy to fight seriously?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm. It still seems as if you will not comply with my request.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Fine, then this is it. If you are unwilling to do so, I will show you my secret technique first.&quot;</p><p>Saying so...</p><p>The swordsman with the longsword comes down next to Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>To relinquish his advantage of being overhead is the same as losing for Assassin.</p><p>Assassin is certainly a skilled swordsman, but that is only with the conditions of these geographical features.</p><hr><p>If they are to fight on the same level, it is possible for Saber to repel Assassin&#39;s attack and slash his neck.</p><p>But Assassin would know this as well.</p><p>So why\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;Be ready. Or you will die, Saber.&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s instincts react to that voice.</p><p>\u2015\u2015He&#39;s telling the truth.</p><p>It is not advantageous at all for Saber that Assassin has come down.</p><p>The instincts that have got her through numerous battles warn her of her misunderstanding.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She readies her sword at once.</p><p>There is no time to hesitate.</p><p>She only has to attack with her sword before Assassin swings his longsword\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s about three meters of distance between them.</p><p>With Saber trying to charge in, Assassin stands ready.</p><p>That...</p><p>...Is a stance that the swordsman has not yet shown in this battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Secret technique\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber charges in.</p><p>The longsword is useless now.</p><p>As long as she&#39;s inside its range, its length will backfire.</p><p>But.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tsubame-Gaeshi&quot;</p><p>Such logic does not exist with this swordsman.</p><p>The lightning strikes.</p><p>An evil strike that attacks with speed overwhelming Saber\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>But it is not as if Saber cannot block such an attack.</p><p>She moves her attacking sword into defense, and she repels Assassin&#39;s full-power attack...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Got it...!&quot;</p><p>Even Assassin will have an opening if that attack is repelled.</p><p>In the small instant where she tries to slice Assassin&#39;s stomach...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Ah&quot;</p><p>In that instant, Saber trusts her instincts and rolls down the stone steps.</p><hr><p>She rolls down as if fleeing.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even soften her landing.</p><p>Saber spins her body frantically and rolls down the stairs without killing her speed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber stops rolling and stands back up.</p><p>She stares at the swordsman standing calmly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. You have dodged my secret technique. As expected of Saber, you are unlike the swallow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I do not believe it. That cannot be...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it is nothing much. It is just something I thought of when considering how to hit swallows.&quot;</p><p>He raises his longsword a little.</p><p>As if\u2015\u2015to trace the movement of the technique that inspired fear in Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Can you see it, Saber?</p><p>Swallows avoid the sword by feeling the wind. It does not matter how fast your sword is. You cannot swing a sword without shaking the air, correct? The swallows feel this shaking and change their direction of flight.</p><p>So no one could kill the swallows with one blow, no matter what kind of blow it was. A sword is only a straight line after all. It is only natural for it to be unable to apprehend the swallow, which can move vertically and horizontally.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Thus you only have to surround its escape route.</p><p>Use one blow to attack the swallow and use your second blow to catch the escaping swallow as it reads the wind.</p><p>But they are fast. The second blow cannot come in time with this longsword. If I wanted to get the swallows, I would have to do both attacks at about the same time. But such a thing is beyond human abilities.</p><p>I accepted such a thing was impossible, but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Unfortunately, I had nothing else to do.</p><p>They say determination is key to success, but when I noticed, it was like this.</p><p>A worthless idea to kill a swallow became a secret technique that creates a prison with many slashes.&quot;</p><hr><p>In her mind, Saber disagrees with Assassin&#39;s words.</p><p>It&#39;s wrong.</p><p>That technique is not as simple as that.</p><p>About the same time? No.</p><p>The two blows came at exactly the same time.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s\u2015\u2015Sasaki Kojirou&#39;s longsword doubled its existence for just that instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Multi-dimensional refraction phenomenon... Kishua Zelretch... A Servant that has reached the level of a Noble Phantasm with mere skill\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That fact is what should be admired.</p><p>That one blow made it clear.</p><p>Sasaki Kojirou does not have a Noble Phantasm like heroic spirits have.</p><p>He has only his demonic technique, made possible by his god-like skill.</p><p>It is impossible\u2015\u2015but this mere human is equal to heroic spirits armed with Noble Phantasms\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;But the foothold was bad. The Tsubame-Gaeshi originally has three slashes. If this place were a bit wider, I could have added the vertical slash as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I would assume so. It would not be effective without that.</p><p>If everything is to happen at the same time, the second blow has to be slower. To compensate for that, there should be a third vertical attack, to prevent the opponent from dodging sideways.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You catch on quickly. That must be why you were able to avoid my secret technique.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Hah, you are wonderful, Saber.</p><p>I have cursed myself for being summoned in this world, but that will end tonight. If I am able to battle someone I can fully use my secret attacks on, it is well worth being summoned\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Assassin readies his sword once again and comes down the stairs.</p><p>He must be after Saber&#39;s neck.</p><p>Saber is not confident if she will be able to avoid that secret technique again.</p><p>Like Lancer&#39;s Gae Bolg, Assassin&#39;s Tsubame-Gaeshi is something that cannot be allowed to begin.</p><hr><p>No, unlike Gae Bolg, that allows you to find a countermeasure once you find out it will go for the heart, there are no possible counters for Assassin&#39;s secret technique even when you know about it.</p><p>If there is a countermeasure, it is only not to let him use it.</p><p>To beat it, she must attack him with her strongest blow before Assassin uses that technique\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Certainly, you are not someone I can go easy on.&quot;</p><p>She lowers her arms.</p><p>She lowers her sword as if to stick it into the ground. She glares at Assassin, who is approaching her.</p><p>&quot;Hm...? So you are finally ready to do so?&quot;</p><hr><p>Assassin stops descending the steps and readies himself for a certain kill.</p><p>Saber looks at him bravely.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I too have no complaints.</p><p>Will you be able to take my attack, Servant Assassin...!?&quot;</p><p>Saber releases her own restraints.</p><hr><p>The air shakes.</p><p>As if acting in response to her will, the sword erupts with a massive amount of wind.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Assassin retreats a bit.</p><p>It is only natural as the wind pressure released from Saber is extraordinary.</p><p>Not only Assassin, but even the large firm trees of the forest are shaking and creaking.</p><hr><p>It is a flow of wind like an explosion.</p><p>The trapped air is released and explodes outward.</p><p>This raging wind that would easily blow away a normal person is coming out from Saber&#39;s sword.</p><hr><p>That is the power of her sword.</p><p>&quot;Invisible Air&quot; is a sword that has wind sealed in it.</p><p>The sword that covers itself in compressed wind changes the refraction of light to make it look invisible.</p><p>So this phenomenon occurs once the wind is released.</p><p>The released wind seeks escape and emits itself chaotically into the surroundings.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015In that instant.</p><p>It is the commanding magecraft of the sword that allows her to freely manipulate the raging wind.</p><p>With Saber possessing incredible amounts of magical energy, she should be able to hold this boundary field for a few minutes.</p><p>As proof, her sword is still invisible even though she has already released this much wind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. It is like a typhoon, but\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The power of the raging wind does not abate.</p><p>The wind emitting from Saber&#39;s sword is about to engulf Assassin.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015It cannot be just this. I will find out what is behind all this, Saber...!&quot;</p><p>Assassin closes in against the blinding raging wind.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s arms move.</p><p>To attack Assassin who is calmly advancing in the strong wind that allows no approach, the sword clad in wind roars and\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-15-tiger-dojo-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-15-tiger-dojo-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 15 - Tiger Dojo 3</h2><p>You thoughtless Shirou!</p><p>Thoughtless Shirou!!</p><p>What are you doing when her wound hasn&#39;t even healed yet?</p><p>You just became a Master, so you should train yourself a bit more!</p><p>That&#39;s right. It can&#39;t be helped if you&#39;re killed by me, but being killed by that fox isn&#39;t cool. Hurry back to the previous choice and stay home tonight.</p><p>That&#39;s right. Make sure to properly consider your actions next time.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well. Tiger Dojo, the support for all those who reach dead ends because of mistakes, is entering its third session already.</p><p>I think you people are getting used to this dojo, but...</p><p>But? What is it, Taiga? Are you hinting at something? Is there something you want to say?</p><p>...Yes. Actually, I think everyone&#39;s starting to wonder by now as well.</p><p>Wonder?</p><p>Well, then I&#39;ll say it but\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Isn&#39;t that buruma too direct!!!!!!?</p><p>Huh? But this is a dojo, right? I&#39;m in my gym uniform because we&#39;re going to be working out.</p><p>...I see. So that&#39;s the reason, huh? That&#39;s certainly logical. I thought it was a scheme of a mischievous girl trying to steal away the few spotlights I have.</p><p>You&#39;re thinking too much, Taiga. After all, we&#39;re on a completely different level. I don&#39;t even need to change into my best clothes.</p><p>You&#39;re right! We&#39;re treated differently, so there&#39;s isn&#39;t even a need to compete.</p><p>Thank God. We&#39;re best friends forever.</p><p>The gym uniform is a sign of vitality, so I&#39;ll allow Illya-chan to keep wearing it!</p><p>Of course. Well, you can thank me for not being in a maid costume or a school swimsuit. Actually, I was supposed to appear in a different costume every time.</p><p>Wow. An obvious difference in our treatment.</p><p>Heh, I&#39;m not vexed. The idea was discarded after all, so you&#39;re treated the same way as I am.</p><p>...But I&#39;m a bit curious.</p><p>What kind of costumes were you planning to wear?</p><p>Um, things like male school uniform, kamakura style, my adult version, snowman, apron, kimono, G*rman army officer&#39;s uniform...</p><p>There were forty different costumes!</p><p>Guaaaaa! That&#39;s enough! Such blessed love is too hateful!</p><p>But it&#39;s a bit disappointing since I wanted to see the officer uniform.</p><p>Yeah. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to take back a decision they&#39;ve already made, even though they&#39;re adults.</p><p>You&#39;re right! What are the commanders thinking to take away my route!? Do they really want to win!?</p><p>You had no route from the start.</p><p>What!? Stay there, you disgrace!</p><p>Kyaaaaa, heeeeelp meeeee.</p><p>Oh, hi, Senpai.</p><p>Stay relaxed.</p><p>She&#39;s gone... Taiga&#39;s unconscious, so maybe I should head back too.</p><p>Give you the stamp and... all right, let&#39;s meet again after the next dead end!</p>', 2078);
