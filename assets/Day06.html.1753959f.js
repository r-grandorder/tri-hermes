Hm? What&#39;s with that surprised face?</p><p>Did something happen?&quot;</p><p>She must&#39;ve been mixing flour, as she puts a bowl she&#39;s been mixing onto the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah\u2015\u2015\u2015I am surprised.</p><p>Um, everything&#39;s so different.&quot;</p><p>Actually, I don&#39;t remember how many years it&#39;s been since I last saw her doing something like cooking.</p><hr><p>&quot;Different...? Oh, you must mean Sakura-chan.</p><p>She went home. Someone from her house called her and she had to go home.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So Shinji must&#39;ve called here.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s needless help, but I guess he wanted to take care of it as quickly as possible.</p><p>&quot;Shinji-kun? Hm, oh well.&quot;</p><p>After tilting her head in question, Fuji-Nee goes back to the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m a bit curious.</p><p>It&#39;s not completely dark yet, so I\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I have to find out what Fuji-Nee&#39;s up to.</p><p>For the peace of our dinner, and for Saber, who&#39;s secretly looking forward to it!</p><hr><p>&quot;Excuse me... Oh, okonomiyaki? Are you hungry?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong. Sakura-chan left me in charge, so I&#39;ll be cooking tonight. I&#39;ll cook for all three of us, so can you go wake Saber-chan up?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Wow, I&#39;m surprised.</p><p>I don&#39;t know about her choice of food, but Fuji-Nee&#39;s acting like a woman, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. You should be able to cook if you&#39;re that old. Huh...? Why are you cooking rice, Fuji-Nee? You don&#39;t need rice with okonomiyaki.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We do. I&#39;m making kani-tama, so it&#39;ll just be an omelet if we don&#39;t have rice.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee cracks open an egg as she says so.</p><p>The egg drops into the flour she&#39;s been mixing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m surprised.</p><p>It seems kani-tama and okonomiyaki are the same in Fuji-Nee&#39;s head.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Fuji-Nee. I know you&#39;ll realize your mistake in a few minutes, but I&#39;ll come out and tell you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh... W-What? All right, tell me.&quot;</p><p>She must think something&#39;s wrong as well.</p><p>She looks at me with respect.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. That&#39;s not kani-tama. It&#39;ll be a horrifying dish where you&#39;ll be putting okonomiyaki on top of rice. So let&#39;s remake this.&quot;</p><p>I clearly tell her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm... Isn&#39;t it the same putting omelet or okonomiyaki on rice, kitchen chief?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. First of all, I&#39;m not a kitchen chief. We&#39;ll give Saber a wrong impression of Japanese food, so let&#39;s remake this.&quot;</p><p>I take the bowl away from Fuji-Nee.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015n-no! I mixed it, so we can&#39;t waste it!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;ll make some snacks with this later, so this is going into the fridge.</p><p>You go crack about five eggs and mix them thoroughly. Oh, the crab and the bamboo shoots are ready? Then I&#39;ll make the sauce. I&#39;ll let you cook it.</p><p>It&#39;s all right. If I preheat the pan, even you can do it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Well.</p><p>Now that it&#39;s decided, I&#39;ll need potato starch, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What? I told you to do the eggs. Don&#39;t mix them too fast, okay? Use a chopstick and use the whole bowl to mix them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s listening or not, as she&#39;s just looking at me like she wants to say something.</p><p>Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ehehe. You have dignity in the kitchen.&quot;</p><p>Saying so, she opens the refrigerator.</p><p>&quot;Hm...&quot;</p><p>Well, I&#39;m glad to hear that, but is it a good thing that it&#39;s only in the kitchen?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02</h2><p>...Yeah.</p><p>I&#39;ll go check on Sakura before the sun sets.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to take a walk. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with you, but I&#39;ll leave dinner up to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, take care. Dinner&#39;s going to be a delicious kani-tama.&quot;</p><p>Kani-tama, huh?</p><p>I guess even Fuji-Nee should be able to make that.</p><hr><p>I go up the hill tinted by the sun.</p><p>Sunset is early during winter.</p><p>I have to go to Sakura&#39;s house quickly and check up on her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Senpai? Why are you here at this time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015well, I was just close by, so I thought I&#39;d drop in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#39;Just close by&#39;, huh? All right, I&#39;ll say that&#39;s the case.&quot;</p><hr><p>My bewilderment must have been funny, as Sakura smiles.</p><p>It&#39;s a big smile, and it doesn&#39;t look like Shinji&#39;s forcing her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura. I really don&#39;t have any business here, but where&#39;s Shinji?</p><p>Is he home right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nii-san? No, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s home yet.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015He&#39;s not home...? Then who called my house? Weren&#39;t you told to come back here by Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Fujimura-Sensei only told me that I should go home since my grandfather&#39;s waiting.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I see.</p><p>...But it is true that Shinji hasn&#39;t done anything to Sakura.</p><p>Shinji&#39;s her brother after all.</p><p>He would never involve such a good sister in this battle between the Masters.</p><hr><p>...And there&#39;s one thing I have to tell her so I don&#39;t involve her in this mess.</p><hr><p>We look at each other, dumbfounded.</p><p>We stare at each other for about ten seconds.</p><hr><p>&quot;U-Um... It&#39;s a bit disappointing, but it relieves me to hear that from you. I was told to stay at the house and not go anywhere during the night for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s getting dangerous recently, so we should&#39;ve done so earlier.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I won&#39;t be able to go to your house for a while.</p><p>It&#39;s disappointing, but it&#39;ll all go back to normal if I endure it for just a short while. Please come see me at the archery club until then, Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura bows and goes back into her house.</p><hr><p>I manage to make it back before dinner.</p><p>An angry swordsman awaited me at the entrance\u2015\u2015\u2015and I told her what happened today, about how we eliminated the boundary field at school, and how Tohsaka is expecting a counterattack tomorrow.</p><hr><p>...I don&#39;t tell her about Shinji.</p><p>I don&#39;t want her to consider him as an enemy until I figure out his true intentions.</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand. Then let us eat, Shirou. Taiga has made dinner and has been waiting.&quot;</p><p>She must be hungry, as Saber quickly makes her way to the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. I haven&#39;t eaten anything she&#39;s made since we were kids.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m half scared and half looking forward to it.</p><hr><p>...Man.</p><p>Who could have imagined that it was going to turn into such a disaster...?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03</h2><p>&quot;I&#39;m going to go talk to Saber. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up, but I can leave you in charge of dinner, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. Look forward to the delicious kani-tama I&#39;ll be making.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I am a bit worried, but kani-tama is like an omelet, so Fuji-Nee should be able to handle it.</p><hr><p>&quot;I just got home, Saber.&quot;</p><p>I take my shoes off as I go into the dojo.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Welcome home, Shirou. It seems nothing much has happened today.&quot;</p><p>Saber must like the atmosphere, since she&#39;s always here.</p><hr><p>I match Saber and sit Japanese-style to tell her what happened today\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015about how we eliminated the boundary field at school, and how Tohsaka is expecting a counterattack tomorrow.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So the battle with the Master is tomorrow? Then I shall sleep well tonight and save my energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>I nod back.</p><p>I know I&#39;m being too optimistic, but I don&#39;t tell her about Shinji.</p><p>I don&#39;t want her to consider him as an enemy until I figure out his true intentions.</p><hr><p>&quot;But Shirou. Should you be here when it is almost time for dinner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I came to report to you because I don&#39;t have anything to do and there&#39;s time until dinner.</p><p>It&#39;s not bad to relax until dinner once in a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What...? Then you are not making dinner tonight...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh...? T-That&#39;s true, but is there a problem with that? Fuji-Nee&#39;s working hard, so I don&#39;t want to interrupt her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmmm... Taiga&#39;s will to cook should certainly be respected. But... um, so you will not be helping her...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Nope. It&#39;s all right. Fuji-Nee&#39;s a grown woman, so she should be able to make some kani-tama.</p><p>She might even be better than me. She has an A-rank in unexpectedness, after all.&quot;</p><hr><p>I give her a weird explanation.</p><p>But Saber frowns.</p><p>&quot;...All right. I shall believe your words over Taiga&#39;s.</p><p>...Let me make sure. I can trust you, right?&quot;</p><p>She makes sure with a threatening tone.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah. You can trust me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I heard that. Please do not forget the oath you made.&quot;</p><p>Saber relaxes her shoulders.</p><hr><p>...Man.</p><p>Who could have imagined that this was going to lead to such a disaster...?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04</h2><p>It&#39;s time for dinner.</p><p>Fuji-Nee&#39;s special kani-tama bowl is ready on the table.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple dish where there&#39;s rice in the bowl and kani-tama put on top of it.</p><p>It looks like there&#39;s a yellow lid on the bowl, and it honestly doesn&#39;t look good.</p><hr><p>But it should make the rice taste better since it&#39;s in a bowl.</p><p>It&#39;s like katsu-bowl and teriyaki-bowl.</p><p>There&#39;s no way it can taste bad because the good taste of the ingredients seep into the rice.</p><p>The only drawback is that the taste is simple, but that&#39;s a small price to pay.</p><hr><p>&quot;Itadakimasu.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, itadakimasu.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Itadakimasu.&quot;</p><p>We bow and dig into our food.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><p>The food isn&#39;t soft like kani-tama.

I made it just like I was told!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Wow. Did the people at the Fujimura family teach you how to make this?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I told them I&#39;ll be making a big omelet, so they gave me flour and other stuff.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><hr><p>I wanted her to realize the mistake right then.</p><p>I thought that being able to make an omelet was a function every human being was born with.</p><p>Kani-tama is just a variant of an omelet.</p><p>It was my mistake to assume that Fuji-Nee couldn&#39;t mess up something like that.</p><p>That&#39;s right, Fuji-Nee can&#39;t even cook an omelet...!</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>...Then.</p><p>I hear a voice filled with disappointment.</p><p>&quot;Saber...?&quot;</p><p>I slowly turn to her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou.

It&#39;s hard to tell, but it seems Saber&#39;s mad...</p><hr><p>...The hellish dinner ends and it&#39;s time for a strategy meeting.</p><p>But I&#39;ve already reported to Saber about what happened today.</p><p>Since it&#39;s likely that there&#39;ll be a fight tomorrow, we should be preparing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then we will not be going out tonight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It might be vexing for you, but sit tight for tonight. I don&#39;t intend to fight needless battles, and also, we&#39;re not in a condition to be fighting freely.&quot;</p><hr><p>I&#39;m inexperienced as a Master, and Saber has a limit to how many times she can fight since I&#39;m not giving her any magical energy.</p><p>We can&#39;t be leisurely looking for Masters in our situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand. You certainly do have a point. It is not proactive, but we do need the utmost care for victory.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015But. If you have a will to fight, we cannot spend time leisurely. If we are to stay here tonight, we should use this time to train.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber stares at me.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even need to tell me.</p><p>I brought Saber to this dojo with that in mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. Do you remember what happened last night?</p><p>We trained a bit since you told me I was slacking off for coming home late last night.</p><p>...That was a good lesson for me. No matter what I do, I can&#39;t beat someone I can&#39;t beat. I couldn&#39;t realize such a simple thing until I fought you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;With that in mind, I think it&#39;s important to train with you.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how effective it&#39;ll be, but I should be able to survive longer in battles if you train me hard.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then Shirou...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Can you train me whenever we have the time?</p><p>For today, that&#39;ll be until we go to bed.&quot;</p><hr><p>I take the shinai on the wall.</p><p>...It&#39;s still eight o&#39;clock.</p><p>There&#39;s still four hours until bedtime, so I&#39;ll train my heart... out\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Hold on, Saber!!&quot;</p><p>I stop Saber since I feel my life&#39;s in danger.</p><p>Because as Saber turns to me...</p><p>&quot;What is it?

A magus would know right away I&#39;m a Master, and I&#39;m sure I can recognize another Master if I see him or her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really...!? But you didn&#39;t know I was a magus. Why is that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? You want me to say it?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sounds mean now.</p><p>...I have a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. I think I figured it out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Smart move. Well, that&#39;s how it is. There are people who have small amounts of magical energy that aren&#39;t magi. Magi approve others as magi only when they have more than a set amount of magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. I figured that out.</p><p>...Oh, then what do you feel from me now?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, you haven&#39;t changed at all.</p><p>I heard it was an incomplete summoning, so I bet the connection between you two is small except when healing your wounds.</p><p>Well, I guess that&#39;s possible since you&#39;re a special case.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Hm.</p><p>Then Shinji isn&#39;t a Master.</p><p>Even if I can&#39;t tell, Tohsaka can identify a Master.</p><p>Tohsaka should be able to feel the lingering magical energy if Shinji is a Master with a Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. You say we have to look for Masters, but it should be easy once we start. We just need to follow the trail of magical energy, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. If they have an item that can hide their magical energy, nobody would find out about them.</p><p>...Well, I think items that can hide a magical energy as large as a Servant are rare, so I don&#39;t think any Master has one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then you can&#39;t detect a Master even if he&#39;s close to you, if he has such an item?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. It would depend on what he has, but I think I&#39;d be able to tell if I go near him. As long as they&#39;ve formed a contract with a Servant, friction with the world will occur.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;If I can&#39;t identify a Master even when I&#39;m near him, it means that the Master isn&#39;t using his Servant.</p><p>Well, I guess there are exceptions, but that&#39;ll be the case nine times out of ten.&quot;</p><hr><p>We return to the classroom.</p><p>Even though we couldn&#39;t find any clues about other Masters, it seems Tohsaka&#39;s happy that we eliminated a lot of the marks.</p><p>She said something about the enemy coming out in the future because we were so active and whatnot.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re patient. You don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll be before that happens, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? A person who would set up a boundary field like this won&#39;t just stay quiet if something like this happens. I&#39;m guessing he or she will come out tomorrow.</p><p>This person won&#39;t let the same thing happen twice.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sneers at the Master we have yet to see.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. So that&#39;s how it is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. \u2015\u2015\u2015Well, I have some things to do, so I&#39;ll be going home now. I have to buy a lot of stuff in preparation for tomorrow.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. Go home early today, okay? Go straight home.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, you&#39;re worrying about me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...! N-No, it just screws up my plans if my ally dies! I&#39;m just making sure!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka says so quickly.</p><p>Her panic is so unlike her, and it&#39;s obvious that she&#39;s only hiding her embarrassment.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I see.</p><p>I&#39;m beginning to understand more about Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyway! You&#39;re too defenseless, so don&#39;t do careless things! I&#39;m an exception, but other Masters will kill you in a matter of seconds!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks away and tries to leave.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Seeing her leave, I suddenly...</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Is Archer by your side?&quot;</p><p>...Murmur something meaningless.</p><hr><p>&quot;He is. What? Do you need to talk to him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No. I&#39;m just wondering if you two are getting along.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks back at me in wonder at the sudden question.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ohhh, I see.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to worry. He&#39;s a good guy even though he&#39;s rebellious. He&#39;s immature in spite of his looks, and he&#39;s fun to be with.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so happily, Tohsaka disappears down the stairs.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-10" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 10</h2><p>Mitsuzuri&#39;s case might still be affecting me, as I am at the archery range before I know it.</p><p>The range is far from the school building and seems deserted.</p><p>The club activities are over, so there&#39;s nothing to find here.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I guess I&#39;ll go home.&quot;</p><p>I turn around and head to the gate.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015And between me and the gate...</p><p>...Stands Matou Shinji, as if to block my way.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, you&#39;re going home this late? Weren&#39;t all students supposed to go home immediately since it&#39;s getting dangerous recently?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t think I can be calm facing Shinji here.</p><p>I ignore him and keep walking.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You&#39;re so tired that you can&#39;t even greet your friend, huh?</p><p>You&#39;re tired because you&#39;re doing meddlesome things like destroying the spells.&quot;</p><p>His voice sounds delighted.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I jump back and ready myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;Spell\u2015\u2015\u2015if you&#39;re using that word, then...&quot;</p><p>I glare at Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yup, that&#39;s right. The boundary field that you thoroughly eliminated is a security measure I set up.</p><p>If you destroy it like that, I&#39;ll be so scared that I won&#39;t be able to come to school anymore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>So this is how stupid I am.</p><p>I knew about it when I saw Shinji in the woods, but I rejected the idea because I was unprepared for the truth.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. Don&#39;t be on guard like that. Since that annoying Tohsaka&#39;s gone, let&#39;s talk things over as men. As you know, I don&#39;t like fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Talk things over...? You don&#39;t want to fight me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing you were forced to be this Master thing as well, right?</p><p>It happened to me too. I was forced to be a Master even though I&#39;m not a magus, nor do I have a will to fight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m trying to find a way to get through this without fighting anybody. So that&#39;s why I have no intention of fighting you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then what&#39;s up with that boundary field? You&#39;re saying you don&#39;t want to fight even though you have such a thing set up?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you stupid? That&#39;s for my protection. There&#39;s a pure magus named Tohsaka in this school.</p><p>She won&#39;t hesitate to fight. Since I&#39;m not a magus, I have to set up protection for myself.</p><p>That boundary field is set up for that purpose alone. I won&#39;t activate it as long as I don&#39;t get attacked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...He&#39;s making sense.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if Shinji is really a Master or not, or how he became one.</p><p>But I can trust his story.</p><p>If Shinji says so, I should believe him.</p><p>But before that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji. Are you the one that attacked the female student yesterday?&quot;</p><p>I have to get this question answered.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, that? I couldn&#39;t help it.</p><p>My Servant&#39;s unmanageable, and she attacks people if I let her be.</p><p>I&#39;m just a normal person. I&#39;m not a magus like Tohsaka, so it&#39;s hard for me to get her to obey me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Then what happened yesterday is an accident? Your Servant did it herself?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be careful from now on. I don&#39;t want anything happening here either. I&#39;ll make sure the only thing she does is to protect me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You swear that&#39;s true, Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Why would I lie? I could&#39;ve kept it a secret, but I told you about it.</p><p>You were getting suspicious of me, right? I&#39;ll have to fight back if you attack me, so I came out with it before that happened.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I don&#39;t want to fight anybody.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t trust everything he says.</p><p>But if Shinji really thinks so\u2015\u2015\u2015everything would work out.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, I&#39;ll believe you. If you&#39;re not going to do anything, I won&#39;t do anything to you either. That&#39;s fine, right, Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Good, you&#39;re understanding for once.</p><p>But that&#39;s not good enough. Can&#39;t you tell why I came here to talk?&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji holds out his hand.</p><p>So that means...</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you want to cooperate with me, Emiya? I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t know, but the Matou family is a family of magi.</p><p>...Well, magecraft died out in my father&#39;s generation, but we still have the knowledge. How does it sound? I&#39;ll be helpful to an inexperienced Master like you, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The Matou line is a family of magi...?</p><p>Tohsaka didn&#39;t say such a thing.</p><p>No, she must have excluded him since magecraft died out in his father&#39;s generation, like he said.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what do you say? We can survive through the Holy Grail War if we cooperate. You shouldn&#39;t even need to think about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>His hand is held out.</p><p>...Shinji&#39;s proposal isn&#39;t bad.</p><p>It makes sense, and it&#39;s a viable option.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shinji. Does Sakura know that you&#39;re a Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? You really must be an amateur, Emiya.</p><p>Listen, a family of magi only teaches its secrets to the eldest son. Other children are just spare organs.</p><p>It&#39;s meaningless to teach magecraft to such a thing, and it&#39;s a waste of time.</p><p>...Geez. A slow woman like her wouldn&#39;t be able to use magecraft.</p><p>I&#39;m the only one that inherited the secret.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I see.</p><p>That&#39;s really good.</p><p>Sakura shouldn&#39;t be involved in all this.</p><p>I want her to be smiling happily all the time.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji. If you won&#39;t do anything to me, I won&#39;t do anything to you. That&#39;s good enough, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. So you won&#39;t cooperate with me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;We don&#39;t need to, right? If we&#39;re not going to fight, cooperation&#39;s meaningless.</p><p>If you only want to protect yourself, have the church take care of you until the Holy Grail War ends. You know that, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. What is this? Are you trying to win this war?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I have no intention of fighting.</p><p>But I&#39;ll fight anyone that attacks me, and I can&#39;t just ignore people that&#39;ll bring disaster to this town.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...I won&#39;t kill people. But I have to see what the Holy Grail really is. To do so, I have to survive until the end, right?&quot;</p><p>I turn my back to Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So you&#39;re going to fight no matter what, huh?</p><p>It has nothing to do with me, but you&#39;re not intending to involve Sakura in this, are you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll let her get involved. You&#39;re going to hide this from her too, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. But as her brother, I can&#39;t let her stay at a house with a guy who&#39;s going to fight.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to fight, I won&#39;t let Sakura out of my place until the Holy Grail War ends. That&#39;s fine, right, Emiya?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Shinji does have a point.</p><p>As long as I&#39;ll be fighting, my house is in danger.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, I&#39;ll tell Sakura. Is that good for you, Shinji?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so caring.</p><p>To be honest, I was scared if you were going to hold her hostage. Well, my problem is solved for now.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s funny, but Shinji laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s all I have to say. I&#39;m going home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go ahead. Oh, but you know that this is our secret, right? I came out with this secret since you&#39;re my friend. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do if you go and tell somebody about this.&quot;</p><hr><p>That must mean he&#39;ll activate the boundary field if I tell Tohsaka about this.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Yeah, I won&#39;t tell anyone. But it&#39;s a different story if she finds out herself. I&#39;m going to help her as much as I can. I won&#39;t stop her from fighting you if she finds out about you.</p><p>...So if you don&#39;t want to be found, don&#39;t do anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>I head to the gate for real.</p><p>The school building is tinted by the setting sun...</p><p>Shinji sees me off without a word.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-11" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 11</h2><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Caster extends her finger.</p><hr><p>&quot;Da\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015mn\u2015\u2015\u2015...!&quot;</p><p>I want to fight back, but my body will not move.</p><p>My senses are taken away, and I&#39;m sure she will eliminate my body in a matter of seconds.</p><hr><p>&quot;Goodbye, boy. If you are going to mourn, mourn that you became a Master with such small skills.&quot;</p><p>My body does not move and accepts the finger of death.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I resist the urge to close my eyes and keep glaring at Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wow. You are a good boy. I like such good efforts.&quot;</p><p>Caster sneers at my resistance and puts her finger on my Command Spell.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Even my free will is numbing.</p><p>...In my fading consciousness...</p><p>Clang!</p><p>I hear a sound like crashing swords from the other side of the mountain gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>What kind of a miracle is it?</p><p>I hear tens of sounds cutting through air, and numerous arrows pierce the ground in front of me.</p><p>Caster instantly retreats, her robe fluttering behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There are arrows pierced in the ground in front of Caster.</p><p>The 13 arrows were shot from above.</p><p>They were probably all shot at the same time, and I&#39;m sure it would&#39;ve gotten Caster if there had been one more arrow.</p><hr><p>The owner of the arrows is standing on top of the mountain gate.</p><p>The knight in red jumps down to the ground empty-handed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heh. I thought you&#39;d be dead by now, but I guess you&#39;re pretty tenacious.&quot;</p><p>The man\u2015\u2015\u2015Archer says so while standing in front of me as if to protect me from Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015\u2015why...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just happened to drop by. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>...So how is your body? I should have cut Caster&#39;s string with that attack.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>After he says so, I check my hand.</p><p>...It moves.</p><p>My frozen body has its freedom returned with just one attack by Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;It moves. Caster&#39;s binding is gone, but\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s good. Do what you want now... Or so I would like to say, but\u2015\u2015\u2015do not move if you don&#39;t want to be killed by her. If you move recklessly...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Kuh, Archer...!? What is Assassin doing!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;See, she&#39;ll take out her anger on you.</p><p>A woman&#39;s fury is hard to control. ...Man, I think this will get rough.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Well. Don&#39;t get too mad, Caster.</p><p>Assassin is fighting Saber right now. I do not know who that samurai is, but he is a strong swordsman to keep Saber at bay.</p><p>Should you not praise him instead?&quot;</p><hr><p>Even though he&#39;s facing his enemy, there&#39;s no tension in Archer.</p><p>Caster must have noticed that as well, as she regains her calm.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Heh, stop with the ridiculous talk. You cannot call him a heroic spirit if he cannot stop you. He is not strong enough to be called a swordsman.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. You sound like Assassin is your ally\u2015\u2015\u2015so your Masters must be cooperating.</p><p>There is no other explanation to this situation of having two Servants in the same place.&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster is staring at Archer silently.</p><p>I can&#39;t see her expression hidden behind the robe, but it seems Caster is bewildered.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Is that true, Archer...!? That Saber&#39;s here and fighting Servant Assassin, and that Assassin&#39;s Master and Caster&#39;s Master are cooperating...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Assassin is guarding outside the gate and Caster is hiding behind the gate. It is obvious that they are cooperating.</p><p>It is not rare for Masters to team up. You and Rin are cooperating, to give an example.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s right, now that he mentions it.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then that means there are two Masters here...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Fufu, ahahahahaha! I was wondering what you were going to say, but you are so off, Archer!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, was I wrong? ...Man, I was confident that you two are allies.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, you are terribly wrong.</p><p>Allies\u2015\u2015\u2015? I would cooperate with that dog? With the man that&#39;s under my control?&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster does not stop laughing.</p><p>Her laugh is so unsuitable that the tense atmosphere disperses.</p><hr><p>In contrast...</p><p>Archer is gritting his teeth.</p><hr><p>&quot;</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I sense something that was not there before.</p><p>It is not Caster&#39;s enmity nor the magical energy surrounding this place.</p><p>For the first time since he came to this place...</p><p>Archer is showing his enmity.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, your guess is correct, Archer.</p><p>My Master is not cooperating with anybody, and the same goes for Assassin&#39;s Master.</p><p>No, first of all, Assassin does not have a Master...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><p>Assassin doesn&#39;t have a Master?</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>Every Servant needs a Master to exist.</p><p>Weren&#39;t they supposed to disappear if they didn&#39;t have a supply of magical energy from their Master?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Caster. You broke the rule.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course not. I haven&#39;t broken the rule. Magi summon the Servants, right?</p><p>Then what is wrong with Caster, a magus, summoning a Servant!?&quot;</p><hr><p>The witch in the black robe laughs.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...That means...</p><p>Servant Assassin is a heroic spirit summoned by Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;A Servant who controls a Servant, huh? I see. That is why he is a fictional hero.</p><p>As Assassin was summoned by a improper Master, someone other than the proper &quot;assassin&quot; was summoned. ...I don&#39;t mind that. It doesn&#39;t concern me who the heroic spirit is, as I only need to defeat them.</p><p>But I&#39;m sure this is all under your judgment, is it not?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! ...Let me ask you. How did you arrive at that conclusion, Archer?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a hunch. Masters are magi.</p><p>When a magus summons a familiar that is superior to him, I&#39;m sure the relationship isn&#39;t that of a servant and a master.</p><p>It is natural for the Master to be on his guard against a familiar of greater power.</p><p>...If I were your Master, I would not give any freedom to a witch. There is no way he would allow you to summon a Servant that would only obey your orders.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. It seems you have some intelligence.</p><p>All right. I shall dismiss your insult in deference to your cleverness.&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster stares at Archer as she laughs.</p><p>...There&#39;s only enmity between the two now.</p><p>They&#39;re about seven meters apart.</p><p>With the charge that Archer showed at school, he should be able to slash Caster even before she can finish casting a spell\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;I understand now. Saber, Lancer, and Rider have strong magecraft resistance. It is on a different level from this guy behind me.</p><p>It is hard to affect them with magecraft.

Then you had no intention of killing me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I only responded to your provocation. My objective is that man over there. I didn&#39;t intend to fight another Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Hm.</p><p>He certainly didn&#39;t have any will to fight from the beginning...</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. It does not look like you came here to fight me, Archer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. It&#39;s just like that chicken over there. I try to avoid meaningless battles.</p><p>I only use my sword at perfect opportunities, and only when I can swear a sure kill. I don&#39;t like killing meaninglessly.&quot;</p><hr><p>...What&#39;s so funny?</p><p>Caster laughs from the bottom of her heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Then you two are alike.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&quot;Huh?&quot;&quot;</p><p>We reply in unison.</p><p>Alike... Me and Archer?</p><p>What makes her say that?</p><hr><p>&quot;Am I wrong? You both do not like meaningless killings, right? That boy over there cannot stand a Servant like me who feeds on innocent people.</p><p>You don&#39;t like meaningless killings.</p><p>See, it&#39;s exactly the same. Is that not why you two are cooperating?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot...! How can you reach that conclusion!? Who would ally with such a guy!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I feel the same way. We are both pacifists, but our principles are different. It is my principle to take care of problems early on.</p><p>I do not ponder forever like this man.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What do you mean by pacifist!? I still remember. You shot at Saber along with Berserker.</p><p>Even though you were hiding in a safe place while Saber was fighting...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It couldn&#39;t be helped. We were not cooperating back then.[vr]</p><p>It&#39;s just that defeating Berserker came before Saber&#39;s safety.</p><p>Or what? Don&#39;t tell me to save everyone I see. If that is the case, Berserker would have to be saved as well and I would not be able to fight him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.......!!&quot;</p><hr><p>We glare at one another.</p><p>Man, I just can&#39;t get along with him!</p><p>Why does everything he says get on my nerves...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Fu\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Then.</p><p>Caster laughs even more seeing us like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;I like you two.

What do you want to say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you not tell? I&#39;m telling you to ally with me.</p><p>I can provide you two with better partners.</p><p>I can give you, boy, a Servant superior to Saber.</p><p>I can give you, Archer, a contract with a magus superior to your Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015My mind freezes.</p><p>I question her sanity for asking such a question.</p><hr><p>&quot;It can&#39;t be a bad proposal. I told you two that I&#39;m prepared to end this war, and winning is easy.</p><p>How about it? Should you not cooperate with me if you want to survive?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t even need to think about it.</p><p>I decided to fight since I want to stop people like her who would involve innocent people.</p><p>So I can never accept her offer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I refuse. I won&#39;t ally with a witch like you.&quot;</p><p>I declare so.</p><p>This is a natural response.</p><p>I can&#39;t cooperate with this Servant, and more than anything, we won&#39;t betray our partners.</p><p>I&#39;ll be fighting with Saber, and Archer will not do anything to betray Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Wait.</p><p>Why is he silent?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey. Archer\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I refuse. There is no reason for me to need your power.</p><p>Before anything, your territory is too weak.

It is not a good enough condition to accept your offer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I sigh with relief.</p><p>I had a bad feeling, but he&#39;s not like that.</p><p>I hate him, but he&#39;s still firm on his beliefs.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So there is no negotiation?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. But I have no intention of fighting you here. It&#39;s by my own choice that I&#39;m here. It&#39;s not my Master&#39;s order, so there&#39;s no reason for me to defeat you. How about we call this a draw?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I doubt my own ears.</p><p>Did he just say he&#39;d let Caster go...?</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s unexpected. Your Master was after me, right? But you&#39;re saying you will let me go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I don&#39;t care how many people you kill here. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll ignore.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. How terrible of you. You think poison has its uses?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My Master isn&#39;t that enthusiastic about killing other Masters.</p><p>So it&#39;ll help me if you kill other Masters. We can settle our match after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>Caster must have accepted it as she turns around.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on, Caster...!&quot;</p><p>I run to Caster, who&#39;s about to disappear.</p><p>But Archer stops me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you stupid? You&#39;ll surely die if you follow her.&quot;</p><p>He sounds calm.</p><p>It&#39;s so true that I want to vomit from anger.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I stop.</p><p>Caster&#39;s black robe flutters in the wind and disappears.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12</h2><p>Caster has disappeared.</p><p>Only Archer and I remain here.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>His figure just gets on my nerves.</p><p>Archer has saved me twice already.</p><p>Caster would&#39;ve taken my Command Spell without him, and I&#39;m sure I would have died from that rain of light.</p><hr><p>But this is different.</p><p>I can&#39;t forgive him for letting Caster go\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer. Why did you let Caster go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s because now is not the time to fight her. Even if I did attack her, she would have just run away. Don&#39;t tell me you did not see her teleport.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s certainly true.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t be able to get Caster if she really wanted to get away.</p><p>After all, this is her territory.</p><p>It&#39;s that witch.</p><p>Even if she may have been weak, I&#39;m sure she had at least one or two more tricks left up her sleeve.</p><hr><p>&quot;It seems you understand now. If we want to defeat Caster, we have to defeat her Master. Even if she can teleport away, she will eventually disappear if we defeat her Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Going after the Master and not the Servant.</p><p>That&#39;s the correct and the safest approach to the Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I know that. But you&#39;re going to let her get away?</p><p>The incidents in town are all her doing. There will be more victims until we stop Caster. I can&#39;t ignore her and let her be.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why? It&#39;s not something that is harmful to you. Actually, I would like for her to continue.</p><p>Caster will keep sucking up magical energy and eventually defeat Berserker. We can defeat Caster after that.</p><p>Rin and I can defeat Caster, but not Berserker. I&#39;ll let Caster do as she wishes until she defeats Berserker.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My head heats up.</p><p>I get so pissed off that I want to punch Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Tohsaka won&#39;t do such a thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re right. That&#39;s why I want Caster to do so as fast as possible. We can&#39;t avoid fighting if Rin finds Caster. It would be ideal if Caster can defeat Berserker right before that happens.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how many people will be sacrificed, but it should be cheap if Berserker can be defeated.</p><p>Humans die anyway. It will not change the ultimate result no matter how they die.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Caster&#39;s too reserved. She should not only take their magical energy, but their lives as well. It&#39;ll be easier for me to fight if everybody in this town dies. My Master&#39;s too optimistic. If that happens, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll do anything to win.&quot;</p><hr><p>The knight in red states with a smile.</p><p>He says it with delight.</p><p>That the people here are only a bother.</p><p>He&#39;s saying the same thing Caster said\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;Y\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I think you know that Rin&#39;s the type that is concerned with formality. She&#39;s great as a magus, but she&#39;s not dirty enough as a Master.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t be this troubled if she would be more like Caster\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I punch at Archer&#39;s face.</p><p>Of course, it does not hit as Archer avoids it without trouble.</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you doing? I thought we were cooperating.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up...!</p><p>I&#39;m not like you. I can&#39;t sacrifice people around me to win...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I feel the same way, Emiya Shirou. But you cannot save everyone.</p><p>For example, the damage will extend beyond this town if Caster obtains the Holy Grail. That goes for Illyasviel and the other Masters.</p><p>As far as I know, you and Rin are the only Masters that will not use the Holy Grail for your own good. Therefore, there will be more victims unless we win the Holy Grail War.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;In that case\u2015\u2015\u2015we will sacrifice the people in this town for our benefit.</p><p>It will be exactly as you want if the damage is reduced as a result.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>My head is numb.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t even need to tell me that.</p><hr><p>One cannot save everyone.</p><p>Kiritsugu always said that.</p><p>So I shouldn&#39;t feel anything even if he says so\u2015\u2015\u2015but it just pisses me off...!</p><hr><p>&quot;You said you do not want to involve innocent people, right?</p><p>Then accept it. Nobody can be saved if you try to save everybody.</p><p>As Caster said, we are similar, unfortunately. We would have to cooperate if we do not want any victims.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No...! I won&#39;t cooperate with you. I will never accept you...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You only trust Rin, after all.&quot;</p><hr><p>I turn my back to Archer.</p><p>I&#39;m different from him.</p><p>If I can&#39;t ignore Caster, there&#39;s only one thing I need to do.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not tell me you&#39;ll go after Caster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I ignore him and keep walking.</p><p>I&#39;m heading inside the temple.</p><p>Since this is Caster&#39;s territory, her workshop has to be inside the temple somewhere.</p><hr><p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe it. You cannot match Caster by yourself. You should stop if you don&#39;t want to die.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Archer follows me, as if he has more to say.</p><hr><p>&quot;Man, are you going to throw away the life that I&#39;ve saved?</p><p>I don&#39;t mind, but at least thank me before you die.</p><p>I helped you out of kindness. I won&#39;t ask for you to treat me like your savior, but at least thank me like a friend.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>Man, he&#39;s really getting on my nerves!</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Shut up, I won&#39;t feel any friendship towards you! Just go back to Tohsaka&#39;s place! I won&#39;t ask for your help even if you offer it to me!&quot;</p><hr><p>I look away and walk towards the temple again.</p><p>There...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Good thing you don&#39;t like me.&quot;</p><p>A chilling intent to kill comes from behind me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>I jump back as I turn around...</p><p>At the same time, Archer swings his sword.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015guh...?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m cut at my shoulder.</p><p>My blood comes flowing out, and my consciousness will fade away if I let my guard down.</p><p>The pain is so sharp that it feels like my body is burning.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah.&quot;</p><p>I back up with wobbling steps.</p><p>It&#39;s not to run away.</p><p>I just don&#39;t have any power, so my feet move back to try to keep my body upright.</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;I missed, huh? It must have been my mistake in letting out my intent to kill, or it must have been your cleverness in jumping back instantly. Well, I don&#39;t care either way.&quot;</p><p>Archer walks toward me with the sword wet with my blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ll be killed.</p><p>I feel that I&#39;ll be killed, so I move my feet in desperation.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The temple&#39;s exit.</p><p>I slowly retreat, trying to make my way to the mountain gate.</p><hr><p>&quot;[line12]&quot;</p><p>...He must know this is a fatal wound.</p><p>Archer walks toward me without hurry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015ah, ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My mind&#39;s fading.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m heading to the mountain gate, I don&#39;t know why I was attacked.

Since you do not have a reason to fight, die here.&quot;</p><p>He raises his sword.</p><p>The white yin sword is raised like a guillotine.</p><hr><p>&quot;What......? Reason\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015to fight...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. It is only hypocrisy for you to fight for someone else and not yourself.

We will still make it. With your healing powers, if we return home right away\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...She must have realized after saying that much.</p><p>Saber turns back to the Servant, still supporting me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Assassin. Why did you not attack me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would be too rude. Nobody can pick a flower that only appears for an instant.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Saber tilts her head in wonder, unable to understand her enemy&#39;s intention.</p><hr><p>&quot;I was charmed by your face. Your fighting face was nice, but your tense face is beautiful as well. I had to admire it.&quot;</p><p>...Is it a kimono?</p><p>The traditionally-dressed Servant turns his back.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is enough for tonight. Leave, Saber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015are you going to let us go, Assassin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. If you promise to continue this battle someday, I will let you go.</p><p>You cannot fight to your satisfaction like this. That is not my wish.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber glares at Assassin,</p><p>and Assassin stares calmly at Saber.</p><p>The breath-taking staredown continues for less than ten seconds.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand, Assassin. I shall settle this match someday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is a good response. I will be waiting, king of knights.&quot;</p><p>Saber goes down the steps with me in her arms.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>I see the knight in red running down from the mountain, determined not to let me go.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer...?&quot;</p><p>Saber says so in wonder.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015He said...</p><p>That he will kill only when he swears to kill.</p><hr><p>Then there&#39;s no way Archer will let me go.</p><p>If he used his sword to kill me...</p><p>I&#39;m sure he will kill me here no matter what.</p><hr><p>His red robe flutters like a wing.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if Saber&#39;s here or not.</p><p>Archer jumps down and slashes his sword at me...!</p><hr><p>Swords clash.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The sword attacks with lightning speed.</p><p>The intercepting blade parries Archer&#39;s attack and goes for his neck...!</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!

I won&#39;t let you through alive, nor will I let you out alive.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I let you go on your way in, but it is a different story on your way out. Your head is not elegant, but I shall accept it for tonight.&quot;</p><p>...His intent to kill leaks out.</p><p>Assassin&#39;s intent to kill is as sharp as his longsword.</p><p>It&#39;s not overbearing like the ones Archer and Saber have.</p><p>But an enmity sharpened to the extreme is going for the enemy&#39;s neck\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Well said. A mere tool of Caster that could not even hurt Saber is going to fight me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That goes for you as well. I sent you to surprise that fox, but I am disappointed that you came back for your own safety.&quot;</p><p>They only confront each other for a short while.</p><p>They attack each other with amazing techniques.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m fascinated by the scene.</p><p>To be honest, I can&#39;t understand Assassin&#39;s technique.</p><p>Even to my experienced eyes, it&#39;s way too fast and too sharp.</p><hr><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s why I&#39;m fascinated by &quot;his&quot; technique.</p><p>The dancing twin swords.</p><p>Archer is defending Assassin&#39;s incomprehensible attacks with a technique I might be able to acquire.</p><hr><p>...To be honest, you could say I admire it.</p><p>He is fighting off Assassin&#39;s demonic technique with techniques only trained by his will and not his natural talent.</p><hr><p>...Damn, it&#39;s natural that he&#39;s strong.</p><p>Strength unlike Tohsaka or Saber.</p><p>All the training he went through because he&#39;s not extraordinary...</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015He probably had nothing.</p><p>That&#39;s why he took the small thing he had, trained it with all his might, and got it to that level\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou, let us go now. We have to treat your body.&quot;</p><p>I come back to reality with Saber&#39;s voice.</p><p>We leave the Ryuudou Temple with Saber carrying me.</p><p>The clashing of Assassin and Archer can still be heard behind us.</p><hr><p>My wound is almost healed by the time we get back.</p><p>&#39;Saber&#39;s self-healing powers might be flowing into you since you&#39;re connected with her.&#39;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s guess might be right as my wound heals faster when Saber&#39;s touching me.</p><hr><p>&quot;So what happened, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Saber demands an explanation once we get to the dojo after treating my wound and getting changed.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I try to tell her all the important things.</p><p>How I was controlled by Caster and went to the temple...</p><p>The relationship between Caster and the coma incidents happening in town...</p><p>How Archer came and saved me when my Command Spell was about to get taken away...</p><p>And how Archer tried to kill me in the end.</p><hr><p>Saber is pondering something.</p><p>I&#39;m sure she wants to first organize things in her head since so many things occurred in one night.</p><p>&quot;...I see. Then Archer let Caster go?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, he let her go. He&#39;s the worst guy ever. He&#39;s not any different from Caster if he&#39;s using Caster to win...!&quot;</p><p>It pisses me off again now that I recall it.</p><p>Damn, I should have punched him in his face back then...!</p><hr><p>...Then.</p><p>Saber has a weird expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. Why are you smiling?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I just thought it is rare for you to insult someone. I have only been with you for a few days, but I understand that you are not one to insult others.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Now that she mentions it, I contemplate my immature actions for complaining.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But I can&#39;t help it. Archer said things that deserve it. And most of all, he insulted his own Master, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. \u2015\u2015\u2015But Shirou, I would like to ask something. Are you angry at Archer&#39;s betrayal?</p><p>It seems you are not mad at Archer for attacking you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh yeah.</p><p>So the fact that Archer tried to kill me would be &quot;betrayal&quot;.</p><p>...But that&#39;s...</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. It doesn&#39;t mean he betrayed me.</p><p>I haven&#39;t made any promises with him from the beginning. So I think it&#39;s fair even if he attacked me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is true, but... Geez, you are a mystery to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so in utter amazement.</p><p>But I think there&#39;s some friendliness in her tone.</p><hr><p>&quot;I feel the same way as you, Shirou. We cannot let Caster be, but Archer is not cruel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...? Wait, what part of our conversation were you listening to?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Everything. Based on all that I have heard, I am saying I have the same opinion as you.</p><p>And his sword technique is a clear stream. He must not have anything evil in his mind. I believe his dance-like techniques indicate his character.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I like it even less now.</p><p>Something&#39;s wrong with Saber to praise him.</p><p>First of all, Archer&#39;s technique is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>No, I was crazy back then!</p><p>He&#39;s like a yogurt that&#39;s about to expire compared to Saber!</p><hr><p>&quot;Humph. What are you saying? His technique is nothing. He couldn&#39;t kill me even when he attacked me by surprise. How can he call himself a Servant like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is because you have talent as well, Shirou. You should be able to be as good as Archer if you train for a long time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t object if Saber says so with a face like that.</p><p>...Anyway, it seems Saber approves of Archer&#39;s technique.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but I don&#39;t like that fact.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Saber. You said I have talent, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. You will be a good fighter if you train for a long time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;ve decided. Teach me stuff as soon as my wound heals.</p><p>Not how to survive, but how to fight.&quot;</p><p>I hold Saber&#39;s hand and stare at her directly in her eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015oh, yes. I do not mind if you say so.&quot;</p><hr><p>All right.
