Fujimaru and Mash,<br> I see you&#39;re both getting the hang of this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> While you can&#39;t attack outright, you&#39;ve gotten much better at analyzing and adapting to the situation as it unfolds.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After all, your objective in battle is to sustain as little damage as possible. Never forget that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m getting more confident on the defensive front.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When we were in Camelot, and I finally learned that the True Name of the Servant I fused with was Galahad...well, that has helped me so much...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The way I bear down...and instead of repelling the enemy&#39;s attack, it&#39;s like I ward them off, or even return the move...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I get it. \u201COaks may fall when reeds stand the storm.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s so eloquent, and it embodies the spirit of martial arts. That should be the motto for all Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not all about skill.<br> Sometimes a defense must be unyielding as steel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The long-awaited counterattack...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-counter? Well, I hear Galahad was skilled at such things...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I... It&#39;s still hard for me to read the enemy&#39;s movements...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you&#39;re talking about a reversal technique, maybe aikido. Swordsmanship, karate...those types of martial arts all focus on responding to the enemy&#39;s moves.</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Oh hey, Master. I&#39;ve been looking for you.<br> I wanted to let you know it&#39;s almost dinnertime!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;re in charge of dinner today, Touta?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Haha. Sorry to disappoint you.<br> But hey, at least my cooking is simple and manly!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let the others make varied and exquisite dishes. Nobody can beat me when it comes to sheer quantity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually, the rice that you cook is delicious,<br> Touta. The grains come out so fluffy.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Fluffy, huh? Well, now that puts a smile on my face. You&#39;d make a good wife, Mash.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I don&#39;t carry around a bag of rice for nothing.<br> White rice is always a source of power!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> There&#39;s nobody who could best me in any dish that pairs with white rice.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> And you can always come back for more! Salted salmon, seasoned nori... Eat it with whatever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gulp...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m...getting hungry...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, if everyone just ate Touta&#39;s rice,<br> it&#39;d be a big help with our operating budget.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Yeah, right? Oh, hey... So this is the seemalayter that I&#39;ve heard so much about.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I heard it&#39;s a strange contraption,<br> but how does it actually train you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh right, you&#39;ve never used it before. This device can take you anywhere around the world or to any strange land.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re famous for killing all kinds of strange things, this device would probably entertain you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Legend says that you once defeated a giant centipede, Touta. I&#39;d be very interested to see what it looked like!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Heh, cut it out. You&#39;re making me blush.<br> I&#39;m not used to so much praise, or talking about myself.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But conveniently, there&#39;s this contraption that could help us out. I&#39;d be happy to show you what you want to know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you going to show us how you defeated the giant centipede?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I&#39;m always in favor of eating good rice. And no meal tastes better than the one you have after facing a life-or-death experience!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Now then, Lord Peach Hair. Give us the biggest centipede you have. I&#39;ll show you a proper bug hunt!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is that what you want? The simulator is useful, but unfortunately, we don&#39;t have any data on giant centipedes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, we&#39;ve never fought a giant centipede in any of the Singularities...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On top of that, the centipede you&#39;re talking about was big enough to have coiled seven and a half times around Mt. Mikami. Recreating something like that would take a while.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Shucks. So no giant centipede...<br> Pity, since it was quite the sight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If only we had an abundance of funds.<br> If all we ate was Touta&#39;s rice...maybe one day...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s have dinner.</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hm...I would love to do that, but now that we&#39;ve started this conversation, I&#39;m not in an eating mood...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m terribly sorry.<br> I started all this with my impossible request.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> No, no. My own immaturity&#39;s got me riled up and now I can&#39;t calm down.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But you know what, Mash, Fujimaru. Even if we don&#39;t exactly have what we want, it&#39;s just a matter of improvisation.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I may have been blessed with many things during my lifetime, but that doesn&#39;t mean I had everything.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Rather, working around a situation like that is my forte. And, Lord Peachtree, if you don&#39;t mind a small request...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That could work.<br> That shouldn&#39;t take too much resources.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Then I ask that you prepare accordingly.<br> Wait right there. I&#39;ll bring in the proper actors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is turning into quite the spectacle...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder when we&#39;re going to eat...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...And so you&#39;re all inside the simulator. I&#39;ll try to use what we have to simulate the period in Japan for you...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, you know, if there&#39;s anything off, just...let it slide, please!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Thanks, Lord Roman.<br> Sorry to rope you into my selfish whims.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you managed to figure out the giant centipede?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s going to be C\xFA Chulainn Alter...</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Heh. Don&#39;t sweat the details.<br> Just sit back and watch. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Now then. Let me tell you the tale of the giant centipede. It was when I journeyed to the province of Shimotsuke.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> When I arrived at Seta in Oumi, I ran across some civilians who seemed to be distressed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, there are people gathered in front of a bridge.<br> Did it collapse?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Nope! It was a giant snake about sixty meters long lying on the bridge.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t doing much, really, just sitting on top of the bridge. But the civilians were all terrified and nobody was willing to try getting over or around the snake.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hiiisss!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ohhh, so THAT&#39;S the giant snake...</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But no mere snake could hinder me.<br> I simply ignored the giant snake and crossed the bridge.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hup!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Did you just step on me? You told me you were only going to step over me during the rehearsal...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Uh, well, I just remembered...back then I was quite intoxicated...and so the giant snake and I...well...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So, you picked a fight with the snake.<br> No one told me about that part.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Therefore, I, Kiyo...I mean, the giant cute snake atop the bridge will not tolerate such lies!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Ha! That&#39;s the spirit, Doujouji!<br> You sure know how to liven up an act!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> This is act one, Fujimaru!<br> Tawara Touta, heading out!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> (Pant, pant)...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> When I lost my temper, I feel I crossed a line unbecoming for a heroine...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master?<br> Did you happen to witness my transformation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I saw nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I totally blacked out the last few minutes. Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Yeah. Even Fujimaru says so,<br> so why don&#39;t you cheer up?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I apologize for messing up the plan.<br> Very sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even Touta apologized.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go out for a meal once we&#39;re all done.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well... If you insist, my dear Anchin...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> (Gasp!) (This is my moment in the spotlight.<br> It&#39;s time for Kiyohime to shine!)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> (It&#39;s time to monopolize Master&#39;s burning gaze!)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ahem... Your fighting was truly impressive.<br> I&#39;m sorry if it looked like I was testing you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Actually, I was here on this bridge because I was waiting for a strong individual like you to come.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> (Good save.)<br> Oh? And who exactly are you?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I am a dragon deity who has lived in this lake of Oumi for years.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I see. I knew you were a metamorphing being, but I didn&#39;t expect you to be a dragon deity. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t kill you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Recently, a giant centipede that lives in Mt. Mikami have been wrecking havoc on the neighboring village.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It would have been ignored had it only hunted down wild beasts, but now it has begun to prey on livestock and even on my own kind.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That giant centipede is nothing but a headache to us.<br> I ask of you: Would you slay this wicked beast?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> You may call it a giant, but a centipede is still just a bug. Squashing it should be easy. I&#39;ll head over to Mt. Mikami and slay that thing in no time flat.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> At the request of the dragon deity,<br> I headed to Mt. Mikami right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? Right away?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I heard the centipede was huge beyond all imagining,<br> I would take time to plan before I went...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> If one had a cool head, yes, that would have been the logical move. But for some reason, I was riled up.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hm. It must have been because the battle against the dragon deity was so intense. I&#39;d pretty much put all of this at her feet, really!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Either way, I had also forgotten that I only had three arrows in my possession.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you faced a great monster that overwhelmed even the dragon deity...with just three arrows!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!<br> Something&#39;s coming toward us!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> It&#39;s here! The giant centipede of Mt. Mikami has finally made its appearance!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Crap! The Genji!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh...why are they connected like a train?</p><hr><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t replicate a giant centipede, but I wanted to create something that would frighten someone to their core with just a single glance.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> And, well, those three fit the bill. So, I asked them to consent to being put in the bizarre position of forming a centipede like this.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> ...Yes. We are lined up holding a jump rope, and we are running in unison. We look like a group of children at play, and so it is a bit embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But if Lord Tawara Touta is requesting this,<br> we cannot refuse.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I am a little conflicted about playing a demonic role...but I shall become a centipede for Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And if this be entertainment for Master&#39;s enjoyment...then tonight, the three of us shall play the part the very best we can!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s good for &#39;ol Raikou to act like a kid sometimes! Can&#39;t be a general all the time!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> And so...lemme hear some NOISE for Minamoto Tribe feat. the Golden Genji Power Train! YEEEAH!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hm. I was the one who planned all this, but it&#39;s actually still a terrifying sight. We went too far.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Lord Raikou is especially...scary.<br> She&#39;s not really getting the whole \u201Cplay\u201D aspect of this.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> (Don&#39;t tell me... Did she not have any friends to play with during her youth...?)</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> (No, no. I should leave that alone.<br> Nothing good would come of it!)</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Okay! Now let me show you some proper monster slaying! Come on Fujimaru, let&#39;s enjoy this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Uh, just to clarify...we agreed that I would \u201Cwin\u201D the moment my arrow hits Lady Raikou&#39;s headpiece, correct?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Of course. That is, IF the arrow manages to get around my sword and hit the target.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hm. This may prove to be more difficult than the actual slaying of the giant centipede! Ha!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Halt! As long as I&#39;m around, your arrows will never reach Lady Raikou!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Heh. That&#39;s some big talk. But hey, if you have that covered, I&#39;ll focus on ATTACKING! Ha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Leave the frontline defense to us!<br> Touta, please focus on getting Raikou off our back!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just get her from here.<br> Mash, hold your position!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...but...</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Right there is fine...the angle and position of your shield are perfect!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh? Where the heck is that Tawara fella aiming at?<br> He&#39;s not the one for make-or-break moves\u2013</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Seriously? He ricocheted against Mash&#39;s shield and managed to hit Boss&#39;s headpiece!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s one thing to do it with bullets,<br> but that just ain&#39;t how arrows work!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Rather than reflecting the arrow, he actually corrected the arrow&#39;s course... What a fantastic demonstration of his superior skill, even with only a single arrow!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Well, Mash also mentioned she was getting the hang of using her shield, so I knew it would work.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> And that Round Table shield of yours is pretty impressive. To see it just deflect my strongest shot... Man, I might lose confidence in my abilities!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not true, Lord Tawara... The sensation of the arrow flying by was like a wave in the air itself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And when it hit my shield, well, there was no doubt in my mind that you could shoot down even a god!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (But...as skilled as it is,<br> how come he usually throws bales of rice?)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Phew. So the theatrical recreation of the giant centipede battle has ended. It was an honor to have witnessed the Great Hachiman Bodhisattva move there.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Yes. An intentional miss resulting in hitting the target. This is truly what you call a bull&#39;s-eye.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Wonderful, Lord Tawara. The stories of your valor I heard in my youth were indeed true.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing. All I did was catch everyone off guard. I would never be able to do that a second time. More importantly, my compliments to the head of the Genji. Now that it&#39;s over, I&#39;m trembling.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Had I missed, you would have rushed in and lopped my head off in one stroke, am I right?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Oh my.<br> Whatever do you mean, Lord Tawara?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Even if you were correct, I am sure you would have easily repelled the attack!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Uh...yeah, let&#39;s go with that, and leave it there!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> To think even my trembling would get a reenactment...<br> I didn&#39;t expect something like that to happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your body trembling... Was it really that terrifying?<br> Even though you fought so valiantly?</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Of course I was scared. Even I could be spooked by things that frightening!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> To realize after the fact that one fought a great demonic insect that would devour even the gods...there&#39;s no way one would NOT be scared.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But that was the last thing on my mind back then. After all, I was blessed by one like a heavenly maiden.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> I was so focused and fired up, I could have risen to the heavens. Motivation surpassed any fear I had.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> After all, adventure and lethal battles are for the young. It was a good experience for me.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Dauntless, yet brisk... I suppose if it wasn&#39;t for that kind of characteristic, the dragon deity wouldn&#39;t have asked for your help.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Totally. Ya just gotta wait until god-devouring insects pass by on its own. Yet to get rid of it with just some dinky arrows...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But as you can see, boss Tawara ain&#39;t someone who brags, but you saw that he&#39;s a super scary monster killer if he gets serious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> After all, that Masa...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Ahem. Kintoki, my dear, I cannot walk.<br> Perhaps it was because I hit my head.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Would you mind carrying your mother?<br> I hear that the cafeteria has breakfast ready for us.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure everyone is hungry after this battle.<br> How about we all head over for a meal?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tons of Tawara-brand rice balls, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Sounds good!<br> I love rice balls!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have a breakfast buffet, Master! Knowing boss Tawara, he&#39;ll prepare tons of seafood dishes too!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I shall accompany you as well. Soup made from fish scraps does indeed sound appetizing.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Hahaha! You guys are all too much!<br> Putting in orders already!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> But that&#39;s how it should be. A good meal is better than battle anytime. That&#39;s the way of the world!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> Fujimaru and Mash, that&#39;s the end of my giant centipede story.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong><br> If you&#39;re satisfied, then I&#39;m satisfied.<br> Now, let&#39;s all eat together!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Thank you for the meal, Touta!</p>', 200);
