A man of broad-mindedness who does not care very much about trivial matters. Often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Sincere and humane. To a companion judged to be trustworthy, Fergus has the tolerance to show and share his heaps of generosity with that companion no matter what, even if it happens to be their first meeting. However, he never permits betrayal, and he will not forgive one who does it, even if they are a king. He always keeps the promises he exchanges.</p><p>In addition, on the occasion of the \u201CT\xE1in B\xF3 C\xFAailnge\u201D, referred to as the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle in Celtic Mythology, when Fergus and C\xFA Chulainn crossed blades in earnest, mostly every other Ulster men had completely ceased into inactivity already due to a curse, so with that being the case (as in the first place, this war itself was also something that began due to Queen Medb\u2019s selfishness), during the time they clashed with each other, Fergus promised to C\xFA Chulainn that he will ease up to a degree in order to not go too far in killing his defenseless former allies, and he displayed to others the fulfillment of his promises sincerely.</p><p>Although he is known as Medb\u2019s lover, Fergus has a legitimate wife too. Moreover, she is a Goddess of the Forests. Fergus usually wears a composed face, but frankly, there is a hidden peerlessness behind it. His sexual desire is excessively too full of vigour, so much that if it was the common woman, that aspect of his needed seven women in a single night to become satisfied, and it is said that only Medb and his wife \u201Ccan either be, surprisingly enough, just that one person that was okay\u201D for his satisfaction.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Fergus comes into contact with the Master as a \u201Ccomrade-in-arms\u201D. His awareness of the relationship between master and servant is very thin. He recognizes them as a comrade in the conflict called \u2018The Quest for the Holy Grail\u2018, as well as a commanding officer that he should trust. If C\xFA Chulainn is \u201Ca reliable elder brother\u201D, Fergus has numerous words and deeds typical of \u201Ca reliable uncle\u201D.</p><p>The wish Fergus wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cto once again \u201Cget along\u201D with his wife and Medb together.\u201D Get along.

The friend and foster father of C\xFA Chulainn. A great glutton who is viewed as one with matchless vigour[2], often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Even now, the fame of the Hero Fergus as a magnificent brave warrior is being left behind in posterity.</p><p>There is also a legend where Fergus was the King of Ulster from the previous generation. According to that, it is said he had temporarily handed over the throne to Conchobar under the condition that Conchobar\u2019s beautiful mother was made into his lover, but Conchobar\u2019s mother, who was overflowing with sinister designs, left Fergus out of the kingship permanently with those designs.</p><p>Fergus was formerly a man who established a corner of the Red Branch Knights, but he ran away from the order of knights out of rage at the betrayal of Ulster King Conchobar. During the time when the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle broke out, Fergus took the side of his lover, Queen Medb of Connacht, and displayed his valour. Because C\xFA Chulainn stayed with Ulster, Fergus was kept from demonstrating his true seriousness in battle, but he still had once reached the point where he was one breath away from slaying King Conchobar.</p><p>Due to the pledge (Geis) exchanged with C\xFA Chulainn at the occasion of this battle, Fergus will almost unconditionally win against C\xFA Chulainn in the situation where a rematch is done with him. At the time of the second Ulster invasion, because Queen Medb was scheming her revenge against C\xFA Chulainn, she concluded that \u201CFergus\u2019 existence will be a nuisance\u201D, and she did not invite Fergus to the battlefield. Afterwards, Fergus was assassinated by the hands of a jealousy-driven King Ailill, Medb\u2019s husband.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn</strong></p><p>His adopted son and friend.

So, Fergus holds a thought of \u2018Hey, I want to request you for the night\u2019, but he understands that it is impossible.</p><p><strong>Beautiful Female Servants</strong></p><p>Fergus basically does not want to speak words and do deeds that will appear to disturb his position as the uncle who will become reliable for others, but towards adult women, the indication of \u201CI want to request you as my companion for the night\u201D is oozing. Given that children are targets of protection, he does not have much of an interest in those with an outward appearance of the very young-looking type.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Since Fergus had a minor specification in relation to his face and figure, it resulted in the present impression where he does not become puzzled much. They are very easy to draw. His eyes, I mean. His equipment had been proceeding with a design similar to C\xFA Chulainn (Prototype)\u2019s at first, but when I sent in a scribble of him wearing a western school uniform in the middle of the process, it grew into a discussion of \u2018Let\u2019s have him wear something where he\u2019s like the leader of a group of juvenile delinquents\u2019, and it settled down into the current design. It got to now where I cannot come up with anything for his figure except for this half-naked style, huh?
