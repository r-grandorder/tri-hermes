One of the three great heroes of the Warring States, It is no exaggeration to say that this personage is the most famous figure in the history of Japan.</p><p>In early years he had been harshly known as the Fool of Owari, or the great fool, but became serious upon inheriting the position of family head and suppressing his brother and crushing the war daimyo \u201CImagawa Yoshimoto\u201D who had been known as a Kaidouuchi no Yumitori (1) with a somewhat desperate surprise attack. He then jumped out to the top in the race of unifying the country.</p><p>Afterwards, he completely demonstrated a natural eye for strategy, beat the hell out of the other daimyo in her surroundings, put them under her control and well extended her influence, and finally proceeded to the capital. After taking it as an easy game and putting on the composure that the warring state period is laughably complacent, as everyone would know, he would then meet her death at the age of 49 at Honnouji, just one step awaw from the unification of the whole country. The figure who unexpectedly embodies a man&#39;s life of 50 years.(2)</p><p>In FateGO, as can be seen Nobunaga is a woman. From the beginning, her father Oda Nobuhide had planned on giving the position as the head of family to her brother, Oda Nobukatsu. However, the time being the period of war, Nobukatsu\u2019s caliber was judged to be impossible to protect House of Oda from then on, and so Kipposhi (later known as Nobunaga) who had an unusual hint for greatness despite being a woman was placed as the family head instead. Eh? It\u2019s impossible for women to become the family head? Even the Dragon of Echigo (3) seems to be a woman as well, what\u2019s the problem then!? Don\u2019t underestimate the warring states.</p><p>After inheriting the position of family head, she continued to behave as a male would. But the information regulation on that matter would then be transmitted in the later years as Nobunaga\u2019s eccentricity in her younger days, such as being \u201Cthe Great Fool of Owari\u201D. It can be said that the concealment of Nobunaga\u2019s various amusing episode was that of a woman was thanks to her retainer\u2019s effort of information manipulation.</p><p>\u201CWell, it is inevitable!\u201D</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes</h2><ol><li>Basically a title for Sengoku warlords, usually referring to daimyo of Tokaido</li><li>lyrics of Atsumori, said to be Nobunaga\u2019s favorite song</li><li>aka Uesugi Kenshin.
