But still...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I understand.</p><p>If the Holy Grail is what Gilgamesh says it is, it should not exist in this world.&quot;</p><p>She kills her wish and assents.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right!&quot;</p><p>I get up and head to the kitchen.</p><p>I put on the apron.</p><p>I tie it behind my back and roll up my sleeves.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What? Did you come up with a good idea?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? No, I&#39;m just going to make something. You two are hungry, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I ignore the astonished party and start preparing dinner.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s all decided. Now, we just need to act like always.</p><p>We&#39;ll eat dinner together and go beat him after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>I take out a bowl and a frying pan.</p><p>I&#39;ll use everything I have in the refrigerator.</p><p>I&#39;ll forget about everything tonight. I&#39;ll make a delicious feast.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You are right. Let us eat dinner like always. That suits us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Then I guess I&#39;ll help as well. Oh, Saber. Can you go prepare the bath?&quot;</p><hr><p>The serious atmosphere disappears like that.</p><p>The living room suddenly becomes more lively.</p><p>This will be the last night with the three of us.</p><p>We&#39;re doing our best to keep it like always and to have a good dinner.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>After eating dinner consisting of Western, Chinese, and Japanese food, we start the customary strategy meeting.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you are saying the Holy Grail is at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. I guessed that the Ryuudou Temple would be the summoning spot this time. I was using a familiar to spy on that place, but it was eliminated just a bit earlier. I&#39;m sure that the goldie is there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ryuudou Temple... That is troublesome.</p><p>We can only enter that mountain through the front gate. Gilgamesh should be waiting for us there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But on the other hand, it&#39;s easier on us because we know where he is.</p><p>He&#39;s troublesome, but stopping the summoning of the Holy Grail takes priority.</p><p>It would be ideal if we can destroy the Holy Grail while Saber keeps him busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. Isn&#39;t Saber the only one who can destroy the Holy Grail? We can&#39;t touch it, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. We can&#39;t destroy the summoned Holy Grail. But we can destroy the vessel before it&#39;s summoned.</p><p>To be more precise, we&#39;re stopping the Holy Grail before it&#39;s activated.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? What do you mean by stopping the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I really don&#39;t want to think about it, but from what I heard, the Holy Grail is Illyasviel&#39;s heart, right?</p><p>But I think the Holy Grail is a set with Illyasviel&#39;s body, her Magic Circuit.</p><p>He didn&#39;t want Illyasviel to be the Holy Grail, so he pulled out the core of it, her heart.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......So.</p><p>He has to implant the heart into a magus&#39;s body to activate it as the Holy Grail. There are only two remaining Masters: me, and one other.</p><p>Since I&#39;m here, the one he will choose to be the foundation of the Holy Grail is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji...!? But Shinji, um...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t have a Magic Circuit, right? ...I bet he doesn&#39;t care.</p><p>He wants to make an incomplete Holy Grail, so I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll implant it into an incomplete Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Even if its bloodline is extinct, the Matou family has hereditary traces of magecraft-Circuits.</p><p>Even a closed circuit will be forced to open if something like a nuclear fusion reactor is implanted into him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Then that would mean we&#39;ll have to detach the Holy Grail from Shinji, huh?</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it means to be the Holy Grail&#39;s foundation, but, if possible, we&#39;ll have to stop it.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I do not think Gilgamesh will allow that.</p><p>Does it not mean that stopping the Holy Grail is to defeat Gilgamesh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. It&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s protecting the Holy Grail, so we have to do something about him first.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I think he&#39;s waiting for us at the mountain gate. The only route we have is the mountain gate because our greatest force, Saber, can only enter through there.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.</p><p>I will rush the mountain gate by myself.</p><p>Rin and Shirou will sneak into the Ryuudou Temple from the back while I do so.</p><p>The boundary field on the Ryuudou Temple is meaningless for you two.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Exactly. ...You will need to give your absolute best, but just keep him busy. We&#39;ll come help you as soon as we stop the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hold on. That&#39;s reckless. Saber won&#39;t be a match for him.</p><p>She can&#39;t keep him busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? What? You seem to think pretty highly of him, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;True. He is a strong enemy, but I will not lose easily if I go into defense.</p><p>Please tell me what that opinion is based on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not what I meant. From what I see, Saber&#39;s stronger than him.</p><p>I&#39;m sure of it. I&#39;ll bet on it too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Then why are you saying that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You can&#39;t beat him as long as you&#39;re a heroic spirit.</p><p>...Yeah, Saber won&#39;t lose if he only had the same Noble Phantasm as Saber. We don&#39;t even need to compare the two&#39;s skills as swordsmen.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But his power isn&#39;t power as an &#39;individual&#39;. A soldier can&#39;t beat war itself no matter how strong he is, right?</p><p>He&#39;s a heroic spirit of that kind. You&#39;ll be defeated unless you&#39;re a &#39;war&#39; just like him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? ...So you are telling me that my attributes are not fit to fight him?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Tohsaka, we can&#39;t let Saber fight him without a plan. There&#39;s no way she can win unless we have some sort of a countermeasure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey... I know that already.</p><p>That&#39;s why we&#39;re going to think about it now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. Then you have a plan, Rin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. I won&#39;t conveniently come up with an idea in a flash.</p><p>His Noble Phantasm is a war, like Shirou said.</p><p>The outcome of a war is decided by how much force you have, right? It&#39;s not how well you can handle the weapon. It&#39;s how much force you can prepare\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? What&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka? Why did you shut up all of a sudden?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s why he treated you like an enemy. Since the heroic spirit doesn&#39;t have his own Noble Phantasm, there is no original. Oh... wait. That means...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Rin? What is wrong? Why are you behind me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-It&#39;s nothing...! I&#39;m going to think, so just talk it over with just the two of you...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Saber and I look at each other.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;ll leave her alone if she has an idea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then I should avoid fighting Archer one-on-one, correct?</p><p>But I have backup from Rin.</p><p>I can use my Noble Phantasm with her support. I believe there is a chance of beating him before he can use his Noble Phantasm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Your Noble Phantasm...? Not Invisible Air?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Invisible Air is only a sheath.</p><p>I can use my holy sword if Rin allows it.</p><p>This is the sword that previously destroyed the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Then it&#39;ll all be up to Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. There will be a big burden on me as well as Rin if I use it. I will probably use up most of her magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Did you hear that, Tohsaka? How much magical energy can you spare?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;M-Magical energy I can spare? How do you know what I&#39;m thinking about...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...N-No, it&#39;s nothing. I told you to leave me alone. I know about Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>She should be able to use it twice with our magical energy.</p><p>We&#39;re going to use it once against the Holy Grail, so you can only use it once against Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Um, Saber. That&#39;s what Tohsaka&#39;s saying, so what do you think?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I do not know. If Archer has every existing Noble Phantasm, he should have one that can equal mine. After that, it depends on whose is stronger.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So it&#39;s going to end up being a fight between the Noble Phantasms, huh?&quot;</p><p>...Then Gilgamesh is likely to win.</p><p>I can&#39;t let Saber fight such a hopeless battle\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>Man, I can&#39;t think!</p><p>She&#39;s been acting strange.</p><p>Why does she keep on looking at me like that?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. Come out with it if you want to say something. You have an idea, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I-I don&#39;t have an idea! I can&#39;t say such a thing here, you idiot!&quot;</p><hr><p>She yells at me and looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing. She&#39;s acting weird, so let&#39;s ignore her and keep planning.&quot;</p><hr><p>We continue with the strategy meeting with just the two of us.</p><p>...But as our &quot;brain&quot;, Tohsaka, won&#39;t talk, we can&#39;t come up with anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015We can go with the previous plan if you guys can&#39;t come up with anything.</p><p>We&#39;ll head out before dawn. Everybody is to rest until then.&quot;</p><p>Our course of action is decided by Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Some time passed after that.</p><p>It&#39;s almost midnight.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka told me I should take a nap, but I can&#39;t sleep in a situation like this.</p><p>We&#39;re going to settle our score with that Servant in a few hours.</p><p>Since we are heading out before dawn, everything should be over by the time the sun rises.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t just lay here and not do anything.</p><p>I\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-05" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 05</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. I can&#39;t sleep in this situation.&quot;</p><p>A plan against Gilgamesh.</p><p>If we are to fight that cold-hearted enemy, I&#39;ll have to come up with some plan.</p><hr><p>Someone will die if we head to the Ryuudou Temple as we are now.</p><p>Compared to that, thinking until the very last minute is nothing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you awake, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>I knock on her door.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! H-Hold on! Don&#39;t come in!&quot;</p><p>......Hm.</p><p>I thought Tohsaka would be sleeping, but I guess she&#39;s still awake.</p><hr><p>More importantly, she&#39;s in a panic.</p><p>After a few minutes of rustling sounds...</p><p>She must have calmed down.</p><p>After taking a breath I can hear even outside, Tohsaka opens the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me as soon as she sees me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I want to continue our conversation from earlier. I want to keep talking about how to fight Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>......Wait.</p><p>Why are you glaring at me?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?&quot;</p><p>I ask the obvious.</p><p>OF COURSE!</p><p>That&#39;s the obvious response she&#39;s going to give, but I have to ask.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. That&#39;s not true.&quot;</p><p>She gives a strange response.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Are you sick or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! ...Geez, just sit down!</p><p>I&#39;m going to give you a plan to beat Gilgamesh since you can&#39;t come up with any!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka pulls me inside, locks the door, and walks to the back of the room.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I move to the center of the room for now.</p><p>I sit down on the cushion and face Tohsaka, who is sitting in a chair.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>And an awkward silence follows.</p><p>Tohsaka is silent even though she&#39;s the one with the plan.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. About Gilgamesh...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I know. You don&#39;t want Saber fighting him, right? You&#39;re especially kind to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not the point here.</p><p>I&#39;m saying that we should switch the roles since Saber won&#39;t fare well against Gilgamesh. If Saber is defeated, you&#39;ll be his next target.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. You say switch roles, so what are you thinking?</p><p>I&#39;m going to pass. That goldie used his riches to collect all the magecraft-resistant equipment in the world.</p><p>I&#39;ll do much worse than Saber. That should be the same for you as well, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s... true, but...</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t get those eyes out of my head.</p><p>Archer definitely told me this.</p><p>That the golden Servant...</p><p>That only Emiya Shirou can match Gilgamesh.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06</h2><p>I&#39;ll go talk to Saber.</p><p>...Even if we&#39;re able to defeat Gilgamesh, Saber will leave once the war ends.</p><p>Saber will destroy the Holy Grail herself and be relieved of her duty as a Servant.</p><p>I won&#39;t be able to see her ever again.</p><hr><p>...A last conversation.</p><p>I want to save something between us before we go into our final battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou? Why are you here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I just felt like coming to see you. Oh, am I a bother? Were you meditating in preparation for the battle?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015n-no. That is not true.</p><p>I am happy since I wanted to see you as well, but... Um, I thought you went to Rin&#39;s room.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Why would I go to Tohsaka&#39;s room? She didn&#39;t call for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You are right. Please do not worry about it since it was just my imagination.</p><p>I-I thought that would be for the better, but I guess that was my concern.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;???&quot;</p><p>Saber is acting even weirder.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know why, but I guess she&#39;ll blush even more if I let her be.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Saber? You&#39;re acting weird.</p><p>Did something happen?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I am not acting weird! I am merely resting in preparation for the battle.</p><p>But what about you, Shirou? I thought you were going to sleep so that you can go to the Ryuudou Temple in perfect condition.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm.&quot;</p><p>If she asks me like that, I can&#39;t tell her it&#39;s because I wanted to see her face.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t tell her, so...</p><p>&quot;...Hm, I couldn&#39;t sleep either. I just thought I&#39;d drink tea with you since I&#39;m awake.</p><p>I think Tohsaka&#39;s busy, you know?&quot;</p><p>I come up with an excuse on a whim.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tea...? Even though we will be fighting the king of heroes in a few hours?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. We can&#39;t rest because we&#39;re so tensed up, right?</p><p>Then have tea with me. I&#39;ll make you the best tea.&quot;</p><p>I invite Saber by force.</p><p>My face is all red and it&#39;s embarrassing, but I want to drink tea with Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It will be my pleasure to have tea with you, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods kindly.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015If it&#39;s decided, I should hurry up.</p><p>I&#39;ll go to the kitchen, brew the Chinese tea I bought for a special occasion, and I&#39;ll treat Saber\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>We didn&#39;t do anything but drink the tea.</p><p>We didn&#39;t talk, not even a single word.</p><p>We just absent-mindedly stared at the dojo.</p><p>We watched the wooden floor we used to train on.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Please go see Rin. Knowing her, I am sure she has her new idea thought out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, really? I guess I&#39;ll go if you say so.&quot;</p><p>I get up and leave the dojo.</p><hr><p>&quot;I shall see you later, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m gonna go check on your foul-tempered Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>I leave the dojo while Saber sees me off.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That ends our final time together.</p><p>I didn&#39;t leave anything definite.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t make any sure promise, no sensations I would be able to recall, no proof at all of Saber&#39;s existence.</p><hr><p>...But I think this is right.</p><p>What&#39;s left are memories that fade away.</p><p>So I&#39;ll cherish this trifling event and hold it strong in my heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Are you awake, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>I knock on the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m awake. Don&#39;t you have to sleep? I thought you were talking to Saber in the dojo until a minute ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, were you watching?</p><p>...I see, you can see the dojo from your room.</p><p>You should&#39;ve come, Tohsaka. It would&#39;ve been better to have tea with the three of us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............That&#39;s fine.</p><p>............That&#39;s not fine at all.</p><p>Well, come on in. I was about to go talk to you anyways.&quot;</p><p>Hmm. Those are surprisingly biting words.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. Excuse me.&quot;</p><p>I tilt my head in wonder as I enter her room.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess you&#39;re pretty calm. What were you doing with Saber?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me the instant I see her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I was only drinking tea with her.</p><p>We can&#39;t be training when we&#39;re going to be fighting soon. I can&#39;t use up extra energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Extra energy\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015y-you&#39;re right. We can&#39;t be using extra energy.&quot;</p><p>...Wait.</p><p>Why did she become so quiet?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?&quot;</p><p>I ask the obvious.</p><p>OF COURSE!</p><p>That&#39;s the obvious response she&#39;s going to give, but I have to ask.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. That&#39;s not true.&quot;</p><p>She gives a strange response.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka.

If Saber is defeated, you&#39;ll be his next target.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. You say switch roles, so what are you thinking?</p><p>I&#39;m going to pass. That goldie used his riches to collect all the magecraft-resistant equipment in the world.</p><p>I&#39;ll do much worse than Saber.

I don&#39;t know who told you that, but you&#39;re right.</p><p>What makes Gilgamesh so strong is the number of Noble Phantasms he has. But to put it another way, one can match him if one has the same number of Noble Phantasms.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The same number of Noble Phantasms...&quot;</p><p>It means I need to reproduce all the Noble Phantasms he takes out.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right.

The Reality Marble is the ultimate forbidden magecraft. I don&#39;t know how to use it, and Archer used magical energy several times my capacity to create that world. That&#39;s totally impossible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I know it&#39;s impossible.</p><p>But you should know how to use it because all your magecraft is rooted in that.</p><p>&#39;Strengthening&#39; and &#39;projection&#39; both stem from your Reality Marble.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a piece of cake once you have the necessary magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s talking about impossible things.</p><p>I have no way to do it, so this is more impossible than for me to go to the moon.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Okay. Let&#39;s say that&#39;s the case. But it&#39;s still impossible.

He did say something like that, but what about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Geez! ...So, um, I have to do something about the insufficient part.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka blushes furiously, her voice trailing off to a whisper.</p><hr><p>&quot;W\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I know.</p><p>I&#39;m a magus, even if I may be an amateur.</p><p>I know what Tohsaka just said.</p><hr><p>&quot;T\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Tohsaka, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...There are only a few ways for magi to tune in, right?

It&#39;s reassuring to know that you&#39;ll be watching me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I am glad you are like that, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>She smiles back.</p><p>We&#39;re prepared for departure now.</p><hr><p>We leave my house.</p><p>Who would have thought I would go to that castle again?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey. You guys aren&#39;t listening to me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>We both turn around.</p><hr><p>...Oh.</p><p>Come to think of it, Lancer was still here.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. You have more free time than I thought, huh?&quot;</p><p>It just slips out.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>He must be self-conscious, as he doesn&#39;t try to retort.</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer. I do not know what you are planning, but there is nothing to gain from following us.</p><p>Archer is a Servant without a Master.</p><p>I do not think your Master would want to defeat such a person.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know, I know. I have no intention of fighting Archer. You can rest assured that I won&#39;t butt in on the fight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then why are you going to come with us? If you want to settle the match with me, I can do it right here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I&#39;ll pass on that. I have no intention of fighting against your Master. Rather, I want to sell her some favors. I want her to be in debt to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Saber glares at Lancer,</p><p>and Lancer ignores her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay, do as you wish. We can use all the help we can get in saving Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou...! Lancer is an enemy. You cannot make such a rash decision\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That should be all right. He&#39;s twisted, but he won&#39;t lie. First of all, he&#39;s not the sneaky type. He&#39;d come fight us straight on before he would try to trick us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm... That is true, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll turn him down if you don&#39;t want to. But he&#39;ll follow us even if we let him be. So isn&#39;t it easier for us to have him near us where we can keep watch?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015you are getting better at making excuses, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, a lot has happened.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s it, Lancer. We won&#39;t concern ourselves with you, and you don&#39;t bother us. Let&#39;s go together if that&#39;s fine with you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I say to the guy that&#39;s watching us with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good enough. Wow, you guys are a great combination.</p><p>Saber&#39;s stubborn, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re more mature now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That is not true! Shirou is the stubborn one. You do not know how much trouble I have been through!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What?</p><p>Are you going to tell me if I ask? Fine, we have some time until we get to the castle. Let&#39;s entertain ourselves on the road with your stories.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015! W-Why do I need to explain such a thing to you? You have nothing to do with this!&quot;</p><p>Saber roars at Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Wow.&quot;</p><p>I guess Saber doesn&#39;t get along well with Lancer.</p><p>But I never thought Saber would get angry like Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh well.</p><p>Let&#39;s get going. We don&#39;t have time to be playing around. We have to get to the castle as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>I leave the two and start walking.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shirou...! I am not playing around!&quot;</p><p>She must still be mad, as she yells at me.</p><p>Lancer follows us from a distance.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s midnight right now.</p><p>I know how far the castle is from here.</p><p>We should make it in time.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015We&#39;ll probably get there around dawn.</p><p>We start to walk to the masterless old castle.</p>', 3349);
