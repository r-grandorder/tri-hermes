(Her throat and tongue were crushed during her time working at the red-light district. Even when she was reborn, her tongue did not heal.) By the compassion of Jiz\u014D Boddhisatva[5] , she was reborn as an oni of hell (and losing her memories from her time as a human), became the adopted daughter of Datsue-ba at the Sanzu River and worked hard.</p><p>The news of her achievements have reached King Enma&#39;s ears and she officially became his adopted daughter.<br> She apprenticed under the Great King Enma to become a judge, and later, in recognition of her merits, she was left with the management of the &quot;Mayoiga&quot;[6] on the surface.</p><p>Benienma renamed the &quot;Mayoiga&quot; to &quot;the place where gods can relax&quot;...in other words, &quot;The Sparrow&#39;s Inn&quot;, became friends with the sparrows who lived there originally and turned it into a business.</p><p>However, during this, for no reason whatsoever, Benienma started yearning after a human village (as an afterglow of the memories of her previous life), and when she descended the mountains to visit it, she was captured by a greedy old woman.</p><p>Benienma was cowering in fear due to the trauma from her previous life that had been forgotten, but she was saved from her predicament by a &quot;kind old man&quot; who was treated as an oddball in the village.</p><p>The old man used most of his assets to get Benienma from the old woman and immediately returned her to the mountains. That was something Benienma has experienced for the first time, but has been looking for all her life: &quot;the goodness of humanity&quot;.</p><p>A few years later. Feeling lonely by himself, the old man set off for the mountains. Hearing of this, Benienma wouldn&#39;t overlook such a thing and invited the old man to the &quot;Sparrow&#39;s Inn&quot; where he was entertained.</p><p>(The fact that she couldn&#39;t make anything that suited the old man&#39;s palate during this time is what turned her into an Iron Chef later on.)</p><p>Benienma wanted the old man to stay forever, but he chose to return to the village.</p><p>&quot;Even if you obtain good luck, you must not monopolize it.&quot;</p><p>Even if he was poor, the old man was aware of such an obvious thing.</p><p>As a small repayment for his kindness, Benienma gave the old man who was leaving the Sparrow&#39;s Inn a souvenir.</p><p>&quot;A large and a small wicker basket. If you don&#39;t bring either one with you, you won&#39;t be able to return to human habitation.&quot;</p><p>And thus, picking the &quot;small wicker basket&quot;, the old man left the Sparrow&#39;s Inn.</p><p>After the old man left, Benienma reaffirmed the goodness of humanity, and decided on the policy of instructing herself as &quot;a good human&quot;.</p><p>In the world of FGO, this anecdote is treated as the basis for the &quot;Tongue-Cut Sparrow&quot;.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Originally, she shouldn&#39;t have been summoned as a Heroic Spirit, but she was transformed into a Servant as the model of Japanese fairy tales and as the &quot;representative that accepts the wishes of children&quot;.</p><p>Since her tongue was cut out back when she worked as the young servant of a courtesan, even after she became an oni, her tongue remained cut due to this trauma and she couldn&#39;t use it properly. She also lost most of her sense of taste.</p><p>For the sake of making delicious dishes for the old man, Benienma became an expert cook by observing the distribution of nutrients and how the humans who ate her food reacted to it, instead of depending on her own sense of taste.</p><p>Her notes on how people reacted to her dishes are gathered in proprietress Beni&#39;s secret notebook, that is, her &quot;Notebook of Enma&quot;.</p><p>Her study notes concerning flavour. Rather than something like a recipe, it&#39;s something that determines the conclusion of the seasoning based on the reaction of humans. &quot;If you get this reaction, this person prefers this flavour.&quot;</p><p>It seems like her cooking skills became famous among Divine Spirits, and before long, she started holding periodic cooking classes in the Throne of Heroes in response to the demands of the Japanese Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Due to having cooking skills being drilled into one with the severity of Hell itself here, it started being referred to as Hell&#39;s Kitchen.</p><p>The tiny cooking teacher is a demonic instructor.
