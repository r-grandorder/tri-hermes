Hop on!</p><p>Romani:<br> Time to start the operation!</p><p>Romani:<br> Be careful, both of you!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> It&#39;s roughly 20 kilometers to the center of the temple, where we think Solomon is hiding.</p><p>Mash:<br> There isn&#39;t any interference from enemy forces for now.</p><p>Romani:<br> Yeah.

Emotionless!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Such a man could not have possessed an ordinary wish!</p><p>Romani:<br> Hearing that from you really stings.</p><p>Romani:<br> You hate me a little too much.</p><p>Romani:<br> Anyway, Solomon&#39;s wish was granted.</p><p>Romani:<br> But there was a problem.</p><p>Romani:<br> Solomon possessed the skill Clairvoyance. In fact, his was so potent that it was essentially omniscience.</p><p>Romani:<br> When he became human, he lost all those powers.</p><p>Romani:<br> That wasn&#39;t a big problem on its own, but... just before his power left him, he saw it.</p><p>Romani:<br> The end of mankind.</p><p>Romani:<br> But who? How? For what purpose?</p><p>Romani:<br> And how could it be prevented?</p><p>Romani:<br> He lost power of knowing those.</p><p>Romani:<br> But he couldn&#39;t just ignore it.</p><p>Romani:<br> And that&#39;s how my journey began.</p><p>Romani:<br> I didn&#39;t know who the enemy was.</p><p>Romani:<br> The only thing I could do was prepare for when the time came.</p><p>Romani:<br> Of course, a few instances of good fortune helped me along the way.</p><p>Romani:<br> The greatest of them was you, Fujimaru.<br> And I don&#39;t just mean on the day we met.</p><p>Romani:<br> During this entire Grand Order, there was never a time you weren&#39;t there to help me.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> What the... You, too, Doctor? What are you\u2014</p><p>Solomon:<br> I am Solomon, the King of Mages.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Goetia...</p><p>Solomon:<br> It is I who shall read you your last rites.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Now that it&#39;s already over, mankind&#39;s greatest fool makes an appearance!</p><p>Solomon:<br> All life must come to an end.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Life is a pilgrimage in which we stockpile suffering.</p><p>Solomon:<br> However, that is by no means a tale of death and partings.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Goetia, shame of my years,<br> Beast born of my corpse...</p><p>Solomon:<br> Here and now, I will pass judgment on your evil with my own hands.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Ha! Don&#39;t make me laugh!</p><p>Goetia:<br> You can&#39;t do anything!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Die! Die!</p><p>Goetia:<br> I will send you to your death with your own Noble Phantasm!</p><p>Solomon:<br> Yeah.</p><p>Solomon:<br> That&#39;s the plan.</p><p>Solomon:<br> I will be extinguished by my own Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Goetia:<br> What?</p><p>Solomon:<br> For a time in the distant future when Magecraft turns into an evil against humans,</p><p>Solomon:<br> Solomon prepared a safety device to destroy it.</p><p>Solomon:<br> That is the True First Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Goetia:<br> What are you talking...</p><p>Solomon:<br> And now, with all the rings here...</p><p>Solomon:<br> Goetia...</p><p>Solomon:<br> You were a spell woven to watch over mankind and in turn, chose to destroy its future.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Let me teach you the final Magecraft.</p><p>Goetia:<br> You don&#39;t mean...</p><p>Goetia:<br> No, that&#39;s impossible!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Stop!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Stop! Stop! Stop!</p><p>Goetia:<br> These rings, the omnipotent seals, are no longer yours alone!</p><p>Solomon:<br> The Time of Birth Hath Come,<br> I Am the Remedy of Eternity.</p><p>Solomon:<br> The Time of Coronation Hath Come,<br> I Am the Beginning of Eternity.</p><p>Solomon:<br> And now...</p><p>Goetia:<br> Stop!</p><p>Solomon:<br> The Time of Parting Hath Come...</p><p>Solomon:<br> I Am He Who Surrenders the World...</p><p>Solomon:<br> Ars Nova.</p><p>Solomon:<br> O Heavenly Father,<br> I return to you your blessings.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Omnipotence is too much for humans to handle.</p><p>Solomon:<br> My work shall be done within the limitations of mankind.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why? Why?</p><p>Goetia:<br> After all this time, are you saying you&#39;re going to save the humans, Solomon?</p><p>Goetia:<br> You, the one who didn&#39;t do anything despite witnessing countless tragedies!</p><p>Solomon:<br> Yeah, it&#39;s strange.</p><p>Solomon:<br> We saw the same things, sat on the same throne and spent the same time together.</p><p>Solomon:<br> But you and I reached completely antithetical conclusions.</p><p>Solomon:<br> If there was a difference between us... it would be...</p><p>Solomon:<br> To put it simply, I just didn&#39;t have the freedom to get mad.</p><p>Goetia:<br> What...</p><p>Solomon:<br> I&#39;ve completely cast aside my position as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>Solomon:<br> But Solomon will disappear from the Throne of Heroes from here on.</p><p>Solomon:<br> With the complete annihilation of Solomon, the King of Mages... the Age of Gods will truly come to an end.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> You&#39;re going to go away?</p><p>Solomon:<br> It&#39;s scary and sad, but it was something only I could do.</p><p>Solomon:<br> And since that&#39;s the case,<br> I have to do it, no matter how painful.</p><p>Solomon:<br> This is the right thing to do.</p><p>Solomon:<br> You and Mash taught me the right thing to do.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Why?</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> That&#39;s so selfish!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> And you didn&#39;t tell us about it the whole time!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Unfair!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Doctor, that&#39;s so unfair!</p><p>Solomon:<br> No, I suppose it isn&#39;t fair.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Sorry. I was inconsiderate right to the end.</p><p>Solomon:<br> But my current self can give a clear answer.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Goetia...</p><p>Solomon:<br> You harbored hatred toward the meaninglessness of life.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Of course, nothing is eternal... and pain awaits us all in the end.</p><p>Solomon:<br> But that doesn&#39;t make life a story of despair. Not at all.</p><p>Solomon:<br> It&#39;s a fight against death and separation in what precious little time one is given.</p><p>Solomon:<br> It&#39;s a repetition of meeting and parting despite knowing there&#39;s an end.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Humans&#39; stories are dazzling, brief journeys, like the twinkling of the stars.</p><p>Solomon:<br> They are... stories of love and hope.</p><p>Solomon:<br> Can I trust you with the rest, Fujimaru?</p><p>Solomon:<br> You, the first and only Master in Chaldea where we spent time together?</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Sure!</p><p>Solomon:<br> Good answer.</p><p>Solomon:<br> You really have matured into a trustworthy Master.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I&#39;m heading out now, Doctor.</p><p>Goetia:<br> You relied on others until the very end.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Your deception will not sway us.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Our great deed remains incomplete but unhindered.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Life should not be bound by death.</p><p>Goetia:<br> A story that must end like that is worthless to me.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Ultimately, I am victorious!</p><p>Goetia:<br> What can a Master with no Servant do?</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I can do this...</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Several millennia passed since the world of Primates was set.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> The Age of Gods has ended, and through time, mankind has become the most prosperous beings on Earth.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> And so we shape the future of this planet and inscribe its history on the surface.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> For that, we nurtured knowledge, produced many resources... and saw countless lives reincarnated.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> It&#39;s a map to prolong mankind&#39;s survival and to ensure its everlasting prosperity!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> In the world of Magecraft, this is called &quot;humanity&quot;!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Those of Chaldea have been charged to protect it!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I am Ritsuka Fujimaru!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> So many people helped me... and here I stand on behalf of so many others... as the Master of Chaldea!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I challenge you...</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Goetia!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Then come at me, Chaldea!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Begone, human history!</p><p>Goetia:<br> We 72 Demon Gods shall grind you to dust!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Just one!<br> You only need to kill one!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why? Why?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why do you fight so hard to protect humanity, Heroic Spirits?</p><p>Goetia:<br> You should be aware that mankind is not worth this effort!</p><p>Goetia:<br> This world is madness!</p><p>Goetia:<br> You are all mad!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why should this all hold such value to you?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Just one!</p><p>Goetia:<br> By killing just one human... everything will be resolved!</p><p>Goetia:<br> And yet... why?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Fine.</p><p>Goetia:<br> It pains me to ask this, but I must know!</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why... do you fight?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why do you not submit to me?</p><p>Goetia:<br> Why do you keep fighting so hard?</p><p>Mash::<br> But please don&#39;t forget this...</p><p>Mash:<br> Many new encounters and many futures...</p><p>Mash:<br> Those were the things... we were fighting for!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> That&#39;s obvious.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> To live!</p><p>Goetia:<br> I see.</p><p>Goetia:<br> So you weren&#39;t even protecting humanity.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Then we were mistaken.</p><p>Goetia:<br> We completely overestimated you.</p><p>Goetia:<br> You longed for life and feared death.</p><p>Goetia:<br> And while fearing death, you defeated us in our quest for eternity.</p><p>Goetia:<br> What hopeless foolishness.</p><p>Goetia:<br> What worthless stubbornness.<br> We need not save you.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I have to get back.</p><p>Gilgamesh:<br> Goetia, the Beast that knew no love.</p><p>Gilgamesh:<br> An Evil of Humanity fueled only by his own grief.<br> One who sought nothingness.</p><p>Gilgamesh:<br> It&#39;s ironic. The Evils of Humanity themselves represent a love for the human race.</p><p>Gilgamesh:<br> Wishing for a better future was the threat.</p><p>Female Chaldea Staff:<br> Destruction of the central area of the temple and life signals in each location have been confirmed!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> In other words?</p><p>Male Chaldea Staff:<br> We have confirmed Beast I is gone and that the Temple of Time is collapsing!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> All right! We&#39;ll immediately raise anchor from this location and withdraw!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> We&#39;ll retrieve Fujimaru as soon as communication returns!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> ...jimaru! Fujimaru!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Can you hear me, Fujimaru?</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> We&#39;ll send you the coordinates!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I&#39;m going back... to Chaldea.</p><p>Goetia:<br> No matter what I do here, now,<br> I cannot redeem my failure.</p><p>Goetia:<br> This is a meaningless battle.</p><p>Goetia:<br> This would have been an unthinkable choice for me before.</p><p>Goetia:<br> But...</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Now you have a reason to fight.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Yes, indeed. I also have my pride.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Or rather, I do now.<br> I now understand... human mentality. Now that I have a limited and mortal life, I finally understand.</p><p>Goetia:<br> It&#39;s been a long journey. So very long.</p><p>Goetia:<br> I have dwelt here for 3,000 years.</p><p>Goetia:<br> I&#39;m going to stop you in order to protect the one thing I cannot possibly relinquish.</p><p>Goetia:<br> And you&#39;re going to stop me as soon as possible so you can return home alive.</p><p>Goetia:<br> O Master who overcame seven Singularities in seven worlds...</p><p>Goetia:<br> Your Grand Order is all about the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p>Goetia:<br> My name is Goetia.</p><p>Goetia:<br> I am the one who used humanity to destroy humanity.</p><p>Goetia:<br> I am born now and I shall perish now.</p><p>Goetia:<br> This battle may be without resolution or reward, but I shall put my entire being on the line to crush you!</p><p>Goetia:<br> My sworn enemy.<br> My hatred. My destiny.</p><p>Goetia:<br> I want you to witness this.</p><p>Goetia:<br> This brief moment is now my story.</p><p>Goetia:<br> This brief but precious time has given the creature called &quot;Goetia&quot; true life.</p><p>Goetia:<br> Tragically short...</p><p>Goetia:<br> So, this is what human life is...</p><p>Goetia:<br> O Lord, may you rejoice in this life.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Dammit. I was so close.</p><p>Mash:<br> Senpai!</p><p>Mash:<br> Senpai!</p><p>Mash:<br> Grab my hand!</p><p>Mash:<br> I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re okay, Senpai.</p><p>Mash:<br> I was worried because you weren&#39;t waking up.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Thanks.</p><p>Fujimaru<br> But Mash, how did you...</p><p>Mash:<br> Well, I really don&#39;t know.</p><p>Mash:<br> Fou, do you know anything?</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Master Fujimaru, Mash...</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> With your safe return, I&#39;m pleased to declare our final Grand Order complete!</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Congratulations on completing your mission!<br> You really did a great job!</p><p>Fujimaru:</p><ul><li>Yes!<br> Mash:</li><li>Yes!</li></ul><p>Da Vinci:<br> Now, we have so many things to do piled up, like communicating with the outside world.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> So, I&#39;d like you two to set up a communication device.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> And go see for yourselves what you two have reclaimed.</p><p>Mash:<br> Okay! Mission received!</p><p>Mash:<br> Let&#39;s go, Senpai!</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Huh? S-Sure.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> A notification to all Chaldea staff.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> As of this moment, the Grand Order has been completed with its objectives met.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> This great feat was possible thanks to all of your efforts.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> We applaud those achievements.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> However, please remember the sacrifices that are in the shadows of such achievements.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Lev Lainur&#39;s assault claimed the lives of two hundred of Chaldea&#39;s staff.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> 47 Masters are still frozen in the preservation chambers.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> And one of our people did not return from the Final Singularity.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Each of those lost is someone who cannot ever be replaced.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> What they wanted to achieve...</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> What they should have achieved...</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> If possible, please give thought to what they were, and carry on their torch.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> We have fought for that purpose.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> They...</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> We all wanted to take back such things as a part of mankind.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> It&#39;s so blue.</p><p>Mash:<br> So, this is the real sky.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> The Earth of our own time.</p><p>Mash:<br> The doctor told me once.</p><p>Mash:<br> He told me it&#39;s always snowing outside Chaldea, but once in a while the skies clear, and you can see the beautiful stars.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> The doctor did?</p><p>Mash:<br> Yes! He also said that one day, the time would come when I&#39;d get to see them for myself.</p><p>Mash:<br> He had no proof but laughed when he told me.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I bet that was what he dreamed would happen.</p><p>Mash:<br> I was able to see this sky, thanks to the help and support of so many people.</p><p>Mash:<br> It was a whirlwind of a year.<br> This Order happened on such a terrifying scale.</p><p>Mash:<br> Still, it&#39;s been a truly incredible experience.</p><p>Mash:<br> What did this journey mean to you, Senpai?</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Let&#39;s see.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> I wasn&#39;t a Mage or anything.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> Just a normal human who just happened to stop by Chaldea.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> But I&#39;ve done everything I could as a Master.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> To the point where I don&#39;t want to forget anything about this journey, about this life.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> So, I hope you&#39;ll still have my back, Mash.</p><p>Fujimaru:<br> It seems I still have things<br> I can do as a Master.</p><p>Mash:<br> Yes! Rest assured, my Master!</p><p>Mash:<br> So, our journey will still continue.</p><p>Mash:<br> And to start, we&#39;ll go beyond the horizon ahead.</p><p>Mash:<br> Once we&#39;ve done that, we&#39;ll go further and further beyond.</p><p>Mash:<br> That is our...</p><p>Mash:<br> Or rather, human nature&#39;s order.</p><p>Mash:<br> All that worrying and lamenting about the future...</p><p>Mash:<br> It was because we had hope.</p><p>Mash:<br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m sure there are many more adventures lying ahead of us.</p><p>Mash:<br> Let&#39;s go toward that new year where the unknown awaits us!</p><p>--Song--</p><p>Fou:<br> Goodbye, Mash Kyrielight.<br> My time with all of you, this journey, has been truly wonderful.</p><p>Fou:<br> When the Mage sent me out, he told me,<br> &quot;Go, experience all the beauty this world has to offer.&quot;<br> And, well... I have seen truly beautiful things.</p><p>Fou:<br> There are some evils that can be defeated without shedding blood or crossing blades.<br> That is what has made this possible.<br> Congratulations to you, the wonderful people of Chaldea.<br> You have defeated Beast IV without so much as a single blow.</p><p>Fou:<br> Once I&#39;ve done this,<br> I will just be an ordinary Beast.<br> I don&#39;t want you to worry.<br> Nothing will change for you.<br> Still, it is a bit of a lonely way to go out.<br> So I wanted to say goodbye here at the end.</p><p>Fou:<br> I hope you don&#39;t mind.<br> Then again, the Mage said an act of goodwill was something forced onto others.</p><p>Fou:<br> But that is... what I call a happy ending.</p><p>Romani:<br> It&#39;s been a decade, huh?</p><p>Romani:<br> It went by so fast.</p><p>Romani:<br> But it&#39;s okay. Fujimaru is here.</p><p>Romani:<br> As long as he becomes a good Master, there was meaning in my time here.</p><p>Romani:<br> I could ask for no greater reason for this human existence.</p><p>Romani:<br> It more than makes up for the freedom I&#39;ve had.</p><p>Romani:<br> It&#39;s time... for the briefing.</p><p>Romani:<br> I&#39;m going to head to the Command Room.</p><p>Romani:<br> See you later.</p><p>Romani:<br> I&#39;m counting on you to take care of things when I&#39;m no longer around.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> The decade you&#39;ve spent...</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> You spent all that time working yourself to the bone, desperately trying to escape from and avert the end of mankind... that you saw when you became human.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Only a nightmarish existence, a hellish freedom.<br> But it was indeed worth it.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> King Solomon never really got his wish to become a human.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Yeah.</p><p>Da Vinci:<br> Your wish came true, Romani Archaman.</p>', 1021);
