What&#39;s that...?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> This is some cheap wine. Its vulgar body, perhaps fearful at the honor of passing through my throat, pales and fades into nothingness.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I will at least acknowledge its grace, if nothing else.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hah hah hah, perhaps you&#39;re trying to say cold wine goes down well? You sure say things in a roundabout way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this a...party?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look, Nitocris over there seems to be sober.<br> She might be the most reasonable one here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try to talk to her, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Oh, Master, Mash. What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We just happened to be passing through.<br> Um...what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> We&#39;re drinking, as you can see. What of it?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I was invited by the two pharaohs over there... Well, more like I volunteered myself to join them in their banquet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But why here in the Command Room?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> If you&#39;re asking about the location, Pharaoh Iskandar said this place is fitting for a king&#39;s banquet.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> If you are inquiring about the purpose of this banquet...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Nitocris! What are you doing over there!?<br> Drink. Empty your cup and drink some more.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> This is a gathering of pharaohs. That includes you.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I called Cleopatra too, but she was so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude and unworthiness that she passed out.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> So basically, you&#39;re the only person that can act as a representative for female pharaohs in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...With all due respect, that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, everyone here really does have the title of pharaoh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was Iskandar one too?</p><hr><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Oh? Master, Mash, I didn&#39;t realize you were there!<br> Did the fragrance of the wine draw you here?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter! As our mutual friends, you have permission to join us! Drink up!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Are you trying to cheapen this gathering of pharaohs? Besides, I recall they&#39;re at an age where they should avoid alcohol.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Oh, very well. You&#39;re hardly even a pharaoh to begin with, and I do not intend to lambaste them for their age.<br> I shall permit it. Drink up!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Haha, you&#39;re quite strict. But I do have a proper regnal name: Setepenre Meryamun!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I too am known by the name Setepenre.<br> I&#39;m sure it is a common name for pharaohs.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> The King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre... Son of Ra... Ramesses the Great... Amun&#39;s beloved...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> That is who I, the Sun Ozymandias, am! I shall allow it. Sear that name into your Spirit Core and Spirit Origin! Remember it!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> By the gods! Then I suppose we&#39;re like brothers!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> No, we&#39;re not brothers. We&#39;re not, but...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I do believe the great king here is a pharaoh!<br> ...I think that is what Cleopatra would say.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Interesting. You dare go against my will?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> N-No, great pharaoh, I would not! I just thought of what Cleopatra would say and I could not help it...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Well, it is true she might say something like that.<br> When did you get that close with each other?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Please...forgive my indiscretion. My only lord is the Sun King, and my only alliance is with Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Cleopatra is like... a troublesome little sister.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hah hah hah. Don&#39;t tease her so much, Sun King. Cleopatra would indeed say something like that.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> She was the last pharaoh on Earth.<br> If so, she is like a granddaughter to us.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> True enough. Even if she&#39;s not related to us by blood, she was the last to inherit the title of pharaoh and its divinity.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Yes. But if that&#39;s the case\u2014</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Nitocris. You. Yes, you.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Y-Yes?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> You&#39;re the oldest pharaoh among us.<br> Wouldn&#39;t you be more of a mother figure, then?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Truly an incarnation of the ancient Horus.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I-I-I am a mother!?<br> To Lord Ozymandias!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Does that mean I can do whatever I want?<br> A mother does all sorts of things for her son...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> She cooks for him, lets him sleep on her lap...<br> Even tells old folktales and scary stories!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> W-Would you be okay with that?<br> I&#39;ve never had a child...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Nitocris?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> N-N-No, I am not worthy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes, that is too much. And Iskandar\u2013you are a pharaoh who has accomplished more than I have.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You are the King of Conquerors. You traveled far and wide, seizing many lands. I pale in comparison.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> What&#39;s so great about a king who focused so much on expansion and left nothing but destruction in his wake?<br> I am a god. I am the sun. I am the true pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Pharaoh Ozymandias!<br> That is so obvious I need not say it!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You are the king of kings: the god-king.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You are so revered that I dare not even try to compare you with others. It would be far too presumptuous of me.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...The same goes for Pharaoh Cleopatra. I didn&#39;t try as earnestly to protect the country as she did.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t Cleopatra...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She destroyed the country, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> If you speak of destruction, the decline of Upper and Lower Egypt became inevitable as soon as I, the true pharaoh, was gone.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Any reign other than my own would thereafter be imperfect, no matter who the pharaoh was.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Just as the Nile flows, the final destination was inevitable. I never had my hopes up.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hah hah hah. I feel I&#39;ve said this before, but no country escapes downfall. Not even my Macedonia.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes. If countries are destined to fall, then all things considered, I believe she played her part of pharaoh well.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But I...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She seems kind of sad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nitocris...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. I agree.<br> She seems depressed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For some reason she doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s touched her wine.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...I guess you can tell.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I&#39;m... an inexperienced pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> When I see all these great pharaohs here...<br> When I subject myself to their gaze...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I feel depressed...<br> N-No, more like ashamed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Iskandar said that you&#39;re the oldest pharaoh in Chaldea, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words, you were alive in the Age of Gods.<br> You&#39;re a pharaoh from the ancient times...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You think in terms of your magecraft.<br> The older and greater Mystics possess more power.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But to me, time means nothing.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It&#39;s about how a pharaoh\u2013the child of a god, a godlike king, a god incarnate\u2013should be.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Do you know why I was not taken to the eternal afterlife?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Ozymandias never chose it to begin with, but me...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Me... I&#39;m sure I just never made it there.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Fujimaru, my ally... maybe I should talk to you about this.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I am a foolish pharaoh. I closed off my own path to the afterlife.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I took my own life without preparing for what lay beyond. But I have no regrets.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I turned into a weapon for the sake of my brothers...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Those treacherous retainers who used pharaohs like puppets... Those fools who mocked the position of pharaoh...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I sent them all to the bottom of the Nile... Without mercy, without hesitation, and without regret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you got your revenge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that means... you killed them.</p><hr><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Yes, I slaughtered them with my own hands.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Perish, you foul creatures!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> No one will hear your screams, your groans, or your cries for help!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I will kill you all! You should be happy to be embraced by the waters of the Nile as you die!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You used my brothers as puppets...<br> You murdered them all...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I will never forgive you. You shall never be forgiven! Never! Never! I&#39;ve been waiting for this day...!</p><p><strong>Retainers:</strong><br> Why, Nitocris? We were the ones who helped you become pharaoh!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It was for this day. Everything. Everything I&#39;ve done was to kill you all.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That has been my only reason for living.<br> Just so that you would choose me as your next puppet...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I made you think you could control my dignity, my being, my body, my will.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> And you fell right into my trap. When you heard I had a gift for you, what did you think it was?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> A lavish banquet? A treasure of gold? Or maybe\u2014Oh, you thought you could even have me?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But this is the end. I will end it all for you.<br> The hubris of trying to control a pharaoh... It stops here!</p><p><strong>Retainers:</strong><br> Stop it! No! We don&#39;t want to die!<br> Save us...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Make your pleas to my dear brothers!<br> To the ones you killed without any mercy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> You will not travel to the eternal afterlife. Ha, ha, but rest assured. I am the same. I will follow you soon.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I will find you in death and torment you for eternity!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I killed them... and then myself.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...After putting up with so much, I&#39;d finally taken my revenge.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Come to think of it, maybe I&#39;m so short-tempered as a Heroic Spirit because of my deeds in life.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I am a puppet of a pharaoh.<br> At best, all I ever accomplished was revenge.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve tried to be as proper as possible.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I punished them for their impiety in attempting to control the position of pharaoh. I tried to restore honor to the pharaoh name.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> The pride I have as pharaoh does exist within my heart, but even still...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> If I compare myself to the other pharaohs, I shiver just thinking how small I am...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I&#39;m so pathetic... I can&#39;t even bring myself to face them...!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hey, small one.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see. How&#39;s this? (Beep, beep.) There.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Difficulty setting? Oooh... \u201CSparta Mode.\u201D That&#39;s got a nice ring to it. Must mean it&#39;s as strong as them.<br> That settles it, then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Iskandar? What are you doing in front of that console...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Hey! Helloooo?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The training program just activated.<br> Are you guys doing something?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Of course we are! The wine has warmed our bodies. How about we swing our swords for a little entertainment!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;ll be assisting the enemy.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I am tired of all the cheap wine.<br> It might be fun to play along with you!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Rejoice, pretenders! Rather than eradicating you, I will shine from on high.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Even those who are not truly alive weep tears of joy. Sear the light of the pharaoh into you!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I see. That puts Master with Mash and Nitocris.<br> A good team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When did we say we were all joining in!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get what&#39;s going on there, but am I right in assuming there&#39;s going to be a fight in the simulator?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, just don&#39;t get hurt, okay?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I... I have to fight a proper pharaoh?<br> That would just be too disrespectful...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I won&#39;t forgive desertion.<br> If you run, you will face the consequences.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> What do you think, Sun King?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Escape and defeat are not fit for the divinity of the pharaohs! Thus...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If you run, you must renounce the title of pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Never address yourself that way. Never use the name. And...let&#39;s see... Say you&#39;re sorry for being a pharaoh up until now.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t...do that...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I am a pharaoh, no matter how short my reign was!<br> I just can&#39;t renounce that fact!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Then you must fight. I don&#39;t have to say this, but you&#39;ll face the same consequences if you lose. It&#39;d also be boring if you threw the game.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> On the contrary, if you win... we&#39;ll give you some sort of reward.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> You speak too much, King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Nitocris, even after receiving my endless splendor, will your mirror still reflect darkness, or won&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> If you&#39;re a pharaoh, then withstand it! If you can&#39;t, you will fade away. That&#39;s all there is to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like...we have no choice but to fight!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Fujimaru! My ally!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I&#39;m an inexperienced pharaoh.<br> But the fact that I am still a pharaoh is my pride.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> If I&#39;m going to lose that, then I can&#39;t afford to run or lose!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I must win this fight no matter what! Lend me your power! No, PLEASE lend me your power!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (Panting)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was intense!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-You guys won. You won against three pharaohs that symbolize an era!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Heh, heh... Ha, ha, ha! We lost! We lost!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> I had no intention of holding back. Perhaps that cheap wine and my arrogance came back to bite me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Why are you all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Cleopatra&#39;s here too. When did she join the battle!?)</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the face a winner should make.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I did not hold back. Your determination was just greater than ours.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Listen up. You fought and defeated multiple pharaohs\u2014myself included.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> O Queen of the Mirror who lived in the ancient world... You&#39;re a perfect pharaoh in your own right.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> I tell you this on my honor.<br> You should be thankful for this reward.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Queen Nitocris.<br> I witnessed it myself. It&#39;s just as you said.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong><br> I saw your pride as a pharaoh...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Cleopatra...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> (Huh...? How long have you been here?)</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> That&#39;s something I lack, to say the least.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> In that respect, I think you&#39;re a better pharaoh than I am. There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> A better pharaoh!? Such a useless distinction!<br> Just being a pharaoh is enough!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> It&#39;s pure arrogance to wish for any more than that.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> After all, it&#39;s established fact that I am the best and most venerable pharaoh. Anything more is fighting for scraps!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> You could be known only for your dark, vengeful acts... or for your numerous conquests... You could be the last of your kind...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> You could even be a young pharaoh who only reigned for a few days...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> No matter what kind of pharaoh you are, to me, there is very little difference!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> But that is why I understand your admiration towards me. It may be arrogant, but I do understand.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Humans still extend their arms to the sun, even knowing they can&#39;t reach it. They attempt to touch the gods.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> There is nothing as meaningless as hanging your head in despair because you cannot reach me. That would be true arrogance.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Hey, you. You just counted me as a pharaoh, didn&#39;t you? It feels like I finally got my certificate of authenticity or something.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> ...Hah hah! This is some cheap wine! I&#39;m not thinking properly, but my mouth keeps going!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go somewhere else and keep drinking, Rider.<br> This time get me some wine that will at least let me talk properly!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Rider too, you know? We can keep drinking, but there&#39;s not much in the way of wine around here...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> Oh, but I do know a king with a big attitude whose wine happens to be very good.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong><br> All he&#39;d need to do is fetch some more from the storeroom... I wonder where he is?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He left...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Were the pharaohs... trying to...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...tell me that...all along?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I was a fool who, unable to make it to the eternal afterlife, eventually became a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I thought it was a punishment by the gods, but...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> But then I met Ozymandias and the other pharaohs. And not just them\u2013 I met you too. The best ally I could ever have.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t a punishment. It&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...No, never mind.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> I was just blurting out nonsense. It was just my imagination. Let&#39;s just forget it. Forget it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m not really good at taking hints, but let me say this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since you guys fought at full force, the simulator&#39;s all messed up! It&#39;s...pretty tough to clean it up, you know...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just let us do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Us two will do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai. That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll take care of it, Nitocris, so go on ahead.<br> Wherever you&#39;d like.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...(Bowing)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Pharaohs... Rulers of Egypt... I&#39;m sure there is some kind of special bond between them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Especially since it was such a long-lasting tradition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Now then, Master. Let&#39;s do our best to clean up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, no matter how you look at it, this isn&#39;t a two-person job. I recommend calling for some help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, you are listening, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. So when you said you two would do it, you were talking about me as well...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hah... The pharaohs sure do everything on a grand scale... including affecting the simulator system... (Sigh)</p>', 237);
