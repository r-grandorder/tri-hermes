However, there\u2019s not a single piece of evidence proving the existence of the kingdom or its queen.</p><p>In Ethiopia, East Africa, there is a splendorous national foundation myth saying that the Queen married Solomon and became the mother to the country\u2019s first emperor.</p><p>With her existence being as unclear as a mirage, many records describe the Queen of Sheba as peerless beauty, comparable even to the majestic figure of King Solomon.</p><p>While her beauty is unquestionable, something about her feels vaguely unfortunate for some reason\u2026 and you know very well what this reason is. She wants a thriving business first and foremost. She\u2019s counts every penny, not allowing any pointless expense. She very much lives and breathes money, treasure, business connection, and get-rich-quick schemes. But despite all this, you must keep in mind that it\u2019s very possible that her conduct is a farce, an act being put on by someone who gazed at the distant future.</p><p>Also, many regions have legends about her having an inhuman figure. Arabians said \u201Cthe Queen had furry legs and donkey hooves\u201D, Southern French said \u201Cher feet were webbed like a goose\u2019s\u201D, etc.</p><p>The correct version is the story that says that she is the daughter of a djinn woman and a human man. It\u2019s also believed that the Queen possesses a shapeshifter\u2019s power to have a variety of appearances, as if she were a light-refracting lens.</p><p>The New Testament (Gospels of Matthew and Luke) also says this: \u201CThe queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.\u201D1</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>She has a self-deprecating side regarding how, contrary to her glamorous legends, her own past was nothing but modest. And she strongly values modest stories of everyday life.</p><p>She has powers of future precognition, originated from her djinn bloodline. It\u2019s implied that her meeting with Solomon in the legends was actually an intense mentally draining Clairvoyance vs Clairvoyance battle, where they would go through the three enigmas adapting to what was becoming settled as the future and the past.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>She takes an incense burner made of gold to scatter incense smoke and manipulate it.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>David:</strong></p><p>Da\u2026!

I remember well putting a lot of energy into this design, in gratitude to my permission to add animal years and horns right in my very first work here. There\u2019s something of an origin story to my little djinns. At first, I considered doing them in a more \u201Cgenie of the lamp\u201D style, but I couldn\u2019t due to circumstances including an already released character doing exactly that. This lead to me just drawing whatever I wanted and those getting used as they were. It\u2019s very pleasant to see than in action as a real Noble Phantasm.
