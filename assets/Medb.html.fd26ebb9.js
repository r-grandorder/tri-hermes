Simultaneously, a lewd and vicious girl.</p><p>Tidy and pure. Lewd and vicious. Both sets are her true images, and either one of them is said to not be a fabrication. It is just that the \u201Cimpression\u201D many people catch is the former. Medb just earnestly likes lewdness neatly and cleanly, and earnestly performs viciousness purely. She loves fine men. She loves strong men! She will love a man even more if he does not succumb to her! It will be worth the torment for some of them! Absolutely not going against her lust, she made a great number of men her own property during her lifetime. Fergus, the owner of the magic sword Caladbolg, was one of her lovers too. She also loves riches, and for that motive, she caused a great war, took on the whole nation of Ulster as her opponent, and commanded the Connacht troops while driving her chariot.</p><p>Because Medb thinks she is the center of the world, she will turn up to a large event even on some occasions where she is not invited. \u201CAfter all, doesn\u2019t it seem pitiful to not notice such things, even though I spent money on things like these? Nevertheless, do be at peace, for I have arrived now! The center of the world, the chosen leading actress, Queen Medb, the ruler of everything!\u201D Even though this is an action according to a person who craves the limelight, Medb herself is uncontrollable within the vicinity when one considers the good of everybody else nearby.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Medb deems her Master as a \u201Ctemporarily master\u201D. However, she openly perceives the system called Servant and Master like some kind of play, and she does not take into consideration of it very seriously. She herself relatively enjoys the state of affairs around herself.</p><p>Although her obsession towards C\xFA Chulainn still remains, the wish Medb wants to make on the Holy Grail is something unrelated to him. Namely, \u201Cto make all wonderful men of the past/present/future as her lovers.\u201D If possible, brave warriors who are often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear would be nice. If her Master is a brave man who conforms to her discernment, Medb will probably slap her love freely onto him with all her energy without caring about public attention. Severely, relentlessly, just like the whip she uses in that particular way.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI\u2019m Medb.

The Eternal Lady. The Queen of Connacht who appears in the Ulster Cycle of Celtic Mythology. A girl of affairs who built engagements, marriages, and at times, nothing but sexual relations with kings and brave warriors in great numbers. The ringleader who caused the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle, she was after the life of C\xFA Chulainn, the brave warrior of Ulster who defied her. It is said that she is even endowed with aspects of discord and conflict as a Divine Spirit that rules over regal powers, evil and insanity.</p><p>Even in modern Ireland, there are many sighting cases where people have said \u201CI saw her.\u201D Of course, those are not a kind of joke. Even now in the hearts of people, Queen Medb, as the Eternal Lady, lives on.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>\u201C\u2026 I don\u2019t really hate being antagonized.\u201D<br> \u201CHowever, I can\u2019t tolerate the fact that, among the men of Ulster, there\u2019s one man, only one man, who didn\u2019t become mine, even though I thought \u201CI want him\u201D. Even though I called out to him, even though I enticed him. Not at all being swayed by me, that attitude of his is as if he\u2019s even saying, \u201CWhat the heck are YOU doing?\u201D!\u201D<br> \u201CI won\u2019t forgive him. Won\u2019t forgive won\u2019t forgive won\u2019t forgive won\u2019t forgive won\u2019t forgive! THAT GUY, absolutely\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201D<br> \u201CC\xFA Chulainn of Ulster! I swear by the name of Medb, the ruler who became the lover of all men! Because I\u2019ll show everyone that you will absolutely submit to me!\u201D</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Medb has been called the mother of many warriors, but it is not because she actually gives birth to those warriors. After she takes in the genetic information of warriors, she reproduces those inside her body. When she wounds the tip of her index finger with a blade, the moment her blood falls onto the ground, what was no more than a single drop of blood then becomes a large pool of blood right after, and as the blood foams, warriors are \u201Cmanufactured\u201D from it. Medb is literally the ruler who became the \u201CQueen\u201D of nameless warriors.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn</strong></p><p>As aforementioned, Cu-chan LOVE.

When drawing a derived work, this is the recommended stage to be drawn since it\u2019s the most comfortable for one to draw, right? Also, because I\u2019m pleased with this one the most, I personally keep her battle sprite in this state.</p><p>Stage 2: Because I received the specification called a white female knight, this stage was imagined first. The other stages were created by adding and subtracting from here.</p><p>Stage 3: Although I imagined sexy underwear, she\u2019s somewhat like a powerful princess, no, a \u201Creigning champion of the ring\u201D, isn\u2019t she? I certainly want her to start up something like a New Celtic Pro Wrestling promotion!
