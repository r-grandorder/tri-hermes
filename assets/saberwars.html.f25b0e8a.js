Hiyaa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s such nice weather, isn&#39;t it, Senpai?<br> Oh, would you like some more tea?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Today I&#39;ve prepared a special apple tea.<br> Have some more. It&#39;ll help you relax.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor ate too many rice cakes, so he&#39;s feeling ill.<br> He wants you to at least enjoy yourself in his stead.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...foou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems Fou has the day off today as well. With weather and a breeze as nice as this, it&#39;s only natural.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Haaa!<br> More skillful! I must be more skillful! Faster, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since this is a Singularity, what we&#39;re seeing here is not definite, but all the greenery and warmth is the real thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Having the perfect weather for a picnic, we haven&#39;t had strange luck like this since Halloween.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This too\u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Haa! Yaa!<br> Noble Phantasm Level 1, Caliburn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...We owe it all to Lily&#39;s training, I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. This is all thanks to Senpai&#39;s kind consent to help Lily get stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If Senpai keeps on doing this, it&#39;s only a matter of time before ads like \u201CGot worries? Come to Fujimaru&#39;s Consultation Room!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> gets posted on the bulletin board in Chaldea&#39;s cafeteria. But don&#39;t worry, if that happens, leave the management to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll manage your schedule with an iron fist to make sure you become the most loved person within the Heroic Spirit community!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t joke around. This time it&#39;s serious.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou?<br> Foufofo fouuuu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come now. You can&#39;t go acting like Kojirou did when Martha was around, Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lily&#39;s troubles are severe.<br> We need to help her out any way we can...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a surprise.<br> You&#39;re training all by yourself, Lily?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Yes. I am still an immature Saber, so I want to hone my sword skills whenever I have time.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> But...no matter how hard I train, my Holy Sword is not getting any stronger.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Though I&#39;m improving little by little, my Noble Phantasm, the pride of a Servant, is still immature...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> And so I&#39;ve decided to take my leave at this time.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I have no future as a Servant, so I am afraid I will only be a burden to you, Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Lily...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whether strong or weak, you must...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True, your Noble Phantasm must get stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Stop.<br> This is important, so staple that mouth shut, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I am an immature Demi-Servant, so I know painfully well how Lily feels.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In particular, the level of one&#39;s Noble Phantasm is a serious issue. Right now, Lily and I have formed an Unenhanced NP Alliance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I want you to be particularly careful about saying anything about Noble Phantasms.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uhm, should you be in an alliance like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s why\u2013 The only thing left for us to do is to train.<br> Training will never betray anyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are a magnificent Saber.<br> Given the opportunity, you&#39;ll succeed for sure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, ok? Isn&#39;t that right, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She will become an A rank for sure.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m not so sure about that...<br> I think you&#39;re exaggerating when you say A rank.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> But I appreciate the compliment.<br> It builds my confidence to hear you say that, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whether a strong Heroic Spirit or weak Heroic Spirit, you must...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, bring me a stapler.<br> It&#39;s on Doctor&#39;s desk.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> N-No, that&#39;s not necessary, Mash.<br> What Fujimaru says is true!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s all due to my lack of confidence and my inexperience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014All right. It&#39;s been decided.<br> This next Rayshift will be for Lily&#39;s training.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We must strike while the iron is hot! Before Doctor recovers from his stomachache. We&#39;re going to Rayshift on our own!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> \u2014Whew.<br> I have completed 1,000 strikes, Master!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Even though this is my usual practice, I&#39;m so glad that Fujimaru can witness how I have improved!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well done.<br> From what I&#39;ve seen, your attacks are perfect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...However, there is still a conundrum.<br> The issue is not with you, Lily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s why in the world the strength of your blade won&#39;t improve...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure...that it must be my lack of confidence that clouds the glow of this holy sword.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I am a phantom consisting of elements separated from a certain Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I am the \u201Cif\u201D that existed between the time I drew the Sword of Selection and the moment I became King.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The \u201Cif\u201D version?<br> Is that different from Alter?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Indeed \u201Cshe\u201D also has a form that&#39;s in training.<br> But that form is not as flowery as me.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I am nothing more than an \u201Cif\u201D that is dissimilar to the authentic me.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> But as long as this Lily exists, I am not a fake or afraud\u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s just I cannot help but think that I am not who I originally was and that I am just a mere phantom.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Now I am unable to train without casting aside my doubt, and I can&#39;t unleash my holy sword&#39;s potential either...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> More specifically, I can&#39;t increase my Noble Phantasm level... That&#39;s what my doubts have led to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Lily...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This problem is a little too specific...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh? What was that in the sky?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> What was that?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-wh-what the heck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whoa! Whoaaaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What the heck is thaaaaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> It appears to be a meteorite.<br> It must have fallen from the sky.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> No need to worry. I don&#39;t detect any radiation, killer viruses, or any other variety of dangerous substances.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> You two really overreacted. This kind of thing happens all the time, and is completely harmless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, I don&#39;t mean the meteorite!<br> I mean, I would like some orders from you, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? This kind of thing happens a lot!?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Well, yes. The other Servants say that it doesn&#39;t,<br> but when I&#39;m alone it happens pretty often.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Your view of the world is pretty crazy, Lily.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Absolutely right!<br> Your words are quite correct!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a person coming from the rocke...I mean, from the meteorite! What? \u2014Could this be!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No need to explain! Because I was able to give you a clear view of me when I made my emergency landing!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> At any rate, I can&#39;t stand by and watch this anymore!<br> You there! You&#39;re a Saber Class, right?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Y-You mean me!? ...Yes, I&#39;m still a novice, so I&#39;m the lowest rank of the Saber Class.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, that attitude of yours is pathetic! Fainthearted!<br> So terribly fainthearted! Are you pitiful or what?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left for you to do now is fight!<br> Prepare yourself, Saber! You as well there, Master!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I, Mysterious Heroine X, will show you what it means to be a true Saber!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A mysterious Servant has come to fight!<br> Senpai! Lily! Prepare for a fight!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Y-Yes, of course! No matter who the enemy is, it is a knight&#39;s duty to protect their Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That was pretty good for a warm-up match.<br> If I have to compare... Yes... Just like warm-up exercise!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That is to say, you&#39;re all still novices! Like preschoolers who can&#39;t even wake up in the morning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think we got in some pretty good blows...<br> That Saber even blurted out some \u201Coofs\u201D...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Right. When my hand slipped and accidentally hit her in the shin, she kept saying \u201CIt doesn&#39;t hurt at all\u201D despite the tears welling up in her eyes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She must really hate losing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No doubt about it, she&#39;s an Altria...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No, to be honest, I was holding back.<br> I didn&#39;t ambush you from the dark...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...bury land mines, or kidnap anyone important to you, did I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, well...that certainly was a fair and square fight, very much like the Saber Class.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way...who are you, anyway? If my eyes were not mistaken, you came out of that rocket...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Humph! Thank you for finally asking!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m Heroine X!<br> I&#39;m the Saber of Sabers! I&#39;m the ultimate Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I am the one and only holy sword wielder in this universe, an one-for-all kind of Saber!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Really? Based on that track suit...<br> who knew you&#39;re someone that amazing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Saber of Sabers... So you&#39;re a Grand Class?<br> Or wait, but... Your class is...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Silence. You call yourself Shielder or whatever, but as a freshman in the Fate world, you cannot see the truth.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What you can see with your eyes is not all that there is.<br> To get along in the world, sometimes you must turn your eyes from the truth and let it remain ambiguous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Everyone with your look is a Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The details don&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...<br> A Master that understands... Very nice...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s Heroine X, right?<br> Explain why you attacked us so suddenly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After that, I would request that you leave immediately.<br> We are busy with Lily&#39;s training.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You&#39;ve hit the nail on the head, Shieldy! I told you thatI&#39;m the ultimate Saber Class Servant, right?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> From where I stand, I cannot overlook that feeble Saber there.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I have a very important mission,<br> though I cannot speak of it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> At any rate! You call yourself Saber Lily, right? What you need now is special training and a teacher that you can respect!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s right!<br> That is why I&#39;m training with my sword...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I said that you need a teacher! You require the help of a great Senpai that has fought many years as a Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Therefore, you&#39;re quite fortunate.<br> As expected of me, the one with A rank luck.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What I, Heroine X, hide is my First Class Saber Teaching License.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It was fate that forced Du Stallion II to crash land here.<br> Let me show you that I&#39;m a first-rate Saber!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> A-All right!<br> I don&#39;t really understand you, but sure, I&#39;d appreciate it!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nice answer! I like you! Let&#39;s get started. I shall now explain exactly what kind of training you shall undergo.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You will gather the three kinds of materials that possess mysterious powers which are spread across this world.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> They have fallen from my spacecraft. If you don&#39;t gather them and repair it, I cannot return home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s a pretty selfish training regimen...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, a Servant from outer space...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> You can&#39;t return home... I feel so sorry for you...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> All right! Leave this to me!<br> I need to gather materials and repair that vehicle, right?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Right. I&#39;m usually not one to trust in others, but since things are generally going my way, I&#39;ll let it slide.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Now I shall tell you the true details of your training.<br> This spacecraft will probably summon a large number of monsters.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It is a very out-of-place object.<br> There&#39;s about as much wealth here as all of England.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Therefore, it is obvious that huge mobs will descend on it to make it their own.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Your job is to fight these lawless bands, defeat them, and gather superparticles called \u201CAltrium.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Altrium are energy particles present throughout the universe. It seems impossible, but if we can get some,<br> I can make this work.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You there, Shieldy, Master, you&#39;re not going anywhere. It&#39;s too late, so give it up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. So it&#39;s too late...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought we could make it if we left now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... New Year&#39;s vacation still isn&#39;t over.<br> This is a pretty rough turn of events, Senpai...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> At any rate! Once you have gathered enough Altrium,<br> I shall power up Lily by myself.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Explanation complete! If you want more details, then gather spacecraft materials and Altrium!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> From now on we must be fierce as demons.<br> We will cut down all Saber-faces we run into.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Even if they&#39;re not Saber-faces, just looking like one is also a sin! So we&#39;ll cut down the likes of Jeanne d&#39;Arc, too!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> A Saber&#39;s dignity rests on battle. Experience and learn this. Now\u2014begin your warrior training, Lily!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is way beyond crazy. This is insanity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now begins a crazy battle that&#39;s supposed to help Lily!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><h2 id="episode-ii-blackbeard-awakens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episode-ii-blackbeard-awakens" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episode II: Blackbeard Awakens</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time that we answered the question that&#39;s on everyone&#39;s mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, you mean about the spacecraft parts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I wasn&#39;t going to say anything, but it looks like this is going to take a while.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ah, you mean about who X really is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s something we should avoid for now.<br> It could cause things to get worse with her.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What? Do you have a question for me? Since we&#39;ve reached a break in Lily&#39;s training, go right ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, for my first question,<br> I&#39;m all right with gathering Altrium...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but how is it that you&#39;ll be able to power up Lily with the Altrium we gather?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Right, I didn&#39;t explain how that works, did I?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> This is common sense throughout the entire milky way.<br> Altrium is a newly discovered almighty energy particle.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> My spacecraft is powered by Altrium. Also, inside my spacecraft, the Spirit Origin Enhancement Device\u2014</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> A capsule known as \u201CAdam Kadmon.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> When this device is fed enough Altrium, Lily can be physically enhanced.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Spirit Origin Enhancement Device?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You want that? Look, Fou, I understand your feelings, but just calm down!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What is Kadmon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In the Hebrew language, it means \u201Cdoll\u201D or \u201Chuman\u201D...<br> But with a negative connotation...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They say it is a very immoral thing...<br> I guess you could say it&#39;s much like Paracelsus...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Adam Kadmon is a device that creates an exact Spirit Origin copy based on the Spirit Origin&#39;s information.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you can just print off copies of the same Heroic Spirit!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You can raise a Noble Phantasm&#39;s level all you like! Wow!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fofo\u2014u!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-There&#39;s a device like that!? That would be awesome!<br> Please let me use it as well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the perfect chance to improve the effectiveness of my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nope, no can do. That&#39;s its flaw.<br> Adam can only increase things made of Altria.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, dear... That was a short-lived dream... I&#39;m sorry, Master. It seems I will always be a hopeless Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Mash. You&#39;ll become stronger for sure someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on! You&#39;ll get there soon.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Those are honest, frank words.<br> You have a good Master, Shieldy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Y-Yes.<br> I will do my best to live up to Master&#39;s expectations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Now for my next question.<br> I&#39;m all right with gathering the spacecraft parts...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But why do the monsters that are attacking carry these parts? They look like nothing more than junk\u2014</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ya-hooo!<br> I found some! I found some, General!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now this be a true dreamland! No doubt about it, this mountain of treasure will make us fat stacks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m getting goosebumps all over\u2014!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Ah. What&#39;s this? A mirage? What a find!<br> Did I accidentally order a happy meal?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> To my left is the sweet Mash-mallow. To my right is a petite, kawaii golden haired Knight Princess...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Good lord! I don&#39;t think I can take any more!<br> Now&#39;s my chance to get a waifu!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had quite enough of the beauties I&#39;ve gathered.<br> They only have eyes for my huge treasure. I&#39;m serious.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Now I will live in a lovely home with my new sexy wife, a pool in the backyard... I&#39;ll go fishing on holidays...<br> Oh, what a dream...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> In fact, I think I&#39;ll have them both! I mean, \u201CPirate\u201D is just a different way to spell \u201CFreedom!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I knew it was you, Captain Teach!<br> And the one next to you is\u2014</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> All right! Time to pillage! We&#39;re on land now! There are no hags here to wallop me on the back of the head!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> This odd scrap metal has the smell of real treasure! Get it all! Oh, General, you take one too\u2606</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AGilles:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> \u201CFine. I may not look it, but I am somewhat of an art connoisseur. I have an affinity for old relics.\u201D</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> \u201CHowever, I have no interest in women. I learned my lesson from Francesca, so split them as you please.\u201D</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you say! You&#39;re pretty shy, General!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Woo-ho\u2014o! As expected of the famous Bluebeard!<br> So cruel! Just like our captain!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Dhuhuhuhuhu! But don&#39;t get carried away just because the General is a gentleman.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Mash and the Knight Princess are mine.<br> If you lay a hand on them, I&#39;ll stick you in a barrel.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Oh, but the one in the tacky blue track suit,<br> she&#39;s not anywhere near my strike zone.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Who was it that liked pretty young girls? Was it Rackam?<br> He was pretty sad when Mary deceived him.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? The General&#39;s getting excited!<br> Could it be that the tacky blue track suit is his fetish?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Not bad for an art connoisseur... Not! Wah-hah-hah! When the General is like this, he really is quite frightening!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> You there in the tacky track suit, take my advice and make a run for it. It just might save you, you kno... Whoa!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Pardon me. I killed him out of reflex. But it doesn&#39;t matter, does it? He is a Saber Class, after all.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...(grin)</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I really wanted Saber Alter to come along, but she&#39;s pretty frightening.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> So, instead I invited the General... Who knew that he&#39;d be defeated before he could even draw his sword...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Oh well, I didn&#39;t expect anything from him anyway.<br> I thought he could at least be a shield... For I am kind...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> But this is unacceptable... There&#39;s not even a cooling-off period... A huge loss to Blackbeard...</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Why you! As another gentleman, I will not abide by this!<br> You, tacky-track-suit, look more like a bad guy than us!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Fujimaru. That talking louse,<br> you seem to know him. May I dispose of him?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Go ahead.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, please. Be my guest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Stay on your guard, X!

I&#39;m so embarassed, almost as much as when someone saw what I hid under my bed.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> At any rate\u2014 Hoo-hoo! It won&#39;t be long before we&#39;re hot honeymooners!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this is the first time I&#39;ve regretted being a Shield Servant. I want a holy sword too! A holy sword!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> So that&#39;s what it&#39;s about.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Sea and sky.

By way of apology, how about if I, Blackbeard, train you myself?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Well, I totally expect something to happen during training. I may look like this, but I know no shame.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I will turn my defeat into an opportunity. I will pretend to be your ally and wait for my chance to strike.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Now, this is top secret. The reason I don&#39;t use a pistol is so I can get in close to grapple with my opponent.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Try using your Noble Phantasm on me once.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I shall dance as gracefully as a butterfly and dash to catch you like a bee.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> This is the kind of dazzling training experience I can offer you.

Oh, let me cut your bonds!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lily!? Are you sure this is all right, Senpai!?<br> Blackbeard is after...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Mash.

You have activated my trap card!<br> Fools! Without that rope, you&#39;re as good as mine!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> A level 1 Noble Phantasm is nothing to me!<br> I&#39;ll take it, and then I&#39;ll KO you with a Lupin dive\u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Right there!<br> Caliburn, cleanse this evil!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Right in the groinnnnnnn!?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong><br> ...Hff.</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna die! Anyone would die from that!<br> That&#39;s more of an anti-male attack than Orion&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Oh, dear! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry...<br> My hand slipped!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll try it one more time!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> ...What? One more time?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Are you... Are you saying you want me to take 20k damage in a single spot again?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> P-Please!<br> I&#39;ll do my very best!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t resist a maiden knight with those cute, puppy dog eyes!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> I cannot say no. But I&#39;m serious, watch what you&#39;re doing!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Make sure you aim for my chest, okay?<br> I can at least get my guard up there.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me!<br> All right, here goes!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Caliburn, cleanse this evil...

He certainly has the core of a Saber.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> By the way, this piece of filth is a nuisance.<br> Does anyone care if I burn him to ash?</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> By god, you&#39;re a heartless one!<br> To speak of such cruelty with a smile on your face!</p><p><strong>Teach:</strong><br> Someone, help meeee!<br> I&#39;ve had enough of this Saber-face!</p><h2 id="episode-iii-revival-of-rome" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episode-iii-revival-of-rome" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episode III: Revival of Rome</h2><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> My training is going well again today, Master and Ms. X!<br> It seems like the strength of my Noble Phantasm is about to improve!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Sigh. Lily is so very earnest.<br> I&#39;m glad her training is going well, but...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> My quota is not being met.<br> Maybe I should find bigger prey...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai.<br> X is muttering disturbing things again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had a change of mind myself.<br> I think now is the time to clear up that other question.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah, you mean about X&#39;s Class.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, not about that... To be honest, it&#39;s something that&#39;s really been bothering me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eek!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m 100% Saber Class. Got a problem?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That seems to be a sensitive issue with her. We shouldavoid being direct and take another approach, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ah, you mean about who X really is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Master. Of course I&#39;d like to know her Class, but I&#39;d at least like to know her origins.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> By the way, Ms. X, you came here on that rocket, but which land are you a Heroic Spirit of?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai! Lily is ignoring everything and jumping straight to the question!)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> So...you want to know my origins. Do you have some ulterior motive for wanting to know this, Lily?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> No... It&#39;s just rather painful to know nothing about someone who has helped me so much.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I just thought that the least I could do to thank you was make a popular dish or famous sweets from your hometown...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Oh, I see.<br> I guess I&#39;m the only one suspicious of others...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you want, then let me tell you all about it!<br> Fujimaru, and Shieldy, you listen as well.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I have nothing to hide. I am a Servant that comes from outer space! I am a Heroic Spirit that comes from a future Servant-verse!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant-verse...?<br> From the future? And from outer space?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Hah...<br> So, Ms. X, is that the same as the Throne of Heroes?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No. The Servant-verse is not some boring warehouse like the Throne of Heroes!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It is where Servants conduct Servant-like deeds with a space-like world view. That is to say, it is a universe.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;s a world where we have been set free from the burden of our origins and can truly do whatever we like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Me neither! But it sounds fun!<br> I think that universe seems all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In that universe, do people become zombies?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Of course. We have everything from suspense, melodramas, and mysteries. It&#39;s only natural that we have a horror route as well.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> When that golden nudist said, \u201CI am mankind&#39;s oldest zombie!\u201D and stuff, I was sure this world was done for.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> At least that&#39;s what I thought, but somehow he made it back to his own world.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No matter how reckless the adventure...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u201C\u2014I&#39;ve been through a lot, but I&#39;ve returned to this town.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> As long as you say that when you come back, most of the time people would just pretend nothing has happened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s put aside talk of Servant-verse.<br> What do you mean that you came from the future?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unlike Rayshift, is that rocket a genuine time machine?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> A time machine? Oh, you mean, can it make time jumps?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m pretty sure it can. It warps, after all. I mean, a journey through space is impossible unless you can travel faster than light.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s incredible!<br> My mentor is also a time traveler!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Well...no, the incredible one is whoever it was that made Du Stallion II...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> But why did you come from the future?<br> Did you make some mistake while steering your ship?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> How rude! My piloting skills are perfect!<br> I am a Saber after all!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I came to this era to save the world. The future that I am in is facing a crisis of destruction now.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> For some reason, our existence is on the verge of being destroyed.

Yeah, I guess.<br> ...I am a Saber, so what of it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I guess Lily really got X there, huh?<br> X is still pretty suspicious,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but with Lily around, I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be a problem.<br> Isn&#39;t that right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. But X is a good Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You think so? I mean, X is \u201Cthat\u201D Saber.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ho there\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s this?<br> Someone is coming... Is that...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ho there\u2014!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I heard a ship fell from the sky around here, but I&#39;m exhausted from all the traveling, so prepare a feast for me first!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Sigh... Acting like a emperor when she doesn&#39;t even know her opponent yet...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Red Saber, do you know if this is enemy territory?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What are you talking about, Caster?<br> Do you really think she can even read the signs?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> First of all, since that is obviously a spacecraft, we are facing aliens. They can&#39;t understand our language.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s just one nutty person facing off against another nutty person.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The returns are small, but the risk is small, too.<br> First, let us see how skilled Her Majesty is.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Fool! Why are you so pessimistic, Archer?<br> We&#39;re facing aliens? Then first we must greet them!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> With kindness, sincerity, and passion! Though we may be of different lands, the feelings within our hearts are similar!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So first, let us negotiate with a smile. There is not a living thing around that cannot understand that.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It is a visitor from the sky, after all!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> They are most certainly overflowing withromance, passion, and a taste of the future!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I will now proclaim with complete confidence, the owner of that rocket is a civilized person who hates war!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Uoooooohhh! Uaaaaaaaah!<br> Diiiiiiiieeeee! Red oneeeeeee!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hyaaaaaaaa!?<br> That one suddenly fired a beam at us!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> And she&#39;s even specific about the color!<br> Hey, Saber! Do you know her?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Oh, brother.<br> So, can you still call her a highly civilized being, Saber?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Nope! We certainly cannot communicate with this one!<br> They must be taught a severe lesson!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy group has entered combat mode!<br> We have no choice but to fight them, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Well, if it isn&#39;t Fujimaru and Mash.<br> Umu. I am very pleased to see you again.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> By the way, is this the first time I&#39;ve met you as a Servant? Or have we already met before?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If this is the first time, then I need to introduce myself!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I am Nero Claudius, in my new Servant form!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> May our friendship be long, Fujimaru.<br> It is nice to know you, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. You&#39;re looking well, Your Majesty.<br> It is good to see you as well, Tamamo and Emiya-senpai.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well. You are very kind. It has been quite a while, Mash and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You need not trouble yourselves over us.<br> As you can see, we have accompanied Red Saber here.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> We just thought we&#39;d tag along.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Actually, we heard that there was a versatile appliance here that could cook and do laundry, which would be very useful for newlyweds, but...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> It&#39;s clear as day that there is no such thing on that rocket!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I will have nothing to do with such junk! Those ads were utter lies! This is going too far!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> At any rate, I have assessed your situation, Lily.<br> The manner in which you handle your blade is quite admirable.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yet, allow me to assist you. If you need a fencing partner, then I am better than a hundred, nay, ten thousand partners!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Thank you!<br> It&#39;s quite reassuring to hear that from another Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Hey! What are we suddenly getting along so harmoniously for? I defeated you just now, Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You should resign and withdraw from the field!<br> And you, Lily! You are far too lenient!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> All Sabers besides you are enemies\u2014 Until you embrace that, you can only dream of becoming a full-fledged Saber!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We merely pulled our punches just now because we realized our opponents were Mash and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But who in the world are you?<br> The owner of this rocket? ...Umu...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I feel like... I&#39;ve seen you somewhere...<br> It&#39;s like...looking at a mirror...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I have a feeling that I know you...<br> Who are you? Where are you from?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Hmph, I have no obligation to tell the Red One my name, but I guess I have no choice here.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I am Heroine X. I am an envoy of justice from the future, come here to correct you Sabers.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Ahem!)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Why do you cough now, Archer?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Why do you perspire cold beads of sweat, Nameless Red?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, my apologies. I just sensed that this world was through, so I couldn&#39;t help it. But really, you two, you shouldn&#39;t fight.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I do not know what your burden is, Lady X... It appears to me that the most important thing is to repair your spacecraft.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And Miss Lily, aren&#39;t you in training? Or is it possible that this is somehow connected with your objective?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Hmm... That&#39;s right.<br> Even though you&#39;re with that Red one, you are sharp.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Uh, well. To avoid any more misunderstandings, I do not recall ever becoming this Saber&#39;s ally. I am entirely neutral.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And Miss Lily, allow me to assist in your training.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Naturally, I do not have a lot of time.<br> But seeing how things are, I cannot help myself.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this great, Ms. X! We suddenly have two more who will join in on my training!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Uh, yes...well, if you say so, Lily...<br> ...I guess I have no choice.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Fine. I&#39;ve predicted the monsters gathering here will only get stronger from now on.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Lily will feel more assured with you at her side.<br> Red One, I will allow your presence for now.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmph! I thought you were a twisted one, but I see that you&#39;re good at heart. I will go along with your policy.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Casko, what will you do? Are you going to just play a minor role again, like in London?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Sorry I was just a minor role!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I was concerned about Mo-san, and didn&#39;t want to take the lead role from her! She&#39;s pretty good, you know!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s true I never had a chance to take part.<br> That&#39;s all right. I do have my own main story, after all.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> When we get to the Japan stage, Ushiwakamaru, the others, and I will have a great battle with the Japanese Servants.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> For now, I trust that time will come and will conserve my energy. \u2014Therefore, I shall stay behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That rocket, or whatever it is, looks as if it has AC inside.<br> I think I&#39;ll take a nice break\u2661</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmm. As uncooperative as ever.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Well, it matters not. Now then, Fujimaru, Mash, Lily, X.

It seemed like all three of them would have understood if we had just talked to them...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> X is the only one who wouldn&#39;t understand if you talked to her. Why do you despise the Saber Class so much?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You must certainly have a reason.<br> Or maybe... You hated them when you were alive?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No, I didn&#39;t hate them when I was alive!<br> This became my mission after I became a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> To be exact, this is more of my own personal hobby.<br> Nobody is forcing me to do this.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What? Are you serious!? Even after becoming a Servant, to achieve your own goal...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> X! You certainly are optimistic. I&#39;m not sure I much like the tyrannical attitude, but I admire your avariciousness!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> There are so many boring Servants obsessing over their regrets in life or over their Master&#39;s purpose or whatnot.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Such obsessions are so foolish! But not you! You are free! Though this may not be praise, I like you!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Uh... Yeah... Right.<br> I&#39;m not sure how I feel about you liking me. <em>Sigh</em></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, umu. Well then, you must be aiming to be the most powerful Saber, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If so, then in the end, you and I must fight one more time.<br> Though it is unfortunate, I will not scoff at your dream.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Dreams of being the strongest are the heart of a warrior.<br> Yes, even I have dreamed of such!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Your space sword or my meteorite sword: which is better\u2014 Now I&#39;m getting excited about the end of this training!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m not excited in the slightest. I mean, you&#39;ve been my main target from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Also, you&#39;re mistaken about me having a dream like that. My objective is my mission. It&#39;s more a like a job.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> If you&#39;re looking for someone who&#39;s strivingfor a dream\u2014 That would have to be Lily.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Yes? Did someone mention my dream?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Lily, your goal is a little different than other Servants&#39;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For example, Mordred wanted...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Did you say Mordred!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, dear! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m just using her as an example!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, a.k.a. Mo-san had the goal of becoming king.<br> He held onto that goal from when he was alive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, your goal, Lily, was born after you became a Servant. Your aim is to be the ideal king.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You may be born from the tale of King Arthur, but since you&#39;re an \u201Cif\u201D separated from it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In a way you&#39;re saying, \u201CI am alive now.\u201D<br> You intend to live your life from now on.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hmm. So, taking a position of fantasy can be a good thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Originally, Servants only existed in Holy Grail Wars on Earth. There are no futures for them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> However, under certain conditions, for example, if they are regenerated by a Spiritron computer lifeform...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...or if they remain connected with their Master after the Holy Grail War, or if they&#39;re given a new body, then things will be different.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Those Servants are released from the shackles of their previous lives and become humans of that era that live now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I once heard of a happy-go-lucky Rider that was in that position...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> No, wait, that was an Apocrypha.<br> Well, I guess that itself is a distant \u201Cif.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You certainly are knowledgeable, Emiya-senpai!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Well, as a lower Heroic Spirit, you get recruited for lots of random jobs. I&#39;ve simply gathered a lot of information.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Think of it as nothing but idle chatter.<br> It&#39;s just a digression.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A Spiritron computer life?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s just one of those Extra things, you know. If you&#39;re really interested in it, then...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Ah-ha! My fox ears felt a prick because they caught the scent of some kind of signal.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You there, Archer.<br> What nonsense is that?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> This is a healthy land we&#39;re in, so talk of talesin a fantasy land is not needed here.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> That is to say\u2014If you act too clever,<br> then I will squish you like an ant\u2661</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Ahem! Pardon me, I let my tongue slip.<br> Please continue.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Damn you, Archer. You stole the spotlight from me.<br> That was supposed to be my moment.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> However, I like that phrase!<br> A Servant that \u201Clives now,\u201D is it? How fascinating!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It seems that I&#39;m not one of those Servants, but Lily is one of them.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s good that a Servant that dreams of the now exists instead of just dreaming of memories of their past life.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Basically, that means that one shapes one&#39;s own ending!<br> Suddenly, I feel that I must support Lily!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Shape... My own ending?<br> So if I became King, then my destiny after that...as well?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Of course! The past has been written, the future has been decided...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirits of the past can change nothing, much less those in the Throne of Heroes who know the future.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> However, as for those in the now, they can alter the past and future!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, because only those that live now can change the future!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hey! Hold on there, Saber! I appreciate the positive thinking, but take a look over there.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Looks like some others have been caught by this crazy Singularity, so now we have some more uninvited visitors.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> What good luck, Babbage!<br> This is obviously a spacecraft!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I saw one at the Smithsonian, so I know. You could fly to the moon and treat yourself to Princess Kaguya!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> I quite approve of such barbarous thoughts, Mr. Golden.<br> Your suggestions are always quite stimulating. On rare occasion, they actually give me tingles.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> However, that rocket is incomplete, or rather flawed.<br> It lacks cogwheels. It lacks a lubricator. It lacks a steam engine.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The only thing I can deduce from the preceding issues is thus. I must reconstruct the spacecraft myself.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> No, you mustn&#39;t, Babbage. You, of all people,<br> how could you overlook the most important flaw?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It does not require electricity!<br> That kind of technology should not exist!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Besides, what is this no-risk, no-pollution, no-Tesla dream energy?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> At least call it Nikola Coil!<br> Are you mocking me with this Altrium!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s what he gets upset about?<br> That poor genius...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Um, excuse me. This is a sword training ground, so those who aren&#39;t Sabers...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Nay. We are eligible persons.<br> We have come here following the lens.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! For some reason, this lens that fell from thesky fits exactly in the palm of my hand.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Since then, I&#39;ve heard a voice telling me to come here.<br> It&#39;s been going on about defeating some source of evil in space.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> It&#39;s real annoying, like it&#39;s latched onto me. When I heard about an evil from space, I couldn&#39;t back down.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;ve been looking forward to this! You know the kind of anime they show in summer and stuff, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You know! During summer vacation, they have those ones where they fly into space and kill some villain and save the princess and stuff!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn! I just love a good adventure!<br> As a guy, it&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d love to do just once!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> So, whether you like it or not, I&#39;m helping myself to that spacecraft! I&#39;m gonna have myself a little spin in it!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Kintoki... You&#39;re becoming more and more American all the time... This is why Shuten drinks...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Oh, she&#39;s not drinking out of desperation but more for entertainment. I mean, a guy as crazy as this, it&#39;s the perfect side dish for first class sake.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey! If it ain&#39;t Fox!<br> Hey, are you friends with that woman?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You sure as hell better not call her here!<br> If you did, this place would be a battlefield!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Why the hell would I want to expose your love affairs?<br> Don&#39;t worry. I wouldn&#39;t call her here even if you asked me to.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> You can be a dumb couple all by yourselves.<br> That&#39;s not the kind of thing anyone else needs to see.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whew... That was about to get dangerous...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That woman is unsurpassed in crushing a man&#39;s dreams.<br> She&#39;s the same kind of devil as that Stheno chick...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Huh?<br> Captain\u2606Nikola? You are the Captain, right?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> The one and only, lady lacking in physical charm.<br> I am the one and only Nikola Tesla\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> With the help of Bell, I intercepted your conversation from ten kilometers off\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> In that Servant-verse you speak of, namely in Universe, is there a genius of my caliber!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> What? But aren&#39;t you Captain\u2606Nikola, the rival of the Dark Doctor, Sanity Gilles?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Good heavens!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> This is unbelievable! Unbelievable, all of you!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Even on a scale as large as the universe, I have been proven to be a genius!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like we won&#39;t need to do any more gathering...<br> Huh? Emiya-senpai, have you noticed something?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> No, I haven&#39;t noticed anything or realized anything.<br> But I think we must battle that group.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I just remembered something I have to do, so I&#39;d like to get back as soon as possible. Lily. I would like to see how your skills have improved.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Yes, if you would like, Emiya-senpai!<br> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m terribly sorry, you in the sunglasses!<br> My hand slipped again. Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hff\u2014That...was...golden...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hmm. If I am to be destroyed by something from the universe, then I am quite satisfied...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I have but one question, Lady X.<br> Is my name not Doctor Lightning where you are from?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It has only ever been Captain\u2606Nikola. Why do you ask?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> So... Captain, is it?</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Over 80% of moving parts damaged. I judge further operation to be impossible, so I will self-destruct.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> ...However, a Servant that dreams...<br> That has a nice ring to it. Truly...nostalgic.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Whether they are insignificant bliss or overblown fantasies, dreams are a human privilege. That is what I learned in that city.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> However... You, lily-white knight, and you, Master...</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> The obstruction to that dream isn&#39;t far at all. From the data that I have collected, I have elucidated her goal.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> Don&#39;t misjudge... Even if the actions are born from good intentions, there is no justice in those that come from the future.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong><br> That spacecraft\u2014is not a vehicle for\u2014transporting dreams\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kintoki, Nikola, and Babbage have all disappeared with this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We were also able to retrieve the spacecraft part that they had acquired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Could what Babbage have said...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s about X...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, well, it&#39;s pretty obvious...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> ...Ms. X...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Babbagen...you are a scholar in this world as well. But you look like a tea kettle.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Well, I guess I have no choice. At this point, why don&#39;t I tell you the truth behind my real purpose?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Why does Heroine X attack the entire Saber Class?<br> The details are in the next episode!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Next, Lily Wars, the final episode!<br> \u201CLet your tears flow, said the Saber.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Don&#39;t miss it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Oh, you mean, this episode was just drawing out the story?</p><h2 id="episode-v-answers-of-x" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episode-v-answers-of-x" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episode V: Answers of X</h2><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s listen to your story.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes. That moving suit of armor&#39;s final words intrigue me.<br> You there, X. What is it that you&#39;re scheming?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Scheming? Really?<br> I think Ms. X is merely selfish and secretive, that&#39;s all...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Yes, well that kind of person is called conniving.<br> Whereas you, Lily, are just too innocent.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> I&#39;m just going to ignore those accusations.<br> My stomach has started to hurt\u2661</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Quit it, romance-for-brains and outsiders.<br> Also, change out of that sci-fi outfit, Red Coat.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Tsk. (Damn, she&#39;s won&#39;t allow it, huh?)</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Lily. Nero.<br> And you, Fujimaru and Shieldy.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I said I came to this era to save the world\u2014<br> To save a future that had begun to crumble.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> To be perfectly frank, the cause is Lily. You too, Nero.<br> It&#39;s you ladies.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> It&#39;s us!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Your Majesty... Are you going to have a World Tour Concert in the future?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How dare you!? Besides, wouldn&#39;t a World Tour Concert from me save the future?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> No, you ladies will do nothing. Well, the Red One&#39;s concert tour did bring Planet Rome to its ruins.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Yes. It was so bad even Altera ran away from it.<br> But I am not here to speak on such trivial matters!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You Sabers will do nothing. However, your mere presence causes trouble for the future.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Why? Because we&#39;re too sexy!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Enough of that.<br> This is serious, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you listened closely.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Get this. You may find it hard to believe, but in the future, there are many of you.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Actually, there are many of \u201Cus.\u201D There are so many that the whole world could end up at war.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Excuse me.<br> ...You&#39;re really serious about this, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> You bet I am! Why would I make up such a story to make myself look good!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> The future is flooded with the Saber Class, and the inflation is out of control.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Due to that, the Class value has plummeted and the Servant-verse has fallen into an unprecedented economic crisis.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> If it continues, the Lancer Class will be annihilated...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...and the Archer Class will all be rounded up as criminals and imprisoned.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Because of this, the free Servant-verse will lose all meaning. So I devoted myself to coming back here to the past.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Either I must destroy the Saber Class that will saturate us... Or eliminate whatever the cause is from history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I-I see. So that&#39;s why you so obstinately attack the Saber Class...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hmm, but don&#39;t you think there&#39;s something odd about that?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> If you&#39;re trying to expel the entire Saber Class, wouldn&#39;t that include Lily?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s right.<br> I am a Saber that shouldn&#39;t even exist...</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> You could even call me one of the causes of the Saber Class saturation that you speak of, Ms. X.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> N-No, Lily is all right.<br> Destroying all the Sabers is not right.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I mean, if I don&#39;t leave at least one, then I myself will never be born.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> And the person that is most suited to that role is you, Lily!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, I would agree with that conclusion.<br> But why not I?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious?<br> Your character is far too strong for it, and most of all...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;re talking like this, you don&#39;t resemble me in the least.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Anyway, though there are many things about you that I find inexcusable, I will forgive you for now\u2014</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nero! Watch out!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Guah!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh! You&#39;ve shown your weakness, Heroine X!<br> You disappoint me to my very core!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Making peace with Red, of all things - how preposterous!<br> You have no right to call yourself Heroine X!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> X!<br> Who exactly are you!?

Ha-hah!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The killer from the shadows, assassination is my forte!<br> I will be the last Saber!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> X!?<br> But wait, she&#39;s right here, so what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Right... She is an imitation of me!<br> What is the meaning of this!?</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> I am no imitation of you. I am Heroine Z!<br> I am the Saber that destroys all Sabers!</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> X! Your softness surpasses that of marshmallows and clouds alike. If the mission is to destroy all Sabers\u2014</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> Then you should have foreseen that another Heroine would appear that would kill her!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not likely anyone would foresee that kind of Ouroboros connection.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I agree. It&#39;s like asking which came first, the chicken or the egg?</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> Well, yes, I guess that&#39;s true!<br> But this ends here! I am, after all, the last!</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> I am the assassin born to kill X, as the result of her traveling back in time.

I&#39;m pleased that you&#39;re shocked.<br> It&#39;s otherwise known as Ninja Art Saber Infinite Hells.</p><p><strong>Z:</strong><br> I hear there&#39;s a candy in the East that shows the same face no matter how much you cut it. I based it on that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s Golden!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!<br> In a way, it&#39;s a good thing Kintoki isn&#39;t here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on, Tamamo, we need a witty comment!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> What? I don&#39;t think this is particularly mysterious.<br> Frankly, I can do something similar.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> In fact, with mine, they aren&#39;t just shadow clones, each one is an independent individual!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> There&#39;s Tamamo-Gucci, who fancies high-class goods, Tamamo-Delmo, who loves decorating her home...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...the wild beast, Tamamo-Cat, the capable and beautiful secretary, Tamamo-vitch...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...the ideal princess, Tamamo-no-hime, the deep and mysterious Tamamo-alia...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> ...and let&#39;s see, there are all kinds of others.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Frankly, whatever the current fad is, there are about three of them with different powers and looks\u2661</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...That is so pointless...<br> Now that truly is a waste!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong><br> Hey! What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I mean that you&#39;re an idiot!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This is no time to fool around! This battle strategy is a headache, but the fact is, there&#39;s a threat!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Archer, Caster!<br> You back up Fujimaru and Lily!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This is Lily&#39;s fight\u2014We&#39;ll watch your back!<br> Now&#39;s the time to fight, Knight of the White Lily!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Thank you, Nero!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Master, direct me!<br> This is the Final Battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Huh... A hundred Saber-faces...<br> Two hundred Saber-faces...three hundred Saber-faces...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u2014What a horrible nightmare! That damn Heroine Z! Using a cowardly sneak attack\u2014</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Z&#39;s gone?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Thank goodness, you&#39;re awake, Ms. X!<br> Look at this!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> With the help of Fujimaru,<br> we soundly defeated Z!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u2014<br> Lily, you...you saved me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, X.<br> Senpai, X is awake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good Morning, X.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> G-Good morning.<br> So you fought as well, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was one rough battle!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I can tell by the wretched spectacle upon this plain.<br> Just how many times did Excalibur fire recklessly?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> This is exactly what&#39;s so bad about the wielders of Holy Swords... Wait, I&#39;m one of those too.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Actually, it&#39;s believed that the random firing of Holy Swords gave birth to Altrium particles.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> People often joke, \u201CHa-ha-ha! After blasting these clean energy beams, we&#39;ve actually polluted the atmosphere! Isn&#39;t that nuts?\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> But that may not be a lie after all...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Excuse me. I don&#39;t see Red... I mean, Nero...<br> Don&#39;t tell me she was done in by Z?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nero and the others have already left.<br> \u201CIf I am around, it will only ruin X&#39;s awakening!\u201D she said.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She also left this message. \u201CThere is something you must say upon your awakening!\u201D she said.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s none of her business.<br> I really do not get along with her at all.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u2014All right.<br> Lily! I have something to say to you!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Y-Yes?<br> What is it, Ms. X?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I must apologize to you!<br> I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Just like Z said, I was belittling you!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I thought that even if I trained you, I could still handle you... So I was going to leave only you alive in this era.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Then after I returned to the future,<br> I was going to cut you down!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s very brave of you to say, but you&#39;re merciless, X!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You call yourself...a Holy Sword Warrior...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Don&#39;t interrupt me!<br> I seriously regret this!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Well, I mean, I&#39;m entirely at fault.<br> From beginning to end, I was merely using you.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Therefore, your training end\u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Yes, of course!<br> We&#39;re going to continue my training, right, Ms. X!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> \u2014Why?<br> I told you I deceived you. Didn&#39;t you hear me?</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> No, you didn&#39;t. From the very start, you have believed in me.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> You said, \u201CThis Saber, I can train.\u201D<br> That&#39;s why I was able to fight with all my might.</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> I mean\u2014</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Since you trusted and praised me so much,<br> I must do my best to repay that kindness.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Oh, well... I guess you could take it that way too.<br> ...I&#39;m at a loss.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Fujimaru.<br> What should I do about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You may as well just resign yourself to training her.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Well, I guess.<br> But I&#39;m not really sure how to do that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just be honest with her, and accept it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I am always honest!<br> I only say what I want to say!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Well, at any rate, my mission hasn&#39;t changed, but I think I&#39;ll take a break from it for a while.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Until Du Stallion II is repaired,<br> I will continue with your training.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to be working with you again, Lily.<br> I&#39;ll continue with the Spartan exercises, so prepare yourself!</p><p><strong>Lily:</strong><br> Thank you! Work with me until my Noble Phantasm reaches max level, Ms. X!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s everything you wanted, but is it satisfactory, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Shieldy... Mash and Lily are enjoying some combat together. Since it&#39;s just us two alone, let&#39;s have a talk.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Nero said this as well.<br> That only those that live now can change the future.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> That&#39;s wrong. For people like Lily and me who were born of certain results, we cannot change those results.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Even if Lily were to improve immensely and become a King, the land she would rule has been destroyed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...But Nero said it could be changed...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t elaborate quite enough.<br> But yes, that is what Nero said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, that can&#39;t be. That&#39;s the whole reason for Chaldea.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Chaldea and we are different. Chaldea works to return absolutely everything to its true state.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It&#39;s not to change history...or throw it into chaos. It&#39;s the final stronghold for returning human history back to normal.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> One day I will become part of Chaldea,<br> and I look forward to that day.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Now listen. No matter what Lily does, she cannot change her destiny.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> But that process, that&#39;s something different. Even if the endpoint is the same, the pathway to it can be chosen.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> ...Take a country that has fallen to ruin.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Whether that ruin was tragic or tranquil, only the people of that time know.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> There is no way for the people of the future to know.<br> Only the people of that time can actually know what it was like.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> The things that Lily does will fulfill that possibility. The original King Arthur was unable to fulfill the dream...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> It is an entirely hypothetical story that left no mark on real history. Only she can make the glorious journey.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Well, you could go through as much suffering as I did, only to come to an even worse end!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foo, foou!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> At any rate, Lily and the others, including myself, owe a lot to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> I look forward to working with you more, Master!</p><p><strong>X:</strong><br> Whenever you face a tough Saber, feel free to call upon my Holy Sword!</p>', 844);
