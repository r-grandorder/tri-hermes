The notion that they could defeat a god is similarly dubious.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But when a human is summoned as a Servant, such lamentations should no longer be given voice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In China, there are two expressions that convey this idea well: \u201CSh\xE9ng j\xF9 m\xF9 du\xE0n,\u201D and \u201CShu\u01D0 d\u012B sh\xED chu\u0101n.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Roughly translated, they mean \u201CLittle strokes fell great oaks\u201D and \u201CDripping water penetrates stone.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therein lies the essence of human progress.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Interesting. So that is how the older and wiser Lord Shuwen sees things.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> You are quite a change of pace from your Lancer counterpart.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Did he do something to upset you? ...Aha, I see.<br> You challenged my younger self to a duel.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I did try to control myself, but I am afraid my excitement got the better of me while I was training.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> It seems I still have a long way to go.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I suppose it would be uncouth of me to apologize for instigating it then.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> That said, Houzouin...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Surely a man with your spirit and virtue could have resisted the temptation.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Is that not what being a Servant entails?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I am afraid it is not as easy as you might think.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Although I lived to the age of sixty, and still retain memories\u2013or rather, records of that time, I do not have any of the more temperate sensibilities I gained with age.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I have no fondness for fighting to the death,<br> but I do get a bit hotheaded from time to time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say! You guys came dangerously close to killing each other, you know!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Haha, I am sorry about that, Master. I knew I should stop, but I simply couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad I stopped you guys in time. It wasn&#39;t easy...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Knowing what I was like in my youth, I&#39;m sure this younger me must have caused a lot of trouble for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Come to think of it,<br> Lord Shuwen, have you not met your younger self yet?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> No, I haven&#39;t. If I did, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that we would end up killing each other.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure my younger self knows that as well as I do. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve made it a point to never be in the same place.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Why would you end up killing each other?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Is it because he would not want to see what he is like when he is older?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hardly. If anything, it&#39;s the other way around.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I&#39;ve devoted my life to perfecting my martial arts. If I&#39;d come across an older version of me when I was young, I&#39;d want to fight him too.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure he sees me as either the culmination or the conclusion of everything he&#39;s worked towards.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> And as a young man, he would have no reason not to see how he measures up to that as he is now.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed. I could not agree more.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> After all, it would be impossible for anyone besides a Servant to truly fight against oneself.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> And if that other self is a more mature version...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...the urge to resist seeing whether your current self is stronger than your future self would be irresistible.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Yes, precisely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But you&#39;re not going to fight each other?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I will if you ask us to,<br> Master...but I know you never would.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Very true. It would be one thing if you were on opposing sides, but in any other circumstance...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Nonetheless, I would also be very interested to learn which of you is stronger!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious? It would be my Lancer self.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, which of you IS stronger?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> My younger, Lancer self would say he is.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> And I would agree with him.</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...That said...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...I would still win.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> And as long as I know that for certain, I personally have no desire to fight my younger self.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...But, if you&#39;d still like us to fight even knowing that, Master, I&#39;d be happy to oblige.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...Oho. Now I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I mean that strength alone is not the sole factor in deciding the victor.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> For me, it is not the pinnacle of strength that I seek.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...It may sound like I&#39;m just an old wolf that&#39;s lost his fangs, but this is a domain the Lancer can never reach. Kaka!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Though of course, if he has,<br> that&#39;s all well and good too.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> It would just mean my victory is even more assured.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m still totally lost...</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Heh...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you worry about it, [\u2642 son /\u2640\uFE0F sport}.<br> As a Master, you have your own path to focus on.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hmm. But if that alone doesn&#39;t convince you, there&#39;s an old story I know that might change your mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...A long, long time ago...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...there was a man with fearsome good looks and two viciously powerful fists.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The man desired strength above all else,<br> and fought anyone who would accept his challenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The man won each and every fight, as if that were the only natural outcome.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whether it was through innate talent, or countless hours of diligent training...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...the man kept winning so much that he came to be regarded as an invincible legend...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...even as he left a trail of corpses in his wake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not even stray dogs liked him. And why would they?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The intense bloodlust he gave off frightened all living creatures who encountered him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Although the man had a teacher,<br> and peers he once studied alongside...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...he always preferred solitude.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> The way I&#39;m going, I&#39;ll surely end up dead in a gutter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man figured this is what fate had in store for him, and accepted it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The life of violence he led could only ever result in his own destruction.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>One day, he would fall.<br> But that day would not be today...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Another day, another pile of corpses.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That said, the man did not always finish his battles unharmed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Bruised, bloodied, a ferocious crimson tiger... Even the moon seemed to try to avoid shining its light upon him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Naturally, there was no one around who would ever try to talk to hi\u2013</p><p><strong>Child:</strong></p><p>Hey, what&#39;re you doing?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Hey, what&#39;re you doing?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Yikes, so many dead bodies.<br> Did you kill them, mister?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I&#39;ve resolved to kill no more than one person per day in duels, but this was nothing so honorable as that.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Gotcha. Are you gonna kill me too?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Of course not.<br> You&#39;re hardly worth raising my fists over.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re no fun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man frowned.<br> He had no intention of preaching about morality...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...but he still felt that was not something a child should say.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Go away. This is no sight for children.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> What&#39;s the big deal? Besides, they killed my brother.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...I see. So they were bandits.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Then you should be satisfied now. Go home.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> But, there&#39;s still more of them.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> According to the child...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...these bandits had built a hideout nearby,<br> and struck out from there, raiding nearby villages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And since this area was too remote for the authorities to help, there was nothing the villagers could do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He also told the man how his brother was killed for daring to fight back...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...keeping his voice calm and measured all the while.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man had no interest in fighting injustice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But he knew that if he did nothing, the child would soon end up following in his brother&#39;s footsteps.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He could see the determination in the child&#39;s eyes, could see that he was willing to fight the bandits no matter what.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man had no obligation to help the child,<br> and no quarrel with the bandits.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Still...</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...Do you mean to go kill them yourself?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man then noticed the child was holding a small dagger close to his chest.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. I&#39;ve gotta avenge my brother.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> You won&#39;t survive.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re too young to decide the manner of your death.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> But if I don&#39;t do it, who will!?</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Somebody&#39;s gotta make them pay!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Somebody, hm. So you don&#39;t care who that someone may be.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> If a perfect stranger can go in your place\u2013if it is not necessary that they be desirous of revenge\u2013then there is no reason that someone cannot be me.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Give me that dagger.<br> I&#39;ll bury it in their hearts myself.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man continued, falteringly.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> The truth is that I have no reason to seek vengeance myself. That&#39;s why I go around searching for opportunities.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> It makes no difference to me if these bandits end up rich, or if a kid ends up throwing his life away.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> But, as luck would have it,<br> our fates have intertwined today.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I will honor that entangling and serve as a weapon in your stead. I&#39;ll be your spear, your fists.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> If you can swear to yourself that your anger and hatred are justified...</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...then I will use these fists of mine to crush those bandits.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> ...You mean it?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Crouching down, the man looked the child straight in the eye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The child then handed the man his dagger,<br> tears spilling down his face.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong><br> Please...avenge my brother.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Very well. Your life is now in my hands.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>As the man walked towards the bandits&#39; hideout,<br> he let his fighting spirit grow hotter and hotter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Not even a starving tiger would dare attack him now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>His bloodlust and delight in battle surged to their boiling points, and he made no effort to hide either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even the sleeping birds were startled awake by his murderous aura.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> Hah? Why&#39;re the birds makin&#39; so much noise this late at night?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Hmm. Which of you will be the first to die?<br> It makes no difference to me.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> Huh? Who the hell do you think you\u2013</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> A-aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> There is nothing to discuss. No need for words.<br> Bring all your comrades here. Quickly.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> S-somebody help! Hurry!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> What&#39;s goin&#39; on? The village hire some martial artist or something?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> What&#39;re you so afraid of? He&#39;s just one man!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Now, now, go easy on him.<br> He did well, at least for a bandit.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all here now. It would be much more trouble to track you all down myself.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> I&#39;ve counted all of you. If the number of corpses fails to match that count when this is over, I&#39;ll know how many of you turned tail and ran.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man&#39;s words stoked the bandits&#39; murderous rage further.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But it was too late. The man knew that if they truly meant to kill him...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...they should have attacked before surrounding him.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> None of you will leave here alive. Now fight me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man smiled like a wolf baring its fangs.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABandit:</strong><br> He&#39;s...a monster...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The bandits&#39; lifeless bodies were strewn across the ground, just as the man&#39;s own body was now bruised and battered.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But that made little difference to either his feet or his fists.</p><p><strong>Bandit Leader:</strong><br> A-aaaaaah! Please! Spare me!</p><p><strong>Bandit Leader:</strong><br> I promise I&#39;ll do anything you want!<br> I&#39;ll never kill again as long as I live!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Too bad you didn&#39;t have your change of heart sooner. This is payback for all the villagers you and your men killed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Blood stained the blade a vivid red. The man continued on his spree, mercilessly felling bandits left and right.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...Guess I should go give the dagger back.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> But I&#39;d better wash the blood off somewhere first...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The man made his way down the gloomy mountain,<br> back to the boy&#39;s village.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> What the...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was no one there to be found. Not even a sign that anyone had lived there recently.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was clear to see that the area had been abandoned for years.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...I see. I knew retribution should be carried out swiftly...</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...but I never considered that I&#39;d missed the chance entirely. I truly am useless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Taking the dagger out from his shirt pocket,<br> he found it had already half-crumbled to dust.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> ...I wonder whose vengeance I carried out.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> Whoever you are, I bet you would have liked to do it yourself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...And so, the man left the deserted village behind, with only the wind howling in his wake.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...Strong as I was back then,<br> I still couldn&#39;t make a difference.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter how strong you are,<br> you still can&#39;t change the past.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Hmm. Still, it sounds like there was nothing you could have done about that. Sometimes, people just die for no reason.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> In fact, neither life nor death carries any special meaning.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Those villagers do deserve to be mourned,<br> but to try to save all of them...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Kaka. I am well aware.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I am far from the Buddha. I&#39;ve never thought to even try to save all lives in this world.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> That said...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> There are things I can teach, and lessons I can convey.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> What I lacked back then was the composure to realize that.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I am neither a hero, nor a villain.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> So I thought, at the very least, I should leave what I&#39;ve learned behind for others to study.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Even I have something I want to protect. These fists can be quite useful at getting to the crux of certain matters.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...Still, Lord Shuwen, what you describe is nothing less than a break with your past self.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Is there nothing about that you regret?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Regret? Of course.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Seeing myself grow weaker by the day...<br> Seeing my fists grow dull and ineffective...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> It would be stranger if I had no regrets at all.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> But, all those regrets are gone, now that I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> ...Aha, I see. You make an excellent point!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Late though it may be for me, perhaps that is what I should strive for too.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> All right, I think that&#39;s enough idle talk for now.<br> Shall we get going, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Very well.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Indeed! I&#39;m glad we had this talk.</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> Now I am more eager to wield my spear than ever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;re all set then?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Of course. These fists are yours to command as you see fit.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...His body grows weaker by the day,<br> and with it, his fists grow duller.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> One can easily imagine his younger self mocking him,<br> saying something like...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u201CWhat were you doing with your life up till now, old man?\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But the old man would just laugh it off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He knows now that his fists are no longer a weapon he wields solely for his own sake...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but one that cuts a path forward for those who follow behind...</p>', 260);
