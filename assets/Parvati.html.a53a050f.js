Rayshift is a success.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good, good. Now then, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let me go over this again: you&#39;re in Fuyuki, a rural Japanese city.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re here to investigate the odd reading we got in this area.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So...see anything?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anything or anyone that seems out of place or that catches your attention in your general vicinity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There is a woman...dressed in Indian attire...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, good work, Fujimaru. Looks like you got it in one!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She&#39;s definitely the source of the odd reading we got. Looks like she&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But she is no ordinary Servant. I&#39;m getting a Divine Spirit response from her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh-ho. I knew this would be a special case since Sheba interpreted it as irregular when we detected it, but I never imagined it would be a Divine Spirit Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She doesn&#39;t seem hostile, but we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. Proceed with caution, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay... Um, excuse me, do you have a moment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hello. You there. Can I speak to you for a bit...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> !? Eh? Uh, yes...? Wh-what is it!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Um, I know I&#39;ve been wandering around the same spot for a while now...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So of course you think I&#39;m suspicious, but I promise I am absolutely not a shady sort!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Um, forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Are you by chance a Master who has formed a contract with a Servant...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Indeed I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I contract with lots of Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, wonderful. Then I don&#39;t have to explain all the basics to you.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not the least bit shady. I am\u2013get this\u2013a wayward Servant who has nothing to hide!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, thanks for that polite explanation. But it&#39;s not just about being polite.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (She acts like the passive type, but she&#39;s got a heck of a stubborn attitude...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Despite her appearance, she&#39;s almost certainly no pushover. Be careful, Fujimaru)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not nice, Da Vinci. She was honest about being a wayward Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And while I know neither her circumstances, nor her True Name, I am sure she is a wonderful Servant!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, are they your friends? It&#39;s nice to be in such a lively group.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> They are transmitting their voices from somewhere across both space and time...am I correct?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s a great interpretation. It&#39;s nice to have a Divine Spirit who&#39;s quick on the uptake.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You can tell I&#39;m a Divine Spirit...a goddess Servant? Even with my weakened Spirit Origin?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. It&#39;s difficult to explain, but we have encountered our share of goddesses. And every one of them has been pretty...distinctive...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh my. What wonderful encounters. You must have gone through intensive training.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know which goddesses you encountered, nor do I know what kind of humans were used as vessels...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But since you already understand the basics, I see no reason to hide my identity. Allow me to formally introduce myself:</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I am P\u0101rvat\u012B. I&#39;ve manifested here using this girl&#39;s body as a vessel... She is someone to whom I am attuned in both body and soul.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> P\u0101rvat\u012B...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A vessel? So, a Pseudo-Servant!?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes. It has been something of a confluence of coincidences.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P\u0101rvat\u012B is a famous goddess from Indian myth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She is the divine wife of Shiva, and is the embodiment of kindness and grace. She doesn&#39;t seem to be a dangerous Divine Spirit, which is a relief.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. If that woman is really P\u0101rvat\u012B, you&#39;re not in immediate danger.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, there really aren&#39;t any myths about P\u0101rvat\u012B doing battle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Goddesses tend to be pretty fickle. They just love punishing humans at even the slightest hint of provocation or disrespect.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But as long as she is truly P\u0101rvat\u012B, anything dark\u2013Wait a minute...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A goddess who&#39;s portfolio includes beauty and gentleness... This is bad. Really bad!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Because she&#39;s not a goddess of war and beauty, but she&#39;s exclusively a goddess of beauty! She&#39;s the same! The same as me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s just put Da Vinci&#39;s antics aside...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m curious about the individual who became her vessel. Um, excuse me, Miss P\u0101rvat\u012B...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> May I ask what has happened to the owner of that body of yours?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You&#39;re asking about the state of this body&#39;s owner... I didn&#39;t think you would ask that question so quickly...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You&#39;re bold, though you seem mild-mannered. Or, at least, you&#39;re certainly cautious. You have the kouhai thing going on, and we have similar personalities...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Miss P\u0101rvat\u012B?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Nothing. Were I in your shoes, I would have asked the same question.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The original owner of this body is not here.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That is... She isn&#39;t asleep, and she hasn&#39;t been destroyed or anything...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Being a Divine Spirit, this is embarrassing to admit, but she and I merged together seamlessly\u2661</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-merged!? D-does that mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The human girl&#39;s soul...um, embraced the Divine Spirit P\u0101rvat\u012B...or rather, didn&#39;t lose to you...?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, I know...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I may not be a god of war, but even so, to be able to retake control from a Divine Heroic Spirit...I&#39;m speechless myself.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This body is...well, it&#39;s basically me now. You know, I&#39;m told that I am gloomy, scary, strong-willed...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> My memories and behavior are all P\u0101rvat\u012B, but expressed through her personality.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> We combined our good aspects and cut away the bad parts in a sort of mutual consensus, creating a new Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The girl&#39;s past and memories were sealed when we merged. After all, no human can bear the full weight of a god&#39;s mind and memories.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But in exchange, my preferences and decision-making were all entrusted to her human nature.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This may be hard to understand, but...let&#39;s see... Are you familiar with the concept of magical girls?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not too far off from that concept. It&#39;s a temporary state I can&#39;t change back from, but were I to do so, I would forget everything as soon as I did.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Magical girl...I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know much about magical girls,but I think I get the idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm. I figured we&#39;d find a vessel once I knew we were dealing with a Divine Spirit, but this is a pretty far cry from what we saw in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In that case, it was a goddess using a human as her core, but this seems to be a human using a goddess as her own core.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Either way, that girl must have some sort of connection with the Holy Grail and Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Typically, the human the god&#39;s compatible with is just used as a vessel. The god puts a small part of their power into the vessel and kind of forces their way into that person to manifest as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s how it usually works for a Pseudo-Servant. You seem to be something of a special case, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But ultimately, you&#39;re not really much different from the other Divine Spirits in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, so there are others like me. That&#39;s good to know.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not particularly comfortable with excessive fear or worship from those around me.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I would very much like for you to interact with me naturally, just like how you treat anyone else.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for your concern, P\u0101rvat\u012B. By the way\u2013</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, you can call me Par. My name is kind of long and a bit hard to say, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay... I&#39;m a little apprehensive about that, but... Very well, Par...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Okay! Hee hee. This is my first time going by a nickname. I&#39;m really being quite sociable, aren&#39;t I? That makes me happy.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The owner of this body and I are both naturally very shy.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But by combining the best parts of ourselves, I believe we&#39;re better able to speak our mind and not be so timid.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> We can assert ourselves and say what we like.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Just that fact makes this manifestation worth it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, Par...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s a goddess like you doing in a place like this?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh yes, I forgot! There&#39;s no time for me to be standing around here being all happy!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um, well, simply put, I&#39;m looking for something. I know it&#39;s around here somewhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean in Fuyuki, during this age?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes. This city seems to have some sort of connection to my body...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And so I thought that if I wandered this place, I would eventually come across it...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But this Fuyuki seems to be different than the one my body is familiar with...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Embarrassing as it is to admit, I seem to have gotten lost and landed myself in a bit of a bind...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that we know what&#39;s going on, what do you think, Senpai? Should we help out Par?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. If that&#39;s her reason for being there, granting her wish will definitely lead us to some answers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want us to help?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We do have some connection with Fuyuki, and we can provide a bit of backup from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We may be able to be of some help.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Well, if you really want to, then I&#39;d welcome it! But...are you sure you want to help me? We only just met.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Give a thumbs up)</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, what kindhearted people you are! I must show my appreciation for your generosity!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Oh, my apologies. I have yet to learn your names. May I ask what they are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Fujimaru. So your name is Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes, I think that is a wonderful name. Pleased to meet you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And...Miss Mash and Miss Genius Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So the thing you&#39;re looking for...do you have any other clues other than that it&#39;s in this city?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um...no... This is more of an instinctual thing, so I think I would know if it were nearby...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then we have no choice but to search the area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s map out the area, and we&#39;ll keep track of where you&#39;ve covered as you do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This could take awhile, but if you just do it bit by bit, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find what Par is looking for eventually.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Wow...and I thought you were the same sort as me, but you take initiative much more than I do, Mash!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But that is very promising! Running into you is the best thing that could have happened to me here. I&#39;m so lucky!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s get going! I&#39;m counting on everyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Par, that thing you&#39;re carrying... Is that a lance?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I was wondering the same. Your Class is Lancer, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve never heard of P\u0101rvat\u012B carrying a lance...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right. This actually isn&#39;t mine.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I borrowed it from my husband, Shiva.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s Shiva&#39;s trident, Trishula? So that&#39;s why you&#39;re a Lancer.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Since I&#39;m only borrowing it, I can&#39;t do nearly as much with it as Shiva could.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And I customized it a little so I could use it easier.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably far from what a lance should look like... Well, no, it&#39;s probably just not as cool because I&#39;m the one who customized it.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I...may be a goddess, but I&#39;m kind of a klutz.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ummm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not true! No matter how clumsy you are, I am sure you&#39;re a very diligent worker, Par!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have absolutely no reason to believe that, but I&#39;m certain of it because...because I feel such a close connection with you!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re no klutz! You&#39;re beautiful, goddess!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> R-really? You think so!? You speak so much more passionately than I could... You make me blush!</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But hearing you say that about me gives me so much confidence!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I may not have as much firepower as Shiva, but since I&#39;ve manifested...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That proves that I am a full-fledged Lancer Servant! Hi-yah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hi-yah...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Um... What was that wobbly move?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s...it&#39;s a \u201Chi-yah!\u201D It&#39;s what all martial artists shout...!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Ungh. Drat. You&#39;re doubting me now, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m a beginner at being a Lancer, but I am still a goddess!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I may not look cool, but I&#39;m definitely really strong when I fight. Probably.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> If an enemy comes, I&#39;ll just slap, slap, slap them. Like this!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I may borrow Shiva&#39;s power, but I still plan on doing it my way: by being splendid and graceful!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t summon any weird shadows or anything!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Eh? (What does she mean by \u201Cweird shadows\u201D?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I think she&#39;s trying to show that she&#39;s strong, in her own way...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It might be rude of me to say this, but she seems more elegant and cute, really...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (A goddess will always be a goddess, I suppose...)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, even if we encounter enemies on our way, there&#39;s nothing to worry about, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You were all kind when I was in a tough spot. Now, I swear on my honor as a goddess...I will protect you all!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm... Normally, you wouldn&#39;t expect much from a goddess like P\u0101rvat\u012B in a melee battle...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But it&#39;s a different story if you consider the mythology surrounding her. If you trace her roots, you&#39;ll find quite the warlike\u2013</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh? That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...Cursed Arm over there?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like he&#39;s doing something shifty by the road. I wonder...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Par?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure, but...I sense something.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> He is a bad man.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, that might be TECHNICALLY true in terms of alignment...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I feel that...we need to proceed with extreme caution. This feeling is bubbling up within me...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And, what should I call it... It&#39;s just a vague association, but there&#39;s a smell on him that bothers me...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s like...this terrible...smell of bugs...?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s all very instinctual, and I can&#39;t express it very well...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But anyway! The fact of the matter is that he is an evil man!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And a goddess like me simply cannot allow that to stand!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Fuuu...haaa (deep breaths)...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Hold it right there, suspicious masked man!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Oh? Are you perhaps addressing me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re the only masked man around!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well... If those weirdo Island Masks were around...</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hahaha. Very true. What business do you have with me?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I see a young lady who has been glaring at me for the past few minutes...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> As I believe that sincere words will reach even those who are evil, I will ask you this:</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> What am I doing? Hmmm, now that I think of it, that is quite a profound question.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Many factors have led me here. However, to put it simply...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Perhaps it is best to say that I am disposing of those who are empty, or those who&#39;ve lost their place...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Wh-what did you say!?</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Heh heh heh... Sir! I&#39;ve found some! There&#39;s a ton over by the river!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Oh, so it seems... Let&#39;s head over right away. This is very exciting, hahaha...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> H-he even has some mean-looking minions...!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> They have some nerve. I mean...wait a minute!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I know that the modern world is full of wicked, soulless people who have lost their way!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But even so, as a goddess, they are all my beloved children!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I will not turn a blind eye to the senseless murder of innocents!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Stay right where you are, you murdering assassin. It&#39;s probably not hard to tell, but I am mad!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Tremble)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That look on Par&#39;s face...! She&#39;s intimidating even for a goddess!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Bingo. P\u0101rvat\u012B is usually described only as Shiva&#39;s wife...a goddess who is very mild-mannered...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But since she is Shiva&#39;s wife, P\u0101rvat\u012B is often identified with his OTHER wife, Durga, who is the goddess of battle...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And on top of that, she is also identified as Kali, who was born from the two gods. Long story short, if you get P\u0101rvat\u012B mad, she&#39;s terrifying!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This is no time for idle chatter.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> If you are truly a disciple of justice, you cannot let these evil men walk free!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now come, Fujimaru! We must give these nasty, bug-smelling murderers divine punishment!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Ugh! There&#39;s no reason to fight to the death here! I&#39;ll just be the bigger man and say you got me!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh my... You&#39;re a lot more accommodating than I expected.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So that horrid, filthy scent of insects was just something that rubbed off onto you? You must scrub hard to get the smell off of you, understood?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Well, not really, but men, put your weapons down. Do as this woman says.</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Damn! Why!?</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> But we just met you, our mentor...and we were on the verge of bettering ourselves...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Bettering yourselves?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...I&#39;m going to ask you again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What were you doing here? Can you tell us again?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...? I don&#39;t remember lying to you, so my answer has not changed. I&#39;m disposing of those that are empty\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, can you please clarify? Without the poetic assassin phrasing...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hm...so it wasn&#39;t clear, huh? Well, let me put it in plainer terms...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> We were picking up all the empty bottles and cans people left here. What of it?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But you&#39;re a Hassan!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What does that matter?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> I had some time on my hands, so I pick up things that can be recycled. I&#39;m the sort who collects all the daggers I throw from the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> And this habit has left it somewhat painful for me to see the culture of fast consumption in this age. It can be so terribly wasteful.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> After a while, the young men who had time and shared in my beliefs gathered here and began to assemble and volunteer their time to assist me.</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Yeah...our mentor became known for turning our delinquent ways around for the better...</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Hawkmo from third street even landed his dream job at an IT company...and I am also going to start work at this company called Gold Mansomething.</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t judge people by their looks, you know... What matters is leading an honest, hardworking life!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Hahaha. Indeed. They can save face and regain something of an identity. Heh.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Grr... I don&#39;t know why, but he gets on my nerves. Maybe we had a connection in our past lives...)</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Can I keep talking? Um...</p><p><strong>Mohawk:</strong><br> Right. Even if he was judged by his looks, no matter what his past was, our mentor&#39;s unwavering spirit to keep going was what attracted us to him.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Heh, you think too much of me, boy. But a little flattery never hurt anyone. Keep going.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But...you&#39;re still an assassin, correct?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the bad guy of all bad guys who, under the orders of a bug-smelling Master, killed both humans and Servants!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> ...? I don&#39;t quite know what you mean.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Yes, I am an assassin...a nominally evil being.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> But now, I am first and foremost the Servant of Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong><br> Without being ordered to do so, I would certainly never attack at random.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I forgot to mention...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But Hassan is actually a nice guy.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...A-ah...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Such a thing is possible!? I&#39;m terribly sorry! I am such klutz in every possible way!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh...I can&#39;t believe I did that... I feel just awful...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t think too much about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No worries! It happens!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master is right, Par.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyone can make mistakes, you know! Even Hassan laughed it off and forgave you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That said, we were all a bit shocked at how mad you got!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You too, right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That incredible\u2013if dark\u2013fighting spirit that was practically pouring from you...it sure reinforced that you are definitely a god!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now I know not to make you mad.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t talk about it! All that anger and it was just a misunderstanding... I&#39;m so embarrassed...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Ahem... Well, there&#39;s one tiny bit of silver lining!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Compared to what happens when I&#39;m REALLY angry, that was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Fortunately, since I&#39;m a Pseudo-Servant, I am one hundred percent good, wholesome goddess!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let that destructive negativity out so easily!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, are you trying to say that your REAL anger is even more intense than what we saw?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...(Smile)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t much of an answer,but let&#39;s try not to tick her off.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> No, you don&#39;t have to worry too much.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What I mean is that you will never see my true fury.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What I&#39;m looking for isn&#39;t around here...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Maybe it is that I&#39;m still unused to this since I just manifested...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh hey, I meant to ask you. Why did you manifest in the first place?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Does it have to do with what you&#39;re looking for?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, no. What I&#39;m seeking is more of a bonus. Or, well, it&#39;s sort of all in my mind.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> There is a legitimate reason for my manifestation. It&#39;s very difficult to put into words though...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But let&#39;s see...it feels like there is something that I must do...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm. If you manifested as a Servant, that means you will need a Master to help you accomplish whatever it is you want to do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can very confidently put forward Fujimaru as highly recommended Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree wholeheartedly. Senpai truly is a reliable Master.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> R-right. I completely forgot. A Servant needs a Master.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Fujimaru is...of course, a pure and just individual.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. It would be best for me to continue receiving Fujimaru&#39;s support... (Stare)</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait!!! You&#39;re not getting away! Pink aerial stunts are a no-no!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! That voice...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Providing minimal explanation) I&#39;m pawtrolling my territory... That&#39;s right, it&#39;s mew!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A wild animal appears!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yep, pretty much a cat. Sneaking in without being called.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior? Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Shut up, you purrpetrator! This is Jaguar&#39;s territory!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Power over life and death...love and death...fish or beef! Know that everything hinges on the whims of the mistress of this territory...ME!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Teacher...! That is such an absurd role!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um...I actually don&#39;t know why I called that thing a teacher... It just came out!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Of course you did. This Jaguar actually stands above all living creatures to be an example to all! I&#39;m the ultimate creature of eduCATion!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna give you a snippet of truth! Eating meat makes you super happy, and naptime is the doorway to your dreams!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh. I tried to make it sound Nirvana-y because there&#39;s an Indian goddess in front of me. What do you think? No good? Aww...I see.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Whatever. I&#39;m being super generous today! Take a look at Student No. EX, who also worships me!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Actually she just dragged me out here! And why are you calling me Student No. EX!?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um...actually, that girl is even more of a rare case than we are. Maybe you could leave her out...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ah! The gang&#39;s back together... I&#39;m feeling invincible! I&#39;ve clinched this!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Arrrgh, this is nuts... Although I kind of understand instinctively calling her \u201Cteacher.\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But...there is someone I&#39;ve never met with Master. Oh, she&#39;s so pretty...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Anyway, I should politely introduce myself to people when I meet them for the first time. Hello, big sister!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Yes, hello, Illyasviel. My name is P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? Did I say my name already?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The world and distant space sometimes align by sheer coincidence, like the light hitting a kaleidoscope to form a distinct and dazzling pattern...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Our encounter must be like that kind of miracle. Either way, I&#39;m glad to see that you are well and happy, Illyasviel.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> O-okay... Thanks...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey! Trying to chat up my student is furbidden!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard enough, meow! This Jaguar is here to object to what you were talking about!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Um...what WERE we talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> About Masters and their Servants...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> About a contract...</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Right! That&#39;s it! I ask of you...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Ahhh, I&#39;ve always wanted to say that line. It feels nice. I KNEW I was the real heroine!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Anyway! I ask of you! Are you pawsitive you want to come to Chaldea!?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Ah, that was what we were talking about. And yes, if I have the chance...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Listen, Chaldea is no ordinary place! Get this: Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Has Emiya...and Emiya...and even another Emiya! On top of that, there&#39;s even a pawsibility that more Emiyas will pop up one day!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Sukhavati!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I dunno, not sure there&#39;ll be more...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s not lying...</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh heh... So whaddaya think? Confused?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Yes. Very...confused!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I like your honesty! Now, do you really think the psyche of a serious kouhai-type would be able to withstand the ridiculous hell that is Chaldea!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Testing that resolve in a furrocious fight is the duty of an educator!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Student No. EX! Now is the time to show our senpai pawers, strengthened by having to endure that weird hell for so long!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What!? So I&#39;m on this side!? I don&#39;t want be on your side! I don&#39;t want to fight against Master!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You idiot! If you do a good job here, your dream of appearing in bloomers won&#39;t have to remain a dream!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want that either!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Are you kitten me? Fine, then how about I help you do your homework for a week?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She stopped moving.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Trying to make an innocent girl do your work by bribing her makes you a terrible teacher! You must be punished!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Gaaah! How could this happen!? We&#39;re both Lancers! So this is what happens when you get a fourth star!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Buh. I guess that means I have to do my homework on my own...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Game, set, and match.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Urgh, so this is your resolve, huh? You&#39;ve got true grit.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But let me ask you again, and this time I want your final answer!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Cute girl who&#39;d be cuter with some sakura petals decorating her: Do you really think you&#39;d be happy if you came to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Yes, I think so.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> To be happy, to make someone else happy...or even to be happy BY making someone else happy...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure there are many different methods.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But no matter what, as long as I am myself, I know the people around me will be happy!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what being a goddess is about?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Got it. If you have that much confidence in yourself, I have nothing more to say!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But...but! It&#39;s just too purrfect! It just doesn&#39;t feel right. Don&#39;t you need SOME kinda dark side to you!?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> (Glare)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Ah-hem. Rest assured. I may have cut away the shadowy parts of myself, but make no mistake, there is such a thing as shadows in the light.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Fujimaru and the others are well aware that I am not JUST the pure, good parts of myself.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I am able to somewhat participate in battle. Like smacking people.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm? Hmmm...well, that&#39;s not exactly what I meant...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, crap. I&#39;m almost out of energy. Farewell, everyone! Look forward to the next exciting installment of the Jaguar Warrior show!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> She just does whatever she wants, doesn&#39;t she? Hmm... She looks an awful lot like someone I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Try not to think too hard and just go home.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Okay! I&#39;ll do that!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> If something like this happens again, I&#39;m sending Chloe instead. They both act like cats anyway, so they&#39;ll probably get along. Yep!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll check your homework later.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Really, Fujimaru!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yay! I&#39;ll wait with tea and snacks at the ready!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You really are kind, Senpai. If I didn&#39;t have work to do, I would have loved to join.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While I do not have homework, I always feel that studying the books in the library is important.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I would make great progress in my studies if I asked Senpai lots of questions, and I&#39;m sure it would be fun.</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Whew. Thanks to that mysterious jolly animal, we took an unexpected detour...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But I have a feeling we&#39;re getting close to what I&#39;m seeking!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> We just have a little more to go. Please bear with me, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> There it is! I&#39;m sure that&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s standing over there...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;ve finally come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She looks familiar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nobody would ever forget that figure!</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> M-Master!? Why are you here!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> This is...well, this was not part of the plan.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> What are you doing? Those are MY clothes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, you found it? You were looking for that school uniform?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s sort of...an object that acts as an anchor to maintain my existence. That Spiritron Dress should naturally be in my possession.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But for some reason, the moment I manifested, I realized I didn&#39;t have it, and that it was somewhere else entirely.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So I went looking for it by following its scent.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And when you sense that someone else is wearing your precious clothes...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You would never want to give them up, and go on a journey to find them, no matter what. Do you understand that feeling?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...well...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So...what is your intention?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Well...you see...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It is difficult to explain my actions...even for me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> After all, what I&#39;ve done here was motivated by a sort of impulse that bubbled up from somewhere within me. But...at least half of my goal is accomplished now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I used this school uniform as bait to lure you here, P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I see. So it was part of your plan to be found. So what is the other half of your goal?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Why, to eliminate you, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> While some may argue otherwise, I would say that I am doing what I am because we are both goddesses. I&#39;m not certain myself, but my gut tells me...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...there&#39;s no need for you to fight if it means you have to use THAT vessel.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> And since you&#39;ve just became a Servant, hitting you with a sufficiently powerful Spiritual attack may cleave you apart from your vessel.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Doing so may entirely negate your existence as a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> So there&#39;s no reason for me not to try it. My Spirit Core is compelling me to try...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Now, please...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Please return to the realm of the gods. I have nothing against you personally, but brace yourself!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It looks like we can&#39;t talk this out.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I may not understand your reasoning, but I can see that you are resolved to do this. But...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I also have a purpose for being here, so I cannot allow myself to be sent away so easily.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> So, I will defend myself!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> This is the end. Please accept defeat.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Ungh...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re willing to give up...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I suppose I have no choice... Please, allow me to speak to you, though I must make some assumptions to do so...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I am an Indian goddess, while you are from the Greek pantheon. Bluntly put, we have nothing in common.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> That is...true...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yet that doesn&#39;t seem to matter to you, and you are fighting fiercely to stop me.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It is hard to believe you&#39;re doing this just because we are both goddesses.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Then, the answer is quite clear.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You are concerned not about the goddess I am, but the girl whose body I inhabit.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...Nnngh...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> That...is a valid point... I simply felt that you should not be fighting...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes, you may be right. The girl and I do have some sort of connection.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> The reason why you feel I should not fight is because you are concerned for her becoming a container for a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...Hee. Being overprotective can sometimes backfire, Rider.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, but don&#39;t get me wrong.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;m not quite sure why, but something within me compelled me to refer to you that way, by the name of your Class.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But I have absolutely no memory of you. After all, I am P\u0101rvat\u012B right now. However...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Neither I, nor this body of mine, feel any anger towards you for what you&#39;ve done here. In truth, we are happy about it.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> So...you don&#39;t intend to stop the manifestation?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> No. This is a part of my duty.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I have been entrusted with a mission. I must deal with my own mess. Well, it&#39;s my own fault for making a certain sacrifice...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> No matter the path I take, I&#39;m certain it will lead me to save the world as a goddess.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Even if it means I must sacrifice my life, I will protect the world and the people that I love.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> And the girl shared my wish to be such a being.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It is the wish we share that allowed me to manifest here. At least that&#39;s what I believe.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Surely you must know that the girl possesses a strong heart.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes...you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> If your existence here is a result of her resolve...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> All I did was get in her way and overstepped my boundaries in doing so.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t overstep anything. As I said, the thought behind your actions made us happy. Truly.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> But...there are things that even we cannot give up. That is all I wanted to say.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...Ah, you are absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> She may look weak and cowardly...but she really was strong-willed.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I had forgotten that you were that kind of person.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Please, allow me to apologize for my actions. And these clothes... Here, I will return them to their rightful owner.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Thank you very much. This is a relief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like everything has been settled peacefully, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep, yep... Whoa, Par!?</p><hr><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, my... I&#39;m a bit drained now that everything is over.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve recovered what I sought, this seems like a good place to take a rest.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Please rest assured. Now that we have met once and forged a bond...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> ...so long as we retain that connection, we are sure to meet again, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Yes. In due time, I am sure I will become your Servant. When that happens, I will work my hardest, so please take good care of me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Rider. My shyness will never completely go away, but I&#39;ve gotten tougher.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Even if the relationships between those in Chaldea are as complicated as that odd animal said...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be...well...I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be...fine.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Is something else bothering you? Oh, I get it.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> You&#39;ve come to like this school uniform too, haven&#39;t you, Rider?</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, all right. Even though this was originally mine...</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Those who have only seen you wearing this uniform might think a goddess assaulted you and stole your clothes.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> It might be best to consider making a duplicate of the uniform just for you.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong><br> Oh, it would be so wonderful for the two of us to wear matching uniforms and become Servants together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Master. This has turned into something of an anticlimactic farewell.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But that is another side of the girl...or so I feel. She can be a little ditzy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No worries. I have a feeling we&#39;ll meet again.</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Master. I know that, with you, there&#39;s no need to bring this up, but I will say it just the same.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai, Senpai... Medusa&#39;s giving you a really terrifying glare, and she&#39;s not even using her Mystic Eyes!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Even if you do manage to summon her...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You must vow to not treat her like a disposable pawn or put her in unnecessarily dangerous situations.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;m not asking for you to give her special treatment.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;m only saying that you should treat her as well as the rest of your Servants, and take good care of her. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I can&#39;t hear you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> YES, MA&#39;AM!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Good [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl]. Now, let us head back.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Hm. I wonder why I&#39;m feeling so restless.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Perhaps I should prepare by cleaning the room next to mine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Par is somewhat special, even unique among Pseudo-Servants...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And not just to Medusa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But perhaps many others in Chaldea would feel the same way when they see her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s concerning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be okay. As long as Master&#39;s around, any complicated relationships between the Servants are sure to be resolved quickly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And of course, I will do my very best to support you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s something to look forward to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit, Master! I hope to one day have an outlook as positive as yours!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Either way, our quest here is done now. Good work!</p>', 564);
