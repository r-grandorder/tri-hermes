He accepted a gruesome death in the Earthly Realm and was subsequently resurrected through a lotus flower. He boasts of his deed of arms where he defeated and sealed demons from even the Ninety-Six Caves as well as in being the greatest rival of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven \u2013 Sun Wukong (or so said person believes).</p><p>He was originally a minor god from Hindu Mythology called Nalakuvara, but he was transmitted into China as a Guardian Deity of Buddhism, was adopted into Taoism, and became the Boy God \u2013 Prince Nezha. Even now, he is being worshipped and favoured in the East Asian Regions, the worship and favouritism centered around China. He appears as a key character in \u201CInvestiture of the Gods\u201D. He also appears in \u201CJourney to the West\u201D, having been recruited to subjugate Sun Wukong \u2013 who was being riotous in the Heavenly Realm \u2013 and being often dispatched by the Heavenly Emperor (Shangdi) to provide aid for Bonze Sanzang and her party in their journey.</p><p>In the first place, Nezha is not a human being. He was born with a Precious Pearl, which was taken down to the Earthly Realm by Mount Kunlun\u2019s Immortal \u2013 Taiyi Zhenren[4] as his core, so he is an awkward existence who is neither fully human nor fully Immortal. In addition to the Magic Tools [Paopei] \u2013 the \u201CQiankun Quan [Universe Ring]\u201D and the \u201CHun Tian Ling [Red Armillary Sash]\u201D \u2013 that he is said to have possessed since the moment of his birth, Nezha was also presented and provided with Magic Tools by Taiyi Zhenren at every opportunity: the \u201CZhan Yao Jian [Demon-Slaying Sword]\u201D, the \u201CKan Yao Dao [Demon-Cutting Sword]\u201D, the \u201CFu Yao Suo [Demon-Binding Rope]\u201D, the \u201CJiang Mo Chu [Evil-Conquering Mallet]\u201D, the \u201CTou Qiu [Embroidered Ball]\u201D, and the \u201CHuo Jian Qiang [Fire-Tipped Spear]\u201D.</p><p>Nezha, who grew up in the Earthly Realm, was not wicked, but he was an excessively insolent and rambunctious kid. When he was blamed by a god for contaminating a river, he killed the god in question, and even also killed another god who was the superior of the previous god he killed. He was soon rebuked for those actions, and when a disaster befell even onto his parents in the Earthly Realm because of his prior acts, he unavoidably arrived at the decision to commit suicide in order to stop it.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>After his suicide in the Earthly Realm, Nezha was resurrected as a lotus spirit, although there were a couple of twists and turns. In regard to his resurrection, it had the assistance of not only Taiyi Zhenren, but also Shakyamuni Tathagata.</p><p>Summoned as a Lancer, Nezha is being strongly tinged with the disposition of a Guardian of Buddhism that appeared in \u201CJourney to the West\u201D. If it were the case that she was summoned as the Nezha from the time just before he committed suicide \u2013 the Nezha who has a brutal nature \u2013 one might fear that it is probably likely she would have become a Berserker.</p><p>\u2026 By the way, Taiyi Zhenren happened to pay no great attention to the sex of the body created for Nezha. To begin with, Taiyi Zhenren had been taking care of Nezha when the latter was a kid whose secondary sex characteristics had yet to develop. In other words, it means Nezha\u2019s body after his resurrection has been completely configured to a sex different from what he was in his previous life, but it was assuredly at a stage where it was already too late. It is for such a reason that Nezha \u2013 even though he has pride in his own body\u2019s origin and performance \u2013 shows an awkward attitude when it comes to the topic of his body\u2019s sex.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>The Fire-Tipped Spear for close combat.

(Aotsuki Takao)</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes:</h2><ul><li>[1] \u2013 The Da Luo Xian are basically the highest tier of Immortals who reside in the Da Luo Tian (The Great Overarching Heaven, aka the highest point of the Taoist Heaven).<br> As explained in Journey to the West, Nezha\u2019s previous life being mentioned here (the one even before the time he was born to Li Jing and Lady Yin, his parents in the Earthly Realm) was him as a Divine Beast Immortal that served the Jade Emperor/the Taoist Shangdi.</li><li>[2] \u2013 The first \u201Cmaster\u201D mentioned here refers to the Japanese character \u2018aruji\u2019 (\u4E3B) while the second [Master] mentioned here is \u2018Masutaa\u2019 (\u307E\u3059\u305F\u30FC), which is mostly in hiragana instead of the usual katakana (\u30DE\u30B9\u30BF\u30FC) because of her speech style.</li><li>[3] \u2013 The Chinese concept of Hun and Po refers to two different souls that every human being has within them, and in Taoism, there are three Hun souls and seven Po souls. When one dies, their Hun souls would fly to Heaven and their Po souls would scatter to the Earth. This leads to the first part of Nezha\u2019s 1st Noble Phantasm\u2019s name: The Clear Soul Flying to the Earth. The Clear Soul is one of the three Hun souls, and the Noble Phantasm\u2019s name references a proverb about Nezha\u2019s threat that he issued once before where he will beat up someone to the point that their Clear Soul would get beaten out of them and fly to the Earth instead of normally flying to Heaven. One losing their Clear Soul means losing their intelligence. So basically, it\u2019s Nezha knocking the sense out of someone.</li><li>[4] \u2013 Taiyi Zhenren should be the Immortal of Mount Qianyuan, not Mount Kunlun.</li><li>[5] \u2013 Nezha says \u7DD1\u8336 [\u307F\u3069\u3061\u3083] (Green Tea/\u2019Midocha\u2019 in Romaji) here, which is a common Japanese abbreviation and pun for one of Robin Hood\u2019s nicknames: Green Archer. Mido (short form of \u2019Midori\u2019) = Green. Cha (from Archer, which is \u2018Aacha\u2019 in Romaji) = Tea.
