I wonder who&#39;s responsible?</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, Taiga asked me to tell you.</p><p>&quot;Here&#39;s some tasty-looking stuff, the rest is up to you,&quot; she said.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahaha. \u2015\u2015\u2015Well, that&#39;s what I thought.\u201D</p><hr><p>As expected, the perpetrator was Fuji-Nee. That joke of a mystery has been solved in less than ten seconds.</p><p>...Well then. With this many ingredients, I could make a whole variety of stuff. What should I do...?</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, do you two have any requests for lunch?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNothing in particular. Whatever you make is fine, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>...Hmm, hmmm.</p><p>Saber is fine with anything. I make a mental note.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow about you, Rider?\u201D</p><p>Rider, who won this morning&#39;s channel battle, is watching the national news.</p><hr><p>\u201CI do not have any particular requests, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph.\u201D</p><p>That was only half expected of Rider. Same reply.</p><p>Well, I guess I have no choice but to decide myself...</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you... do you have any food that you like?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, it&#39;s just that you always eat without saying a word.</p><p>So I&#39;m thinking maybe you arduously eat things that you don&#39;t even like from time to time.\u201D</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee or Illya would say it outright if they didn&#39;t like a particular item; moreover, they wouldn&#39;t even touch it.</p><p>Sakura or Tohsaka advise me as fellow chefs, and Saber... goes without saying.</p><p>But I have yet to hear a single thing regarding food from Rider.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, if you have something to say to me, please state it clearly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s... nothing like that.</p><p>See, Saber will eat it right up, anyway, and I&#39;ll have an easier time with the menu.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CW-What are you saying, Shirou?</p><p>That almost makes it sound as if I lack composure during meals.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you really consider yourself calm when eating?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CO-Of course!</p><p>...How rude. How do I appear to you, then?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Rider exercises her right to keep silent.</p><p>I am so glad.</p><p>I am so glad that she&#39;s an adult.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, so... back to the matter of taste.</p><p>Have you ever eaten anything that you didn&#39;t particularly like, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not really.</p><p>Did I perhaps worry you all this time?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA little. Saber is very frank, so it makes it easier for me to know, but...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShirooou. Are you taking sides with Rider!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m glad Saber tells me frankly; it really helps when I&#39;m making something.</p><p>And on top of that, Saber is well-mannered when she eats.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hmm-hmm,&quot; Saber nods with satisfaction.</p><p>Saber, no matter how much of a hurry she is in, will not rush her chopsticks.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s easier to make meals once you know my taste.</p><p>...I can understand that, but I am, like Saber, satisfied with whatever Sakura or you make.</p><p>So I don&#39;t think you need to worry too much about it.\u201D</p><p>Mmm... I&#39;m glad she feels that way, but we&#39;re not making any progress.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, then let&#39;s change tactics.</p><p>Rider, do you have anything that you just won&#39;t eat?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015If you put it that way...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s see... Though I do not think the two of you would be cooking one in the first place...\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, so there is something?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly common in this country, but\u2015\u2015\u2015snakes...\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see. Considering Rider&#39;s identity, I doubt she&#39;ll want to eat snakes.</p><p>And considering her class and Noble Phantasm, I could guess another item she would not like to eat.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, horses also would be bad, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. It&#39;s not that they are bad...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlright. Snakes are rare, and I&#39;ll try to refrain from horses.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, then wouldn&#39;t it be prudent to send back the snake wine Taiga brought a few days ago?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSnake wine... Wait, Fuji-Nee, why the heck? She really brought that?\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber nods once, comes into the kitchen and opens the cabinet under the sink.</p><p>And in there, unknown to me, someone left a jar with a whole snake inside.</p><hr><p>\u201CShe happily showed it to me and Sakura.</p><p>Neither of us got scared, so she lost interest and just stuck it in here, as far as I remember.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Good that you remembered.</p><p>Saber, you fine with both of those?\u201D</p><p>I ask her as I shove the jar with what looks like a habu snake wine deeper into the storage.</p><hr><p>\u201CYes, I am not opposed to eating either.</p><p>...But I would not think of eating them in front of someone who is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know. Henceforth, snakes and horses are banned in this house.\u201D</p><p>Saber and Rider simply don&#39;t fit each other by nature.</p><p>But they have a very caring mutual friendship.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright. I think I got the idea.</p><p>Rider, could you come here for a second?\u201D</p><p>I motion toward Rider.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it&#39;s getting cramped with all three of us here, but Saber shows no intention of going back to the living room.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease choose something you want to eat for lunch from here.\u201D</p><p>I open the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201CYou are asking me to choose the ingredients for lunch?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, go ahead and pick what you like, it&#39;s all fine.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs that so?</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>She looks into the refrigerator intently. And Saber watches us from the back.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Shirou, you are certainly very kind to Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>Perhaps she is irritated by the fact that I&#39;m asking for Rider&#39;s opinion instead of hers?</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you talking about, Saber? It&#39;s easier for me when I know what all of you like and dislike.</p><p>Besides, I&#39;ve asked you many times before.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat... is true.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, what would this be?\u201D</p><p>Turning to check what she&#39;s asking about, I see Rider pointing to a styrofoam package in the corner of the fridge.</p><p>The label on top says &quot;Perishable. Store refrigerated.&quot; I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s some sort of fish.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s inside... an octopus?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLooks like it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I try to take it out, but its suckers seem to have stuck to the lid inside, and won&#39;t come off easily.</p><hr><p>\u201CSure is a lively one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHow about this for lunch? Best to eat it while it&#39;s still fresh, I&#39;d say.\u201D</p><p>Indeed, stuff like this is great when consumed the same day it is caught, no doubt.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re right. Hm, what should I make\u2015\u2015\u2015huh, what are you doing that far away, Saber?\u201D</p><p>For some reason, Saber looks on from the other corner of the kitchen.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, are we really eating that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I was thinking about it, but... does it bother you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, just\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Saber is definitely acting strange.</p><p>The longer I think what the possible reason could be, the stronger grows my conviction that the thing clinging to my hand is the perpetrator.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Could it be... that octopuses scare you?\u201D</p><p>Right on the mark, it seems.</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, you&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. You were eating takoyaki without hesitation.\u201D</p><hr><p>She ate it all without a question when I brought them as thanks for watching over the house.</p><p>...Even Sakura&#39;s portion, despite the &quot;I want some, too&quot; look from her.</p><hr><p>\u201CT-That can&#39;t be... the things inside were... those sleek yet rough things were the netherworld&#39;s demon fish!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSleek yet rough...?\u201D</p><p>Well, I suppose you could say that... but no need to hate them so much...</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is the meaning of this?\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou, the one you speak of...\u201D</p><p>Trembling all over, she glares at me with a dreadful stare. Is she really that mad?</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, Saber. Are octopuses really a no-go? You ate them just like that until now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CD-Don&#39;t tell me... I never thought that this &quot;octopus&quot; you speak of is... the demonic fish itself?!</p><p>...What is this... The netherworld&#39;s evil god that wouldn&#39;t die no matter how much I cut it... was what I tasted back then...!\u201D</p><p>&quot;Netherworld&#39;s evil god&quot; is taking it a little too far.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat should we do, Shirou? Saber doesn&#39;t seem to like it.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah...\u201D</p><p>Maybe it revived when we took it out of the refrigerator. The now-live octopus starts wrapping itself around my hand.</p><hr><p>\u201CR-Rider, you, too! How could you eat such things!?\u201D</p><p>&quot;Aren&#39;t we both from around the same lands,&quot; is what her eyes are saying.</p><hr><p>\u201CI can eat all seafood without reservation.</p><p>On my part, I just cannot believe you like natto or umeboshi.\u201D</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ve been born in almost the same lands, yet you sure can eat that stuff up,&quot; is what the hidden message is this time.</p><hr><p>...Wait a moment, there&#39;s something Rider does hate, after all.</p><p>I hear foreigners are notorious for being unable to ever get used to natto and umeboshi. Sounds like Rider is no exception.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hmm. I was indeed surprised at first, but compared to cheese or dried meat consumed during a march, they were nothing.\u201D</p><p>Ah, I suppose that&#39;s the reason why she can stand anything fermented.</p><hr><p>And as I&#39;m admiring her resilience, I peel the octopus off my hand and put it on the cutting board.</p><p>Rider and Saber are too busy arguing to notice what I&#39;m doing.</p><hr><p>\u201CNow that you&#39;ve brought it up, don&#39;t you put too much olive oil on things? It destroys the fragrant essence of food.\u201D</p><p>Ah... indeed, Rider sure uses olive oil a lot.</p><hr><p>\u201CEating is one&#39;s own free right.</p><p>We are originally Servants. It isn&#39;t right to fuss over a meal that is unnecessary to begin with.</p><p>Saber, your behavior is sometimes shameful in my eyes.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? And disguising oneself as a waitress out of desire to own a bicycle or a motorbike isn&#39;t shameful, then?\u201D</p><hr><p>...!?</p><p>Ack! Somehow, a precarious situation has developed while I was focusing on food!</p><p>Danger, Will Robinson! If I let this go on, the existence of our beloved house, if not the entire neighborhood, is in question...!</p><hr><p>\u201CSenpai, I&#39;ll help with the lunch preparations.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSakura\u2015\u2015\u2015! Whew, great timing!</p><p>I-I&#39;m fine, but could you please go placate those two?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh... Right. \u2015\u2015\u2015Really, Rider. What are you still arguing with Saber-san about?</p><p>...You&#39;re not planning on breaking the table over some small quarrel again, right...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CS-Sakura...!?</p><p>N-No... it&#39;s nothing big.</p><p>Right, Saber? We were just having friendly discussion about our opinions on various food items\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yes, it&#39;s just as Rider says!</p><p>We were just thinking if we shouldn&#39;t challenge our senses with some traditional Japanese dried seafood sometimes.\u201D</p><hr><p>I can hear the excuses.</p><p>\u201C...Well, this should teach them a lesson.\u201D</p><p>I silently thank Sakura as she&#39;s scolding the two of them, and concentrate back on the ingredient lying on the cutting board.</p><p>Of course, this would be one-sided, so I better prepare some natto and umeboshi too.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Well then.</p><p>As a symbol of our reconciliation, why don&#39;t we all try something to conquer our respective weaknesses\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-2-caster-s-cooking-practice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-2-caster-s-cooking-practice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 2 Caster&#39;s cooking practice</h3><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What are you doing here, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs you can see, I&#39;m cleaning the floor.\u201D</p><p>I wring out the washcloth, and dirty black water drips into the bucket.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, that much is obvious... What I do not comprehend is why would Emiya be here, of all places, wiping down the temple floor.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, that...\u201D</p><hr><p>As part of my strength training routine, I try to utilize the muscles I don&#39;t normally use by going up and down the long flight of stone steps.</p><p>Issei&#39;s older brother comes by.</p><p>\u201COh, Shirou-kun. How&#39;s the cleaning?\u201D</p><p>Seeing the motivation that I had to train my body, I was asked to assist with temple cleaning.</p><hr><p>Exchanging a brief greeting with the ever-present Assassin at the temple gate, I enter the temple grounds.</p><hr><p>I was expecting to be sweeping up the fallen leaves for sure, but also eventually got dragged inside the temple hall.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd that&#39;s how I was entrusted with mopping the temple floor.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy did you not refuse?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou guys help me out all the time. And besides, cleaning the floor in a temple is kind of fun.\u201D</p><p>Issei takes a deep breath.</p><p>Amazed... or not, kind of hard to tell.</p><hr><p>\u201COh no. Shouldn&#39;t I be the one saying that with how completely I rely on your assistance for Student Council matters\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>He concludes with a sigh.</p><hr><p>\u201CHowever, does this mean you would really go as far as cleaning your friend&#39;s house when asked?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt depends. I ended up cleaning Tohsaka&#39;s residence before as well\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>I keep the keys while she&#39;s away, too\u2015\u2015\u2015and so Issei&#39;s disapproval grows even stronger.</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh... Even more than my anger towards Tohsaka for forcing this kind of job on you, the fact that we&#39;re now making the exact same request that she did is making me a little dizzy...\u201D</p><hr><p>Nonetheless, now that I am Tohsaka&#39;s apprentice, cleaning the master&#39;s house is also part of my job.</p><p>Work hard, party harder. This is important.</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse me. Some refreshments for Emiya-kun, from Reikan... Make sure you go wash your hands before taking a break.\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki-sensei came along with a tray.</p><p>Looks like some tea and Japanese sweets.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t take long to notice that these are a whole class above our teacakes, probably reserved for guests.</p><hr><p>\u201CReikan wouldn&#39;t come, Souichirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo. He has a visiting parishioner to attend to. He said that you should eat together with Emiya.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CMuch thanks. I&#39;ll be off to wash my hands, then. Would here be alright once I come back?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCannot settle down in front of the Buddha?</p><p>Then use my room. Unfortunately, the guest room is occupied right now.\u201D</p><hr><p>The whole scene is quite bizarre.</p><p>We&#39;re drinking tea in Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s room, sitting around a tray.</p><p>As if personally assigned to us, Kuzuki-sensei is pouring us tea. But I still can&#39;t settle down.</p><hr><p>...Looking around the room, I realize there&#39;s a whole lot of cupboards and odd-looking bottled ships all over the place.</p><p>The reason is that those are all made with Western liquor bottles, rather than 1.[ruby text=sho]8-liter Japanese ones.</p><p>Ah, but I do wonder what&#39;s inside all those cupboards. I didn&#39;t realize it until I actually came in here, but this is also the newly-wed Caster&#39;s room.</p><p>In that case, inside there\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, tea.\u201D</p><p>Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s voice brings me back to reality.</p><p>I accept the offered teacup, and a nice smell floats into the air.</p><p>As I thought, this must be pretty high-quality fare.</p><hr><p>It wouldn&#39;t be polite to ignore it, so I help myself to the tea cakes, too.</p><p>Sweets taste particularly great after hours of hard work. And even more so together with delicious tea.</p><p>Saber would be delighted if I brought her a few.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou seem to be enjoying yourself. Did you like it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, do I really look that way?\u201D</p><p>&quot;Yep,&quot; nods Issei. Kuzuki-sensei just continues sipping tea, expressionless as always.</p><hr><p>\u201CI do believe we still have some of those left. How many do you want to take with you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt wouldn&#39;t be nice of me to impose this far, would it? All I did was mop the floor for a bit.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t mind.\u201D</p><p>In that case, I guess it&#39;s okay to take a few as a souvenir. The second I thought that, the door slides open.</p><hr><p>\u201CSouichirou-sama, lunch is ready\u2015\u2015\u2015 Oh, my.\u201D</p><p>Caster, still holding a tray, looks at me quizzically.</p><hr><p>\u201CNevermind Issei-kun\u2015\u2015\u2015But why is the boy here, I wonder?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, things happened.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s all I can manage. The part about the flight of stone steps would be quite difficult to start from, too.</p><p>But, more importantly, the stuff on the tray finally caught my interest. The food that has just been put down on the nearby desk must be today&#39;s lunch.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Caster, did you make that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Got a problem with that?\u201D</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m just wondering about the extreme simplicity\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CCould it be that cooking isn&#39;t your forte?\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s burned, flooded with oil, and, to top it off, kind of gaudy.</p><p>It&#39;s yellow, or maybe red. No, perhaps violet is the best word for it?</p><hr><p>\u201CW-What? For you to say it like that, I guess you must be able to cook, too!\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, Emiya&#39;s cooking is excellent.\u201D</p><p>Issei chimes in right away.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Now why would you say that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I mean, I did actually get a chance to try his cooking.\u201D</p><p>To be correct, he &quot;tries&quot; it all the time in the student council room.</p><hr><p>Knowing that cooking isn&#39;t one of Caster&#39;s greatest skills, I can now understand him.</p><p>She was originally a king&#39;s daughter - royalty, in other words - and while she probably has no experience with things like cooking, she is certainly persistent.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking for a Heroic Spirit with cooking skills, try another period in time.</p><p>Like that red one. Or with dark skin. Or with white hair.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm. So you are good at cooking?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, right. I&#39;ve always cooked for myself, I guess you could say so.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Hm.&quot; After this unusual display, as if having thought of something\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CCaster. If you feel that your skills are inferior, why don&#39;t you take a few lessons from Emiya?\u201D</p><p>He&#39;s just proposed something outrageous.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u201C\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015HUH?*\u201D\u201D\u201D</p><p>The three of us reacted simultaneously.</p><p>\u201COf course, that&#39;s only if you two agree.\u201D</p><p>He continues indifferently, as if our reaction did not disturb him in the least.</p><hr><p>\u201C...If Souichirou-sama kindly says so, it is not a problem for me...\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u201CEh?\u201D\u201D*</p><p>This time it&#39;s me and Issei, who never thought Caster could agree to this.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s looking at me now. Indeed, I&#39;m the only one that hasn&#39;t replied yet\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Well, if so, I don&#39;t really mind, either.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen it&#39;s settled. Do teach my wife well, Emiya.\u201D</p><hr><p>Having received the present from Issei, I leave the Ryuudou Temple behind.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Mm-hmm.\u201D</p><p>Well, whatever.</p><p>\u201C...Really not sure how to describe this development.\u201D</p><p>For now, I wonder what the heck should I teach her\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-praying-fuji-nee" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-praying-fuji-nee" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 3 Praying Fuji-Nee</h3><hr><p>Ryuudou temple, Fuyuki mountain.</p><p>I once asked Issei about its history. He produced a list of mysterious names, befitting a famous temple, and left me even more confused.</p><p>...Well, most of the town&#39;s population couldn&#39;t care less about these things, but for the New Year&#39;s and other events, the temple still gathers believers atop the mountain.</p><p>So, here&#39;s one of these pilgrims.</p><hr><p>\u201CDid you just come for fun, Fuji-Nee?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph, what&#39;s the fun in climbing a long flight of stone steps?\u201D</p><p>The stone steps keep going all the way from the base of the mountain to the temple gate.</p><p>Must have taken her a fair amount of effort. Climbing up here isn&#39;t exactly a one-step affair.</p><hr><p>\u201CIndeed, after bunny-hopping all the way up and down ten times even you must feel refreshed, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMy knees would give out before I&#39;m done with that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Youngsters don&#39;t do it with a spare tire and iron sandals these days, do they?\u201D</p><p>Iron sandals? Where the heck would you even get those...? Wait, probably from the Fujimura Group.</p><p>Old man Raiga has been seen strutting around in single-tooth tall sandals, I believe.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, did you come just for fun, too? Big sis will be worried if a healthy young man says that his hobby is mountains, you know? Like, how did I raise you with such gloomy interests?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWorry not, your education policy did not include anything even close to such bland activities, Fuji-Nee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, it didn&#39;t. Okay, let&#39;s visit the temple.\u201D</p><p>We walk over to the temple grounds, and get some purifying water.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s been a while since we visited a temple together.</p><p>Since New Year&#39;s, I guess.</p><p>Every year, Fuji-Nee dresses up in a really profound-looking kimono, but that&#39;s another story.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow about an offering?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I-It&#39;s about fate, so five yen.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCan&#39;t you do five hundred?\u201D</p><p>\u201CF-F-Fifty five!\u201D</p><p>We&#39;re coming up one order of magnitude short, sadly.</p><p>Of course, even if we do, putting in paper bills would be unheard of.</p><p>Faith is what matters\u2015\u2015\u2015that&#39;s what I&#39;d like you to believe.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Alright, so what should I pray for.</p><p>Household well-being, road safety, academic success.</p><p>Wondering what Fuji-Nee&#39;s wishing for, I take a sideways glance.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Let Shirou grow up strong and healthy...\u201D</p><p>...Crap, I wasn&#39;t ready for that. I&#39;m touched.</p><p>Does she really worry about me this much?</p><hr><p>\u201C...And also, please let me have a hot boyfriend.\u201D</p><p>...Ah... As I was praying for her safety and well-being, that thought crossed my mind, too.</p><p>But you know, Fuji-Nee... You&#39;re making an awfully common request.</p><hr><p>\u201C...And please save the Siberian tiger from extinction... The Bengal tiger is in danger of becoming extinct, too...\u201D</p><p>Gradually running out of material, we get to tigers... So the prayer for my adulthood is lumped together with other material. My feelings are now mixed.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, what did you wish for, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...For world peace.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYours is always the same, isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t you go more like, &quot;A girl, now!&quot; and stuff?\u201D</p><p>If I did, the deity would probably be quite troubled. I&#39;m pretty sure this mountain isn&#39;t oriented towards marriages.</p><hr><p>And besides, marital success... with whom?</p><p>My train of thought is interrupted by a familiar voice.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, look. It&#39;s been ages since we met, Shirou-kun.</p><p>Morning. Really nice weather today, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood morning, Fujimura-sensei.</p><p>Morning, Emiya.\u201D</p><hr><p>The two that just came out from the main hall are Issei and his older brother, Reikan.</p><p>We&#39;ve been making quite a bit of noise, and they probably came to check it out.</p><hr><p>\u201CGreetings. Good morning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, Rei-chan and Ryuudou-kun, hello.\u201D</p><p>Fuji-Nee waves at them with a smile.</p><p>Rei-chan is Reikan-san. Just making sure.</p><hr><p>\u201CHahaha, good to see you in high spirits, as always.</p><p>By the looks of it, you&#39;re here to pay homage to our temple. Indeed, we are delighted to have you visit today.</p><p>Also, we have been indebted greatly by the Fujimura house this summer. I will thank you in my father&#39;s stead. Before long, the high priest himself will be paying us a visit.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, don&#39;t worry about it, really!</p><p>Is the honorable preceptor doing well?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHe is well, quite well. Although the ten years of service do weigh on him.</p><p>This month, claiming pursuit of knowledge, he went to another mountain temple. &quot;Lose not to the Fujimura Senior,&quot; those were his spirited words.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe old man used to say that, too, actually.</p><p>&quot;This New Year&#39;s eve, I will not be outdone by that Ryuudou geezer! Save up lots and hold tight!&quot; or something like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat sounds promising. That desire for money runs a little deeper than most people&#39;s. We are definitely looking forward to getting sliced and diced by the Senior.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Hahaha,&quot; a pleasant laughing voice resounds throughout the temple grounds.</p><p>...Issei&#39;s father and old man Raiga&#39;s relationship is downright murderous. Furthermore, Fuji-Nee, Reikan, and Neko-san are all classmates.</p><p>There must be a connection to the little-known ruling sect of the Miyama town...!</p><hr><p>\u201C...Why are you trembling, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-It&#39;s kind of chilly and stuff.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBoth our old man and even Rei-chan&#39;s father are fond of Shirou.</p><p>Yep, so we&#39;d like you guys to teach us.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...!\u201D</p><p>Teach what, exactly!?</p><p>Chivalry and meditation, no, maybe gambling and praying!?</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, there&#39;s no need for it, Junior.</p><p>Shirou-kun will turn out quite well, I&#39;m sure. Accomplished in both literary and martial arts and excelling at chivalry. A fine fellow, I&#39;d say.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh, I wonder about that.</p><p>He&#39;s alright now, but I&#39;d really like him to be awesome like Rei-chan and stuff.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo way. A student like me can never have the composure that Reikan-san always does.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSure you can.</p><p>Rei-chan, remember back when we were at Homurabara? You&#39;d get surrounded by guys from our school, and still keep laughing.</p><p>Well, you did get beaten up in the end, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, but that was a while ago.</p><p>And before I came to realize my fate, Taiga-kun had already tended to my wounds!</p><p>Oh, a word of welcome for the clumsy and inexperienced monk. Taiga-kun&#39;s sole companionship!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Hahaha,&quot; they laugh, a tiger and a wandering monk.</p><p>...Amazing.</p><p>I mean, I&#39;m actually looking at a man that is more than able to talk back to Fuji-Nee, in ways more than one.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You are amazing, Reikan-san. Like, just awesome.\u201D</p><p>A mind this broad that can keep company with Fuji-Nee must be the stuff of legends.</p><hr><p>\u201CBrother Reikan is my role model.</p><p>How about it, Emiya? Come to the temple. Let&#39;s pursue this ideal together.\u201D</p><hr><p>Before I knew it, Issei starts persuading me, too.</p><p>At this rate, Fuji-Nee may well end up selling me off to them.</p><p>Although, I must admit, I do find the monk lifestyle somewhat appealing... hm?</p><p>&quot;Come to the temple,&quot; laughs Issei, then suddenly straightens himself.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs brother Souichirou coming this way?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease keep it a secret from him.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Good morning, Fujimura-sensei, Emiya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh.\u201D</p><p>Right, Kuzuki-sensei lives here too.</p><p>Whenever his lean figure is around, it&#39;s as if one&#39;s entire body gets restrained, making it difficult to even open your mouth.</p><hr><p>\u201CHello, Kuzuki-sensei.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you for your help, as always.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere, too, your help is appreciated every day. Please take your time.</p><p>Reikan, father is on the phone.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, my apologies.</p><p>See you later, Shirou-kun, junior. Have a nice day.</p><p>You come, too, Issei. In case there will be a particularly difficult question again. I may not manage alone.\u201D</p><p>\u201CO-Okay, to the extent of my abilities.</p><p>W-Well then, please excuse me, too.\u201D</p><p>Bowing respectfully, the two of them leave.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.\u201D</p><p>Unconsciously, I relax a little.</p><p>No matter how sociable Reikan might be, he still has an air of strictness about him.</p><p>Issei, Reikan, Kuzuki-sensei... do these types of people tend to gather at temples?</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, we&#39;d better get going as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Sorry for putting you off like this.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t fated to happen today, but please don&#39;t hesitate to visit next time. Issei will be glad to see you, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlright, until next time.\u201D</p><p>Leaving the main building behind, I follow Fuji-Nee across the temple grounds.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... That sure was a surprise.</p><p>Turns out Kuzuki-sensei lives here, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. The three of them are pretty much like brothers, don&#39;t you think?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know! Oh, but I wonder if we look like siblings, too?\u201D</p><hr><p>...It&#39;d be nice if we did.</p><p>We&#39;ve been living like a brother and sister since forever.</p><p>I&#39;d be kind of proud to have others see us that way, too.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright, I&#39;ll drop in the back for a bit.</p><p>What about you, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll go for a stroll and then go back. Want to see the back hill and whatnot.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMm, okay. Don&#39;t worry about my lunch share, then.\u201D</p><hr><p>Parting with Fuji-Nee, I leave the temple grounds.</p><p>Well then, what should I do next\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr>', 526);
