The dolphins bear their fangs against those who are hostile to Jeanne, as though they are about to come and swoop down on them just to cut up and pull apart their flesh.</p><p><strong>Servant Cheer!: [B]</strong></p><p>Even if she is not in the Ruler Class, Jeanne\u2019s cheerful mentality did not change at all. When she grasps someone\u2019s hand tightly while saying \u201CLet\u2019s do our best together!\u201D, she makes other people think the wrong idea. Jeanne herself believes that she is just cheering them on.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="des-oceans-d-allegresse-as-the-oceans-get-abundant-together-we-shall-get-to-delight-in-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#des-oceans-d-allegresse-as-the-oceans-get-abundant-together-we-shall-get-to-delight-in-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Des Oc\xE9ans d\u2019All\xE9gresse: As the Oceans Get Abundant, Together We Shall Get to Delight in it</h1><ul><li>Rank: A+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~20</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people</li></ul><p>Des Oc\xE9ans d\u2019All\xE9gresse (The Oceans of Glee). By offering her prayers to the oceans, Jeanne can summon Phantasmal Beasts. Perhaps she has a connection to those Phantasmal Beasts, but she can call forth most of those related to the sea and use their powers. The highlight is the blue whale; which gives the impression that one would die if it came crashing down on them, or something like that. Furthermore, Jeanne sincerely gives each and every one of these animals a name.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females]<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare, etc.</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>At this occasion, Jeanne herself thinks that although she changed into a swimsuit, there is nothing particularly different about her. But of course, she is absurdly different. With a carefreeness in valuing the summer over the innate goodness of man, and being light and airy from beginning to end, there is the feeling that she is clearly running at full throttle to make the summer festive. Furthermore, the notion of wearing a swimsuit for the purpose of simply enjoying the summer rather than for dressing herself up is quite strong for her.</p><p>However, when her Saint Graph enters its Final Stage, Jeanne undergoes a Class Change from \u201Cthe older sister of the dolphins at the beach\u201D to \u201Ca Saint who swooped down upon the everlasting summer.\u201D Changing the Lord\u2019s divine protection into a hoop (halo) of light, she transforms into a high-mobility shooting Saint who does as she pleases.</p><p>Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: \u201CWhat are you? Really, what the hell are you!?\u201D</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Originally, Jeanne was going to break down her guardian-like gimmick when she was going to change into a swimsuit, but the girl \u2013 who is a Ruler \u2013 decided to choose righteous discipline as her motto and view all relationships as platonic from beginning to end.</p><p>However, Jeanne\u2019s reason as a Ruler was annihilated once she got into the Archer Class. She openly changed into a sad monster who was convinced that she is an older sister. Surely at first, she had recognized to some degree that \u201CIt\u2019s nice to think of myself as an older sister\u201D, but maybe because her spirits have become the highest they have ever been at the time when she became a Swimsuit Blademaster, she can even fire brainwashing beams.</p><p>Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: \u201CNo, seriously, what the hell are you?

Just about everything about her has completely changed. She has become far nastier than when she was in the Ruler Class!\u201D</p><p>In addition, because she changed her clothes, Jeanne has also started a manga circle as a new hobby. She formed the circle \u201Cst. Orl\xE9ans\u201D together with Marie Antoinette. For the duo in question, they intend to draw a love comedy manga, but from the way it seems, their work got a reputation in a different sense with things like \u201CNo matter how you read it, this is an explosion scene\u201D, \u201CRather than saying it\u2019s bittersweet, it\u2019s like saturated, sugared water\u201D, and \u201CI don\u2019t understand why you would launch a smartphone from a cannon in order to get a person\u2019s contact address.\u201D</p><p>Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: \u201CBut I truly don\u2019t understand the reason why in the hell those are selling so well!\u201D</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Dolphins, rings, balls, etc.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter (Swimsuit)</strong></p><p>\u201CYou\u2019re making manga, right?

Also, where did you get those Japanese swords from?\u201D</p><p><strong>Marie</strong></p><p>When the two are present, the beach will already turn into a sea of gorgeous celebrities.

In the beginning, when she was called an Archer, I even thought about a gigantic water gun for her, but in the end, I cannot grow accustomed to a Saint with firearms. At the end of ups and downs, it became \u201CI have no choice now but to put a dolphin here\u201D, which led to her becoming the current Dolphin Saint. For her swimsuit in her First Stage, I designed its appearance so that it is arranged like the swimsuit Jeanne was wearing in Fate/EXTRA.
