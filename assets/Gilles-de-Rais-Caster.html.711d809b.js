Gilles de Rais himself isn\u2019t a legitimate magus nor has any grounding in magecraft, but this grimoire performs magic instead.</p><p>That means, it\u2019s an exclusive Noble Phantasm for him as a mage. Regardless of the owner\u2019s skills, the grimoire itself executes High-Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals and performs the summoning of water demons containing attributes in accordance to the deep sea system. For this reason, it\u2019s fine that Gilles de Rais himself just uses the sea demons he called. The individual power of the sea demons is weak in comparison with a Servant, but the classification as Anti-Army isn\u2019t for show, as it\u2019s possible to summon them in dozens. Fuel efficiency is good since it\u2019s possible to summon new sea demons from the defeated ones. Also, it is possible to summon a super-gigantic sea demon by disregarding execution (can\u2019t control it).</p><p>However, in the end it\u2019s just \u300Csummoning magecraft performed by the grimoire\u300D, the summoning itself is not a \u300Cmiracle of the Noble Phantasm\u300D. If constant mana supply from the grimoire is cut, the summoned demons can\u2019t last in the current world, and will be eliminated if the mana supply is interrupted even for a moment.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First person pronoun: \u79C1 (watashi)</li><li>Second person pronoun: \u8CB4\u65B9 (anata) / \u3007\u3007 (without honorifics)</li><li>Third person pronoun: \u8CB4\u65B9\u305F\u3061 (anata tachi) / \u8CB4\u65B9\u304C\u305F (anata gata) / \u3007\u3007 (without honorifics)</li></ul><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Indeed like a great nobleman from the feudal period, courteous yet cruel.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t really listen to others, but that\u2019s more because of his paranoia than because of his arrogance.</p><p>He has a cunning personality, but lacks discretion.</p><p>Although he was the owner of a deep piety during his life, he tasted a profound despair after Jeanne Darc, who he respected and fought together with, was executed for heresy, and lost sight of God.</p><p>What was born as a result was a murderer that slaughtered hundreds of infants for pleasure, a monster which is said to be the motif for the appearance of Bluebeard in fairy tales.</p><p>Since he\u2019s discerning the true beauty of life, he doesn\u2019t just kill and abandon others when killing, for he has the policy of having to fully taste all of that resentment, pain, and lamentation.</p><p>Him staining his hands with cruel and dirty acts was a method to prove the absence of a God who is supposed to punish immorality, but after all, it isn\u2019t impossible to say that his piety that was deeper than anyone\u2019s has turned inside out\u2026\u2026</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Without thinking about his sadistic preferences and his addiction to Jeanne, he has acquired a proper education, and it\u2019s certain that he\u2019s an experienced person who led an army and ran across the battlefield.</p><p>Since he won\u2019t emphasize to agree with his special preferences, he\u2019ll become a reassuring partner attitude-wise.</p><p>He responded to the summon of the Holy Grail in order to resurrect the Holy Maiden Jeanne.</p><p>Therefore, he\u2019ll think that his wish was fulfilled in the circumstance of the Servant Jeanne Darc being in the present world, and his concentration will be devotedly directed in earning Jeanne\u2019s favor.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300CThere is freshness in fear.<br> By fearing when in fear, the senses die.<br> Fear in a true sense isn\u2019t a static state but a dynamic of change \u2015\u2015 like in the moment hope turns into despair.<br> How were they?

When Jeanne was captured in England, he tried to rescue her but ended failing.</p><p>After Jeanne\u2019s death, he felt nostalgic about Jeanne when he stayed in Orl\xE9ans in summer of 1435, and when a girl that claimed to be Jeanne appeared in 1439, he took action and tried to make her feel his strong emotions towards her by giving her his soldiers. However, he was enticed by the mage Fran\xE7ois Prelati at the same time, and by repeating rituals of black arts at his territory, he atrociously murdered hundreds of children as sacrifices.</p><p>It is said that he attempted to secure his fortune through alchemy, but there are also records of him having indulged himself in magecraft since he was young.
