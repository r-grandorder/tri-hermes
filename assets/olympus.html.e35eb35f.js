Up in the sky!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Atop the sprawling city sits another enormous structure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Above that, great mountains of translucent<br> crystal loom even higher.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And there, beyond the crystalline peaks...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...lies the very thing they&#39;ve been searching for:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The roots of cosmic fantasy stretching out into space.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Tree of Emptiness!<br> That&#39;s the Tree of Emptiness we saw from Atlantis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, that&#39;s the not the only thing that surprised me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I never would have dreamed that there could be such<br> a massive hollow space underneath the Great Pit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t look subterranean, either.<br> It&#39;s more like an entirely different world...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is the true surface of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While it no doubt would appear to be the<br> bowels of the Earth from up on Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...it is, in fact, the true face of this Atlantic Lostbelt. Atlantis itself is mere camouflage.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In Proper Human History&#39;s Greek mythology, the Age of Man was ushered in through two great wars known as machia...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But what is going on in this Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> How was it able to control this space to such a degree?<br> How was it able to advance this far?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It appears to operate in the same manner as the Chinese Lostbelt in that it fully embraces its Tree of Emptiness, but the manner in which it does so is wholly opposite the Chinese Lostbelt&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the Chinese Lostbelt hid its Tree of Emptiness completely, here, it has been allowed to flourish to the greatest possible extent...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s what it looks like.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That part down by the base must be the city.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. It looks just like something<br> you&#39;d see in a science fiction novel.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s easily as impressive as the pictures of Proper Human History&#39;s skyscrapers Sion showed me.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell what the exact dimensions of this city are just from looking at it, but it&#39;s safe to say there are at least ten million people living there, minimum.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ten million people...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So this is really it, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this is where our attack on the Atlantic Lostbelt really begins...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, it would seem we truly<br> have our work cut out for us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That, of course, is as true here in this<br> fifth of the seven hells as it ever was.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And as Da Vinci said before, we cannot blind ourselves to the cost of our actions, not even for a moment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That being said, how one reacts to such a cost<br> depends entirely on the individual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And I, for one, am delighted by how you have all held onto your humanity in the face of such adversity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Computer room here\u2606 Sorry to interrupt,<br> but I just finished scanning our vicinity!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And just like I expected, the atmosphere<br> here is just chock-full of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So this is the Age of Gods... The magical energy density&#39;s at least on par with our records of the Seventh Singularity, if not higher.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A-are you serious!? But the Seventh Singularity was in Mesopotamia DURING Proper Human History&#39;s Age of Gods!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A-and you&#39;re telling me this place<br> exceeds its magical energy density!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Aah!

It&#39;s as powerful as a spell designed to attack the mind!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci, quick! Raise our Bounded Field&#39;s output before something happens to Fujimaru or Meuni\xE8re!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Got it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Between this immense pressure and this manner of speech, it looks like they&#39;re rolling out the biggest of big guns.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If I&#39;m not mistaken, this must be\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My name is Zeus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Zeus the King of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I rule over this ancient ocean.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I rule this grand interstellar city.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I rule over all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am king of the Atlantic Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Z-Zeus!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I was going to say \u201Cone of the<br> Twelve Olympians,\u201D but no matter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This is, unfortunately, the worst of the possible scenarios I predicted. Of all the gods to come out and greet us...!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So that&#39;s...the Zeus of this Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I already had a good idea of this thanks<br> to the Poseidon we saw in Atlantis, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. This King of the Gods may be very different from the one in Proper Human History, but deep down, they are fundamentally the same:</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The supreme being of Greek mythology; the winner of both machia wars, and the one who rules over the Twelve Olympians.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not merely a Divine Spirit, but a genuine<br> god who once existed right here on Earth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> His deep ties to both the concrete and abstract planes mean that he is one of the phenomena shaping the very world itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To put it another way, the king of the gods of myth is, in a very real sense, the closest thing there is to a ruler of the entire planet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then...does that mean he&#39;s like Sc\xE1thach-Skadi<br> in the Scandinavian Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or Arjuna in the Indian Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unfortunately, no.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The combat data we collected from Artemis<br> and Poseidon alone speaks volumes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We were able to weaken Arjuna&#39;s Divinity<br> by attacking the faith he engendered...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but we definitely won&#39;t be able to do the same with these gods. Their existence is fundamentally different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Their godly functionality is a core part of their being. Just look at the Theos Klironomia if you need proof.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Their functionality is what makes them gods; nothing can be done to alter that. And Zeus is the one who stands above all the others!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So, what are you two trying to say!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That Zeus is more powerful than any<br> other foe we&#39;ve faced to date!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Th-that can&#39;t possibly be true!<br> Don&#39;t you remember how tough Arjuna was!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> He was a monster who&#39;d absorbed every god in India! How could anything entire orders of magnitude more powerful than him even EXIST!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If, like Artemis and Poseidon...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Zeus has continuously ruled over this planet since ancient times without changing his very nature...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Then he is, without a doubt, in a league of his own.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For you see, the ancient dramatist<br> Aeschylus once described Zeus...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...as the omnipotent and omniscient god of justice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...An omnipotent King of the Gods...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Omnipotent... As in, all-powerful...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh, come now!<br> How can he possibly be omnipotent!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Zeus is strong, yes, but he&#39;s known for being sneaky and lecherous! He used to take any old animal or person he came across and toss them up into the sky as constellations!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> He also, um...wields thunderbolts said to be<br> capable of...incinerating the entire universe...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> I-is that true, Captain!? Come on!<br> Give it to us straight!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> You&#39;re a half-god on Poseidon&#39;s side, right!?<br> Just what the hell are the Olympic gods!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Are they just like the myths say,<br> or are they something entirely different!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> &#39;Cause if Zeus really does have the Authority<br> to destroy the whole universe\u2013</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know, okay!? I mean,<br> I can say that my father wasn&#39;t a machine...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But if this Lostbelt developed along an entirely<br> different timeline than the one we know...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...then it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Zeus turned out<br> to be a machine god, just like that Poseidon was.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If these gods are the embodiment of this planet&#39;s concrete and abstract, and possess the same abilities, properties, and Authority as described in the mythology...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And if, on top of that,<br> they also possess powerful mechanical bodies...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Then I suppose, maybe...those machines were always<br> their true bodies, even in Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And if that&#39;s the case,<br> that would mean this Lostbelt is...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Captain!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Oh, uh, right.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Anyway, if he is omnipotent\u2013and he seems to be\u2013then he&#39;s the strongest being in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So it&#39;s safe to assume he has Authority powerful and all-encompassing enough to merit leading the other Twelve Olympians.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know exactly what he&#39;s like here...but in the Age of Gods I know, he was definitely the top dog.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So if at all possible...<br> I&#39;d really rather not face him head-on...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly!<br> He is NOT someone we want to go head-to-head with!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;d be one thing if there was a way to snuff out all of his demiurge-class Divinity, like we did in Scandinavia and India...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But when it&#39;s an honest-to-goodness, genuine god<br> we&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s just not gonna work...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-what was that!?<br> Some kind of turbulence!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now fall...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...insignificant ones.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All hands, brace for impact!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thunderbolts!<br> No... These are great thunderbolts!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> These magical energy levels are bonkers! Every single bolt is ginormous! Wait... You&#39;re kidding me! They&#39;re all as strong as Artemis&#39;s cannon!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh come the hell on!<br> I&#39;ve heard of power creep, but this is nuts!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Meuni\xE8re! Do whatever you must to make sure those things don&#39;t hit us! We only just got this new ship!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Wait...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Checking hull readings now... I was right!<br> They&#39;re all missing us! But how!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Looks like our emergency scattering worked, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hell yeah it did!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll be! Excellent work, Captain! Technical Advisor! You&#39;re both far more useful than Acqua Pazza there!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So what was that gizmo just now, anyway? Some sort of secret defensive system you put together when I wasn&#39;t looking?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup, pretty much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s basically a kind of Spirit Origin chaff grenade that uses extremely high performance dummy Spirit Origins to throw off enemy attacks.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I only just finished putting it together before we went down the Great Pit. It&#39;s the Storm Border&#39;s latest defense!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I might not&#39;ve been able to finish it in time for our showdown with Artemis, but it&#39;s designed to even defend against attacks from orbit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And as you just saw, it works brilliantly!<br> None of that lightning is hitting us directly!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Whoa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re the best, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You know it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nice job scattering it, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No problem. I was already reaching for the<br> console as soon as I heard the \u201CZ\u201D in \u201CZeus.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Heh... That&#39;s right! Wahahaha!<br> Our Storm Border is amazing!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This is just the kind of dream ship I would&#39;ve imagined Captain Nemo and the Atlas Institute could come up with if they worked together! Not even Zeus&#39;s thunderbolts can touch us!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You see that, Zeus!? This is what Proper Human History&#39;s Mage&#39;s Association can do when we set our minds to it!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Now, all that being said, would you mind<br> if I brought up a different issue?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I know we&#39;re managing to fight a brilliant midair battle at the moment, but technically...this ship is still falling, right?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Of course we&#39;re technically falling! I&#39;m doing my damnedest to slow our fall with the propulsion system and inertia controls, but I can&#39;t change the fact that this is a boat!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Of course it&#39;s not gonna work right anywhere<br> that&#39;s not on the sea, underwater, or Void Space!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash! Get to your seats and<br> don&#39;t move a muscle! And keep an eye on the monitors!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Look for any body of water we could use for an<br> emergency landing! Sea, lake, pond... Anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yes, sir!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Dodging Zeus&#39;s thunderbolts won&#39;t do us much good if<br> we just end up being dashed to pieces on the ground!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We need to keep the Storm Border,<br> and myself, safe at any cost!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (True, every aspect of this new Border is undoubtedly at the cutting edge of Proper Human History technology.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (However...would the supreme being of a mythological system so advanced they&#39;ve had futuristic technology like nanomachines for thousands of years really miss his first strike?)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Then again, what if...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Captain! Da Vinci! Open the engine up full throttle!<br> It&#39;s not safe to be up in the air like this!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Nearby body of water or not,<br> we need to land while the chaff is still working!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There! Target spotted four thousand meters below!<br> We can use the trees in that forest to cushion our descent!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Set inertia control to seven o&#39;clock! Point the bow downward! Unfurl the Zero Sail by eighty percent!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> G-got it! I&#39;ll handle the controls!<br> All you marines, get to your posts, now!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong></p><p>Aye, aye, ma&#39;am! We&#39;ll blast our way<br> out of here like a giant marlin!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Keep scattering the Spirit Origin chaff as we descend! Once we&#39;re one thousand meters from the target landing point, pitch the bow up!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All hands, brace for impact!<br> It&#39;s going to be a bumpy landing!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Agh, this g-force is intense!<br> It feels like my gut&#39;s about to come clean off!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Why are we going down this fast, Captain!?<br> I thought the Spirit Origin chaff was keeping us safe!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> An elementary deduction, Goredolf. True, the Storm<br> Border&#39;s new weaponry is a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However...take a look at the gale of thunderbolts,<br> and consider this.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What if Zeus is still holding back,<br> and this is just what he considers warning shots?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Warning shots!? Then, you mean he<br> still has yet to actually attack us!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-then we&#39;re all as good as dead! They might call me Phoenix but that doesn&#39;t mean I can fly out of here!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Come on, everyone, hurry!<br> We need to get out of this airspace as soon as possible!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m trying to do!<br> ...Damn, it&#39;s no use. I can&#39;t dodge every bolt!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to take a direct hit!<br> Meuni\xE8re, take the helm!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Huh? Me!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Brace yourselves, everyone...!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Shit, shit, shit! How&#39;m I supposed to emergency land a freaking battleship when I&#39;ve never done it befoooaaah!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> And why&#39;m I the one taking the helm!?<br> The hell are you doing, Captaaaiiin!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Graaaaaaaaah!<br> All hands, make sure you&#39;re strapped in tiiiiiighhht!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> (Huff... Gasp...)</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...H-hey, we stopped.<br> I&#39;m alive... I think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! Are you all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure am! All thanks to my seat belt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your seat belt... I see. I guess Director Goredolf&#39;s<br> guidance paid off in spades here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine. What about you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m all right. I remained on standby in a half-sitting posture, so I could be ready for a worst-case scenario, and I guess it worked out.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> G-good, it looks like we stuck the emergency landing!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Next, shut down Magical Reactors One through Three! And hurry! If Zeus notices their magical energy, he&#39;ll come after us!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Already done! Captain, would you mind<br> taking care of the ship&#39;s camouflage?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m on it.<br> In fact, I&#39;m already done.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Since I disguised the ship right before we landed,<br> the enemy shouldn&#39;t have seen where we wound up.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Hurry up with the cloaking. They may not be able to see us, but they could still detect our magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aye, sir!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...All right, now that things have settled down,<br> let&#39;s assess our current situation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After Zeus attacked the Storm Border, we made an emergency landing near Olympus&#39;s western perimeter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> By deploying optical camouflage around the ship, we were able to evade visual detection during the landing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We&#39;ve also shut down the Border&#39;s motive power, namely the Magical Reactors, and surrounded the entire hull with a concealing Bounded Field to prevent the enemy from detecting its magical energy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This should mean we&#39;ve successfully landed the ship in Olympus with the enemy none the wiser as to our location...at least, theoretically.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First off, great work, everyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You should all be proud that we made it out of that<br> without having to resort to a dangerous Zero Sail.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, in the worst case, a Zero Sail taken without the necessary precautions could wipe us all out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Really, the few times we&#39;ve managed to pull<br> one off so far were basically miracles.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whew.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, the important thing is,<br> I&#39;m glad we&#39;re all okay!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It just goes to show what an excellent<br> machine the Storm Border truly is.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It can evade an omnipotent god&#39;s thunderbolts!<br> It can dive into Void Space!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If we brought it back to Proper Human History, it would be the greatest technological revolution of all time!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That will never happen. This ship couldn&#39;t exist in a world where humanity was flourishing like it&#39;s supposed to.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s only in this completely bleached world that my Nautilus Noble Phantasm, Sion&#39;s pseudo-Spiritron armor, aka the Hermes Skin...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Hephaestus&#39;s nanomachines, and Chaldea&#39;s engineering could all come together like this.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The only reason the Storm Border exists at all is to defeat the Foreign God. It won&#39;t have a purpose beyond that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-oh... I see. I suppose that&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s still a great, dependable ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Indeed, you&#39;re spot-on there.<br> I&#39;m glad to see you understand, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At any rate, we can&#39;t let everything<br> we did in Atlantis be for nothing.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And we certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to look the Atlanteans in the eye if we got ourselves shot down before we even landed the ship.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to be ready to use all available resources. Have you finished replenishing your Command Spells?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> All the precious backup Command Spells we saved<br> up in case we needed them for a huge battle...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...and we&#39;re just going to use<br> them up like it&#39;s nothing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All replenished, sir.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe I was actually able to replenish all three Command Spells...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well, I did say they were precious. We can&#39;t exactly buy more refills from the Command Spell store!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We were only able to scrape these together in time by running the Wandering Sea&#39;s Magical Reactors at full blast...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...pooling my technical and administrative advisors&#39; expertise, and having Sion pull a few all-nighters.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Only time and luck will tell if<br> we&#39;re ever able to make any more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So we were really fortunate<br> to be able to use them now.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose...<br> A-at any rate!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now that things have come to this,<br> we&#39;ll have to use every resource at our disposal!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> After all, we still have a crucial<br> mission we need to carry out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right. We absolutely must cut down<br> the Tree of Emptiness here in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Tell me, Technical Advisor, how safe<br> do you think we are right now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good question. From the scans of the surrounding area, I&#39;d say we lucked out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing this area we&#39;re in<br> now is in the outskirts of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There are almost no buildings here, there&#39;s no sign of any natives, and I don&#39;t see a single soldier or defensive weapon anywhere.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can thank Meuni\xE8re for his choice of landing spot, since he was the one handling the controls on short notice.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I agree. I would have landed the ship myself, but I had my hands full coordinating with the Nemo Series.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Great job, Meuni\xE8re. When we have a chance later,<br> I&#39;ll give you a proper lesson on how to steer the ship.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> W-well hey, haha, what can I say? It WAS pretty impressive if I do say so myself, but still!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Sure, I got a little panicked when you first asked me to take over, but I figured things would work out if I just stuck to my usual game plan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Meuni\xE8re.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You made the right call.</p><hr><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Ah, I can&#39;t really take the credit. The Storm Border<br> did all the hard work. I just kept it stable.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m glad I was able to help you out, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You definitely did. I was planning to station a<br> marine in the cockpit, but now I won&#39;t have to.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So since I&#39;ll have one to spare now,<br> I&#39;ll assign them to ship cleaning duty instead.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Good. Keeping the ship clean at all times<br> will be a great boost to morale.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ahem. Well, Administrative Advisor, the bad news?<br> I know well enough by now that it can&#39;t all be good.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Right you are, Director.<br> You really are getting the hang of this.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve shut down all of our Magical Reactors, restarting them will take some time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Which means, of course, that we are effectively stuck here for the time being. That means no Zero Sail, either.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-oh. I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At least they should have a hard time finding us here, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. As long as we remain hidden,<br> the odds of them detecting us should be low.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So does that mean we can&#39;t get away if they find us here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Good question. If they should happen to find us,<br> making an escape will be very difficult.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Right. As long as we&#39;re unable to start up the ship&#39;s engine at a moment&#39;s notice, we&#39;ll be out to sea without a lifeboat if we&#39;re spotted again.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If we end up taking several of those supercharged magical energy attacks head-on without even any of our defensive mechanisms to shield us, well...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t even want to think about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Captain! Wh-why&#39;d you collapse like that!?<br> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It looks like Zeus&#39;s great thunderbolts<br> were even more powerful than we thought.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The one that hit us didn&#39;t damage the ship too badly...<br> but it did...damage my Spirit Core...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no. Does this mean those thunderbolts<br> are actually Anti-Servant attacks!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;s a good thing...only one of them hit us...<br> If even one more of those had struck...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...we might&#39;ve ended up losing...our new ship...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Ngh... This is pathetic.<br> I don&#39;t...even have the strength to stand.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Dammit, get Nemo Nurse in here, on the double!<br> Make sure Captain&#39;s as comfortable as possible!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> R-right!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Does this mean you&#39;re injured as well, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Looks that way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I thought I was just feeling off thanks to all the magical energy I used for the chaff and the concealing spell...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But since I was acting as the Storm Border&#39;s CPU when we got hit...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I guess I actually got just as hurt as the Captain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I think I&#39;d better rest up for a while, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Easy there.<br> ...Good, I caught her in time.</p><p><strong>Nemo Nurse:</strong><br> Thanks for the nurse call.<br> Is it an emergency?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say! Thanks for coming, Nemo!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> It&#39;s Captain and Da Vinci!<br> The former collapsed, and the latter&#39;s totally drained!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Please, hurry!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes! Meuni\xE8re!<br> H-how are Da Vinci and Captain doing?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> They&#39;re both asleep now. Well, I say asleep,<br> but it&#39;s more like what we did back in Scandinavia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They&#39;re in the recovery pods I used at the time. They may seem fine on the surface, but their Spirit Cores have both suffered significant damage.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It may take them a few days, but don&#39;t worry.<br> We expect them both to make full recoveries.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To put it in the modern parlance,<br> this will be no big deal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it is! It&#39;s too bad we can&#39;t visit them while they&#39;re in the pods, but I&#39;m still glad to hear they&#39;ll be okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Quite so. Ideally, I&#39;d prefer to wait for their full recovery before we begin our plan of attack in earnest, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Indeed. We have neither the time nor the<br> mental capacity to spare for that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Both the Captain and the technical advisor<br> fulfilled their duties spectacularly!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Yes, they may be useless for the time being,<br> but no matter. Their recovery takes priority.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Meanwhile, those of us who remain have an obligation to make the most of this opportunity they&#39;ve given us. Namely\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Make a move before we&#39;re found, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Exactly. By this point, I suppose there was no need<br> for me to say anything after all, was there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Buy them a nice fruit basket for when they wake up, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be daft, [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F girl]!<br> I already arranged for one of those!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ahem. All right, as the new director of Chaldea, and<br> the commander of the Storm Border, here are my orders.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru.<br> Mash Kyrielight, [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] faithful Servant.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There is still much we don&#39;t know about our situation, but even so, I&#39;ll need you two to head out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t be able to support you as<br> normal with our technical advisor incapacitated...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...myself, Meuni\xE8re, and our administrative advisor<br> will do our best to fill her shoes in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Your sole objective for now is to explore this Lostbelt and recruit other Proper Human History Servants!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hehe. At least this time, we won&#39;t be at a complete disadvantage thanks to the vanguard that got here ahead of us.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Once you find the Heroic Spirits that came here from<br> Atlantis, the tide is sure to turn swiftly in our favor!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If we&#39;re going to defeat that detestable Kirschtaria, cut down that preposterously huge Tree of Emptiness...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...and destroy that incredibly dangerous Zeus,<br> you&#39;ll need to meet up with them, first!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hehe, just what I like to hear.<br> Now I can relax and really enjoy my breakfast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get going, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ve just run a scan of our vicinity...and I&#39;m afraid<br> the circumstances are very much not in our favor.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we will be no more able to bolster our<br> ranks via summoning circle here than we were in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Every last leyline for kilometers is under intense observation. They are too man-made\u2013or perhaps I should say god-made\u2013to be of use to us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Suffice to say, we won&#39;t be able to secure the magical energy necessary to summon and maintain new Heroic Spirits while here in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to be content with using the Spirit Origin graph for temporary, combat-only summons.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> All the more reason you need to find the Heroic<br> Spirits who came here ahead of us as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> With the forces we have, we won&#39;t even be able to keep ourselves safe, let alone accomplish the mission.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> It would&#39;ve made things a lot easier if we could&#39;ve summoned more combat-ready Heroic Spirits from a leyline...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...but I guess that was too much to hope for,<br> just like it was in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Well, in the meantime, I don&#39;t know how much<br> these&#39;ll help, but here, these are for you two.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks, Meuni\xE8re.<br> But, um, what are they?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> They&#39;re disguise kits\u2013well, a kind of Mystic Code, really\u2013that<br> Da Vinci made in secret based off the Atlanteans.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Basically, they use magecraft to deceive onlookers<br> both optically and perceptually...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...giving you the same effect as wearing a disguise<br> without actually having to put one on.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> She said they make use of the same disguise principles as Holmes&#39;s Noble Phantasm. They should let you disguise yourself as residents of Olympus and\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gather the information we need.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Right. I know this is business as usual for<br> you guys by now, but still, be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Make our way into the city of Olympus.</p><hr><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> The silver lining here is that your magical energy<br> readings are the same as any other human&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Apparently, even Mash only has a tiny bit<br> of Servant aura about her right now.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> So hey, in that sense, this should make it a lot easier to sneak in than it would be if you were bringing Servants along.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Under these circumstances, the risk of a hostile<br> Servant noticing me or Senpai should be very low.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So if all goes well, this should give us the chance we need to rendezvous with the Heroic Spirits who got here before us!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...But, uh, that being said, you&#39;ll still be at<br> a major disadvantage if you do end up in a fight.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> So don&#39;t lean on the disguise kits too heavily, okay?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Then again, you&#39;re both old hands now with Rayshifts and Lostbelts, so I&#39;m sure you already know that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Director.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hm? What is it, Administrative Advisor?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have two suggestions I&#39;d like you to hear.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The first is that we send the combat and environmental information we&#39;ve gathered to date to the Wandering Sea in a data packet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And for the second, well, I think discretion would be the best course for this one...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s this now?<br> Hahaha, careful. I&#39;m quite ticklish, you know.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Wh-what was that!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Are you serious, Administrative Advisor!?<br> But that&#39;s... Surely you can&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Director, do you remember the border guards<br> that Odysseus kept under his command?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m quite certain that your concerns,<br> while understandable, are nevertheless unwarranted.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Nnn... Nnnnnnnnn...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s incredibly risky, but I can&#39;t deny that<br> it also makes a lot of sense... Nnnghhh!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...A-all right.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A-as the director of Novum Chaldea, I can&#39;t have my subordinates be the only ones putting themselves in danger to restore Proper Human History!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Very well, Administrative Advisor!<br> I accept your proposal!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you. I had every confidence<br> you would make the right decision.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This is no laughing matter, if you ask me...<br> Geez.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What were you guys talking about?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid the time is not yet right.<br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll find out soon enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! I haven&#39;t heard you say that<br> in a long time, Holmes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ha ha ha.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This is no laughing matter, if you ask me...<br> Geez.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> All right, once again: Fujimaru! Mash Kyrielight!<br> As director of Novum Chaldea, here are your orders!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You two are to leave the Border at once<br> and make your way to the city of Olympus!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Once you&#39;re inside, find out where the other Proper Human History Servants are and meet up with them posthaste!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> After you have secured an adequate fighting force,<br> you are to cut down the Fifth Tree of Emptiness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. We&#39;ll go begin our<br> Olympus investigation right now!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fo, foooooou!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Directly beneath the Fifth Tree of Emptiness, Magellan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Interstellar Mountainous City Olympus.

Priestess Queen Europa.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I hope you will accept this humble apology.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Limbo.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ALimbo:</strong><br> ...Oh my.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I do beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...Not at all. I am the one who owes you an apology.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I hope you will forgive my momentary surprise,<br> O gods of foreign lands.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Limbo.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be absurd, my illustrious Queen Europa.<br> I am the one who has wronged you.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Not at\u2013</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Silence, all of you.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I understand your anger. I understand your impatience.<br> But stay your tongues.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> There are some facts we must accept,<br> no matter how humiliating they may be.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Namely, the fact that without the Tree of Emptiness,<br> none of us could exist.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Our glorious Olympus&#39;s prosperity... We Twelve Olympians&#39; eternal reign... All depend on the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> This we must come to terms with if we are to overcome the tree&#39;s hold on us.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Overcome the tree&#39;s hold? Does that mean<br> you plan to cut down the Tree of Emptiness?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> As long as you grow the Tree to full maturity, we have no objections as to what you do with it afterwards.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> But still, the very idea of overcoming<br> the tree&#39;s hold is just... Hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Are you truly capable of such a thing, almighty Zeus!?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Indeed, it is a task beyond<br> even my all-encompassing power.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Which is why I have formed an alliance with my<br> sworn friend, Kirschtaria Wodime the Crypter.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Zeus! Need I remind you that he is only a human!?</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Zeus! You would still call<br> that human your sworn friend!?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Silence.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime the Crypter is no ordinary human.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> One could well liken the mammalian humans from<br> Proper Human History to little more than sentient reeds.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> And indeed, Kirschtaria is sentient.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But no mere reed could ever be that strong.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...So this is the Machina Corridor of the<br> Great Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona, huh.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s way too damn long if you ask me. How&#39;s a guy supposed to cross this thing and get where he&#39;s going on time?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Did they just make it to scale with the gods of Olympus or something? At this rate, I&#39;m gonna die of old age before I get anywhere.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Still, on a different note, I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s just<br> letting me walk around like this unsupervised.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wodime...<br> I swear, I can&#39;t tell what that guy&#39;s thinking.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Now I feel like an idiot for keeping my guard up constantly, figuring it was just a matter of time before he sends someone to finish me off.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (I always thought a Crypter without a Lostbelt would be worthless, that he wouldn&#39;t have anywhere left to go, and no reason to be kept alive.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (I was sure he was just going to take<br> my Sirius Light and be done with me...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Was I wrong? I remember Director Marisbury said:</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> \u201CThe Sirius Light is the power to overturn the very world. Possessing it is what makes you a Crypter.\u201D</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> We studied every abnormality that could possibly occur during the seven ages. We trained for every scenario we might encounter in the simulator...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Team A was supposed to save the world, and our Sirius Lights were supposed to be our trump card.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...It&#39;s strange. When you think about it, we were never actually told exactly what the Sirius Light is.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Sure, they told us that they&#39;re even more powerful Command Spells, and that they produce more magical energy than the user could generate on their own...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...but the only one of us who actually knows<br> when and why to use them is Wodime.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (After all, he was the one<br> entrusted with their timing...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...so he should also be the only one who knows how<br> the Sirius Lights are really meant to be used.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (So then, why hasn&#39;t he taken mine...?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Ever since we came back to life, Wodime&#39;s always said how the Crypters are all equal in the Foreign God&#39;s eyes, but it never occurred to me that he might really mean it.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Does this mean...he seriously believes that?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Dammit, what am I saying? There&#39;s no way he could. He&#39;s a noble. He&#39;s got to have an angle I&#39;m not seeing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> There must be something that only he knows.<br> Something about the Sirius Lights...the Foreign God...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...the Trees of Emptiness...<br> and why the Lostbelts can exist in the present day.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...All right, Wodime.<br> I&#39;ll find out what it is you&#39;re up to.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Whatever it is you and Zeus are plotting,<br> I&#39;m gonna bring it to light.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And if I&#39;m gonna do that...<br> I&#39;m gonna need a distraction that really stands out.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You know, I was thinking.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I still haven&#39;t been punished for my failure<br> with the Indian Lostbelt, right?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So go ahead and punish me however you see fit,<br> Wodime. Whatever it is, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I hope I have not given you cause to mistake me, Pepe.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> We Crypters are colleagues, nothing more. I have no more authority to punish you than any of the others do.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> For the time being, Scandinavia Peperoncino,<br> let&#39;s just be glad you&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re sure taking all this in stride.<br> Not that I expected anything less, of course.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But I still wouldn&#39;t feel right getting off scot-free.<br> Why don&#39;t you at least take my Sirius Light?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Sure, I could probably save more face with the Foreign<br> God if I offered it up to them instead...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...but I couldn&#39;t care less about getting in either<br> the Foreign God or the Alter Egos&#39; good graces.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So here, hon, you can have my Sirius Light.<br> Make sure you make good use of it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Thank you, Pepe, but there&#39;s no need for that.<br> You can keep yours.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The Sirius Light has not been my responsibility since Team A ceased to be relevant.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So no, you should hang onto yours.<br> What you do with it is up to you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So Ophelia didn&#39;t happen to die after using hers.<br> She died BECAUSE she used her Sirius Light.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Would I be right in assuming that&#39;s what Marisbury had in mind when he put our team together?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Not at liberty to answer that, huh?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Nooow I get it. I&#39;m starting to see just a little<br> more of what your relationship was really like.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Despise me if you wish.<br> You are probably right to do so.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Despise you? Now you&#39;re just insulting me, Wodime.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I think the fact that you&#39;re refusing to say anything<br> just goes to show how much integrity you have.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Up to this point, I still wasn&#39;t<br> sure who was connected to what...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...but I think I&#39;m finally starting<br> to see how the pieces fit together.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Teehee! It never really sunk in before, but I guess<br> we really are enemies of humanity after all!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I have to say, Pepe, your sheer mental fortitude never fails to surprise me. I&#39;m amazed you can still smile like that under these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hey, it&#39;s the one thing I&#39;ve got going for me. Though, in my case, it&#39;s more despair than self-possession.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But hey, the important things are that I&#39;m alive right now, and what it is I need to do next, right?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I&#39;d never get anywhere if I spent all my time<br> fretting about a past I can&#39;t change.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So I&#39;m just going to tell you this, in the hope<br> that it might lead to an even more fun future.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You know how the Disciples are always telling us the Foreign God wants the Lostbelts to flourish, and that the strongest one will become the foundation of a new humanity?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m positive they&#39;re lying.<br> They&#39;re not planning on any of the Lostbelts surviving.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> While we&#39;ve been hoping that one of the Lostbelts<br> would become the next Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...they&#39;ve got other plans entirely.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...And why do you think that?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hehe. I heard it straight from the Alter Ego&#39;s mouth back when he was elated at the prospect of his seemingly assured victory.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I swear, I never would&#39;ve guessed his fondness for hearing himself talk would actually work in our favor!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Haha. I see. So you got Limbo to talk.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Then I won&#39;t be responsible for what you&#39;ve learned, and it won&#39;t violate my contract with the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...That being said, Myourenji, I can&#39;t say anything<br> more in response to what you&#39;ve just told me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> All I can tell you is that I am prepared to establish<br> this Lostbelt as the new Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...and that I have done everything<br> I can to see that vision made reality.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I will use everything at my disposal to ensure this Atlantic Lostbelt becomes this planet&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> In the meantime, I want you to carry out your duties as a member of Team A in whatever way you feel is best.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hey, you don&#39;t have to tell me.<br> I was already planning to do whatever I wanted.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Besides, I was never really into the whole<br> \u201Cking of the Earth\u201D competition thing, anyway.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But let me know if you ever need help with anything, all right? I&#39;m not THAT much of an ingrate, you know.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Not that much of an ingrate, huh.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course I know that, Pepe.<br> You&#39;ve been of help to me more often than you realize.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You always described yourself as a cold-blooded killer, but in fact, you were always the most humane...always honored your obligations more than any of us.</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oh? Unless I am very much mistaken, there is a great deal of venom in your expression. Are you unhappy with what we just discussed?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Peperoncino came to his conclusions based on what the Alter Ego said. There&#39;s no need to eliminate him.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Nor did I tell the other Crypters any of the Foreign God&#39;s secrets.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So far as I can tell, there have been no breaches of contract here. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Everything is proceeding according to plan. The Tree of Emptiness is now a fully grown catalyst, ready to bring your true form down to this world.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Zeus no doubt means to use<br> this energy for his own ideals.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> For my part, I have no intention of getting in his way.<br> I promised him I wouldn&#39;t, after all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> We agreed that, though our positions may be very different, Zeus and I would work together to ensure that the Atlantic Lostbelt is fully completed.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And I will not be going back on my word.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not after he trusted me enough to let<br> me see him in a moment of weakness.</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m well aware. If Zeus&#39;s plan comes to fruition...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...the Tree of Emptiness&#39;s magical energy will be depleted, and the Foreign God&#39;s descent will be delayed.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Should that happen, I will be considered in breach of contract, and my life will be forfeit.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...But that is not going to happen.<br> Much as it pains me to say this as his friend...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Zeus&#39;s ideals will never work, even if his plan is flawless. Once they fail, that is where I come into play.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll see that my job is done perfectly.<br> I value my life as much as anyone, after all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It would be equally trivial for me to complete this<br> Lostbelt and see Zeus&#39;s ideals realized...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...or to conclude this Lostbelt and let<br> the Foreign God descend upon this world.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The only unknown factor that could possibly pose an obstacle to either of those outcomes is Chaldea, and whatever course of action Fujimaru<br> chooses to pursue.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I only hope [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] spirit isn&#39;t yet broken. I&#39;m counting<br> on [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] to make [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] way here and once more throw<br> [\u2642 himself /\u2640\uFE0F herself] into battle against me...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...so that I can conclusively demonstrate<br> to [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] that [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] efforts were for naught.</p><h2 id="section-2-olympus-s-reception-first-half" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-olympus-s-reception-first-half" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Olympus&#39;s Reception (First Half)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s been two hours since we left the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our comms still aren&#39;t working well,<br> so we can&#39;t get in touch with anyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I doubt the Bounded Fields our disguises are generating are interfering with the signal, so it must be the magical energy in the atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess this means we&#39;ll need to head back to<br> the Border to tell everyone what we find out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No need to rush.

Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demeter, the goddess of the land.<br> Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I overheard a few others as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if they were talking about the gods<br> of mythology, or other people named after them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They could also be talking about Divine Spirits...<br> Heroic Spirits... Mechanical gods, like in Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or maybe there are other actual non-<br> Divine Spirit gods here, like Zeus.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Most gods here will probably be our enemies, but maybe not all of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;ll be gods like Apollo who are willing to help us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hope you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that Zeus himself has attacked us, it&#39;s only natural for most of the other gods to follow his lead...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but there should still be other gods like<br> Apollo who will be exceptions to the rule.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Nkyu... Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ll let us know if you sense anything dangerous,<br> right, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right, Senpai, let&#39;s start gathering information.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should be able to learn what we need by making<br> close contact with the local Olympians and talking to them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-hello. May almighty Zeus&#39;s protection be with you.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh, hey there.<br> May Zeus and Hera&#39;s protection be with you, too.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Say... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you around here before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right, I suppose you haven&#39;t.<br> I only just got here from the, um...countryside?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Er, I basically came from the edge of town,<br> so I&#39;m still not used to being around so many people.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Really? I&#39;m pretty sure this is what<br> it&#39;s like everywhere in Olympus...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Then again, I&#39;ve only been to Shrinetown a few times, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve seen everything the city has to offer.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> And hey, there were some less urban areas ten thousand years or so ago, so I guess it makes sense that there are still some districts like that now.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> So, what brings you here?<br> You just move in or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, nothing like that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m just, um...passing through? On a trip?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, I don&#39;t know much about this area,<br> so I was hoping you might be able to fill me in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anything you could tell us would help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We just got here today, and we&#39;re really lost.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh, is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] with you?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> [\u2642 I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re married or something?

You a squirrel?<br> Some kind of Chimera pup? ...No, I&#39;m guessing not.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Anyway, I won&#39;t pry. I think it&#39;s great you&#39;re traveling, and I&#39;d be glad to tell you what you want to know.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> This is the west side of the Interstellar Mountainous City of Olympus&#39;s Tenth Residential Layer. Here, take a look.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t the Holy Vessel Ring Cronus Crown<br> look beautiful from this angle!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Cronus Crown...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> See the great shrine inside it up there? You&#39;ll never get such a great view of it over in the East District.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> That&#39;s Great Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona, the heavenly castle of our holy gods. Glory be to Zeus!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> And way up there, above the crystal mountains that provide us with unlimited magical energy?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> That&#39;s Atlas, the World Tree.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> It used to be called the Tree of Emptiness,<br> but almighty Zeus gave it a new name.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> It&#39;s a miraculous tree made up of Zeus&#39;s glorious light, and it was a gift from some gods of a foreign land.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You can see it real clearly here, right? When it blooms, we&#39;re going to hold a huge festival right in this district!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...festival?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Well sure. After all...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...that tree is what&#39;s keeping us alive after<br> we were cut off from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Hahaha. I see, I see.<br> It&#39;s not every day we get travelers around here.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> The last ones I met were a young couple a lot like you two about two hundred years ago. Yes, that&#39;s it. You should be proud.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong at all with taking the path less traveled. I have absolute faith that the gods support us humans in all our vast diversity.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Still, that being said...<br> I don&#39;t have much I can teach you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Surely, you&#39;d already learned about<br> the Crown and the World Tree, right?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> No matter where you go, Olympus&#39;s endless bounty surrounds you!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> It&#39;s always been that way, especially over the<br> last few thousand years, and it always will be.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> So there&#39;s nowhere in all of Olympus you could<br> go where we aren&#39;t positively spoiled by riches.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Just look at all these glittering production towers!<br> The ambrosia Lady Demeter bestows upon us every day!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Things like hunger, illness, injury, and<br> pain are all relics of the distant pas\u2013</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s right. Two hundred years ago.<br> It was practically just the other day.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...My job?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Haha, you travelers are funny. Jobs are those things people used to have to do to earn money, right?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed you still remember such an ancient concept.<br> Are you history buffs or something?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Well, I think that&#39;s wonderful.<br> There&#39;s just something romantic about archaeology.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> It&#39;s such a shame that the gods don&#39;t like to talk about things that happened more than ten thousand or so years ago, and that there aren&#39;t more records of the past.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You must run into the same problems at every university and research organization. ...Me? Oh, no, I don&#39;t go to university.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I&#39;m an artist. There&#39;s nothing that brings the gods<br> more joy than the evolution of art and culture!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what we would do without the gods. They watch over us, protect us, love us... Ahh, glory be to Zeus!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh, yes, in my case, I study under Educational Terminal No. 3 at the nearby art academy!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Well, me, and about five hundred<br> thousand other students. Hehe.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> War?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;ve heard that used to be a thing. You can read all about it in the government records, libraries, and university archives.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh, wait. Is your district one of the ones that doesn&#39;t<br> have any big government offices or libraries?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed there are still places in<br> Olympus bereft of the gods&#39; glory.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Anyway, sure, I can tell you what I know.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> A long time ago, there were<br> four great wars called machia.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> The first was between Zeus&#39;s gods and Cronus&#39;s Titans. The second was between Zeus&#39;s gods and the White Death.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> The third was between Zeus&#39;s gods and the Gigantes.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> And the fourth was\u2013</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Huh? The exile that took place<br> a few thousand years ago?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Yes, that was part of the fourth machia, a tragic civil war fought between the gods themselves.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> The followers of the gods who lost\u2013the poor people who did not accept the gods&#39; protection...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...left Olympus and descended to Atlantis.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Though another theory says that they left<br> in search of their far-off homeland.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Either way, it&#39;s all in the past now. Humans have never waged war with one another, and they never will.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s great here!<br> Every day&#39;s so much fun!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I played all day yesterday,<br> and I&#39;m gonna play all day today, too!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Hey, what kind of animal is that?<br> A baby Chimera? A lion?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;d you say?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Is there anything we&#39;re scared of?<br> Or anything that hurts us?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Uh, no? I can&#39;t think of anything like that.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Heck, I can&#39;t even remember the last time...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...I heard words like \u201Cpain\u201D or \u201Cscary\u201D!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Are you two in pain?<br> Are you scared of something?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You want to know more about the gods?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...You can&#39;t be serious, right?<br> Is this a trick question or something?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Huh?<br> You&#39;re from the countryside?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Do you know about Lord Zeus?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I had no idea there were still areas within Olympus<br> bereft of the gods&#39; glorious protection.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Do tell where you&#39;re from later, okay? I&#39;ll let them know during my regular prayer at the branch shrine.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Lady Europa will take care of<br> it once we bring this to her attention.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You do know who Lady Europa is, right?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Queen Europa is Lord Zeus&#39;s wife. She&#39;s a demigod who assimilated with Lady Hera, so she&#39;s sure to hear your prayers.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...Really?<br> Don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t even know that?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> What about the branch shrines? You know, the places<br> we go so the gods will hear our voices?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Do you mean you don&#39;t even know about them? ...How the gods can hear us better there than anywhere else?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You poor children.<br> That&#39;s the saddest thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry.<br> The gods watch over all of us equally.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Ahh, glory to the great gods of Olympus!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Glory to the ones who sit atop<br> the great shrine, in possession of the Cronus Crown!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Lady Demeter! Lady Aphrodite!<br> Lord and Lady Dioscuri! Queen Europa!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Almighty Zeus!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Glory to our guests, the gods of foreign lands...</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> ...and to Lord Zeus&#39;s sworn friend,<br> Lord Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kirschtaria...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess that means everyone in Olympus<br> knows who Kirschtaria is then.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh my, do watch your tongue. You can&#39;t refer to<br> Lord Zeus&#39;s sworn friend without a title.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! I-I&#39;m sorry.<br> That just slipped out...</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Hehe. I don&#39;t mind so much myself, but you could end up on probation if one of the guards were to hear you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Probation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, we&#39;d be thrown in jail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean, we&#39;d be executed?</p><hr><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh my... This is even worse than I thought. I can&#39;t even imagine how undeveloped the place you grew up in must be.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> You should really file a proper complaint with<br> your local government office about this.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Just to be perfectly clear, no guard would<br> ever do anything so barbaric as that.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Lord Zeus has decreed that not a single drop<br> of blood should ever be spilled in Olympus.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> Oh my, I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s still even one<br> place in the city that uses language like that.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AOlympus Citizen:</strong><br> This is just beyond belief...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry. I was just reading a history book recently, and I guess I kind of got history mixed up with reality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nice recovery, Mash!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Th-thank you, Senpai.<br> I just wish I hadn&#39;t had to lie to her...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Easy mistake.

How!?<br> They&#39;re just ordinary human Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Too bad. He outclasses me in sheer ability and training, but he knows absolutely nothing about real combat!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Forgive me!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AOlympus Soldier:</strong><br> Well done.<br> I mean it.</p><p><strong>Olympus Soldier:</strong><br> ...Will you tell me your names again, Chaldeans?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Miyamoto Musashi, of Niten Ichiryu.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> ...Mash Kyrielight, Demi-Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1AOlympus Soldier:</strong><br> ...Musashi. Mash. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AOlympus Soldier:</strong><br> Olympus will never let you escape with your lives.<br> We WILL kill you. On that, you have my word.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy hostile completely silenced.<br> The battle is over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t planning to take his life directly...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you weren&#39;t. That&#39;s why I did it.<br> There a problem with that, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...No. Well, yes... But it&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Good. Now, do you know what we need to do next?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get away from here as fast as we can...right?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Very good. Remember, you&#39;re in the heart of enemy<br> territory now, so get used to making calls like that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re all okay! Did I manage to make it in time for the start of the adventure!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course. Thanks, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure did. Thanks for showing up to save us.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You bet! Whenever Chaldea&#39;s in danger, I&#39;ll be there to help! I still have to pay you guys back for letting me stay there, after all!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, I know we have a lot to catch up on, but right<br> now, we should focus on getting out of here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Like I said, this is the heart of enemy territory, so we don&#39;t want to stick around. Know the way out of town, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Y-yes, I do!<br> I&#39;ll secure an escape route right now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Great! I knew you had a keen eye for this stuff.<br> How about you, Mr. Detective? Can you stand?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I can. It would seem the bleeding&#39;s stopped as well. Thank you, Ms. Miyamoto. I don&#39;t know what I would have done if you hadn&#39;t come along.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would also seem you&#39;re more right than you know.<br> Take a look.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple Olympian soldiers spotted!<br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess there&#39;s no going back the way we came!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash! We need a new route, now!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! But, I&#39;m afraid all three<br> major roads have been blockaded\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then we can take the back alleys!<br> They&#39;re nice and twisty; perfect for making a getaway!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would seem to make more sense than moving about in the open...but wouldn&#39;t our enemy be more familiar with the lay of the land than us?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> True. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll just have to trust to our luck when it comes to whether or not we&#39;ll run into anyone!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If we do...we&#39;ll just have to<br> cut them down and keep moving!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay, let&#39;s get going!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Huff... Gasp...)<br> Phew, this is rough!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I swear, is everyone in Olympus as strong as a<br> Heroic Spirit!? &#39;Cause it sure feels like it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not detecting any magical energy readings nearby. I think we managed to lose them for the time being.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use a talisman to put up a concealment Bounded Field. It&#39;s not much, but it should give you a moment to breathe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You did great, Master. You just ran the equivalent<br> of a fifteen hundred meter dash at full speed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You should use this chance to take some deep breaths and replenish your oxygen levels. Would it help to sit down?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m pretty light on my feet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m okay, thanks. Don&#39;t forget to rest up yourself, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I won&#39;t. Thank you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Thank you, Fou.<br> That&#39;s very considerate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I guess it wasn&#39;t just that first Olympian<br> soldier who turned out to be incredibly strong.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> No, it wasn&#39;t. These people have all been powered up to an unheard-of degree. It feels like humans were brought up to Heroic Spirit-level while still somehow remaining human.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And they&#39;re not just physically strong. Their mental toughness is off the charts, too. They didn&#39;t even bat an eye at losing an arm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, well, you can understand why they might be so fired up, as they say nowadays. They&#39;re fighting for their world just as much as we are for ours.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No doubt they have their own loved ones they wish to protect here. It&#39;s little wonder they would put up such a tremendous fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There was always a chance that we would need to fight our way through the local populace in previous Lostbelts. Now, it would seem, that possibility has become reality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Meaning, every person in this Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is, everyone who lives here in Olympus...<br> should now be considered our enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Everyone in this Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Zeus&#39;s revelation was extremely effective. From now on, we should consider the entire city to be on the lookout for us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Suffice to say, the Olympians are simultaneously innocents who depend on the Tree of Emptiness for their survival...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...and vicious enemies who will take<br> any chance they can to end us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which is exactly why we need to hold our heads high.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Not \u201CWe need to beat them\u201D or \u201CWe need to be strong,\u201D<br> but \u201CWe need to hold our heads high,\u201D huh?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (...[\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] really does have [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] head screwed on straight.<br> I didn&#39;t even have to break out a pep talk.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (I guess they&#39;ve both seen a whole lotta worlds in the time between Russia and here.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Oh, right. This really isn&#39;t the time<br> to let our guard down and relax, is it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, we don&#39;t know if these people can still<br> hear us through the Bounded Field or not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They can&#39;t. Strong as they may be, the Olympian soldiers are still limited by their human perception capabilities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The defensive systems do seem able<br> to sense magical energy...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but given the sheer amount found in the atmosphere,<br> the addition of a few Servants shouldn&#39;t draw any notice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So as long as we don&#39;t have, say, a Divine<br> Spirit-class Servant among our ranks...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...or they don&#39;t try to find us with something similar<br> to a god&#39;s own eyes, we should be safe for\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Mr. Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...As I was saying, something similar to a god&#39;s own eyes could be able to detect the Bounded Field itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A god, in this case, referring to any being that surpasses our common understanding of magecraft and Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words, to a god, or a being roughly on par with one, we would appear to be totally out in the open!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An enormous magical energy reading is headed our way!<br> Thirty meters...twenty...ten...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming from the other side of the alley!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...It was humanoid.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was definitely shaped like a human...<br> but it was much too big to be one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It resembled nothing so much as a giant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sound of metal scraping together pierced the air.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Intruders detected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Initiating elimination.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was...a bronze giant.</p><h2 id="section-3-olympus-s-reception-second-half" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-olympus-s-reception-second-half" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Olympus&#39;s Reception (Second Half)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Intruders detected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Initiating elimination.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A bronze giant!<br> According to myth, it is a monster... Now I see!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It must have incorporated legends from the island of Rhodes... So the gods themselves must have minted this bronze giant!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And now, in Olympus, they&#39;ve no doubt deployed it as an automatic defensive system for the purpose of eliminating intruders!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Its magical energy readings are too<br> high for my sensors to measure!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> This output is on par with a Divine Spirit! And its<br> magical energy type isn&#39;t like any other kind of giant!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> A bronze giant, huh!<br> I guess this means we really are in Greece!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t look like blades&#39;ll be much use against it, either...or that it&#39;s about to let us go without a fight!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now that it&#39;s found us, we&#39;ve got no choice<br> but to send this hardhead packing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Get ready to fight, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Raising Ortinax output!<br> Engaging combat mode!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All functions are fine-tuned and working properly!

Well, except for one thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think so, but something doesn&#39;t quite add up.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Back at Chaldea, your drift was recorded<br> as something similar in nature to a Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So my understanding was that you could only drift<br> to different time periods in parallel worlds.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup. As a rule, my drifts always put me in different<br> worlds, never in the same one I drifted from.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Before, if I wanted to drift back to<br> the same world as all of you guys...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d basically have to keep drifting between different worlds and hope I&#39;d eventually get lucky.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> When I drifted out of Russia, I found myself<br> face-to-face with the same bleached-white Earth of 2020.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I tried a few more drifts after that,<br> and they all turned out the same way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> While I didn&#39;t always end up in the same location,<br> I did always end up in the same world and time period.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> A bit surprising at first, but I realized I&#39;d basically gained a superpower: the ability to teleport across long distances.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> From there, I spent my days wandering around, fighting off weird creatures, and testing how much I could control my new ability.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then, one day...</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> ...Watch yourself, woman.</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> Colliding with another teleporter is unheard of,<br> even in the magecraft world.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I ran into this guy who was kind of arrogant but basically all right, and we ended up traveling together for a while.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> He turned out to know a ton about all kinds of things! Like, he knew what kind of divine power my drift uses...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And what happened to you guys after Russia...<br> I&#39;m not sure there was anything he DIDN&#39;T know!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, he pretty much caught<br> me up on the whole situation...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...so I decided to sneak into the Atlantic Lostbelt<br> ahead of you guys and wait for you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, I even managed to drift into Olympus easy-peasy!<br> They never even knew I was here!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Unfortunately, my drift only works on me, so I couldn&#39;t bring Robed Guy or any other Heroic Spirits along.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> They&#39;re probably gonna need more help besides just me. Should we spend more time looking for other Servants?</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> ...No need. Circumstances being what they are, we can be assured that a Grand Servant will appear in the Atlantic Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> That Servant will be a much more powerful ally than you could ever hope to be.</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> They will need you as well. If you want to come along, I can take you as far as the Atlantic Lostbelt, but no farther.</p><p><strong>Robed Figure:</strong><br> ...Hmph. The Counter Force truly is nothing if not<br> meticulous, meandering, and mean-spirited.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So basically, your self-warping powers really came through.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup! I always used to think of this tendency to drift as a problem, so I&#39;m glad it turned out to actually be useful for once!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, in exchange for no longer being able to Rayshift<br> to different time periods in parallel worlds...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re now essentially able to freely<br> teleport, at least to a certain extent?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s very impressive that you&#39;ve been able to make your way into Lostbelts without embarking on a Zero Sail.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;m not really sure how it works<br> myself, but that all sounds right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So in summary, your drift ability involved jumping into the rift between worlds, then emerging into another world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s safe to assume that<br> it still works that same way...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...since that would explain how you were able to get past the Lostbelts&#39; storm walls.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The idea is that you&#39;re jumping into a higher dimension,<br> then falling back down to a lower one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only difference is that before, you could fall<br> down to any number of possible destinations...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but now, you&#39;re only falling back to this world,<br> which is why you always emerge somewhere here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah, exactly. Hehe. Guess I can&#39;t really call it drifting anymore then, can I?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.<br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...One last thing. Who is this robed guy you met?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...What about the robed guy? Can you tell us any more about him?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d like to know that too. Is he the robed figure<br> we&#39;ve heard rumors about in the other Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The one who claims to be from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nnn... Sorry, but I can&#39;t answer that.<br> He made me promise not to.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And I still owe him for giving me food and shelter<br> for a night, so I can&#39;t go back on my word.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I...see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Well, I&#39;m still glad to know he helped you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> At least we know he helped you, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right... He did, didn&#39;t he!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We may not know who he is,<br> but we do know he sent you here to help us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if it&#39;s thanks to him that we were reunited,<br> he must be\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s got to be on Chaldea&#39;s side.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> U-uh, yeah, maybe? I mean, it&#39;d be great if that turned out to be the case. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, Fujimaru and Mash,<br> there&#39;s something I want you to keep in mind.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yes, the Heroic Spirits who came here<br> from Atlantis may all be gone now...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but you still had allies here willing to risk their lives for you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So while it might feel like you&#39;re fighting<br> all on your own sometimes, you&#39;re not.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You may not be able to see it, but your home world of<br> Proper Human History is still here to back you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah... There&#39;s always been someone around to help us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hearing you say that is all the reassurance<br> I need to know you&#39;ll be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aah! Fou!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ahahaha, I see you&#39;re raring to go too, Fou!<br> That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re right! Motivation is the key to success! And we&#39;re gonna need all the motivation we can get so we can settle things once and for all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> What, does saying it out loud scare you? Don&#39;t worry, we<br> can do this! You guys already took out two of the gods!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but, we only managed to do that because we had so many Servants helping us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not to mention they had all enhanced their Spirit<br> Origins using the Olympian gods&#39; Theos Klironomia!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> On top of all that, they had to risk everything they had, and even then, we were only just able to eke out a victor\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmph!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm, hmmm. This isn&#39;t good, Mash!<br> You&#39;ve been bit by the cowardice bug!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, um... A cowardice bug...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Bugs like that need to be shaken<br> off as soon as possible!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So on that note, go ahead and Ortinax up, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Go on. No need to be modest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, Musashi? Is this really a good idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know we only just got up, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Luckily, you can shake off the cowardice bug pretty easily just by getting in some exercise! Which means you&#39;re doing this too, whether you like it or not!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Mr. Detective!<br> Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t see you watching over there!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would seem Eastern samurai intuition, especially at a sword saint&#39;s level, is a frightening thing indeed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes! Sh-should you be up and about yet?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh yes, I&#39;m quite all right, Ms. Kyrielight. In fact, I feel even lighter on my feet now than I did before we left the Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As far as I can tell, I&#39;ve recovered to the point that I may indeed engage in hand-to-hand combat once again.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> These medical nanomachines are truly marvelous things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Theos Klironomia!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You found Demeter Klironomia here, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> These Theos Klironomia\u2013a collective mass of microscopic Authority\u2013are named after Demeter, one of the goddesses of Greek mythology.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Demeter is the goddess of fertility and the deity<br> who cultivates ambrosia, a food which grants immortality.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> According to the mythology of Proper Human History, she is best known for the tale of her beloved daughter&#39;s abduction:</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Persephone was abducted by Hades and made the queen of the underworld despite Demeter&#39;s desperate attempts to bring her back to Olympus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demeter Klironomia...<br> I remember seeing it once back in Atlantis, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> True, but the Klironomia that were being kept here are far more effective than the Klironomia we saw in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we could bring some back with us to<br> study later, I have no doubt we could\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, no more questions!<br> It&#39;s time for morning training!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Fujimaru,<br> you can have breakfast as soon as it&#39;s over!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like there&#39;s no getting out of it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks like you and I are doing some morning training, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right. Understood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This morning training seems like it will be very different from the simulator training I&#39;m used to, but I&#39;ll do my best to adjust!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well, Ms. Miyamoto, if you insist. But be warned, baritsu is a highly versatile martial art.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If you think your katana alone will grant you an easy victory, I would advise you to reconsider your tactics.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oho, I see somebody remembered<br> to bring their trash talk!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, guys, come at me whenever you like!<br> My void sword is ready and waiting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I know, right? Food always tastes<br> even better after a good workout!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This food is amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think Olympian cuisine might be my new favorite food...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree! At first glance,<br> it doesn&#39;t appear to be anything special.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s bread, ham, salad, milk... The same kind of staples we&#39;ve seen in all sorts of different times and places.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And yet, for some reason I can&#39;t put my finger on...<br> everything here tastes completely different!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well, maybe not COMPLETELY different.<br> I mean, the bread is still bread...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The ham is still ham,<br> the milk is still milk, and so on...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But from the moment you first take a bite, you can<br> sense the flavors changing at least three times...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and every single one of them is<br> a breathtaking culinary experience!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I know EXACTLY what you mean! I had the same reaction the first time I went around sampling the local cuisine!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While we&#39;ve still only seen a small<br> fraction of what Olympus has to offer...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We now know that it is an enormous, highly advanced city with many tall skyscrapers, that its nanomachines guarantee its populace long, healthy lives...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And that its incredible prosperity\u2013prosperity, I might add, that is independent of any sort of currency...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...enables its people to devote themselves to art and academia, thereby further enriching its culture, with no need for any kind of manual labor whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Their daily lives are happy affairs, praising the gods with bright smiles on their faces.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> War and combat are simply unknown to the people of Olympus. Well, except for where we are concerned.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Yes, I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There is no better word to describe this Interstellar<br> Mountainous City of Olympus than \u201Cutopia.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Utopia...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sort of earthly paradise people have been dreaming of since time immemorial...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even the food here is simply sublime. The Chinese<br> Lostbelt&#39;s empire was arguably a type of utopia as well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but its ideals were only achieved by concentrating<br> its culture on a single point.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Olympus, on the other hand, shares its wealth in every sense of the word, and all without any conflict whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It really is a paradise beyond human achievement. I must say, even I don&#39;t know what Proper Human History could do against an opponent like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Hey, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Did you not notice Fujimaru and Mash<br> had only just cheered up?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Did you really have to rain on their parade like that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, as far as we&#39;re concerned, it doesn&#39;t matter whether this place is a utopia, an amusement park, or a front for organized crime.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You guys are from Proper Human History,<br> which means this is a fight for your very survival.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And the only way you guys are going to walk away from<br> this alive is if you beat them before they beat you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you&#39;re here on behalf<br> of all Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I know that isn&#39;t the kind of position you wanted, and that you didn&#39;t really get a choice, but there it is.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And you&#39;ve got enough in your udon bowl as<br> it is without piling on extra toppings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Perhaps, but all that being said, Ms. Miyamoto\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Musashi?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for worrying about us.<br> I really do appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it&#39;s okay.<br> We need to know who it is we&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We need to know who the people of the Lostbelts are, even if we are attempting to cut their world off from Proper Human History again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We already decided that it would be wrong to avert<br> our eyes from the effects of our actions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Wait, is THAT what this is about?<br> Right and wrong and stuff?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I mean, the key to walking away from a battle alive<br> is to keep things as simple as possible, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s all well and good to worry about your opponent&#39;s circumstances, your own moral code, and stuff...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but you have to be able to separate yourself from those things because worrying about them in the heat of battle is only gonna help you lose.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;m not good for much except slicing folks up like some kinda human meat grinder, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So any undue pressure about stuff not directly related to matters of life and death when I&#39;m in the thick of enemy territory is the last thing I need!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. So your comments just now were not meant to console [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru and Ms. Kyrielight there,<br> but rather\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup. I just wanted you to cut it out<br> to make it easier for me to win.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Basically, there&#39;s a time and a place for everything,<br> and that includes thinking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean... Yes, that&#39;s obviously true,<br> and I do get your point, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Haha. That&#39;s our Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll always be able to do that, but I&#39;ll try.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Exactly. Just take it easy.<br> Can&#39;t win a fight if you&#39;re busy moping.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m sorry again for raining on our breakfast<br> parade. Aw man, now my soup&#39;s all cold!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No need to apologize, Ms. Miyamoto. I should have known better than to voice those thoughts at that time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mhmm.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey, yeah! YOU were the one who rained on<br> this parade in the first place, not me!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, I suppose I was, wasn&#39;t I?<br> Hahaha, I do beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Is that all you&#39;ve got to say for yourself!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, please go easy on him, Musashi!</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> ...What in the world are you all doing at this hour?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-oh, I&#39;m sorry.<br> We didn&#39;t mean to disturb you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, and thank you for breakfast.<br> It was absolutely scrumptious!</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Breakfast?</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Ah, I see. That wasn&#39;t me.<br> The twins made it for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Twins? Are those the people we saw yesterday?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean the two people who rescued us yesterday?</p><hr><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Though I doubt you<br> saw their faces at the time...</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you two come out already?<br> This is your base of operations now, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AGirl:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AGirl:</strong><br> I&#39;m, uh, glad to hear you liked the food.<br> Were you able to get enough rest last night?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was delicious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We slept great, thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AGirl:</strong><br> Oh good! I&#39;ve never had guests before, so I wasn&#39;t sure if I did a, um, good job or not...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> Never mind that now, Sister.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AGirl:</strong><br> Aww.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> ...For the time being, it looks like you&#39;re<br> all at a point where you can talk again.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see the Klironomia&#39;s working. I wasn&#39;t<br> sure if it would fit your Spirit Origin or not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed it did, and I am greatly obliged for your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Klironomia?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait. Did you give me some too?</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> You? Klironomia?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> It&#39;d be one thing if you&#39;d undergone bio-modifications like the elite soldiers, but there&#39;s no way Klironomia could ever be compatible with a normal human from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> No, all I did for you was cast a light healing spell,<br> since you didn&#39;t have more than a few scratches.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AGirl:</strong><br> You&#39;re very welcome.<br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> ...A-ahem.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> Chaldea. Visitors from Proper Human History. Well, I guess that doesn&#39;t really apply to all of you, but anyway...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hehe, you must mean me!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoy:</strong><br> I&#39;m Macarios.<br> And this is my older sister, Adele.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s very nice to meet all of you.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;re the God Destroyer Alliance.<br> ...Or at least, what&#39;s left of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to meet both of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m .</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m Miyamoto Musashi, wandering Servant.<br> How about you in the hood?</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> ...I have nothing to do with those twins.<br> Introducing myself now would only complicate things.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm, you don&#39;t say.<br> Okay then, who&#39;s your owl friend?</p><p><strong>Minerva:</strong><br> Hoot. Hoot.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo...</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> All the gods of Olympus are machines.<br> A mechanical owl shouldn&#39;t exactly be a shock.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If you say so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Adele.<br> Macarios.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you again for saving us yesterday.<br> I don&#39;t know what we would have done without you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you, um...both from Olympus?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.<br> We&#39;re both official Olympus residents.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We have citizen numbers and permanent ration cards, and we live our lives by the grace of the gods&#39; blessings and protection.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But, the truth is\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Not now, Sister.<br> Save it for later.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They need to know what&#39;s going<br> on before we tell them about us.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I said no. It&#39;s still too soon to tell them about us.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Besides, Chaldeans, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s someone else you&#39;d all rather be talking to.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> Voice recording for Chaldea.<br> Pattern B2.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> All right, where to begin...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> For the time being, I&#39;ve entered all the information we possess into this base&#39;s data processing unit.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> It&#39;s embedded with a simple artificial personality program, so it can answer most questions you might have.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> That concludes the video portion of the instructions!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ANikola Tesla?:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let the artificial personality take it from here.<br> ...There, I think that should do it.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Activation complete.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> From here on, I, the artificial intelligence,<br> will do the talking.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Yes, the picture remains the same, but get over it! The image is a recreation made by recycling existing video footage!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> An A.I., eh? I suppose that shouldn&#39;t surprise me from one of the greatest scientific minds among the Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget, you can always switch to me if you don&#39;t<br> care for the half-witted eccentric&#39;s persona!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> You can also switch to me, if you prefer. Hehe.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do anything Mahatma-related, though.<br> Sorry I can&#39;t be more help.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Anyway, hi there, Chaldeans!<br> It&#39;s nice to meet you all!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Yelena.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So the Servants who left these recordings for us weren&#39;t summoned to Chaldea, nor are they ones we met in any of the Singularities...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rather, they&#39;re all Heroic Spirits from Proper<br> Human History who were summoned here to this Lostbelt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Edison might be an exception.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I dunno; Edison only materialized like that in that Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Good point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thomas Edison&#39;s lion-head Spirit Origin only<br> came about in the Fifth Singularity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...so he should still retain his memories of us,<br> just like Jeanne Alter.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s begin with the basics of Olympus.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Your opponents here are, in a word, gods.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...That was me. I decided to pause the A.I. for a bit.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Before you hear any more,<br> I wanted to warn you that you guys&#39;ll probably...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You&#39;ll probably be shocked by what they have to say. It might even be enough to make you despair completely.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Some of the Heroic Spirits that made it here only stuck around long enough to say nobody could win against gods.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So I just wanted to make sure you&#39;re<br> ready for what comes next.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. Keep playing.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. We can&#39;t do anything if we<br> don&#39;t know what we&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So please, Macarios. Adele.<br> Let us see the rest.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> First, let&#39;s begin with the gods.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The gods of Olympus\u2013the rulers of this Lostbelt\u2013are<br> genuine deities that have existed since the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Those deities, including the ones<br> you may have seen in Atlantis...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...are beings who came here from far,<br> far across the universe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo! Fo fo fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> I trust Macarios and Adele are there as well? They, like all residents of Olympus, refer to the gods as thus:</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Deities who came here across the sea of stars.<br> The great ones.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The descendants of Primordial Chaos. The great systems of prosperity who bear the Cronus Crown.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> And of course...<br> the Twelve Olympian Machine Gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sea of...stars...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We knew that these machine gods<br> were interstellar weapons, but...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Th-this is way bigger than I was expecting...<br> I mean... Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, um...<br> Hang on, let me just make sure I&#39;ve got this straight...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You said these are super ancient gods who came<br> here across a sea of stars, right? So, then...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That would make them space aliens!<br> Right!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou! Fo fou!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not quite. It would not be entirely accurate to refer to them merely as intelligent life-forms from another planet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Based on everything we now know...it seems they are more akin to machines from an extremely advanced civilization.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> One that may reside outside our galaxy, or at the far ends of our universe...or in an entirely different universe altogether.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s more or less correct.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Huh, I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I thought you guys would be a lot more taken aback.<br> Why aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I am, believe me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well...after Atlantis, I had a feeling they&#39;d be something like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> All right, now should be a good time to proceed.<br> Next, I have more information about the gods for you.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> From this point onward...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> I will be telling you how this Lostbelt differs from Proper Human History, and at what point in time it diverged.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> First of all, how did these gods originally come to be? The first gods were born from Primordial Chaos, and eventually, the younger generation fought the Titanomachia, the first great war.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Up until this point, the world was largely the same as it was depicted in the myths of Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> The Titanomachia was a war between the Titans, the gods of the old generation, and Olympus, the gods of the new.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As I recall, Zeus defeated his own father\u2013<br> Cronus, the king of the Titans...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and in doing so, he gained control over the rest of the pantheon...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The gods of Olympus won that war,<br> and Zeus became omnipotent as a result.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Omnipotent...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Then, there was a second machia. This one took place roughly fourteen thousand years ago.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> During this war\u2013also known as the Leucusmachia\u2013the gods of Olympus did battle with an enemy that threatened the entire world.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Unfortunately, details pertaining to this event are scarce.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Not only was it not recorded in Proper Human History,<br> most citizens of Olympus know very little about it.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> However, my distinguished colleagues,<br> what we can say for sure...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...is that we are certain this is the point where the Lostbelt diverged from Proper Human History!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> The third great war, the Gigantomachia\u2013a battle against the enormous Gigantes that took place about thirty-five hundred years ago...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...serves as further evidence of that divergence.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> In Proper Human History, this machia was the second,<br> and final, great war of Greek mythology.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> In the version from Proper Human History, the gods of Olympus, aided by human heroes, eventually succeeded at vanquishing the mighty Gigantes.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> I think the great hero Heracles even played a part,<br> if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> But! In this Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...the gods eradicated every last Gigant in an instant!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> How did they accomplish such a feat? By\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> By preserving their machine god bodies, which, in Proper Human History, had long since faded away, I presume?</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The Olympian gods used their original machine god<br> bodies to obliterate the Gigantes all at once.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> At least, that is our working theory. In Proper Human<br> History, the gods&#39; machine bodies were lost long ago...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...but here in this Lostbelt,<br> the gods were somehow able to retain them.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The result is the very Atlantic Lostbelt in which we now find ourselves! A world ruled by machine gods who still possess their once lost mechanical bodies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So then, in Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...the gods of Olympus were meant to lose their machine bodies between fourteen thousand and thirty-five hundred years ago?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So it would seem.<br> But here, the gods remained alive and well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And as long as these mechanical gods from beyond our universe have their original bodies, they are not even affected by the deterioration of the Age of Gods that was meant to occur.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That brings us to the fourth, and final, machia.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> As with the second, this one also has no equivalent in Proper Human History; it is peculiar to this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> A few thousand years ago,<br> the gods of Olympus split into two factions.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Their conflict revolved around what to do about humans\u2013whether to rule over them, or to coexist alongside them.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This schism led to a fierce<br> disagreement between the gods.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Zeus, Demeter, Aphrodite, Hera,<br> and Artemis wanted to rule...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...while Athena, Hades, Poseidon, Apollo, Hestia,<br> Ares, and Hephaestus wanted to coexist.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> We believe Poseidon initially sided with the rulers, but that he eventually ended up defecting to the other faction.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Gods on each side enlisted loyal lesser gods as<br> their disagreement devolved into full-blown war.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This battle went on to be called the Olympiamachia\u2013<br> or the Great War of Olympus, as it&#39;s known in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Both sides fought fiercely...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...and the remains of the mechanical gods who were<br> killed fell to Atlantis, where they formed islands.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> In the end, the faction supporting rule over humans was victorious, and the opposition survivors were punished.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> For example, Poseidon, the sea-god.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> His Divine Core was rewritten, reducing him to<br> little more than an Automated Defense Unit to protect the Great Pit.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> And that brings us to today.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> The gods who emerged triumphant in all four machia continue to rule this Lostbelt, with the city of Olympus as their capital.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Today, there are five gods who reside within Olympia Dodona, the great orbital shrine that makes up the center of the city.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Zeus, the omnipotent god of the heavens.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Europa, the divine queen who<br> fused with the goddess Hera.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Demeter, the goddess of the land.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> And finally, the Dioscuri, the ancient twin gods.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The Dioscuri...!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Not now, Macarios. Not now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Technically, the twin gods of Dioscuri are a Divine Spirit, which makes them neither living gods nor mechanical ones.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> They died once, and were transformed into a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Who killed them, you ask? I wish I could say it was the God Destroyer Alliance, but it wasn&#39;t. No, their killer...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...was the Crypter Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kirschtaria...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A mage... A human mage...killed a god?</p><hr><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> After that, Kirschtaria formed a contract with the Dioscuri, making them his Servant.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> To be clear, he did not summon their Divine Spirit from the Throne of Heroes. He formed a contract with genuine gods after they had been killed and reduced to a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...The Dioscuri are not among of the Twelve Olympians, but they are no mere lesser god, either.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> They are one of the ancient gods who accepted Zeus as the supreme being. To be precise, they are a Divinity that have been around since before the Gigantomachia.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> From what we&#39;ve been able to gather, they joined the pantheon by imbibing of Zeus&#39;s divine blood...his Klironomia.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> They are now considered children of Zeus,<br> with standing equal to Apollo in his glory days.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> And Kirschtaria Wodime...<br> managed to kill them.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Hard to believe, isn&#39;t it?<br> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...If only it really was as bad a joke as it sounds.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They should&#39;ve just stayed dead.<br> Them, a Divine Spirit? What a load of crap!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The Dioscuri are deranged.<br> They don&#39;t deserve to be spirits, let alone gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> P-please forgive my brother.<br> He, um...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> He swore an oath to the late Athena that he would<br> one day take revenge on the twin gods...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...for their murder of our hundred-odd<br> fellow alliance members...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The Dioscuri are bloodthirsty maniacs!<br> Death incarnate! Human killers!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They killed almost all of the humans<br> who joined the God Destroyer Alliance!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...There are only a few members left now, including us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That must have been really hard for you.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Oh, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Well, Chaldeans?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Why&#39;re you acting like that?<br> Aren&#39;t you scared?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;re up against murderous gods. Gods who actually<br> enjoy going out of their way to slaughter people.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And if that isn&#39;t bad enough, there&#39;s another guy<br> out there strong enough to make them his flunkies!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Just the idea that you might have any<br> chance of beating them is absurd!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Yeah. It&#39;s absurd.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We know some of the Heroic Spirits gave up and walked away when they found out how the Gigantomachia ended.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So what about you guys? What&#39;s your deal?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Does the fact that you guys aren&#39;t more fazed mean your world\u2013Proper Human History, is even more messed up than ours?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Stop that, Macarios!<br> That&#39;s no way to speak to people we&#39;ve just met.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Sorry, everyone. I got a little out of hand there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-please, it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really. I don&#39;t blame you for being taken aback.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve encountered so many different threats by now<br> that I suppose our reactions must seem strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gods from another universe...<br> Mechanical gods with frightening powers...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Twin gods who enjoy taking lives... Kirschtaria, who&#39;s<br> strong enough to make those gods his Servants...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Every last one of them is a tremendous threat\u2013threats that we may very well not be able to deal with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And these revelations ARE shocking for us. It&#39;s<br> tempting to despair in the face of such overwhelming odds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, all that being said...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We still have a job to do.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re just going to do the best we can.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You&#39;re gonna do the best you can? That&#39;s it?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Haha. Are you kidding me?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You know, Fujimaru,<br> I honestly can&#39;t<br> tell if you&#39;re being arrogant or modest.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Okay. I think I get it now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s it. I get what you guys are like now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You&#39;re just how Edison said you&#39;d be!<br> Hahaha! He was right after all!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So you Chaldeans really are<br> just a pack of weirdos, huh?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Well, nothing wrong with that!<br> Haha! You&#39;ve convinced me! I like you guys!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So you get it now, huh? That&#39;s great!<br> They really are weirdoes, aren&#39;t they!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Aah! Wh-what the hell are you? Don&#39;t jump on us!<br> What are you, some kind of squirrel?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hehe. Look, Macarios, I think he likes you.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foun!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Eek!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Ah! Hey! Get away from my sister!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Weirdos, huh...</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s the right way to think about them, Macarios.<br> They&#39;re all hopeless weirdos.</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> That&#39;s been the case in every other Lostbelt so far, too. Though that&#39;s not to say that means they&#39;ll be able to accomplish the same thing here.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You&#39;re only here because the Collaborator sent you, right? So where do you get off acting like you know so much about Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Collaborator?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s what we call the person who&#39;s been<br> so kindly aiding our God Destroyer Alliance.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know their true identity either, but they&#39;ve been a big help to us, especially with procuring supplies for combat.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We were told that the Collaborator sent<br> this hooded man here to help us, but...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Say, you in the hood?<br> You ARE on our side, right?</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> I am for now, at least. Otherwise, I would have let the gods do what they wanted with you.</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> I&#39;m an acquaintance of this \u201CCollaborator\u201D you speak<br> of, and\u2013On second thought, that&#39;s enough for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, excuse me. I apologize if I&#39;m way off the mark with this, but are you\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kadoc!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then, after Rasputin snatched him away...!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ll spare you the details of this particular exercise in deduction, but suffice to say, I am something of an expert when it comes to disguises.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, Sir Hood?<br> Did we get it right?</p><p><strong>Hooded Man:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> F-fo, fooou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What? Do you guys know each other or something?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh my... Does this mean you&#39;re part of Chaldea, too?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Me? Part of Chaldea!? You&#39;ve gotta be\u2013Oh, forget it. Just, hell no!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Dammit. Holmes I get, but how the ACTUAL HELL did YOU see through my disguise, Mash!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I was using a disguise spell and everything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa. What are you apologizing for?<br> It&#39;s not like you did anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Yeah, fair enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kadoc... You saved our lives.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Saved you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> For what?</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I only bailed you out &#39;cause it would&#39;ve<br> been a waste to let you die back there.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re nothing more than pawns I can use to throw Olympus off-balance, just like you did in Russia.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So I&#39;m gonna use you guys to further my own agenda.<br> That&#39;s the only reason I bailed you out.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like you even have a snowball&#39;s<br> chance in hell of winning here, anyway.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Between Zeus, Wodime, and the Foreign God&#39;s Alter Egos, you guys are hilariously outclassed.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have to bother<br> trying to kill you myself.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc, as a former member of Team A myself, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m not part of Team A anymore.<br> I&#39;m a Crypter now.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hell, maybe I&#39;m not even that anymore.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Does this mean you are not acting with or on behalf of the Crypters here, Kadoc Zemlupus?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hell no. I don&#39;t have the slightest<br> idea what Wodime&#39;s thinking.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He went out of his way to have Rasputin get me,<br> but he never told me why.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...He never told me why.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You may have lost your Russian Lostbelt, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need to enter another Crypter&#39;s service.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You can keep your Sirius Light, too.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re a free man, Kadoc. All I want you to do in<br> this Atlantic Lostbelt is whatever you see fit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Is that your idea of a joke?<br> &#39;Cause if not, it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the one who sent Rasputin to get me off the Shadow Border?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That was entirely the priest&#39;s decision.<br> I have no right to give the Foreign God&#39;s Disciples orders.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As for why he saved you, your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps he only wished to prevent you from leaking information.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, well, there&#39;s not much I could&#39;ve told<br> them besides which Crypter was where.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> None of us have any idea what the Trees of Emptiness are actually made of, or who the Foreign God really is, after all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course not. The Foreign God couldn&#39;t<br> care less about any of you, after all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The Foreign God isn&#39;t going to tell you anything,<br> nor do they expect anything from you.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> They couldn&#39;t care less if you lived or died.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Whereas the same cannot be said for me, as my every<br> action carries the weight of the grandest expectations.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Is that so?<br> Well, excuse the hell out of me for being a third-rate mage.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Huh? That&#39;s weird.<br> What was that long silence about?)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, Kadoc. Just get some rest for now. We won&#39;t<br> have to worry about Chaldea for the time being.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Caenis has told me they&#39;ve made their way to Scandinavia,<br> but there&#39;s nothing we can do about them from here.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So my only orders for you are to go<br> about and see Olympus for yourself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...And you actually think I can live up to your expectations? Even after the total mess of things I made in Russia?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m not the one who can decide whether or not you&#39;ll do that, Kadoc. You are.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...He might as well not have told me anything at all,<br> for all the difference it would&#39;ve made.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So now, I&#39;m doing whatever the hell I want, just<br> like he asked. That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna uncover the truth behind Zeus,<br> and what Wodime&#39;s really thinking.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh? And what do you mean by that last part?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I don&#39;t actually care what&#39;s going on in that head of his, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve got anything else to do.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So I&#39;m gonna show that stuck-up aristocrat<br> that things aren&#39;t always gonna go his way.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> ...Oh? What&#39;s this now?</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Goodness, it&#39;s been so long since<br> I&#39;ve seen your face in person.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> I think the last time must have been back then...</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> ...when you tore those poor Dioscuri twins apart.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Good day, Lady Demeter, goddess of the land.<br> Indeed, it has been a long time, hasn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...It seems your memory partition is functioning properly,<br> at least in regards to me.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Oh my, how terrifying.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> That sounds as though you could destroy our<br> true Aletheia bodies whenever you like.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Ahh, Kirschtaria Wodime. A dreadful human<br> capable of killing us single-handedly.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite the problem child, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> It saddens me so, particularly since I think of you as my own son.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Demeter. Mournful goddess of the land.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Mother of the beautiful Persephone, who inherited much of Gaia&#39;s disposition.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I urge you to share your boundless motherly<br> love with humans other than myself.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I have no need of it.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> But there can be no children without mothers,<br> nor can children grow without love and nourishment.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Gods and humans are the same in this respect.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Humans, humans, humans! This new intelligent species<br> still barely older than a newborn babe!</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> This precious, fragile intelligence we met on this planet. I love you all, truly.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> I love you as though you were my own children.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> And I love you too, Kirschtaria.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...In the same way you love Persephone?</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Why yes!<br> You know, Zeus is absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing that brings a mother like me more joy than to see her children grow up strong and happy!</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Which is why there&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t<br> do to make that happen.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> I would take an arrow for my children. I would gladly give up my body, my life, and my Aletheia for them. Truly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Then I will take you at your word, Demeter, and trust that you truly bear a mother&#39;s love.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As a matter of fact, Zeus&#39;s ideas of the restoration of mythology are closer to your own notions than to mine.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Kirschtaria? What are you saying?</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> Do you mean that Olympus, the heart of our<br> Lostbelt, is not the ideal you seek?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course it is. We only differ when it comes to our...end points.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You see, I believe that the gods should<br> be even stronger than they are now.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Now, let me tell you one more thing.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This is the single most important piece of information<br> about the gods of Olympus I have to share.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The king of this Lostbelt is Zeus, an all-powerful god<br> who naturally still possesses his original mechanical body.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> He has existed ever since the Age of Gods, just like<br> Sc\xE1thach-Skadi from the Scandinavian Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like this is information we already knew.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Zeus... An omnipotent god who has<br> continued to exist for millennia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we are to take his \u201Comnipotent\u201D nature at face value,<br> then we would seem to be well and truly outmatched...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And yet, Mr. A.I., I cannot imagine that the electricity expert whose visage you now borrow...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...would waste his time challenging an opponent<br> whom he truly has no hope of defeating.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...Hahaha! You cut right to the heart of things, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Still, I can hardly blame you for interrupting, Mr.<br> Holmes. You have every right to be concerned.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> And you&#39;re correct. Your hope of defeating Zeus is small\u2013perhaps even infinitesimal\u2013but it does exist.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Zeus is indeed almighty,<br> but he is not truly omnipotent.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Almighty...but not omnipotent?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, if I understand you correctly...then,<br> while he does rule over many things...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...he doesn&#39;t technically rule<br> over absolutely everything?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, he can do all sorts of things, but he can&#39;t do everything?</p><hr><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> You catch on quickly.<br> Yes, that&#39;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> As King of the Gods, Zeus possesses Authority over infinite things, but conceptually, he does not possess infinite Authority.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> We believe that Zeus turned into a nigh omnipotent god by synchronizing all of the Titans&#39; Authority with his own...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Followed by the many lesser gods&#39; Authority...and<br> ultimately, even his fellow Twelve Olympians&#39; Authority.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That much, at least, would seem to be a matter of little doubt.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> But, conceptually, he is not truly omnipotent, and so does not have control over all things and beings in this world.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> At least...that&#39;s our working theory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Do you happen to have anything to support that theory?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Of course:<br> the very alliance base you&#39;re standing in right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The underground infrastructure...!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Precisely. A truly omnipotent being would have known about \u201Cvillains\u201D like us lurking underground the instant we set foot in here!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> And yet, he has no awareness of this underground infrastructure. This was the domain of Hades, his fellow god, and he doesn&#39;t even bother to look at it!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> From this, we can surmise that the gods of Olympus are<br> conceptual deities, like those from other mythologies...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...And, simultaneously, that they depend on Klironomia\u2013their Authority-like functionality\u2013from the enormous mechanical bodies they used as ships to cross the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That is where our chance of defeating Zeus lies!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> For if we are up against a nigh omnipotent King of Gods with Authority over infinite things, rather than a truly omnipotent god...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...then you should have a chance, however minuscule, of defeating him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you, Mr. A.I.<br> This has been both informative and hope-inspiring.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, fou.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s get back to business.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Though that said, the only business that remains<br> is the information we have pertaining to Zeus.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The omnipotent King of Gods\u2013head of the Twelve<br> Olympians and victor of all four machia...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...has formed a contract with Kirschtaria as his equal.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Well? Bet you had no idea about that, did you?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!!! Foooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean, Kirschtaria formed a contract<br> not with a Divine Spirit...but a god!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But... But that shouldn&#39;t even be possible...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> G-granted, there&#39;s no way to test that for sure<br> given that gods don&#39;t exist in our own time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but theoretically speaking, forming a contract as equals is...!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, hang on.<br> Let me make sure I&#39;ve got all this straight.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re saying this Kirschtaria guy formed a contract not with a Divided Spirit, but with an actual god, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And not just any god, but a demiurge that&#39;s<br> as big a deal as the Vairocana?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Full marks, Ms. Miyamoto. In fact, from an esoteric<br> Buddhist perspective, it was a truly perfect answer.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Zeus is neither a Divine Spirit<br> that returned to nature, nor a Divided Spirit.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> He is a proper, almighty god...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> And Kirschtaria Wodime has formed a contract with him! It puts him on completely equal footing with Zeus as his sworn friend, no less!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Holy cow! THAT&#39;S the kind of mage you guys have been up against!?</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Not that we managed to<br> stand against him for very long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Wodime&#39;s been clear about his goal from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> \u201CWe are about to fill this world with inhuman Mystic<br> secrets. We will restore the Age of Gods.\u201D</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And if this Atlantic Lostbelt ends up becoming the new<br> proper timeline, that goal&#39;ll pretty much be fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> He formed that contract with Zeus to be certain this Lostbelt&#39;s Tree of Emptiness would grow bigger as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...But even with all that said,<br> there&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> A Lostbelt needs its Tree of Emptiness to maintain its existence. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that, as far as that Lostbelt&#39;s king is concerned...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...that Tree of Emptiness is something strange and entirely foreign.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But Zeus had no problem with this. I&#39;m sure he and<br> Wodime came to some kind of secret agreement about it...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...but at this point,<br> I can&#39;t see what their endgame could be.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Keep that fur ball away from me, would you?<br> I never liked it even when I was at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-easy there, Fou. It&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Phew.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All right, Mash, this is the last thing I have to tell you.<br> If you want to see Wodime...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...you can find him in the Great<br> Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s where you&#39;ll find Zeus, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where are you going to go now, Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Who cares?<br> It&#39;s none of your business.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hey, Kadoc. If you want to come back to Chaldea</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What, have you finally snapped, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I might not be a Crypter anymore,<br> but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to go back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can&#39;t trust either side,<br> and I&#39;m sick of being somebody else&#39;s pawn.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If I&#39;m gonna fight back, I&#39;m gonna do it on my terms.<br> So much more badass doing it like that, anyway.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Anastasia&#39;d probably say the same thing,<br> if she were still alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hmph. All right, that&#39;s it for me.<br> I&#39;m getting outta here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;ve said everything I wanted, and gotten everything I needed out of being the Collaborator&#39;s lackey.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I doubt we&#39;ll ever see each other again...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;ll really depend on you guys.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> See you around, Mash. Just make sure you don&#39;t<br> stick with the losing team there for too long.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You felt for yourself how strong those gods were,<br> right? Well, Zeus and Wodime are even stronger.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If I were you, Chaldeans, I&#39;d take a good, long think<br> about how you want to spend the rest of your lives.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If you do survive long enough...make sure you go see Wodime.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You know, I thought I&#39;d tail him for a bit to see where he&#39;s going...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but he lost me pretty quickly. Too bad.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man, turning invisible and then a rapid movement ability is a hell of a spell combo. It might not technically be teleportation, but it sure feels like it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Maybe he&#39;s using talismans and Mystic Codes this Kirschtaria gave him or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, Musashi...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ehehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You were tailing Kadoc just now!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well of course!<br> How could I not after he tried to run off like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Incidentally, I attempted to tail him as well, with equally dismal results. Hahaha, I suppose we should have known he wouldn&#39;t make it that easy for us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I believe the information Kadoc Zemlupus shared with us is trustworthy enough to use in determining our next course of action.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> After all, he would have little reason to<br> lie to us except for personal revenge.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well, while he certainly has cause to desire vengeance on us, taking into account his manner of speech, facial expressions, tone of voice, and what he told us\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We get it. We get it!<br> Enough with the deduction shtick already!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Basically, we have to make our way to Kirschtaria<br> just like Kadoc said, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And eventually, you guys have to cut down this Tree of Emptiness these insanely powerful superbeings are defending.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Boy, talk about playing on hard mode.<br> This is gonna be a fun challenge!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Since this Collaborator person is good enough<br> to support this underground society here...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...I figured it&#39;d make our lives a lot easier<br> if I could make contact with them...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But, it looks like that&#39;s not happening anytime soon.<br> So! What&#39;s our next step?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Great Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that enormous floating building is acting as the gods&#39; and Kirschtaria&#39;s base of operations...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...then our next step should be figuring<br> out how we&#39;re going to get to it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We could try to get there in the Border through a series of Zero Sails, but even if Zeus&#39;s thunderbolts somehow missed us while we were preparing\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t take long for the other gods and soldiers<br> to overwhelm us with sheer force of numbers.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> There we go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that sound just now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you just do something, Macarios?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Oh, that?<br> I was just defrosting something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you say \u201Cdefrost\u201D?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, I did.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like, frozen food or something?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So Proper Human History has frozen foods too, huh?<br> I never knew that.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But this isn&#39;t food.<br> It&#39;s something way better.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;d like to officially ask you to join the God Destroyer Alliance. We want you to come fight with us.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You want to go to the Great Orbital Shrine, right? And you also need to cut down the Tree of Emptiness Magellan that&#39;s even farther up past it, right?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Then we should be able to help you with both goals.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We have ways of traveling through airspace here. Furthermore\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The Great Orbital Shrine is the gods&#39; throne.<br> It&#39;s forbidden for humans to set foot in there.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They won&#39;t let you in without a fight...but then,<br> you&#39;re going to have to fight the gods, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. Which is why I hope I can count on your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d love for you two to fight with us.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...We will.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Magellan... Another galaxy name.<br> Though I had suspected as much.)</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;d be honored to help you.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh, I just had a thought.<br> Why don&#39;t we take this occasion to celebrate?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ooh! By celebration, do you mean yummy food!?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I made a pretty simple breakfast,<br> but for a special occasion like this\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sister.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt, but I need to use this<br> thing while it&#39;s still freshly defrosted.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Huh? O-oh, I see.<br> Yes, you do, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So no yummy food just yet, huh... Bummer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah, the thing you defrosted...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What was it you were defrosting, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s something you might have seen before.<br> Here it comes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The floor just opened up...and something<br> huge is coming up from underneath it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oho.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks just like...the hostile entities we<br> encountered in Atlantis a number of times!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s a steel Chimera\u2013an autonomous weapon made out of high-purity Klironomia.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It used to serve the gods, but after Edison and<br> Tesla made a number of adjustments to it...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...and Ms. Blavatsky casting a spell to tame it,<br> it now listens to us. It does a very good job, too.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Nemea! Sit!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> As you can see, it&#39;s now this<br> alliance base&#39;s trusty guardian.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So, next up...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...we&#39;re going to use it to see how strong you guys are. I trust you&#39;re okay with that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup, figured something like this was coming.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh no, you don&#39;t.<br> Where&#39;d all that big talk from earlier go, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Surely you&#39;re not about to say your baritsu is no match for a little Demonic Beast, are you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Of course it is. I said baritsu was a highly versatile martial art, and I stand by that. But that doesn&#39;t mean using it to fight a creature like this isn&#39;t quite simply a pain in the posterior.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Hahaha, you two really get along, huh?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Anyway, we can back you guys up with artillery Mystic Codes, but we don&#39;t know that much when it comes to swordfighting.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s true. So we were hoping we could count on all of you to handle the melee combat, if you don&#39;t mind...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;ll be fine, right, Mash?<br> I mean, you&#39;ve got that giant shield and everything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry Mash, looks like it&#39;s emergency transformation time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You heard him, Mash! Battle positions!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Just, um, give me a few minutes please,<br> if you all wouldn&#39;t mind!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Emergency transformation complete.<br> Setting output to seventy percent!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Preparing to intercept combat training target!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough!<br> Okay, Nemea. You can rest now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The steel Chimeras are going back into their underground storage hangar. The battle is over, Master.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Phew. I never would&#39;ve thought the Chimera<br> would divide itself like that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Is it just me, Ms. Miyamoto, or were you<br> not taking this especially seriously?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Looks like you guys really are strong. You&#39;ve obviously had a lot of experience fighting up close.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That means you ought to be able to<br> go toe to toe with the Royal Guard.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But...it&#39;s still not enough to beat the gods.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So we&#39;re going to use Tesla, Edison, and Blavatsky&#39;s parting gifts.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAdele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They left us a number of machines,<br> and a few different plans of attack to use.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAdele:</strong><br> These god-slaying blades are the best tools<br> the God Destroyer Alliance can offer you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Adele! You&#39;re hurt!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1AAdele:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAdele:</strong><br> Oh, this? I guess I must have gotten hit when Nemea&#39;s<br> shards went flying. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s bleeding from her right arm!<br> We have to stop it!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, she&#39;ll be fine. In fact, this is a good chance to show you something. Just stand back and watch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your injury is...healing itself...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It still hurts, but the wound is gone now.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> By tomorrow, there won&#39;t be a trace of pain left.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> So it&#39;s really okay.<br> You don&#39;t have to worry.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You can burn us, shatter us, tear us apart... It doesn&#39;t matter. We&#39;ll always go back to our \u201Cperfect\u201D forms.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> We never change, no matter what happens to us.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Any injury we suffer heals itself.<br> That&#39;s how we&#39;ve been remade.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Thanks to the ambrosia\u2013the Demeter Klironomia they regularly give us to maintain our bodies...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...no citizen of Olympus will ever get sick.<br> We&#39;re practically immortal now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> No one can die.<br> No one can kill.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The gods are the only exception.<br> They&#39;re the only ones with the power to kill us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry, I think I may have misheard you a moment ago.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you just say you were practically, um\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Immortal.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, Ms. Kyrielight, he did indeed say that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I presume that means that as long as the gods&#39; Authority remains, you and the other people of Olympus will even come back from death?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come back from death...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Immortality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The one thing humanity has continued to long for since time immemorial... The ultimate goal of countless technologies, not to mention magecraft...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And here, it&#39;s just...a fact of life...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just how advanced IS Olympian civilization compared to ours?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So every injury anyone gets heals automatically,<br> and they never even have to fear death.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s damn impressive, that&#39;s for sure. I can&#39;t even<br> imagine what it would be like to live like that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I knew this city had achieved long, healthy lives for its citizenry, but I never would have thought it had also found a way to bring them back from death.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Never mind utopia. This place would seem to be more akin to heaven\u2013our collective idea of a blissful life after death.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It almost strikes me as a calculated plan to forcefully<br> evolve all of humanity into the realm of gods...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good gracious, I can only imagine the look on Qin Shi Huang&#39;s face if they were to hear about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, if Olympians can even come back from death...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...does that mean that soldier we fought is still alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! Now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that reserve soldier we first fought<br> after the alarm was sounded was...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> He was dead. I killed him myself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But now that you mention it, there WAS something strange about it. Even after I dealt the killing blow, I didn&#39;t feel as if I&#39;d really won.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I guess him not actually dying would explain it.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t die.<br> None of us can be killed here.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Inflicting death is a power only the gods have.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> By this point, that soldier will have come back to life<br> and started thinking up ways to get his revenge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...While we&#39;re on the subject,<br> I might as well tell you this, too.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Even if we stop taking ambrosia,<br> like me and Sister have...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...the Klironomia inside our bodies<br> will continue to function.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll always be like this, forever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Forever?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Forever.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Immortality is, well, eternal.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Ever since that day the gods bestowed<br> ambrosia on us eons ago...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ve always looked exactly like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, you don&#39;t age either?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, you don&#39;t just have eternal life... You have eternal youth, too!?</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> All right.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been alive for a long time.<br> A very, very long time.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;ll never reach adulthood.<br> We both stopped growing long, looong ago.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> The adults are all happy that we&#39;re still children.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They say children are weak and should be protected, so we should just let them and the gods take care of us, and be grateful for it.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Never mind that we passed adult age a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While many Olympians may be fine with this enforced stagnation, the two of you are not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And while the gods may have succeeded at preserving happiness at the level of a society, it seems they were unable to extend their control to individual emotions. Truly fascinating.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well. That at least makes clear why you two have chosen to rebel against the gods and assist us...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but before we go any further, there is one<br> thing I would like to confirm with you.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Fine with me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As you know, we are from Chaldea\u2013<br> a group of beings from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our victory here would mean the<br> end of this entire Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Do you understand what that means?<br> If we succeed at cutting down this Tree of Emptiness...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...everything here\u2013Olympus, the gods, and all the many people, including you two\u2013will disappear. No exceptions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even knowing that...do you still wish to fight by our side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Yeah. We do.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need to keep living the same day over and<br> over forever. We want to see a new tomorrow...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Even if it means we end up dying for it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh no...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Please, don&#39;t be sad, Mash. We&#39;ve spent an entire century thinking this through from every possible angle...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...and this is what we decided.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We want to see tomorrow.<br> A real tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> A day that&#39;s different from the one that came before. Something more than just another today.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already lived more than enough for countless lifetimes.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Do you have any idea how old I am?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I remember everyone in Atlantis had a life span of at least a few hundred years...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I would guess maybe twice that?<br> Or several times...?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Hehe. A few hundred years, huh?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> The gods&#39; protection must have worn pretty thin for them. I&#39;m jealous.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Back during the fourth machia, we were actually<br> supposed to go to Atlantis ourselves...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...along with all the other people who supported the faction that wanted coexistence between gods and humans.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But what happened was\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We missed the last boat.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> And we&#39;ll never have another chance,<br> since the gods don&#39;t allow any of us to leave the city.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa. Hold up.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The fourth machia was the war between the gods. Didn&#39;t that happen something like several thousand years ago?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So...you guys are saying you&#39;re<br> a few thousand years old!?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> No, we&#39;re not.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d say we&#39;ve been alive<br> for about ten thousand years.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> Ten thousand years plus a few centuries.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ten thousand!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re citizens of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;re the gods&#39; beloved playthings,<br> kept in their eternal cradle.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Ever since the day the gods built this city...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ve been stuck living here forever.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> For over ten thousand years...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ve been forced to live millions upon millions<br> of versions of essentially the same day.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Never getting to set one foot outside the city&#39;s limits... Never getting to grow or change...!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> For ten thousand years...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ve been utterly stagnant.</p><h2 id="section-6-thou-art-the-harvest-that-reaps-the-stars-iii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-thou-art-the-harvest-that-reaps-the-stars-iii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Thou Art the Harvest that Reaps the Stars (III)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Interstellar Mountainous City Olympus. Great Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona, the center of its operations.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> A revelation is upon us.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Now is the time of revelation.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> He is all-powerful justice, the direct heir of Primordial Chaos, and ruler of all things.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> He is the one who should keep all of humanity safe.<br> He is the one who should rightfully rule over all worlds.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> He is the wielder of the great thunderbolts capable of shattering even the adamas scythe. None less than the Authorities of Gaia and the Meliae bow to his will.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> He is the great demiurge, the one who wields the Cronus Crown for all eternity!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Now, behold the words of the almighty Zeus!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...There is work to be done.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I command you by my name, Demeter.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Goddess of the land, who grants the vast earth an abundant harvest, and my own flesh and blood.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You are to eradicate the Chaldeans who lurk within my city.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I permit you to use your Aletheia in every district of Olympus. May your piercing shriek shatter the bones of the enemies that threaten our world.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> As you wish, almighty Zeus.<br> Your will is my command.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> These Chaldean demons strike fear into<br> the very hearts of our citizens.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> And as the citizens of Olympus may as well be my own children, my duty as a mother is clear.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> I shall use every power and Authority at my disposal to eradicate them.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> ...I swear it on my beloved Persephone.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, mmmmmm. What a lovely oath by<br> a lovely goddess. I&#39;m touched! Truly!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I see, I see. So you have sworn this oath on<br> your precious daughter, Lady Persephone!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Then heavenly Zeus&#39;s will is certain to be fulfilled,<br> no matter who may try to stand in its way!</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Forgive me, King of the Gods,<br> but may I offer a word of advice?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> As nice as it is to see my Alter Ego colleague and fellow Foreign God Disciple Limbo so overcome with emotion, that is not why we are here.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Might there be any room for us<br> to join her on this mission?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Your help is not needed.<br> I have no orders for the likes of you Disciples.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s a pity.<br> It seems we still have yet to fully earn your trust.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> May I say something, Father?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Yes, Father, may Big Brother say something?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> While I do have my concerns about sending Demeter out on this mission, I am happy to abide by your judgment if this is what you think is best.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> That being said, there is one<br> thing I would like to ask.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Please, tell me.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Why did you place such a curse on<br> that sage of Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So, you noticed that, Castor;<br> child of old in whose veins runs my blood.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Very well then, I shall tell you. That sage is a prime example of the very worst of humanity.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Thus, he does not deserve to be met with the full wrath of my lightning. I trust you can understand that.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Father, if I may say one more thing!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Why did you not strike him dead on the spot!?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Big Brother!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> And why did you even permit Chaldea&#39;s submarine to disembark on our holy land!? If you had only used your true great thunderbolts, their entire ship would be\u2013</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Enough, Castor.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> You may be almighty Zeus&#39;s child, but that does not<br> give you license to speak to him however you like.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Remember: you are in the presence<br> of the King of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I forgive your transgression, Castor.<br> And I admit, your words possess an element of truth.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Indeed, I am all-powerful. If I wished,<br> I could have easily reduced them all to dust.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> However, there is one thing you must never forget.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> If I were to use the true strength of my great thunderbolts, they would demolish the city and obliterate the populace.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Not even Demeter&#39;s regenerative gifts would be able to bring them back.</p><p><strong>Demeter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> We must protect the city.<br> We must protect the populace.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> For ever since the second machia fourteen thousand<br> years ago\u2013the day we obtained the Cronus Crown...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...we have ceased to be a fleet of mechanical<br> arks crossing the sea of stars...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...and have become gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I take it your divine revelation is over then?<br> That must be quite tiring for you, King of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Especially since merely keeping Olympus running must<br> take at least ninety percent of your resources.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am for letting<br> these Chaldea insects slip inside.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I could say the same to you, Wodime.<br> You have nothing to apologize for.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You entrusted Caenis with the task of stopping as I did with Odysseus. Both failed.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Indeed, Chaldea surpassed both our expectations.<br> Revising our estimation of them is more than sufficient.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I see. I don&#39;t know what to say. Hearing you say that to me, a mere human, makes me feel I have even less of a leg to stand on.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I may seem cool and collected, but I was actually<br> steeling myself to face some kind of penalty.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You are my friend, I know, so don&#39;t you want to admonish me at least a little?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Heh. I could never let the other ships\u2013<br> gods, hear you tease me like that.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But as it is just the two of us here,<br> I cannot help but be more lenient with my judgments.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Be at ease, young mage.<br> There is no one else here for whom you need perform.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> That goes for the Foreign God too, of course. Even as we speak, I am using all my Authority to keep this conversation private.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Whatever we do or say here remains strictly between us.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> That said, even I cannot hide us from the priestess&#39;s<br> prying eyes, loath though I am to admit it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That&#39;s because she&#39;s the observer. In a sense, she&#39;s even more trouble than the Foreign God, who still lacks a body altogether.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But simply knowing that she will not hear what we have to say is more than enough, since that will give us an opportunity to verify our endgame goals with one another.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As you have surmised, Zeus,<br> the Foreign God is indeed keeping a close eye on me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The Alter Egos may be supervising the other Crypters,<br> but only I have a direct link to the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If I were to act in any way counter to the Foreign God&#39;s interests, I would immediately be cut off from further aid.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Which is why I had no choice but to say:</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> \u201CGrow the Tree of Emptiness. When it is done,<br> the Reconstruction of Myth will take place.\u201D</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Yes, I remember that.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You also said that this planet&#39;s surface activity would be restored to the Age of Gods, and that the gods would soon after resume their reign.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I agreed with your conclusion, but insisted we face one another in combat. I said that if you truly believed in the ideals of which you spoke, you should demonstrate that you wield the necessary strength to bring them about.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Of course, I lost that fight. I never thought I would learn firsthand how debilitating complacency could be.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That was only because I planned ahead. I took a calculated risk that you wouldn&#39;t go all out if I spoke to you alone.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Olympus is not part of Earth.<br> It&#39;s a colony that continues to operate to this day.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As its omnipotent god, you have an obligation<br> to keep it running at all times.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So it follows that you would not employ your full strength in an opening move against a lone mage like myself, yes?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Hmph. I have to admit, you were a clever bastard of a human. As soon as you unveiled your meteor magecraft, I knew I had erred at the start.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I quickly changed outputs, but by then, it was too late. In boxing terms, I had already been knocked out.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Hehe, what I wouldn&#39;t give to show Hades the signals<br> Demeter and Aphrodite were emitting as they watched.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I doubt there are any stories of those two staring slack-jawed in shock in any myths from your Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I could say much the same of your reaction as well. You looked more like a kindly old man than a cold-blooded, all-powerful god.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Have the other gods of this Lostbelt ever even<br> seen those other possibilities you harbor?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> As if I would ever let them see such a thing. I am Zeus, the flagship of all Olympus. I am the all-powerful one who rules over even the other gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Even this avatar to which you now speak is no more than a virtual self, created expressly to converse with you. It is both me, and not me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes, good point. I may be hiding something,<br> but being a ship, you are largely unable to do so.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> When you do something not expected of you, you create a new function and have it act in your stead.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to put you out.<br> Let&#39;s return to the subject at hand.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You recognized the Foreign God&#39;s existence,<br> and accepted the Tree of Emptiness into your world.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After all, you need the Tree of Emptiness in order<br> to preserve this Lostbelt. But, at the same time\u2013</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> As long as the Tree of Emptiness is here, the Foreign<br> God will one day descend upon our world.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> And we Olympian gods cannot<br> coexist with the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> All we gods need is the Tree of Emptiness. The Foreign God and the Alter Egos are our enemies, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Thus, the instant the Tree of Emptiness has fully<br> blossomed, we will revolt against them.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I will claim the Tree of Emptiness for myself,<br> and destroy the Foreign God&#39;s point of arrival.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> From there, I will purge this world of the last traces of insolent Proper Human History, and establish our world of Olympus in its place.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I remember you approached me with a contract<br> back when that thought first occurred to me.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Your exact words were, \u201CThere is no need for<br> you to explain your decision with words.\u201D</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> \u201CKing of the Gods, I implore you to form a contract with me, for our ultimate objectives are the same.\u201D</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> That was your way of suggesting we protect this<br> Lostbelt from the Foreign God, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be so bold as to say \u201Cprotect.\u201D<br> As you and I both seek the same outcome...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I only wanted your help so that our goal would<br> be realized even if one of us were to fall.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I trust your feelings on that have not changed?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Of course not.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I may oppose Proper Human History,<br> but I do not oppose humanity.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I promise you that in the event of your death,<br> I will carry on protecting humanity in your stead...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...even if it should come to light that you have been<br> deceiving us and acting on Proper Human History&#39;s behalf.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> As long as you are not openly to blame for your actions, I will accept you, warts and all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I hear you loud and clear, Zeus.<br> It seems our plan remains unchanged.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> There are only a few days left until the Tree of Emptiness reaches a critical point. Until that time comes, we shall continue to work towards the Reconstruction of the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Heh. You continue to walk a tightrope with the Foreign God, Olympus, and Chaldea all aiming to knock you off...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...and you do so with aplomb.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Wait, Wodime.<br> There is one thing I would like to verify as well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You told Caenis the stars indicated you<br> would need to fight two more times, yes?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> One of those happened in Atlantis,<br> leaving only one more.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So you are to save your final<br> battle for me, understand?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I forbid you to waste it on either<br> Chaldea or the Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I want to fight you once again...and I want to stake<br> the future of this world of gods upon our battle.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> When that time comes, I will gladly face you with all my strength, so that I may live up to your expectations.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> ...What an unpleasant surprise.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Exactly who gave you permission<br> to stand there, human?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Olympia Dodona&#39;s corridors are reserved for gods alone.<br> They are no place for humans to loiter.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I see. Well, I do beg your forgiveness if<br> I&#39;ve offended you, O goddess of beauty.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I was trying to hide my pitiful human self behind a pillar so as not to upset your divine mood, but I guess I wasn&#39;t successful.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re new here. Are you another one of those mages<br> from Proper Human History? Crypters, was it?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see. There&#39;s Kadoc Zemlupus, who reminds me of a filthy little puppy... Peperoncino, who reminds me of a nasty vulture...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> And you&#39;re... You&#39;re... What are you, exactly?<br> Are you really a Crypter?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Nothing about you stands out. I can&#39;t eve think of an animal you remind me of. How dreadfully boring.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Ouch! You cut me to the quick, goddess.<br> But yes, you&#39;re exactly right!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> As you can see, I am but a humble, harmless human. If you think me pitiable, I would only ask that you find it in your divine heart to offer me some tiny modicum of compassion.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Compassion? You want me to spend my precious<br> time thinking about a human?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Humans are weak and deserving of our protection. I&#39;m even willing to lend them a hand when they need help.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> But that&#39;s as far as it goes.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> We are the gods of Olympus! We would never waste our time on something so foolish as thinking about humans, especially not here!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Not even a comrade of Kirschtaria.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Know your place, human.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Ahh... You couldn&#39;t be more right, goddess.<br> Please, forgive my foolish offense.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You see, I only just arrived from<br> an incredibly barbaric island.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Every person there had their hands full taking care of themselves, and any faith they may have had in something greater had long been lost.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Not that there were ever any gods in that world to begin with, of course. Compared to that, Olympus has been truly divine in every sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Indeed, your glorious light is still far too bright for my poor eyes. I only hope you can laugh off my slight as the foolish remarks of a hopeless country bumpkin.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> A world without gods, hmm...<br> Such a place is better off being pruned.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Very well, Crypter. You may not be worthy of my<br> consideration, but I can spare you a bit of my pity.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I can only imagine how much you must have suffered<br> in a Lostbelt without a single god.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> So I will overlook your transgressions here in light of your wise decision to abandon that foolish Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Now then, what is your name?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Ah, your mercy and kindness move me to my core, goddess! I have no words to express my gratitude and respect!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> My name is Beryl Gut.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> If I have proved worthy of you remembering me, even if only for a fleeting moment, I will know joy beyond measure!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Beryl... What a strange ring your name has.<br> It almost sounds like blood splattering against a wall.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Very well, Beryl, come to my shrine.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to tell me, and only me, about this Lostbelt\u2013this Land of Fairies at the Ends of the World you abandoned.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> It would be my pleasure, my goddess.<br> But first...may I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I can&#39;t seem to find a close friend<br> of mine here no matter where I look.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> It&#39;s Kadoc, the one you said reminds you of a puppy.<br> Would you happen to know where I might find him?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Of course not. I couldn&#39;t possibly care<br> less about such a hapless creature.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> He&#39;s probably out somewhere enjoying<br> one of the city&#39;s automated brothels.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> (...Is that so. Well, that works out nicely.)</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I see, I see.<br> Yes, that does sound like something Kadoc would do.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> But in that case, Lady Aphrodite, if Kadoc is out in the city now, I mean, according to the revelation from the King of the Gods...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Oh, that? Yes, if he&#39;s out in the city now, he&#39;ll probably end up dead, caught up in the eradication of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> As a pathetic member of Proper Human History, rather than one of our citizens of Olympus, I doubt there will be so much as a trace of him left.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Indeed. This may sound heartless of me, but if that is his fate, so be it. After all, you are the goddess of love, and love can, at times, be cruel.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You were never one to come to the aid<br> of mortals, even in Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> For my part, I can only hope and pray that<br> Kadoc is still somewhere in this shrine...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> What about the other Twelve Olympians?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Say, for example, the goddess of the land and harvest who has long protected nature, animals, and humans alike?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Oh, yes, Demeter.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Hmm... Good question. I&#39;m not really sure.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> There would be no problem if she could remain the steely, cold-blooded goddess she should be...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> But Demeter...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> She&#39;s always been much too kind for a mechanical god.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Interstellar Mountainous City Olympus.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> South District.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All of a sudden, an enormous flock of birds took to the sky, causing the people there to instinctively look up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it was only a flock of birds taking flight.<br> Nothing else of note occurred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Today would play out peacefully, just as yesterday had. Soon, there would come another peaceful tomorrow to take its place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was what everyone thought just before it happened.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was an enormous sphere.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A massive steel object as tall as<br> most of the nearby skyscrapers.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This was the true form of a god.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This was one of the gods that reigned supreme over Olympus\u2013one of the arks that had crossed the sea of stars long ago.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This was the Aletheia that presided over the land. This was Demeter, the mechanical goddess of the land and harvest.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As the mother goddess who inherited much from Gaia,<br> her name means \u201CMother Earth.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She saves humanity by giving them ambrosia, which grants immortality. She nurtures humanity by keeping her supply towers running at every hour of every day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her love for humans is genuine.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is so sorrowful.<br> Endings are such misery.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, my beloved citizens of Olympus.<br> My darling, precious children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry to have to do this...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but I need to take your lives for a moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Commence demolition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> An earthquake! No, wait.<br> That didn&#39;t feel like it came from the ground...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This is Demeter&#39;s power. Believe me, I&#39;d know these massive vibrations anywhere.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Scream Eleusis.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s a, well, scream derived from Demeter&#39;s Authority<br> that can till massive expanses of land in an instant.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s powerful enough to destroy entire city districts. She could use it to plow all of Olympus in probably half a day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you say all of Olympus!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. She must be trying to kill us\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> No... She must be trying to kill you guys, even if she has to reduce the whole city to rubble to do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So she&#39;s attacking the whole city...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But, doesn&#39;t that mean the people of Olympus will also</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. Her scream kills everything it touches.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She must be counting on all of us being somewhere in the areas she&#39;s targeting, as that&#39;s all she needs for her attack to succeed.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This was how the gods so brutally killed the Heroic Spirits from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So they don&#39;t think anything<br> of sacrificing their own city.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but wait, I just remembered.<br> Adele, didn&#39;t you say that\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The power of the gods is the only thing<br> that can kill these immortal people.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But while they&#39;re practically immortal, they&#39;re<br> not truly immortal. That&#39;s what you said, right?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-so then, does that mean that, at this very moment...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Demeter is massacring hundreds<br> of thousands of people!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, but nobody&#39;s gonna care.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Not when they know she&#39;ll just regenerate<br> everything she kills or destroys later.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s what she did back during the third machia, and it&#39;s what she did when she killed Nikola Tesla&#39;s group, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> With Demeter&#39;s Authority, she could easily massacre<br> every Olympian who swears allegiance to her...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ... and bring everything back the<br> way it was in just a few days.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Our glorious gods, eh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, even death can be cured in this world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, you also said you still felt pain, right, Adele?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if they know they&#39;ll be brought back to life, being crushed to death inside a building must still be a terrifying experience.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Maybe it only sounds weird to me because I&#39;m not immortal myself.)</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Assuming that the goddess of the land&#39;s Authority truly is capable of completely restoring a person&#39;s physical body...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...the notion that the experience of dying would somehow not affect the victims psychologically is...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I must admit that, while this is unexplored territory, the prospect seems extremely unlikely at best.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I see you care about the same things they did.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Some said it didn&#39;t matter what the people of this Lostbelt went through, since they were all going to disappear when Proper Human History was restored, anyway...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...but that didn&#39;t prevent the Heroic Spirits of our alliance from trying to save them from the gods&#39; devastating attack.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> What&#39;s more\u2013</p><p><strong>M\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahaha!

What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It is what it sounds like. It&#39;s the name for the strategies we came up with to take down each of the gods.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been the God Destroyer Alliance&#39;s goal for a long time. Hell, they&#39;re the whole reason our alliance exists. And luckily, Tesla&#39;s group made a ton of headway on them.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we failed in our attempt, so now,<br> we would like you to pick up where we left off.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Please help us.<br> I&#39;m sure Mahatma had a hand in bringing you here.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> These Spirit Origins of ours may not know you...<br> but you have fought alongside other versions of us before, right?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> I remember you.

Externally, it appears to be very<br> similar to the ones we saw in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This is an original model, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a cut above what you saw in terms of effectiveness and precision.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> After all, Klironomia never degrade while they&#39;re<br> near the Cronus Crown\u2013the symbol of the king of the gods.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing the Cronus Crown is that giant mechanical thing up above the great shrine?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It used to belong to<br> Cronus, back before the first machia.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what keeps the Authority nanomachines in<br> good working order, huh? Sounds like extra divine<br> providence.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa there, careful, Fou.<br> You don&#39;t want to get too close.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Not unless you want that adorable fluffy body of yours<br> to start swelling up like some kind of muscle balloon.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, kyaaau!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> These Theos Klironomia contain the Authority<br> of both Athena and Ares, the two gods of war.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They&#39;re very pure nanomachines that are usually only given to the Royal Guard stationed in the great shrine. They should be a huge help in combat.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> At least, until their effects wear off...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Anyway, they&#39;re one of the more powerful weapons we got with the Collaborator&#39;s help.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Normal Heroic Spirits can&#39;t hold a candle to the gods,<br> so you&#39;ll need these to power up your Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ares Klironomia...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Back in Atlantis, we heard these were long gone...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I see. Well, don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s not the case here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They don&#39;t exactly grow on trees, but rest assured...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...we do have high-purity Klironomia<br> from all of the Twelve Olympians here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Usually, they would reject human-based Spirit Origins...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...but fortunately, we know how<br> to adjust them to work on you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So we&#39;re basically getting a free power-up, huh?<br> This is great! It&#39;s like Buddha himself has come to drag us outta hell.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Those of us who live by the sword aren&#39;t picky about using whatever gives us an edge! At least not if you live by my Niten Ichiryu!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Granted, I&#39;m sure there are also regular Heroic Spirits<br> capable of cutting down gods, but never mind those for now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to use them too, if you don&#39;t mind.<br> Under the current circumstances...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I also agree that we can&#39;t be picky about how we<br> even the odds. Is this okay with you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. Let&#39;s do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You bet. Just be careful and don&#39;t overdo it, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai. Don&#39;t worry. If I feel anything is<br> wrong with my vitals, I&#39;ll let you know right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said...I think I&#39;ll be just fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I saw what it was like for everyone else to fight with<br> Klironomia back in Atlantis. Now, it&#39;s my turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> If you&#39;ll stand over there, Mash and Musashi, I&#39;ll begin the Klironomia injection and bonding procedure.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> And while we&#39;re doing that...<br> I&#39;ll go over exactly what Demeter is.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a video feed of what&#39;s taking<br> place above ground right now.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This is Demeter, goddess of the land.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Aka Demeter, interstellar voyage<br> supply and production ship.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She provides the Olympus Interstellar Fleet with the supplies they need, and on Earth, she provides people with infinite resources.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She&#39;s said to be the god who inherited the most<br> from Gaia, one of the original prototype ships.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She possesses Authority over the harvest\u2013<br> in other words, production and regeneration.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> While her power does consume a fair amount of magical energy, she rarely has to worry about running out thanks to the connection she, along with all the other gods, have to the god-made leyline in Olympus&#39;s crystal mountain range.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Theoretically, she can regenerate from any amount of<br> damage, making it impossible to completely destroy her.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She also possesses Scream Eleusis\u2013a destructive Authority that breaks down old and dead organic matter into reusable resources.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Between infinite regenerating defense and massively destructive attacks, she&#39;s a very powerful opponent.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no way you can hope to<br> defeat her in a normal battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Yes, that&#39;s certainly about what I would expect<br> when going up against one of the Twelve Olympians.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What about that aural dissonance you two used yesterday? It appeared to do a good job at cutting the gods off from their magical energy resources.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That? Well...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That IS one of the Alliance&#39;s trump cards,<br> but it&#39;s not one we can use freely...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Plus, it takes a while to charge with magical energy,<br> so it&#39;s still out of commission right now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Not to mention that the real thing<br> is somewhere else right now. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. I suppose I should have expected<br> it wouldn&#39;t be that easy.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> However, we&#39;ve been developing<br> a secret weapon on the sly...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> With it, we have a nonzero chance of actually slaying the gods!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a very impressive name, but...what exactly is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t ready when Tesla&#39;s group was still here, but it&#39;s ready now!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> With the Heroic Spirit Cannon complete, we can finally<br> fight back without having to cower in fear of the gods!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m not typically one to get excited about weaponry, but there is something about that name that gets my heart dancing. The Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon... Hmm.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Yes, the gods may have defeated us,<br> but our loss was not in vain.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Our path to victory was viable.<br> We simply weren&#39;t able to take it!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> But now, our corpses have paved the way,<br> and the path forward is clear!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> So go, and be victorious!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Okay, thanks, guys.<br> Now let me take it from here, or we&#39;ll be here all day!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> All right, so, the Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon<br> is basically a giant, super Mahatma cannon.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> It&#39;s a type of Mystic Code that all seven of us Heroic Spirits pooled our magical energy into making. You could even call it a magecraft weapon of sorts.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> It uses Klironomia from the Olympian gods who were in the coexistence faction and were defeated during in the last machia\u2013</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Hades, god of the underworld; Apollo, god of the sun;<br> Ares, god of war; and Hephaestus, god of the forge.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> All seven of us, along with the Collaborator,<br> designed it to fire a pretty powerful projectile.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> It should be able to expose a mechanical god&#39;s Divine Core with a direct hit, which will open it up to further attack!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This can work! I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s get down to how exactly<br> we&#39;re going to pull this off.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Our target is Demeter, the mechanical god destroying Olympus&#39;s South District, advancing as we speak.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> It looks like she&#39;s digging deep down into the ground, too...which means it&#39;s only a matter of time until she also destroys this base.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve got to fire the Heroic Spirit<br> Cannon before she can get the chance.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> According to our calculations, these are the four optimal positions at which the cannon can inflict the most damage:</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Our job is to lure Demeter to one of these positions and score a direct hit on her with the Heroic Spirit Cannon, after which we just whale on her.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This is our surest path to victory right now. But be<br> careful! The Heroic Spirit Cannon may technically<br> be complete now\u2013</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> But it can still only be fired once!<br> If it misses, you&#39;ll be in big trouble!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Klironomia injection and bonding process complete.<br> Vitals all look good!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m all set, too! This is amazing! I can feel the energy welling up inside me, magical and otherwise!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> As for the stuff with the cannon, we were listening<br> along too, and I think we got the gist.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Basically, we hit this goddess...ship thingy with a special cannon, then it&#39;ll be time to cut her down to size!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Sounds like a plan to me!<br> Now let&#39;s all go make it happen!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Are you with me, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Operation God Destroyer: begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou!!!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> There&#39;s just one last thing you should be aware of.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have time to get into the details now, but just be careful about what you say up on the surface.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Down here, you can say whatever you want, but up there, make sure not to mention our base or our names.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but, got it!</p><hr><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> All set? Great!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get this operation started!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have a visual on the target! Demeter is making her way through the South District, moving from the northern area to the southern!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s laying waste to everything in her path... She&#39;s<br> going to destroy this entire region unless we stop her!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably her game plan. If she doesn&#39;t find us here in the south, she&#39;ll keep destroying all the other districts one by one until she does.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (I&#39;ll say this about that plan: it&#39;s a pretty solid approach to killing us all no matter where we might be hiding.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Case in point, the alliance base is right in the<br> southern tip&#39;s underground infrastructure.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> These gods don&#39;t do anything by halves, that&#39;s for sure. If nothing else, I&#39;ll give them points for style!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Last time, Demeter stopped her assault after she&#39;d<br> killed all the Heroic Spirits above ground\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But this time, we don&#39;t know what her ultimate objective is. For all we know, she might really destroy the entire city.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Either way, we&#39;re not gonna take this lying down!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (No way in hell I&#39;m gonna let this god destroy the city or wipe out our base!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s the latest status on the<br> Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s all set up on the rooftop of a disguised skyscraper in the middle of the South District. We&#39;re aiming it at point Alpha as we speak!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Find a way to lure Demeter there.<br> We&#39;ll open fire as soon as we have her in our sights!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Please get back in the storage space, Fou!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Let me go over this one more time.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Demeter is not acting alone.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> She&#39;s being accompanied by a number of<br> escorts located directly beneath her.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Specifically, it&#39;s a swarm of destructive machines and steel Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You should be able to draw Demeter&#39;s attention by finding these escorts and destroying them one at a time.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Our analysis tells us that Demeter relies exclusively on her overwhelmingly powerful abilities in combat...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...so she has no understanding of strategy or tactics as applied to battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So, the plan is to hit the nearby enemies hard, draw<br> Demeter&#39;s attention, and lead her to point Alpha, hm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Fascinating. Yes, most fascinating indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems phase one of this anti-machine god strategy can best be described as, \u201CWe won&#39;t know until we try!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foumes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wh-where&#39;d that come from!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m shocked too, Senpai. I can&#39;t recall Sherlock Holmes ever saying something so, um, cavalier before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-it almost sounded to me like he was just, well,<br> saying something for the hell of it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahaha. I assure you, Ms. Kyrielight,<br> I was being quite sincere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Uh, does he usually say that kinda stuff, or was he hitting that pipe of his when we weren&#39;t looking?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, while I do very much enjoy a good pipe, I&#39;m quite sober at the moment. Nor am I anyone else disguised at me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now, more importantly, I&#39;m sensing a number of magical energy signals not too far from us. Am I the only one?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right! It&#39;s a group of Demeter&#39;s escorts!<br> They appear to be about two hundred meters away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And Demeter herself is twenty-two hundred meters<br> past them! We&#39;re close enough to begin the operation!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So, Fujimaru, what&#39;s your next move?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The only move we can make!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash! Musashi! Get ready for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>P\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Prelim time, huh. Fine by me!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well! Let us begin phase two of this anti-machine<br> god strategy: \u201CThe only move we can make!\u201D</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man, oh man. I feel great!<br> These Ares Klironomia are amazing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Confirming multiple hostiles down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These Athena Klironomia are amazing, too... I&#39;ve been<br> able to raise the Ortinax&#39;s output to ninety percent!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, with these on our side, I think we should have no problem going toe to toe with Olympus&#39;s forces!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, we&#39;ll still need more power in order to face a mechanical god. In this case, we require the Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon to break through her shielding!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And let&#39;s not forget, it&#39;s only a matter of time until<br> the escort troops you just defeated regenerate!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So keep making your way through them<br> until you get to Demeter! Onward!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is so sorrowful.<br> Endings are such misery.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demeter is...changing direction!?<br> Instead of heading to the southern edge...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...she&#39;s started moving towards the east!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Wh-what the!? Why isn&#39;t she trying to use her unstoppable regenerative and offensive abilities on us!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Dammit, change of plans! Forget about points Alpha and Beta! Hurry to point Gamma!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Demeter&#39;s escorts are reconstructing themselves and changing formation. Try to get her attention by destroying them again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple hostiles detected again! The reconstructed escorts are making their way towards us!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief. Talk about your loyal guard dogs.<br> Still, this would seem to work in our favor.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Let&#39;s make extra sure to get Demeter&#39;s attention this time. Are you ready for another round of strenuous combat, ladies [\u2642 and gentleman]?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know it! Let&#39;s do this, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course! Battle positions, guys!</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Right, Master.<br> Preparing to resume battle operations!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There! We broke through the second wave of escorts!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, we can SO do this. Seriously, these<br> war-god nano-whatsits are freaking AMAZING!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m not about to convert from Buddhism anytime soon, but I can still totally get the appeal! Thanks for helping out!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway! That ought to have gotten<br> Demeter&#39;s attention by\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is so sorrowful.<br> Endings are such misery.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, my beloved citizens of Olympus.<br> My darling, precious children.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...The hell? She&#39;s ignoring us?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems Demeter does not get involved in her escorts&#39; affairs. I suppose they must all be operating independently then.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo? Fou?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> These escorts are only slowing us down.<br> If we&#39;re to lure Demeter to point Gamma...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...it seems we&#39;ll have to get out in front of her and make her notice us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She may have limitless capacity for regeneration, but even she cannot ignore a direct attack to the face.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you want us to directly attack a god!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ll even go so far as to say that the third phase of this anti-machine god strategy is \u201CHit them as hard as you can\u201D!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So that is the wisdom Sherlock Holmes, great sage of Proper Human History, has to offer.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s a reckless, foolhardy plan,<br> but the premise is sound.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Okay, Mash, Musashi, and Fujimaru.<br> The rest is up to you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Don&#39;t even think about trying to defeat her. Just holding out against her will be more fiendishly difficult than you can possibly imagine.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> But for the plan to succeed, you will have to evade her attacks and hold out as best you can until you can lead her to point Gamma!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is so sorrowful.<br> Endings are such misery.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> She&#39;s been repeating the same crap for a while now!<br> God? Yes. Master orator? Not so much!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hell, I bet most modern-day kitchen appliance A.I.s are chattier than her. She could learn a thing or two from a good kabuki show.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s about all the bluffing I can muster.<br> What do you think, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup, she&#39;s about as eloquent as a microwave!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way she&#39;s a match for your motormouth, Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I knew it!<br> Then let&#39;s keep this attitude up for one last push!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Demeter is approximately twenty-six hundred meters away from our position! Deploying rapid movement charge to initiate battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Death is so sorrowful.<br> Endings are such misery.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why? Why?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why do you hurry to your deaths?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Shatter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I somehow managed to withstand her<br> large-scale magical energy emanation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Ortinax&#39;s auto-maintenance is still working. Theoretically, I should be able to take two more strikes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you all right, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m okay!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved to hear that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine! Thanks, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> There! We finally have the big gal&#39;s attention!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Although... Not only is her armor super tough,<br> it really does regenerate before your eyes, huh...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We&#39;ll obviously never get anywhere like this.<br> We&#39;ve gotta fight mass with mass.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So!? How&#39;s that part going!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It isn&#39;t much,<br> but she has slightly altered her course to face us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Assuming she doesn&#39;t further alter her course,<br> she should arrive at point Gamma in due time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So far so good, as they say, but I can&#39;t help but wonder: How many more times can we weather that assault?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even with Ms. Kyrielight&#39;s considerable defenses, I&#39;m also forced to conclude that two more strikes is our limit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Suffice to say...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Things are not looking good.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fa! Foooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Dammit, this IS bad! Enemy reinforcements are headed this way from the East District, and fast!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Olympus official guards! Depending on their numbers, you might not be a match for them, even in your powered-up states!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AOlympus Official Guard:</strong><br> So you are the Chaldeans! The demons who would defy Lady Demeter and turn their blades on the gods of Olympus!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1AOlympus Official Guard:</strong><br> We will cut you all down, women and children or not!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (How&#39;d they make it here through all these explosions!?<br> Oh, right, they come back to life. Makes sense!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Man, as if Demeter wasn&#39;t a hell of a handful on her own, now we&#39;ve got a bunch of tough-ass soldiers who don&#39;t even fear their own deaths to deal with, too!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Let&#39;s see, one, two, three...<br> Way more than I can count!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Saying things aren&#39;t looking good<br> would be kinda an understatement!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> All right, Shinmen Musashi...<br> How are you gonna get out of this one!?</p><h2 id="section-7-thou-art-the-harvest-that-reaps-the-stars-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-thou-art-the-harvest-that-reaps-the-stars-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Thou Art the Harvest that Reaps the Stars (IV)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When I gaze up at the sky...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m able to forget the horrible atrocities taking<br> place beneath me, if only for a moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My beloved humans.

This is all very good!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We gave Caenis a communications relay that should<br> boost our connection and let us communicate in real time.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s a special device our technical advisor put together to compensate for Olympus&#39;s environment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci did that...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I keep telling her not to work so hard and get some rest, but she never listens to me! You should put in a word with her, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tell her I said \u201Cthanks.\u201D</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Very well.<br> I&#39;ll also tell her you said to get some rest already.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;ve got a fairly<br> good grasp on your situation.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Really, it&#39;s hard to miss the giant machine god destroying the city, given she&#39;s...well, giant.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And knowing all of you, I was all but certain you&#39;d be leaving the Tree of Emptiness aside in favor of doing something about her.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well?

Just to be clear, you can start with the praise whenever you like.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At any rate, I don&#39;t know how much you&#39;re currently struggling, but now that we&#39;ve got Caenis on our side, use the extra help as you see fit!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then I want you to defeat every last one of those damn machine gods and cut down the Tree of Emptiness!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You got a death wish or something!?<br> Who said any of you could \u201Cuse\u201D me!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Eep!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-w-w-well, let&#39;s not forget, Caenis,<br> you owe me a debt, do you not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In fact, I distinctly remember you admitting defeat in the face of my overwhelmingly skillful negotiation technique and saying you would do whatever we asked!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Y-you are a Divine Spirit, are you not? Surely you&#39;re<br> not about to go back on your own word, are you!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m not clear on the particulars of how this came to pass, but I trust we can now count Caenis among our ranks?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> P-precisely, Administrative Advisor! Now go ahead and use Caenis however you need to bring that god down!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hey!

That was a poor choice of words,<br> so I&#39;ll...be more careful in the future. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Eesh. You punks really want a dipshit like that as your commander?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hahahaha. All right, everyone, now that you know Caenis is on our side, you should be up to speed!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Try to get along as best you can!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...Caenis is...on our side now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how this happened, but if it&#39;s true,<br> this is wonderful news, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Having someone as strong as Caenis on our team would be a huge help!</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! Don&#39;t get it twisted, you Chaldean dumbasses!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I owe Goredolf Musik there a debt, so I&#39;m just putting<br> my spear in your hands until I pay him back.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Once that&#39;s done, I&#39;m still gonna kill the absolute shit outta all of you, no matter what else happens.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Really? Are you suuure about that?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell you trying to say, bitch?<br> You think I don&#39;t mean what I say?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh no, of course not. I can tell you&#39;re serious,<br> and that you&#39;re not really our ally...at ALL.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I just mean, given how bad things are around here,<br> you might not be around long enough to pay back your debt.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So what?<br> You&#39;re saying I&#39;m gonna die like a dog or something?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t go that far, but yeah, maybe.<br> I mean, take a look.</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Impossible... Is that Lord Caenis!?</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> No, it can&#39;t be!<br> It must be an illusion cast by the Chaldeans!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> All hands, destroy that fake Caenis! We can&#39;t let her make any more trouble for Lady Demeter!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Tch. Yeah, all right, I got it.<br> Less talk, more spear, right?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, Chaldean dipshits, it&#39;s your lucky day.<br> I&#39;ll let you command me in this fight.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> When you&#39;re done, you&#39;d better make sure none<br> of these Olympian soldiers are left alive!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Half a day earlier,<br> inside the Storm Border...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Please, Director, stop! We don&#39;t have to do this!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Really, why in the world didn&#39;t you restrain this Servant when you had the chance!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> You couldn&#39;t have known what we had back when that Nemo Marine picked up a mysterious magical energy signal...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> But why the recovery pod treatment once you did!?<br> And without restraints, no less!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, you went and<br> gave her a regular bed once she healed up!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> This is nuts! I don&#39;t know what you were thinking,<br> but I&#39;m sure as hell not going in that room!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Believe me, I understand the risks involved here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> However, the fact is, this could be our only chance<br> to obtain something we desperately need.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Remember, we still have yet<br> to hear back from Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] could have failed to rendezvous with the Heroic<br> Spirits who got here before us, and may be looking for a way out of a precarious situation even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And if so, what can we do? As things stand now, we have<br> nothing and no one we can send to help [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So it is imperative\u2013absolutely imperative\u2013that we find some means to fight back.

I get all that.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t make HER a good option!<br> I mean, she&#39;s just gonna kill us once she wakes up!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh, stuff it!

I-I take it you&#39;re awake now?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> My name is Goredolf Musik. I&#39;m also known<br> as Musik the Phoenix and Musik the Brave.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m the current director of Chaldea, though I&#39;m<br> sure you could tell as much from looking at me.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I apologize for the intrusion, but we&#39;ve been monitoring your vitals, so I know you&#39;re conscious enough to converse.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I, uh...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I have a nice, fluffy croissant for you here,<br> which I offer with no ulterior motive whatsoev\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Shut up. Gorduroy, or whatever the hell it is.<br> I heard the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> E-er, yes, while that does have a nice, strong ring to it, I&#39;m afraid I must correct you. It&#39;s Goredolf, not Gorduroy.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You gave the order to pick me up?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And you put me in that recovery-whatsit<br> without restraining me?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And you also let me sleep in a real<br> room instead of a jail cell?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m Caenis. Remember how I swore I&#39;d kill every last one of you dumbasses?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You must&#39;ve known that when you chose to help me.<br> So that means...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You got a death wish?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (N-n-n-n-n-n-nod)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Quit nodding and say something, dammit!<br> What are you, some kind of drunk freshwater mussel!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Answer me! If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll take your silence as confirmation you got a death wish.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-of course I don&#39;t want to die! I&#39;m standing here now because I believe we can cut a deal!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I saved your life! Th-that means you owe me a debt!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh? Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You&#39;re damn right I&#39;m serious! You were on the brink<br> of death! Hell, you practically WERE dead!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So no, you wouldn&#39;t be here right now if it weren&#39;t<br> for my bravery and my cunning calculations!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That said, my original plan was to only heal you a little bit and negotiate with you while you were still weak!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I never expected you to recover so much so fast! Dammit, Goredolf! Of all the mistakes you could have made!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You wanted to take advantage of me while I was still weak? That&#39;s extortion, not negotiation.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh? Really? Is that how it comes across?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Damn straight.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> It&#39;s no different from telling a POW that they&#39;ll<br> have to be your slave if they want to stay alive.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Cripes! I never thought of it<br> that way before, but she&#39;s right!)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Nice. That&#39;s WAY easier to believe than saving me outta the goodness of your heart. I&#39;d&#39;ve straight up murdered you if you&#39;d tried to pull that good Samaritan bullshit.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Your plan&#39;s screwed though,<br> since I&#39;m pretty much all better now.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what kind of magecraft or Mystic Code you used to heal me, but right now, I&#39;ve got Authority over both the land and the sea.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Once I&#39;ve snacked on a little magical energy,<br> my Spirit Origin&#39;ll pretty much heal itself.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> See? I&#39;m all healed up good as new,<br> so I don&#39;t need your help anymore.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So, you wanted to negotiate?<br> How you gonna go about that now?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> &#39;Cause from where I stand,<br> you ain&#39;t got shit for leverage.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well... There&#39;s the fact that I saved your life...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Heard that one already. What else you got?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Nothin&#39;? If it&#39;s nothin&#39;, I&#39;m killing you right now.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Well? I thought you didn&#39;t want to die. You&#39;d better speak up quick or my spear might slip. Or maybe I&#39;ll just kill you with my bare hands.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Which part of you should I crush? Your heart? Your skull? Maybe I&#39;ll start with your throat and then...get creative.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, you fat prick. Say something.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you got anything else to throw at me!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-w-w-we&#39;ve also defeated P-P-P-Poseidon!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-the Storm Border, our state-of-the-art ship, defeated Poseidon, the mechanical god of the sea protecting Atlantis!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-wh-what do you think of that!?<br> You&#39;re the Caenis from Greek mythology, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> S-so hearing of Poseidon&#39;s destruction must make you feel p-pretty good, right!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t believe this.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Dammit! I can&#39;t believe of all people,<br> you Chaldeans beat me to it!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That shitty punk-ass bastard might not be the Poseidon I know from Proper Human History, but still!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I was supposed to be the one to finish that asshole off! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!!!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Anyway, that aside...<br> You.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Eep!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You beat Poseidon, huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Solid card to play. You might have some skill at this negotiation stuff after all.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-I, uh... Thank you...?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Five minutes.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Five minutes?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be nice and hold off on killing you for five minutes. Four minutes and fifty-nine seconds.<br> Fifty-eight...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !!!!!!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> N-now just a minute! You mean everything I worked up the courage to tell you only bought me five minutes of leeway!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You ought to be proud.<br> You got five whole minutes from me. Make &#39;em count.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You could run for away, not that it&#39;ll do you any good. You could call for help, which also wouldn&#39;t do you any good.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So, Goredolf Musik of Chaldea,<br> what&#39;re you gonna do?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> .........</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So, once five minutes have passed, you&#39;re going to kill me? No, not just me... Everyone on this ship?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Yup.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-th-th-th-then, I&#39;ll have to find a way to stop you... Wh-whatever it takes...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh yeah? And what&#39;re you gonna do, mustache?<br> You sure you don&#39;t just wanna make a run for it?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Look. You might be an idiot,<br> but I can tell you&#39;re not completely stupid.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So you do know that when I say I&#39;ll give you five minutes, I mean YOU are the only one getting the head start, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> B-b-be that as it may, I...<br> As director, I have a responsibility to\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think I give a seahorse&#39;s shit about that?<br> Besides, what&#39;s responsibility compared to your own life?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Just forget about all your allies on this ship and<br> run for your life like the pathetic coward you are.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Nobody&#39;d blame you for it.<br> Especially since they&#39;ll be kinda busy being dead.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...B-b-b-be that as it m-m-may...<br> I-I still have a responsibility to\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Who cares?<br> What is this, some commander&#39;s pride thing?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, last chance.<br> Go on and get out of here before I change my mind.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t get why I&#39;m letting you off the hook, then fine. I&#39;m gonna feel kinda bad, but I&#39;ll start by killing you\u2013</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong!<br> This isn&#39;t about my responsibility as commander at all!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> NO! You&#39;ve got it all wrong! This... This goes back WAY further than just my time as commander!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I know! I know, God dammit! It was ME!<br> It&#39;s my fault the world ended!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m... I&#39;m to blame for Chaldea&#39;s destruction. Um, partly. You think I don&#39;t think about that every day!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s staff didn&#39;t do anything wrong! The Incineration of Humanity wasn&#39;t their fault and I damn well know it!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> They didn&#39;t have a choice! They had to try to fix the apocalypse with just a few dozen people!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I knew that. Even then, I knew it.<br> And STILL I insisted it was all their fault...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> They were... They were amazing...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And if I hadn&#39;t come in and taken over as the director and screwed EVERYTHING up, things might have gone differently!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So...there. There you have it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to do this. I&#39;m terrified to even try,<br> b-but I still have to see this through!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Y-you see...<br> I&#39;m the most important thing to me. By a LOT!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to be a traitor to humanity!<br> That&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to end up just some useless coward!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Chubby...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A-and it&#39;s why I can&#39;t run away now.<br> Even if it means I end up dying here...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I won&#39;t back down! I won&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Do you hear me, Caenis? I&#39;m standing my<br> ground because I think we can cut a deal!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I saved your life, my team and I defeated the sea-god you hate\u2013even if he wasn&#39;t the one you know from Proper Human History\u2013and what&#39;s more...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Well?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> What&#39;s more...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Two minutes. One minute, fifty-nine seconds...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And what&#39;s more...I&#39;ve got a freshly-baked croissant!<br> Right here!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, and so delicious you&#39;ll\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh, so that&#39;s what you&#39;ve had there all this time.<br> I thought it was some kind of poison... So it&#39;s food?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s right. It&#39;s made with tons of butter,<br> and it has all the calories you could want.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ve also got milk and tea to go with it, if you like. Croissants are delicious, but they can make you feel a bit parch\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Ha.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Haha, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!<br> Ahhh hahahahaha! Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Are you trying to win a Heroic Spirit over with food!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Are you actually trying to negotiate with me, Caenis<br> the Tyrant, now Caenis the Divine Spirit...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...with a freaking piece of bread!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahaha! This is the funniest goddamn thing I&#39;ve seen in...I don&#39;t even know how long!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> It&#39;s too bad Kirschtaria didn&#39;t talk to you more! Hehehe, hahahaha! I&#39;ve never seen anyone so insolent in my life!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Surely it can&#39;t be THAT funny, can it?<br> Even Toole used to love these croissants.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Gimme that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I said, give it here already.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...(Munch)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Huh. So, that&#39;s a croissant.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Thanks. That was good.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That was good. And not only that...<br> I haven&#39;t laughed that hard since I manifested.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So I&#39;d have to say you won<br> this little exchange of ours.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, Musik, I officially owe you one.<br> You name one thing you want me to do, and I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Really!? You mean it!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;m a lot of things, but not a liar. I&#39;d never kill anyone who gave me such a warm reception.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a damn centaur, after all.<br> I might not act like it, but I&#39;m still a king.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Go ahead, name your request. I&#39;ll do anything<br> you want that&#39;s reasonably within my power.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...P-permission to speak freely?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Sure.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Could I make a second request as well?<br> One to return the favor I did you with the recovery pod?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-what do you say?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You&#39;re serious?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-the fact is...I need help! I can&#39;t shake this<br> feeling that things are going very badly out there!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Did Fujimaru&#39;s team manage to meet up<br> with numerous allies, like they did in Atlantis!? Or did the Heroic Spirits who got here ahead of us all meet an untimely end!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If it turns out to be the latter, then I\u2013we,<br> need you more than anything!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> H-huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That is to say, we need your help!<br> Desperately! And while I&#39;m at it...!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I also want that thing you&#39;ve been holding so tightly in your right hand ever since we found you.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hm?<br> My right hand?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh yeah, I guess I do have something here, don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I must&#39;ve grabbed hold of it when I<br> was floating around in the sea...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s a fragment of the moon goddess, complete with Artemis Klironomia! It&#39;s a bloody miracle that you happened to find it!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Please, let us have it!<br> It&#39;s of the utmost importance that we have it!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Go nuts. I sure as shit don&#39;t<br> have any need for this thing.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Aah, what a waste! Phew, it&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t know what<br> we would have done if it had broken\u2013Oh, right.<br> I guess it wouldn&#39;t, would it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Thank you, Caenis. I appreciate this more than I can say. Now, at last, we have the means to fight back!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Excuse me for a moment!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Wh-what the...!?<br> What&#39;re you doing back out here, chubby!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Perfect timing, Manuel! I need you to bring<br> this to my technical advisor at once!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> After that, I want you to use every bit of electricity the Storm Border has at its disposal to contact Sion back at the Wandering Sea, even if only for a few seconds!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> When you do, you are to tell her<br> \u201CWe have the last material!\u201D</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Phew. And with that, my work is done.<br> My subordinates should be able to take it from here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well then, now that things have settled down a bit,<br> there&#39;s something I need to ask you.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This has nothing to do with learning our enemy&#39;s strategy, or figuring out his weakness or anything like that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I just want to know out of, um... Personal curiosity? Disbelief? No... This is really only about my pride as a fellow noble.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> What is your Master...Kirschtaria Wodime,<br> like as a person?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Could I ask you to tell me your<br> personal thoughts about him?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Present time.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At any rate, the important thing to know<br> is that Caenis is not your enemy!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell you all about the bond<br> of trust we&#39;ve forged later!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash Kyrielight! You two are our<br> last hope for restoring Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It is for that eminently logical reason<br> that I risked my own life to help you!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Since my gamble has paid off, it&#39;s time for you two to take the proverbial ball and run with it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Director!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay! We&#39;ll get Demeter to point Gamma one way or another!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master! Resuming combat now!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If she doesn&#39;t want to follow us to our destination, we&#39;ll just have to drag her there, kicking and screaming!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll give everything<br> I&#39;ve got to make that happen.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If four swords aren&#39;t enough...I&#39;ll break<br> out my immovable fifth to finish the job!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Can we count on your help too, Caenis!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Even though if you do this, you&#39;ll be throwing your lot in with anti-Atlantic\u2013I mean, anti-Olympus Lostbelt forces!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! Fine with me! If they didn&#39;t want me switching sides, they shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve stabbed me in the back in the first place!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Care to elaborate?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Sh-shut up! Forget I said anything! All I need<br> to do&#39;s kick this god&#39;s fat ass, right!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Okay, Goredolf Musik! Time to see for yourself what a powerful asset I can be!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare miss a second of this!<br> If you so much as blink, I&#39;ll kill you on the spot!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Now check this shit out!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Lapithai Caeneus!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A bird with golden wings bursts forth!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Its violent shock wave rocks<br> even Demeter&#39;s massive core.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s not enough to bring her down.<br> Only to make her lurch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yet even so, all her disparate parts begin shaking<br> to help her keep her balance. Once. Twice.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> One more lurch, and she&#39;ll be where the God Destroyers need her to be...but it doesn&#39;t happen.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We&#39;re not done yet!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Setting Ortinax to maximum output! Preparing<br> to pierce Demeter&#39;s base with the bunker bolt!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Haaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> There! Demeter&#39;s at point Gamma!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Now&#39;s our chance! Firing our final weapon,<br> the Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Aah.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaah.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We hit her!<br> It...it sounds like she&#39;s screaming!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Do you hear that? Do you see that!? It&#39;s working!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right!<br> I can see cracks where the blast hit her outer shell!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Way to go, Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon! You actually managed to crack open that super tough god armor!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not over yet. Do not let your guard down.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> The blast still didn&#39;t manage to expose Demeter&#39;s Divine Core! I can&#39;t believe it. Her armor is even tougher than I thought.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but I&#39;m impressed. I can&#39;t believe she managed to take a direct hit from our Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon and remain intact. That being said\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Her armor isn&#39;t invincible anymore! Especially now that we&#39;ve got Caenis&#39;s spear negating her healing Authority!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We&#39;ve definitely got a shot at beating her now!<br> Come on! There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mash!<br> Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let up now! Keep hitting her with all we&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Understood, Master!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Setting Ortinax output to eighty percent! I&#39;ll keep up the attack making use of the Klironomia&#39;s effects!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Haha, so I&#39;ve got a chance to kill a god now?<br> Perfect! Hell yeah, let&#39;s do this thing!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You better believe I&#39;m gonna use you for my own purposes, Chaldean dumbasses!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh? Was that Nikola Tesla I saw just now? Is he one<br> of the Heroic Spirits that got here before us?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Does this mean I was working myself up over nothing?<br> I don&#39;t recognize that boy and girl over there, either...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-well, no matter!<br> Right now, our top priority is taking down Demeter!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Leave this part to me, everyone! Is that clear!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Begin the attack!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...A-all right, no matter! Begin the attack, everyone!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> There, we managed to get her outer shell off!<br> Did it work!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Demeter&#39;s outer core is severely damaged!<br> What appears to be her Divine Core is now exposed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ortinax output remains stable! I should be able to<br> maintain Anti-Divinity combat mode for at least ten minutes or so!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now we just need to take out her Divine Core!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hold it! Just hold the hell up! Are you dipshits blind or something? You can&#39;t just ignore her Klironomia!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Dammit, she hasn&#39;t completely stopped regenerating!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I can confirm her infinite regeneration has started<br> up again! Her wounds are beginning to close!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Dammit, we were so close!<br> ...Demeter! How much are you going to mock us!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-wh-what are you all doing!? Go on, keep hitting her! Caenis! Can&#39;t you use your land Authority to neutralize her regeneration!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I am, dammit! But it&#39;s still not enough to stop that bitch of a goddess!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> This damn Lostbelt Demeter really is directly descended from Gaia, isn&#39;t she! Dammit! I started celebrating too soon!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...It would seem this is well and truly the end. Even with all our great strokes of fortune, we still weren&#39;t able to defeat her.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> We thought we had accounted for our enemies being more powerful than expected in our designs, but her regenerative powers exceed even our wildest expectations!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> The Olympian gods truly seem to<br> surpass us in every way imaginable!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t over yet!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If you punks can beat Poseidon,<br> you can sure as shit beat Demeter, too!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Besides, nobody kills you jackasses but me!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Now take this, Fujimaru!<br> It&#39;s a little present from Mustache!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> He said this thing&#39;s guaranteed to be a game changer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Phew! Just barely caught it!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this...some sort of attachment for the Ortinax?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that... No way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! It&#39;s a new piece of Ortinax equipment Chaldea&#39;s own technical advisor designed in tandem with our Atlas Institute alchemist ally!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s a form of cancer made to bring down<br> beings of a scale far beyond human capacity...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We call it...<br> the Black Barrel!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Natural Longevity Conceptual Weapon,<br> one of the Seven Taboos!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Not that I know much about it myself!<br> Wahahahaha!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nice catch, Fujimaru!<br> So...what is that thing, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not entirely sure, actually...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I bet Mash&#39;ll know what to do with it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooooou! (Special<br> Translation: Nice pass, Fujimaru!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, Master! I know exactly what to do with this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> During Sion&#39;s lecture on life scales, she talked about a paradox effector that could let someone use a measurement as a weapon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci took that concept and ran with it to make a new mechanism for the Ortinax.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I actually had time to practice using it in the simulator while I was on standby at the Wandering Sea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa! The Ortinax doesn&#39;t look anything like a shield anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ah... Whoooa! So that&#39;s how it all works!<br> It really is a gun barrel, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Anyway, get ready to have your<br> socks knocked off, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You&#39;re looking at one of the Seven Taboos\u2013one of the Atlas Institute&#39;s crowning achievements, renowned throughout the entire magecraft community!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Or so I&#39;m told!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seven Taboos...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (That sounds vaguely familiar...)</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. The Seven Taboos are something of a legend among the Mage&#39;s Association. They&#39;re said to be weapons of magecraft capable of destroying the very world itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And the Black Barrel Conceptual<br> Weapon there is one of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ms. Sion already possessed a replica of it. I believe<br> she offered it to Chaldea as a souvenir of sorts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I knew she was also working with Da Vinci on<br> a new replacement part for the Ortinax...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but I didn&#39;t know they had finished<br> their work after we arrived here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good, no issues with the gun barrel transformation! Output and stability are all well above expected parameters!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Send out the Accomplishments Measure!<br> Begin the Black Barrel transformation when ready!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here goes! Initiating Accomplishments Measure!<br> Ascertaining Demeter&#39;s life scale!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> One thousand... Two thousand... Three thousand...<br> There! It stopped at forty-five hundred!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Beginning Black Barrel transformation!<br> Preparing to burn the Dead Counter into the gun barrel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but can someone tell me what&#39;s going on here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can hardly blame you for feeling lost. I doubt I could comprehend its workings either, even were I at my peak condition!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But while I may not know how it works, I do know<br> what it does! That&#39;s Demeter&#39;s life span!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then again, since she&#39;s a machine, perhaps its her warranty period? Or her estimated number of years in operation? Well, no matter!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The point is, as long as this universe has a finite<br> life span, there is nothing in it that will last forever!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Everything that has a form must also inevitably have an end! A limit, if you like!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That gun barrel can measure that end and<br> make it tangible! In other words\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So it&#39;s a weapon that copies its target&#39;s mass and throws it right back at them in the form of magical energy?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely! I must say, Caenis, you&#39;re far more intelligent than your behavior would suggest!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right. It&#39;s not the kind of weapon you<br> could usually carry around like this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But in this case, I was able to miniaturize and stabilize it by restricting the measurement function to machine gods only.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sion gave me the blueprints for it some time ago.<br> All I needed was a benchmark to use for its core.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The first benchmark was Poseidon&#39;s Divine Core.<br> And the second...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...is the fragment of Artemis that Caenis was holding when drifting down from Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was the last piece of the puzzle we needed!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Hmph. So that idiot Artemis turned out<br> to be good for something after all, huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But the Barrel still needs ultradense magical energy to do its job. And that means we&#39;re going to need you to use a Command Spell, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And not just any Command Spell, either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, this one&#39;s going to have to be a little different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll need to use everything you&#39;ve got\u2013your magical energy, your stamina... Even your own fate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Make no mistake: if you miss this shot,<br> you won&#39;t get another.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And since Mash has her hands full working the Ortinax, you&#39;ll need to work together to time it just right. She&#39;ll do the aiming. You&#39;ll pull the trigger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got this!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s what I like to hear.<br> Okay, good luck saving Proper Human History!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Da Vinci. Now go get some rest already.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ha! I swear, nothing throws you off, does it?<br> ...Thanks, Fujimaru. I&#39;m counting on you!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This may be only the first of Olympus&#39;s mechanical gods, but it&#39;s still a crucial moment!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh come on! After everything we did to get her<br> to notice us, NOW she&#39;s paying atten\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh shit!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That&#39;s the sound Demeter makes when she&#39;s about to get serious! She&#39;s storing up a metric shit ton of magical energy in that giant ass of hers!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> To put it in terms you punks&#39;ll understand...<br> she&#39;s just about to unleash her True Name!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I... I love you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I really do love you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Persephone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, how sad. How tragic...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Demeter&#39;s magical energy is rising rapidly!<br> She&#39;s about to unleash a massive scream!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you guys just got hold of, but you&#39;d better hurry!

By all rights, I should take it to my grave.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Back then, I was enrolled in the Astromancy Department at the Clock Tower, aka the Mage&#39;s Association&#39;s headquarters.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was the thirteenth heir to the Wodime legacy\u2013<br> the child who had been granted the protection of the stars.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was said to possess the greatest magical<br> circuits of any Wodime to date...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and that I was a genius who had already been promised the keys to the Wodime family in a few years&#39; time by the eleventh head of the estate, who led the family even now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Those were the sort of things everyone<br> else would say about me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Me, a genius? Even though I usually spend each<br> day sifting through other departments&#39; files?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was always the sort of response I gave,<br> but I did so more from conceit than modesty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I knew I was talented. I was confident I would one day be exactly what everyone expected me to be and more.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wanted for nothing; not lineage, nor talent, nor affection. With so many things working in my favor, it was easy to push myself to greater heights without leaning on my environment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Back then, I took pride in my excellence,<br> and would constantly work to further improve myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believed those blessed with natural talent should still continue to apply themselves, should set their sights on even greater stages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was completely convinced that there was nothing I<br> could not do, and nothing that was beyond my reach.</p><p><strong>Child Crouching On Bridge:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For the past six months, crossing the great bridge to<br> reach the Evocation Department college had become something of a routine of mine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I noticed what appeared to be beggars by the path at the opposite side, but I never gave them any thought.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At the time, I didn&#39;t even see them. It wasn&#39;t that<br> I disliked them, or that I was trying to avoid them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was that, for me,<br> they may as well not have existed at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was a prodigy, born to carve out a new age of magecraft. I didn&#39;t have time to get involved with people like them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was born into an environment far better than most could hope for, with talents far greater than most could dream of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That was why I had a duty to fulfill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was going to create something beautiful.<br> I was going to create something wonderful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was that ideal, that passion, that made me apply myself to my studies day in and day out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the reason I so frequently visited that college,<br> even when it arguably belonged to an enemy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t realize how arrogant<br> I was being, how childish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On that day, I was headed home later than usual. It was the middle of the night, with no one on the bridge, and the stars hidden behind the clouds.</p><p><strong>Man in Hat:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Everything happened so fast that I failed to react in time. That turned out to be a fatal mistake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t surprised that an assassin had been<br> sent to try to kill someone as young as me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was surprised because my would-be assassin was a manservant I had frequently seen in my own house.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I counterattacked automatically, before I even thought about what to do, thanks to the spells that had been engraved onto my body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The assassin never got another chance. Vacuum blades<br> sliced him to bits before he could pull the trigger again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, it was enough. He had already critically<br> wounded me, and there was no hope of escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He wasn&#39;t the only assassin who had been<br> sent to take my life. I knew because...</p><p><strong>Man in Coat:</strong><br> It&#39;s done. Send out more men.<br> Find Kirschtaria&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...it was my father, trying to kill his own son.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ghh...!</p><p><strong>Man in Coat:</strong><br> He fell into the river! Find him!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course, I wasn&#39;t the one who had fallen in.<br> It was my ring, after I had cast a weight alteration spell on it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I knew it wouldn&#39;t do more than buy me some time,<br> but at that moment, it was the best move I could make.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After I drew the assassins&#39; attention towards the river, I activated a footstep cancellation spell in my shoes and got as far away from them as I could.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Okay... Now what do I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My consciousness began to fade away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I went back to the bridge instead of heading to the city exit, and my strength gave out just as I was making my way to a narrow back alley.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At the time, I didn&#39;t yet know that my assailant&#39;s<br> weapon wasn&#39;t ordinary magecraft...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Rather, it was a kind of poison just like the sort used by a famous mage killer that was designed to attack magical circuits directly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Ghh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was in a dimly lit room. Within it was nothing more than the sound of dripping water and the scent of mildew.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was on a makeshift bed made from an old wooden crate.<br> A bare minimum of bandaging had been applied to my back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was no pillow. No blankets.<br> And no restraints on my arms or legs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was technically free, but unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to move so much as a finger. The wound in my chest had yet to close, and I lacked the strength even to stand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had been laid down to rest with<br> no more ceremony than a corpse.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Where...am I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At first, I thought my assassins had captured me...but<br> then I realized they would have no reason to keep me alive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all, since it was my own family was trying to kill me, there was little sense in torturing me for information.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t understand what was going on.<br> My thoughts refused to put themselves in order.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Still just barely conscious, I managed to crane my neck enough to observe the dimly lit room...</p><p><strong>Something Creepy:</strong><br> Heehee... Heeheehee...<br> ...Heehee... Heehee...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something was in the corner of the room, as if it were<br> trying to hide from what little light there was.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was then that I noticed something...strange staring directly at me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...Seriously?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Just when I decide to stop by so it doesn&#39;t look<br> like I&#39;ve been gone for two days straight...)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (...Zzzzzz.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this guy. He&#39;s just basking in the sun, snoozing away on a bench without so much as a single guard.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hey. Hey, Wodime, don&#39;t you<br> think it&#39;s time you got up?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You ARE the Crypters&#39; leader, right?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the one guy representing humanity in the power struggle between the Olympian gods and humans?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How can you just leave yourself completely defenseless<br> like this!? Come on, wake up already!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Is that you, Kadoc?<br> Wait... Kadoc...?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What are you doing here?<br> This is my roo\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Never mind. No it isn&#39;t. This is the Hanging Gardens of the Great Orbital Shrine Olympia.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Well, that was careless of me. The sunlight was so pleasant that I didn&#39;t even realize I had fallen asleep. I was dreaming about something I hadn&#39;t thought about in a long time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I feel very silly. I guess I just get too relaxed without Caenis around to keep me in line.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Anyway, thank you for waking me up<br> before I could waste any more time.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...You don&#39;t have to thank me. I only spoke<br> up &#39;cause it was weird seeing you like that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Weird? How so?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;re not exactly the sort of<br> guy to just doze off out in public.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> You&#39;re, like, perfectionism incarnate.<br> You don&#39;t get to take naps like a typical college slacker.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I see. While I do take some issue with the impression you seem to have of me...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I also understand now why it is you were so surprised. I&#39;ll be more careful in future.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now then, what is it you wished to see me about, Kadoc?<br> Do you have something to report to me?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Aw crap. I was so shocked seeing him sleeping like that I forgot I didn&#39;t actually have anything to tell him...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (And I can&#39;t just fib, or he&#39;ll know I&#39;ve been up to something... Wait, I&#39;ve got it.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They got Demeter.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> One of the great gods of Olympus, gone just like that.<br> Some perfect being she turned out to be.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, and one more thing.<br> A tan Lancer with white hair was helping them out.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Luckily, it looks like Europa didn&#39;t catch that part.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, how&#39;s it feel, Wodime?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> How&#39;s it feel knowing the loser you thought you&#39;d disposed of is not only alive, but actively working against you now?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That is a surprise. I never would have expected Caenis to go over to Chaldea&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And they managed to destroy Demeter&#39;s true form?<br> They must have been far better prepared than I thought.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So, a tiny rebel force managed to bring down a powerful authority figure. How very...rock &#39;n&#39; roll.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> No, wait. Heavy metal feels more appropriate,<br> given the composition of the gods&#39; bodies.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Uh... Am I going deaf or did you<br> just make a lame pun about music?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Apologies.<br> Perhaps I have not quite awakened yet.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> At any rate, I&#39;m surprised you knew<br> something even Queen Europa did not.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It almost sounds as though you were there watching things unfold in person, Kadoc. You must have found yourself a very good familiar indeed.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Well, you know, I can&#39;t just sit<br> around here mooching free grub forever.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m still a Crypter, after all, so I need to be<br> ready to fight again at least one more time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I see. Then make sure you take good care of that familiar. An ace up your sleeve can mean the difference between life and death, after all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Rest assured, you don&#39;t need to tell me, the other Crypters, or anyone else in Olympus, what yours is.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That said, if it should come to light that you<br> were using something you shouldn&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...then I will unfortunately be forced to respond in whatever way is appropriate. I have my own role to fulfill, after all.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ... (Shit. How much does he know...?<br> I&#39;d better change the subject, fast.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, uh, by the way, about Demeter...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Chaldea might&#39;ve been able to beat her, but it still<br> wasn&#39;t because they straight up overpowered her.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It looked to me like Demeter was looking for something... No, that&#39;s not right. Maybe trying to recover something.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> She kept apologizing, over and over.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And not to the Olympians she was killing,<br> but to one person in particular.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s the only reason they were able to destroy her.<br> Any idea what she was looking for?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I see. So that did hold her back,<br> as I suspected it might.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Just like in Proper Human History, this Lostbelt&#39;s Demeter once had a daughter she loved dearly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Her name was Persephone. It&#39;s said that Demeter wept long and hard after Hades stole her away to the underworld...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...yet despite that,<br> she never stopped loving her daughter.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But, a few thousand years ago,<br> her daughter died during the fourth machia.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hang on, Wodime. That doesn&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if she was a full god or a demigod or what, but I thought people didn&#39;t die in this city.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not necessarily.<br> Humans are simply incapable of killing other humans.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The immortality humans enjoy in this Lostbelt is not true immortality, but pseudo-immortality.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The gods can easily end their subjects&#39;<br> pseudo-immortal lives if they wish.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So the one who killed Persephone was\u2013</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> One of the gods? You mean, one of the<br> gods from the coexistence faction?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> No, it was not one of them.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Then...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Persephone sided with the coexistence faction,<br> so Zeus ordered Demeter to kill her own daughter.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...So, she was calling out to the daughter<br> she killed...as if she was still alive, huh.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Sounds almost human of her.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> These gods are machines, right? How can they function<br> properly when they&#39;re contradicting themselves like that?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I understand your confusion, but it is precisely their machine nature that means this was no contradiction at all.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Their minds don&#39;t work like ours, after all. That&#39;s the tragedy of the Twelve Olympian Machine Gods right there.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Whether gods create humans, or humans create gods, both sides usually share a common understanding of the world in which they live.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But the Olympians are different. They weren&#39;t gods to begin with. They only came to be defined that way over time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It was because their functions enabled them to control<br> the weather... Provide endless amounts of food...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Destroy various life-forms&#39; memories...<br> And mass-produce weapons...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That led to the residents of this<br> Lostbelt seeing them as gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> They then incorporated this definition into their<br> functions in order to operate more smoothly on this planet.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After all, the people of the ancient world wanted superior beings they could pray to, not cold, unfeeling spaceships.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And so, they accepted the new roles they had been given, and became mechanical gods instead of mere machines.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As a result, they ended up making this god play-acting into a new directive, all without ever understanding how the intelligent beings treating them as gods actually felt.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Cold and unfeeling, huh?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, is that why Demeter went nuts? Because she ended up with feelings tacked onto herself when she didn&#39;t need them?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This was less a matter of contradiction<br> than it was of conflict.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Humans can rationalize acts like that by telling<br> themselves there was nothing else they could have done...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...but she had no choice but to treat the order to<br> kill her own daughter like any other assigned task.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> She wasn&#39;t crazy. She was just in pain.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That&#39;s what it means to be a god in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s also why they were able to realize a real-life utopia, where nobody has to die or grow old.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...And here I thought machines<br> always operated on pure logic.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All right, if that&#39;s what the gods are like here,<br> then what&#39;s your game, Wodime?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Your goal is to bring about the Age of Gods again, right? Is that really the kind of god you wanna be?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course gods should run the world.<br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The future\u2013the answer I seek\u2013is a little different from Zeus&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What I seek, Kadoc, is an even more perfect age\u2013an age where there will be neither conflict nor contradiction.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It is my responsibility to see that age come about...<br> and, it is what the Foreign God wishes.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><h2 id="section-8-thou-art-the-ardor-that-corrupts-the-stars-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-thou-art-the-ardor-that-corrupts-the-stars-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: Thou Art the Ardor that Corrupts the Stars (I)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even as I gaze up at the sky...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I know nothing I see there<br> will ever excite me again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m not reminded of cheeky Artemis when I see the moon, nor do I think of aggravating Apollo when I see the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even the stars are just fixed points of light.

Teeheeheeheehee.<br> And what might you be, hmm?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You were wailing too loudly to be talking to yourself, and your voice was too irritatingly shrill to be the growling of an insipid beast.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Whichever it was, I don&#39;t want to hear another word, you Lycaon painted wolf. Remember, you are in the presence of a god, so you are to conduct yourself accordingly.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh my, I&#39;m so terribly sorry.<br> I do hope you can forgive me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Had I known there was a god here, and one prone to something so base as eavesdropping to boot, I&#39;d have spoken more softly.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, wait, I&#39;m sorry. Perhaps I have it all wrong. Perhaps you&#39;re simply distraught over losing one of your mechanical comrades?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> In that case, I really must apologize.<br> I would never want to offend a customer, after all.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I would understand perfectly if we were talking about one of the Twelve Olympians from Proper Human History who&#39;d already lost the Aletheia they received from Primordial Chaos...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But seeing how, here in this Lostbelt, you&#39;re all still completely static mechanical gods who never even heard of panta rhei...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, I simply never would have dreamed you&#39;d feel<br> anything in the way of pity for a fellow goddess...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...who was so careless as to let<br> mere humans get the better of her.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Well, well.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You ARE a funny one, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard a woman speak so defiantly towards me before. At least, not when they were aware I&#39;m the goddess of love and beauty.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You&#39;re one of the gods from a foreign land, right?<br> I can certainly see how well you fit in with Limbo.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> That&#39;s very kind of you to say.<br> But I&#39;m afraid I must correct you on one thing.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I may be an Alter Ego Servant...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...but I am not one of the<br> Foreign God&#39;s three Disciples.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Our arrangement is purely professional.<br> Our mutual interests just happen to align. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Oh, really? Then whose Servant are you?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Oh, right. Come to think of it, I think I&#39;ve heard about Servants who weren&#39;t summoned by anyone in particular.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Somebody once warned us that there were seven evil Spirit Origins that materialized on their own, without anything or anyone calling for them.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Hmm. I wonder who it was?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Rasputin, most likely.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> He does so enjoy giving out warnings that seem nonsensical at first but turn out to be surprisingly helpful in the end.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Still, that particular warning doesn&#39;t have<br> anything to do with me! Not yet, anyway!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Nor, I&#39;m sure, does the omen of a beast have<br> anything to do with you, O beautiful Venus.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Ahahahahahaha! Nice, very nice.<br> You really are funny, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> We&#39;ve never had anyone like you in Olympus before.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Like Limbo, you don&#39;t even try to hide your wicked nature...but you...you don&#39;t sneer just to sneer, hm?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I like you. What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Tamamo Vitch Koyanskaya.<br> But please, just call me Koyanskaya, Venus.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Very nice. I like the way you call me by<br> my other Proper Human History name too.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You know, I think you and I have a lot in common. Don&#39;t you think we could be at least something close to friends?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Close to friends? Absolutely.<br> But are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, word has it that the gods of Olympus<br> protect all humans fairly, you see.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Word also has it that you show extra favor to the Ancients\u2013the descendants of intelligent beings from a bygone continent.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Some even say that you, well, love them.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Oh, that.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> True, Demeter did like to talk about love this and love that, but I&#39;ve never gone in for that stuff with humans.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> After all, I only oversee love.<br> I don&#39;t engage in it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh my. I see you&#39;re just as beautiful on<br> the inside as you are on the outside.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> So you only oversee love without engaging in it, hmm? Hehehe. How very interesting...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Some gods in Proper Human History also liked to protect humans, while others liked to possess them, but I never heard of one who liked to keep humans as pets.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> While I can&#39;t say I share your particular tastes...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...I do have to agree that you and I both appreciate the finer points of cruelty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the Hanging Gardens.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t overhear your whole conversation, but it certainly sounded like you two were getting along swimmingly.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I take it you and Koyanskaya are<br> really hitting it off then?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Who asked you, Crypter? What business is it of yours who I do or do not get along with?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Anyway, never mind that.<br> There&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Me? You have a question for me?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Normally, I&#39;d be more than happy to expound at length about love...but I have a feeling my more modern sensibilities would be a tad too cruel for an ancient god like yourself.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Can I ask if you&#39;re, you know,<br> up-to-date on the latest beauty standards?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Up-to-date?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Why exactly would I need to update my standards?<br> I already AM beauty.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Beauty is my domain, so I and I alone decide what is beautiful in this world.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> All you humans need to do is comply with my aesthetics.<br> Do that, and you&#39;ll be happy and well.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...Spoken like a true god.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You make a good point.<br> Some gods are kind, while others are strict.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I guess you&#39;re your strict self today, huh? Not that I&#39;ve ever seen so much as a hint of your kind side.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Fortunately for you, I&#39;m curious enough to overlook your insolence. At least this time.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Remember? I said I had a question for you.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Tell me, human who calls himself Peperoncino:<br> How does it feel to have lost your Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Teehee. That IS what happened, isn&#39;t it? You lost<br> the entire ancient land of India, just like that!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t help but be curious about how impossibly<br> incompetent you must be to allow a miracle like that!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> You know, I was really looking forward to<br> invading the other Lostbelts with Zeus.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I wanted to kill the tsar of those humans who turned themselves into Demonic Beasts... I wanted to kill the goddess who kept those human breeding grounds running for thousands of years...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I wanted to utterly destroy that uppity<br> emperor who claimed to be a Zhenren...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> And I wanted to mash your head into paste, along with that insolent syncretic god who ate up all those other gods.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> But now... (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s destroyed them all before we<br> had the chance. It&#39;s SO disappointing.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. I have no one to blame for my loss but<br> myself. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t live up to your expectations.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Hmph. Here I thought you&#39;d either cower in fear or blow up in anger, but you didn&#39;t do either. You&#39;re no fun, Pepe.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s a fact, and you can&#39;t argue with facts. That<br> goes for both your godlike aspirations and my own failure.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But I suppose there is one thing I&#39;d like to say in response. To be clear, these are just my honest thoughts. There&#39;s no deeper motive here.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Well? What is it?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re not very attractive, are you? Your Proper Human<br> History mythological counterpart was much more charming.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I always knew of Aphrodite as the goddess of love and beauty, though as Zeus&#39;s daughter, she also acted as the god of death at times.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Her body was the Platonic ideal of the female form, and I also suspect that Ishtar, the Sumerian goddess of Venus, had some influence on her divine manifestation.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But in your case, at least as you are now, well...</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> ...Go on, Pepe. Tell me, how do I seem to you?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hmm. Speaking strictly personally...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always known Aphrodite to have two distinct sides<br> to her Divinity, but I can only see one side to you.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Never mind the rigmarole. Just spit it out already.<br> How do I seem to you, Pepe?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Well, unlike your Proper Human History self...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...you don&#39;t seem like you&#39;d<br> ever choose to marry Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> ...Is that so?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s not to say that certain aspects of you aren&#39;t just like your counterpart in Proper Human History, though.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Do you know about the Trojan War? The war fought<br> between Grecian allies and the kingdom of Troy?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> A war fought solely between humans? Who cares?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You were partially responsible for it, even in Proper<br> Human History. You won over Prince Paris of Troy and offered the Trojans your protection, along with Apollo and the other gods.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Ultimately, your actions led to a massive<br> war that brought all of Troy to ruin.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Your self from Proper Human History never<br> wanted things to turn out that way, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Well then, she&#39;s nothing like me at all.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I&#39;d never think twice about destroying a human<br> nation or two. In fact, I&#39;d enjoy it!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> And when I was done,<br> I&#39;d give the survivors a big smile.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> I&#39;d give them my condolences on the difficult time they endured, and encourage them to do better next time!</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Then I&#39;d tell them I&#39;d give them a reward<br> depending on how hard they worked.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> And when there was only one human left standing,<br> I&#39;d give them a genuine smile!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> No, no, no. This is all wrong...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> No way do you show up looking like...that!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Where am I?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Camelot? ...Avalon?<br> No, no!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> This is Olympus! It&#39;s gotta be!<br> You and I got no reason to fight!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Who is that!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Who&#39;s singing...in my freakin&#39; head!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Aah, ughhh...<br> Aaaaaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Fran? Is that you!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Easy there, girlie!<br> What&#39;s gotten into ya!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Mordred&#39;s our friend! Don&#39;tcha remember fighting<br> that giant mechanical Argos together!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ughhhhhh!<br> Aah, ah, aaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Kin...toki...! You are...Sakata Kintoki...right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hell yeah I am! Wait. You were just goin&#39; to town on her yourself, weren&#39;t ya!?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The hell&#39;s goin&#39; on!?<br> You two were doin&#39; fine just a little while ago!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We even finally got that Argos thing to stop regeneratin&#39; itself! All we had left to do was plant the goods!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss!<br> Boss Raikou!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kintoki...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Boss, I need your help!<br> We need to get these two to\u2013</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> It&#39;s too late, Kintoki. There&#39;s nothing we can do<br> for them now. We&#39;ve made a dreadful mistake.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> The Argos was nothing more than a decoy. We are little more than flies lured into the spider&#39;s web.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid...I won&#39;t be able to<br> control myself much longer, either.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> I was able to endure it a little<br> thanks to my Madness Enhancement...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> But very soon...<br> I won&#39;t be able to stop myself from killing you.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> So please, Kintoki. My dear child, please...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong><br> Kill me! Right now!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Don&#39;t even joke about that, Boss!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh... Ah... Aah...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ah... Aah... Aaaaaaaaah!<br> Wh-what&#39;ve I done...!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Dammit! ...Fran!<br> ...I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> .........</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh good, you&#39;re up.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Morning, Fujimaru.<br> You did great yesterday.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, uh, right. You&#39;re probably wondering<br> what I&#39;m doing in here, huh? Ahaha.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I did knock a few times, but you never answered,<br> so...I got worried.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No worries.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hehe. That&#39;s very kind of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s all good. Morning, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Good morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I guess you&#39;re still a little sleepy? Now that<br> I think of it, you always were hard to wake up.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But that&#39;s fine. You did just get through a battle with an honest-to-goodness god, after all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Not to mention you almost died.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I had a feeling that was the case.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...But I&#39;m okay now. I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You sure?<br> As a matter of fact...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mash was right by your side up until dawn.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> She insisted she was going to stay with you until<br> you woke up, but she was pretty worn out herself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So we all kind of ganged up on her to convince her to take a nap. It took a while, but eventually she agreed...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And now, here we are, with me checking in on you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Sorry if I woke you up.<br> I promise I didn&#39;t mean to.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to get up if you&#39;re not ready to, okay?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure your body&#39;s recovered by now, but if you still wanna rest a bit, you&#39;ve more than earned it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well then, I think I&#39;ll do just that...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Go for it. And in the meantime,<br> I&#39;ll tell you about what&#39;s going on outside!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What happened to the city after we beat Demeter?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...You really want to know?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I took a quick peek outside earlier, and it looked<br> like recovery operations were already underway.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Over half the populace had come back to life, and I didn&#39;t see anything in the way of dead bodies or blood splatters.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I think they said something about Zeus taking over<br> the harvest Authority now that Demeter is gone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> No wonder they call him almighty.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> As for Demeter&#39;s remains... Well, a whole buncha machines just showed up out of nowhere...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...disassembled her into her component parts,<br> and carried them all back to the big sky shrine.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It was a crazy sight, believe me. I wish you could&#39;ve seen it. The way things were going, I bet the whole district&#39;ll be good as new in a few days.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, that does sound amazing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It was. Fighting might be our only option in the Lostbelts, but that part was still incredible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...For the moment, I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s your reaction, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s true, we&#39;re lucky we got out of that with so few losses. Just don&#39;t push your luck too much, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, how tough was Demeter, huh!?<br> Talk about a worthy opponent!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> She totally would&#39;ve kicked our asses if we didn&#39;t have Caenis&#39;s fire bird going all FWOOOSH! Not to mention the alliance and Chaldea&#39;s secret weapons!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Me, on the other hand...<br> Well, I was kinda useless.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Guess I should&#39;ve known it wouldn&#39;t be easy<br> to cut through a hunk of metal that huge...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I only pulled it off in Russia &#39;cause I was suuuper focused. It&#39;s a whole different story when you&#39;re up against a solid mass of machinery...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...It just goes to show there&#39;s some things I can&#39;t cut even from the void. Honestly, it makes me wonder if there&#39;s anything an empty sword even CAN cut...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I can see the zero that lies beyond the void.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And I know that&#39;s my ultimate destination, whether it&#39;s Proper Human History Musashi or me, but still...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m still glad you were there, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ehehe. Reeeallyyy?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re here. I tend to<br> fall into bad habits real easily, as you know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I need someone like you who&#39;s got<br> their act together counting on me for help!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoops, sorry about that.<br> Guess that means it&#39;s time for breakfast!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Like they say, you can&#39;t wage war on an empty stomach,<br> and breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Plus, Mash ought to be waking up soon,<br> and I bet she&#39;ll be waiting in the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So come on, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you&#39;re up! Good morning!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You look so much better than you did yesterday...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You really are back to your old self again, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, thank goodness...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry to worry you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine now! And I&#39;m starving!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ahh, there you are, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm, yes, you look quite alert for<br> having just woken up. Very good.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fortunately, the Demi-Servant there has already<br> briefed me on your current situation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Congratulations on your recovery,<br> [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Interesting. It would seem the medical facilities<br> in this alliance base are truly exceptional.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While we do have healing Mystic Codes of our own,<br> they alone would not have been enough to save your life.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, Olympian technology deserves all of the credit for your continued survival.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I am, of course, kidding.<br> It&#39;s actually Proper Human History magecraft.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Specifically, healing spells designed for people from Proper Human History that the Alliance Heroic Spirits left behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So they really saved us in more ways than one then.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. If it had not been for both their Seven Link<br> Heroic Spirit Cannon, and their advanced healing spells...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...there is an excellent chance<br> we would not be here right now.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ahem. May I go on now?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s still the matter of you falling asleep at the beginning of our teleconference...but, under the circumstances, I&#39;m willing to overlook it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Excellent work yesterday. Now that Demeter is gone, we&#39;ve taken a significant step toward our goal.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Good morning. Breakfast is on the table.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I know you should be physically recovered now,<br> but you still need to eat to replenish your strength.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sorry for serving the same kind of food as yesterday.<br> Neither my sister nor I are much for cooking.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hey, speak for yourself, Macarios. I like cooking<br> just fine. I even took a course for it, remember?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, two thousand years ago...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Come on, Sister, you and I both know you haven&#39;t really cared about food for at least the last few hundred years.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And that line about needing to<br> eat to replenish your strength?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t said anything like that in at least<br> ten thousand years. Don&#39;t be silly, Sister.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Come on, Macarios. Not in front of our guests.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have breakfast later, thank you.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Director, Adele and Macarios are</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve been informed.<br> They&#39;re the two locals who have been helping you out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Apparently, they know who we are and what we&#39;re here to do and are willing to help us anyway, despite being native inhabitants of this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Not just willing, in fact. As I recall, they asked to help of their own accord, hard as that is to believe...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But, then again, perhaps I would feel similarly<br> if I had lived for as long as them.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Perhaps if I&#39;d studied magecraft to obtain a long life for myself, I might have had something better to say to them...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Adele and Macarios, are you<br> two truly certain about this?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If we succeed at cutting down the Tree of Emptiness,<br> then you two will... You know...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to worry about us, Director Goredolf.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, we&#39;re just as dedicated to the God Destroyer Alliance as anybody, and we know exactly what&#39;s at stake here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see. In that case, I have nothing more to say.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...So, you two are utopian humans<br> who never age a day, huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There may be significant differences in your life spans...but seeing how empty you seem to be, I can&#39;t help but be reminded of the homunculi&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s enough for now, Director.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-oh, right.<br> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now then, since you&#39;re only just joining us,<br> Fujimaru, let me fill you in on the Storm Border&#39;s status!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Captain Nemo is still recovering, and while my technical advisor technically still is, too\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, hey! Morning, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hey! Aren&#39;t you supposed to be recovering!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh come on, it&#39;s just a short talk!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So Fujimaru, are you getting enough sleep?<br> Did you have breakfast yet?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You might not be too hungry right now thanks to the load you put on your nervous system yesterday, so just take your time getting the nutrients you need.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You basically have to overload your<br> body in order to use the Black Barrel.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since you were connected directly to it when you loaded it with a Command Spell, the recoil must have been intense.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Believe me, I noticed...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s no surprise it took a hell of a lot out of you, seeing how it let you take down a god with one shot.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Command Spells might be incredible sources of compressed magical energy strong enough to control Heroic Spirit\u2013that is, Ghost Liner materialization...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but they&#39;re still not enough to fire the Black Barrel at full power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, you mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like I said right before you fired it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the Black Barrel places a much, much heavier<br> load on your body than a normal Command Spell.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And that&#39;s just for a single shot. Trying to fire it in rapid succession could very easily kill you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Firing consecutively, without giving yourself time to recover in between, has a high risk of inducing heart failure...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and it would also put Mash out of commission, since she&#39;s directly linked to the Ortinax when firing it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So basically, try to fire it more than once,<br> and you all die. Be careful with it.</p><p>Note: Branch Begin</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not sugarcoating this, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Got it. I&#39;ll do my best not to have to fire it more than once.</p><hr><p>Note: First Choice</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not sugarcoating this, huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I thought it&#39;d be better to just come right out<br> and say it instead of tiptoeing around it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But in retrospect, I should&#39;ve been a little more delicate. Again, I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I appreciate you being straight with us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Glad to hear it.</p><hr><p>Note: Second Choice</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Got it. I&#39;ll do my best not to have to fire it more than once.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good. The key takeaway here is mainly to be very,<br> very careful about when you use it.</p><hr><p>Note: Branch End</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Whoops, got a little dizzy there.<br> I can&#39;t believe I almost fell down over nothing.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Nothing, my foot!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I swear, do you even realize how hard you pushed<br> yourself putting the Black Barrel together?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And that&#39;s not even getting into how you were already worn out to begin with. Enough is enough, Technical Advisor. For the time being, you need to dedicate yourself solely to recovery, is that clear?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...&#39;Kaaay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci... I didn&#39;t realize you were<br> working yourself so hard to help us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please take it easy for a while, Da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even you need your rest, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, this is nothing compared to what you two are going<br> through on the front line. But, okay, I&#39;ll try to rest.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmph, you&#39;d better.<br> All right, that&#39;s enough from the technical advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now then, let&#39;s keep bringing each<br> other up to speed, shall we?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Er, Mash, this may be somewhat unseemly to ask,<br> but did you-know-who come in handy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m sorry, I actually don&#39;t<br> think I know what you mean.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh come now, sure you do! The terrifying helper I waited to send your way until the time was just right!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We may be enemies, but for now, you can trust Caenis. Just do your best to stay on good terms, so you can keep making good use of\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Good use of what?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I mean, er, good, useful steps toward recovery! That&#39;s it! A-at any rate, the, um, important thing is that you&#39;re all getting along!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh sure, we&#39;re getting along great. How&#39;s that saying go again? The closer you are with someone, the more you fight?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caenis!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I, um...<br> Good morning...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> M-morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bonjour.</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hey. Morning pleasantries, huh?<br> Kinda laid-back bunch, ain&#39;tcha?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We make it a point to make ourselves feel at home wherever we go. S-so, how are things with you, Caenis?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Little sluggish since I&#39;m low on magical energy, but I&#39;m okay otherwise. Better now we smashed Demeter&#39;s face in.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Good morning, Caenis.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So you were one of the Argonauts<br> in Proper Human History, huh.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I appreciate you helping us out against Demeter...<br> but does that mean you&#39;re going to join our alliance?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell do you think?<br> Hey.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yes? Do you need my seal<br> of approval or something?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hell no.<br> I&#39;m not here to be friends with any of you punks.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;m just here to help and to repay my debts.<br> Both to you punks, and to Kirschtaria.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But don&#39;t forget, dipshits,<br> this only lasts until my debt is paid.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Soon as it is, we&#39;re gonna right<br> back to killing each other!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fine with me. Welcome aboard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Glad to have you with us for as long as you&#39;re around, Caenis.</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Good.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Best of luck going up against those hunks of metal.<br> You&#39;re gonna need it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Interesting.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I was aware Fujimaru and Mash frequently<br> accomplished their goals with help from allies made<br> along the way, but I didn&#39;t know our new director<br> shared the same trait.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Alternatively, there may simply be something about<br> Chaldea that naturally attracts people of that temperament.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hah! As much as I enjoy the flattery, Administrative Advisor, be warned that it won&#39;t affect your bonus!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now, where was I...<br> Oh, yes. The Black Barrel.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Just because you&#39;ve had that Conceptual Weapon fitted to the Ortinax, Mash, doesn&#39;t mean you should use it lightly.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Remember, you still ultimately need<br> Fujimaru&#39;s Command Spells to fire it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And since you already used one in<br> your battle against Demeter...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...that means you can only fire the Black<br> Barrel two more times. Remember that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Only two more times, huh?<br> ...That&#39;s not very many at all.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Indeed, it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And don&#39;t forget, we can&#39;t replenish your Command Spells anymore, even if you&#39;re able to make it back to the Border.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The only way you&#39;ll be able to restore them is to return to Chaldea Base and connect yourself to a few Magical Reactors, as usual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ah yes, speaking of which, what is the Storm Border&#39;s<br> status? Are you still completely defenseless?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Funny you should ask, since you&#39;re the one who left us high and dry in the first place!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Yes, needless to say, we&#39;re still very much completely defenseless. I wish you could send us a Heroic Spirit to help us out, but I know that&#39;s just not possible right now.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So in the meantime, we&#39;ll be here laying low<br> as we wait and hope that your plan succeeds.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m sure Captain will wake up soon, and when he does, I can ask him to defend the Border to the best of his ability\u2013without exacerbating his condition, of course.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Rest assured, I&#39;m prepared to bargain with as many soft, buttery croissants as necessary.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Something on your mind, Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I was just thinking about how we could get you guys<br> back to your ship if you needed to go there...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You said you made an emergency landing<br> in the western frontier zone, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Is that what you call this area?<br> At any rate, yes, that sounds right.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Gotcha. Never mind, then.<br> There&#39;s no safe way to get there.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sorry for getting your hopes up.<br> Just forget I said anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;s no safe way to get to the frontier zone,but is there one for other zones?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that mean there&#39;s a safe way to get to the other zones?</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, there is.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We can use the underground infrastructure. It won&#39;t let<br> us go everywhere, but it can get us to a lot of places.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm, I see. I&#39;ll have to remember that.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Hey, Mustache.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If you only need to move one person around,<br> I can take &#39;em myself.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Having Authority over the sea means I&#39;ve also got the power to navigate it. Basically means I can cross any border, Lostbelt or not.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But hey, it&#39;s up to you. &#39;Sides, I&#39;m not gonna lie;<br> it can be a rough way to travel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Authority to cross borders...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So it was Poseidon&#39;s gift that let<br> you move freely between Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Do. Not.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Say.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That. Name.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ah yes, I do beg your pardon. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m one of those sorts who must think out loud to put their thoughts in order, you see.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I don&#39;t give a shit why you do it.<br> Say it again, and I&#39;ll kill you then and there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Duly noted.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> E-er, may I say something now? Is it safe to assume we&#39;re all just about up to speed now?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Although...<br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I never thought every Heroic Spirit who got<br> here before us would already be gone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But hey, at least you met up with me!<br> Don&#39;t worry, I got this!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> How!? There&#39;s only one of you!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-then again, I suppose Miyamoto Musashi is an extremely powerful Heroic Spirit. Plus, we have Caenis on our side too!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The Black Barrel&#39;s destructive force is truly remarkable, and we also have local allies providing us with safe haven.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Looking at everything we have going for us,<br> I know I should be happy...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...But, I still can&#39;t get over it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The instant we kill Demeter, Zeus just swoops in and takes over her Authority like it&#39;s no big deal!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And not only that, he&#39;s already got the South District back on its feet, even after it was completely destroyed only yesterday! How can he be so damn omnipotent!?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Ah c&#39;mon, General Gof, cheer up!<br> These guys are as golden as golden gets!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> We might&#39;ve tried to slay the gods,<br> but they actually pulled it off!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> &#39;Zactly! You oughta be throwin&#39; your hands up in the<br> air cheering, not starin&#39; at the ground and shit!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Ugh, aah!</p><p><strong>M\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Allow us to introduce ourselves again, Director of Chaldea. We are the God Destroyer Alliance\u2013or rather, the A.I. built from its remains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kintoki! Mordred!<br> You&#39;re here too, Fran and Raikou!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ah... Aah...<br> Aaaaaah...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So all these powerful Heroic Spirits working together<br> still weren&#39;t enough to defeat the gods of Olympus...!</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Uhhh...</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Uh, aah.<br> Aaah.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Aah, aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Eep!</p><p><strong>K\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> All right, which one of you assfaces installed a Fran<br> persona!? How&#39;re we gonna tell &#39;em everything we need to tell &#39;em like this!?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Hahahaha! There&#39;s certainly never a dull moment with the second squad around! All right, I think this Nikola Tesla persona had best take it from here.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Tesla wasn&#39;t exactly a wallflower himself, you know...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Just let it go, Macarios. We&#39;ll never get anything done<br> if we point out every little thing like that...</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> I never imagined we would get new reinforcements and weaponry at this point in the game. It seems things are looking up for the Alliance!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Now then, let us resume Operation<br> God Destroyer in earnest!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Let me be clear: this is not a plan for defeating the individual machine gods. This is a plan to bring down THE god: the omnipotent Zeus himself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you really have a plan to defeat Zeus!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fo, fooou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! I&#39;ve been waiting to hear how us Chaldeans are going to take the fight to an omnipotent god!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This is so much fun, don&#39;t you think, Caenis!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Why&#39;re you dragging me into this?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think fun even enters into the equation while I&#39;m stuck with you morons? We&#39;re not friends, dipshits.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now, now, don&#39;t be like that. Ours may be a business relationship, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact we&#39;ll still be fighting together!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, don&#39;t you love throwing caution to the<br> wind and fighting battles against impossible odds?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think I&#39;m the same kinda headcase as you, bitch? I don&#39;t hate impossible odds, but I&#39;m not a freakin&#39; fan either!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> My fun&#39;s in absolutely crushing my enemies!<br> I got no interest in a fight I know I can&#39;t win!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh reeeallyyy.<br> Then why&#39;d you come over to our side, hmmm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m betting you actually love fighting against impossible odds just as much as you love completely demolishing your enemies!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I totally get it!<br> I&#39;m exactly the same way!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I just say I&#39;m not a freakin&#39; headcase like you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ahem. If you two would be so kind as to bond over<br> your shared lust for battle at a later time...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A.I., may I ask exactly what it is you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As I recall, the Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon was a onetime only option. Are you saying you have something else on hand that can bring down a god?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, I think I had a dream about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I remember hearing something about a summoning circle?</p><hr><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Golden! That&#39;s it exactly, Boss!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Our last option for taking<br> down granddaddy Zeus himself...</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...is to use a great summoning circle to summon<br> a major VIP ally of Proper Human History!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A great summoning circle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you mean a spell designed<br> to summon a Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one! Though it&#39;s gonna be a little different<br> from the Chaldea-style summoning you might be used to.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Now, lemme tell you how you&#39;re gonna go about summonin&#39; this VIP! A whole bunch of Heroic Spirits from all walks of life put their heads together to come up with a foolproof, timeless method!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> See, chain reaction summons happen pretty easily in Lostbelts and Singularities, so we figured all we needed to do was give that process a nudge in the right direction.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The result is the great summoning circle<br> I&#39;m about to tell ya about! We call it:</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The God Destroyer Grand-Class Designation Summon!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> This right here&#39;s our ace in the hole!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> A Grand Servant!?<br> Are you freaking serious!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know shit about magecraft, and even<br> I know a Grand Servant&#39;s a big freaking deal!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Grand Servant... The kind of unbelievably powerful Heroic Spirit that&#39;s usually only summoned by the true Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual the Holy Grail War is based on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve certainly encountered them before, like with Orion and the First Hassan, but even so...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. We&#39;ve never summoned one on our own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Damn, way to go, God Destroyer Alliance!</p><hr><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Ahahaha! Right!? Super golden, right!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. So your plan is to summon a Grand Servant here to Olympus, like how Orion was summoned to Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But then...does that mean the conditions to<br> summon a Grand Servant are in place...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo, fooou?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> So cool!

So there was yet another powerful Heroic Spirit here at one time...</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> The electric professor, lionhead professor, and Blavatsky designed the Article, and the Collaborator built it.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> As for the great summoning circle...last we heard,<br> its components are still being set up in each area.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Unfortunately, the machine gods defeated us before we could see the operation through to the end, so we are trusting all of you to do so in our stead.</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Destroy the gods and save humanity.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> There are seven summoning circles that make up the great summoning circle, and the Heroic Spirits managed to set up four of them.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Which still leaves three to go...</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> We can no longer help slay the<br> gods ourselves, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> We ended up falling to the mechanical gods before the<br> great summoning circle and Article were complete.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> But now, there are heroes gathered here once again,<br> and only three summoning circles left to go!</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> That sounds to me like a mission worth risking one&#39;s life over, no?</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Hm? What do you think?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! So he&#39;s all but admitting this could end up killing us,<br> huh? I don&#39;t know who that is, but at least he&#39;s honest!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I say, am I the only one who finds the idea of an A.I. actively assigning us a dangerous mission somewhat unsettling?</p><p><strong>P\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Oh, for... Stop that, Mr. Tesla! You should know by now that not everyone&#39;s so eager to push themselves to their limits!</p><p><strong>P\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry if we didn&#39;t convey it well, but we&#39;re not<br> trying to give orders. We&#39;re only providing information.</p><p><strong>P\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Whether you act on it or not is up to you guys.</p><p><strong>Q\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> While we&#39;re on the subject, here is where the<br> remaining summoning circles need to be set up!</p><p><strong>Q\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> This is Olympus&#39;s East District, and these three points of light are where the last summoning circles need to go.</p><p><strong>Q\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> These other four points of light are the<br> ones we already finished setting up.</p><p><strong>N\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> As of now, neither the machine gods, nor the people of Olympus, have noticed the existing summoning circles.</p><p><strong>P\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> They&#39;d better not, after all the trouble we went to<br> to hide them. Not to mention the Collaborator...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Collaborator...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I see. So this Operation God Destroyer was<br> forced to be suspended partway through.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then I suppose this is no time for half measures. We of Chaldea will pick up where the Alliance left off!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And I&#39;m saying that in front of everyone here,<br> Heroic Spirits included! Even you, Caenis!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Caenis, would you continue to aid us!?<br> Please! We still need your help!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Shut up. You think I don&#39;t know that?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way you three Chaldea Servants<br> alone could possibly take down the gods.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> R-right. Good!<br> N-now then... Ahem! Ahem!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We&#39;ve decided our next course of action: we will complete the great summoning circle, thereby preparing for our showdown with the King of the Gods!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That means we&#39;ll need to make our way to Olympus&#39;s East District. I will disguise your Command Spells, so the locals are none the wiser.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So this&#39;ll be a covert mission, huh.<br> Good luck, Mash and Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I just tell you to get some rest, Technical Advisor!? Fine, fine. Take a moment to say goodbye, but that&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> After this, I want you going straight back into sleep<br> mode, no ifs, ands, or buts!

What do you want to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just stick with moving the whole base.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s not even bother with walking.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Good call.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Besides, Sister and I wouldn&#39;t even be able to contact<br> you in the East District if we stayed here.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Anyway, it shouldn&#39;t take us long to get there at this<br> rate. Just be careful you don&#39;t lose your footing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man... I never would&#39;ve even thought<br> to try moving this entire place!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It sounds like it&#39;s old hat to you guys,<br> but Olympian tech is pretty amazing to me.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s Atlantis, not Olympus.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Atlantean, I mean. At least, that&#39;s<br> what I&#39;ve heard; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They say our ancestors originally came to Olympus from the continent of Atlantis about ten thousand odd years ago.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s also why we think the second machia may<br> have played a part in Atlantis&#39;s destruction.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we don&#39;t know anything for sure, as all<br> the records pertaining to that time were lost long ago.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou, faaaaaau!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The continent of Atlantis?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s right. It&#39;s believed to be a continent<br> that once existed in the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of Proper Human History&#39;s<br> most well-known legends.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As in, the mythical continent?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. The continent of Atlantis is one<br> of Proper Human History&#39;s most well-known legends.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was once a prosperous empire rich in natural resources, but over time, its people lost all respect for the gods and the rule of law...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...so the gods punished them by flooding the entire<br> empire and sinking the continent into the sea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s how the ancient Greek philosopher Plato described it in his two dialogues, Timaeus and Critias.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of many flooding legends that have been passed down through different civilizations, like Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The flooding of Atlantis is said to have taken place some time around 9000 B.C., but\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But the theory of continental drift claims otherwise.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we assume that all our current continents were originally a single giant landmass, then there&#39;s no place where a mythical lost continent could fit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...At least, that was the operating theory as of a hundred years or so ago. That said, I doubt the discovery of plate tectonics has done much to advance Atlantis&#39;s cause.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Furthermore, given that there have been exactly zero discoveries of any Atlantean artifacts, the sole historical record we have for its existence is Plato&#39;s writings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, that still leaves one question unanswered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right.<br> What if the continent of Atlantis really did exist...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but in a way that was completely unlike<br> any other continent we know about?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can&#39;t deny it&#39;s a possibility.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Especially now that we know it is possible for something<br> to exist without leaving behind a single trace.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Namely, the realm of Mystics.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And that&#39;s not all. There&#39;s also the very act<br> of using magecraft to materialize a Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the existence of most things can be proven with physical evidence and written records, the same cannot be said of Mystics.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. If what Adele and Macarius told<br> us about the mechanical gods is true...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The gods of Olympus could have arrived on the continent of Atlantis long ago, thereby bringing civilization to prehistoric peoples.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though of course, in that case, those events would be more akin to the work of Jules Verne than they would Plato&#39;s Timaeus and Critias.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Good grief. I can practically see Sir Doyle&#39;s face grinning in delight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the prestigious author<br> who immortalized your exploits in novel form!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve read every book he ever published!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve seen the movie versions!<br> Well, at least all the ones you&#39;re in, Holmes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I still remember the first time I saw the<br> Granada version like it was yesterday...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow, Mash, you&#39;re practically glowing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to get carried away.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s fun to gush about something you love, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, it is. Thank you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. You&#39;re too kind, Ms. Kyrielight. I only hope I get a chance to tell Sir Doyle what dedicated fans he has.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, back to the subject of Atlantis...<br> This has been a most fascinating discussion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Depending on when this Lostbelt first came about, this could mean that the mythical continent of Atlantis truly did exist on our Earth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If the same were true in Proper Human History...there would surely still be some trace of physical evidence pertaining to the continent&#39;s sinking.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, such an event would have affected the topography of the entire planet. No doubt someone would also have discovered something along paleomagnetic lines as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And yet, in Proper Human History, there is not one piece of evidence that the continent of Atlantis ever existed.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...No evidence of the continent&#39;s existence, hmm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Haha, by Jove, that&#39;s it! It may not be a proverbial<br> smoking gun, but we&#39;ve got collateral evidence right here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ah yes, I beg your pardon. This is still only a hypothesis, but I do believe I&#39;ve solved the riddle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we assume that the legendary continent of Atlantis<br> truly did exist in Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...then we can now say with a fair degree of certainty<br> what it truly was. It&#39;s really no great mystery at all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Take a look around.<br> Where are we standing right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> On a floor...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed we are.<br> But what is that floor a part of?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, right! Olympus!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Precisely.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As you all know, we are currently standing on a small<br> part of the Interstellar Mountainous City of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And what, pray tell, is the<br> nature of Olympus&#39;s existence?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh! I get it now! Olympus isn&#39;t a natural landmass.<br> It&#39;s a mysterious, enormous, artificial structure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s essentially a virtual continent built inside a supernatural hollow space, and with advanced technology well beyond the scope of Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Right you are, Ms. Kyrielight. Granted, this is a most preliminary theory that may well change as more information comes to light. Nonetheless...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahahaha, I must say, I never dreamed this adventure of ours would involve me deducing the existence of Atlantis!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ohhh, nooow I get it! Mostly!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Basically, Olympus and Atlantis are both pretty impressive, yeah? Totally got it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, mostly. I mostly got it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I definitely, absolutely, mostly totally got it.<br> ...Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you say so, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Somehow, I&#39;m still not convinced you really get it, Musashi.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> By the way, Adele and Macarios,<br> there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s about the underground infrastructure<br> we&#39;re using for transport as we speak.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Sure. What is it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You said this whole underground area was safe &#39;cause<br> it used to be Hades&#39;s domain or something, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I was just curious what the full story there was. Hades is one of the gods who was killed in the fourth machia, right?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> All the gods who fought for coexistence between human and god were defeated and destroyed during the Olympia Machia...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...and Hades was one of them.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> After the war, Zeus ended up taking over<br> the domains of every god they defeated.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That, along with enslaving Poseidon, gave him full control over the entire sea of Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...but it was a different story for Olympus&#39;s<br> underground infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hades decided to take his own life...and the resulting<br> explosion sealed off his underground domain.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thanks to that, the underworld became a dark<br> zone that nobody could easily touch.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Nobody except those who were allied with Hades and the faction fighting for coexistence.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now I gotcha. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I always found it strange how an all-powerful god like<br> Zeus knows everything that happens on the surface...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but can&#39;t seem to do anything when<br> it comes to this underground area.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty much down to luck<br> that things worked out this way.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> As ships, Hades and Zeus were both<br> based off of the Titan Cronus.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> As gods, that put them in the same class of deity.<br> So even when Zeus became omnipotent\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> He&#39;d still need to allocate almost all of his power<br> to see everything going on in the dark zone.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And right now, Zeus is using most of his magical energy to keep Olympus and Tree of Emptiness Magellan up and running.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then...you&#39;re saying that is a weakness<br> we can take advantage of?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> We believe that&#39;s where our hopes for victory lie.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh. Everything just shook again.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Nn...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> (Yawwwn)... Damn, I must&#39;ve fallen asleep.<br> We there already?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, the base is done moving along the underground.<br> Let&#39;s go up to the surface.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be going with you this time,<br> since this is a covert mission.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Eek! F-Fou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Ah! There you go again! Didn&#39;t I tell you not<br> to jump on my sister, you big squirrel!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mmm. A cute boy, a cute girl, and a cute<br> animal, all together. You love to see it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...That thing&#39;s not really a squirrel, right?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, try not to get yourselves killed out there.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m gonna play pretend, so you guys can knock yourselves out acting like the idiots you are.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;ll hang around in my spirit form in the meantime,<br> and pop out if things turn violent.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... What do you mean by play pretend?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh, yes. It means you need to be careful about your choice of words on the surface, or Zeus&#39;s scans will catch you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah, you said something about that back when we fought Demeter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why we need to watch what we say up there?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Now then, we need to get our cover story straight.<br> Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Okay, I think I&#39;ve got it.<br> Fujimaru, Mash, Musashi...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You three will be our distant relatives<br> from the very edge of the South District.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> As for you, Holmes... Um...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No need to worry about me.<br> I&#39;ll stay close by in my spirit form as well.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ooh, I call the oldest sister role! Hehehehe, I always<br> wanted a couple of cute siblings of my own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess you&#39;ll be my other big sister then, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you mean, you want me to be the middle child!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, um... I was kind of hoping I<br> could be the youngest child...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and you could be my big [\u2642 brother /\u2640\uFE0F sister], Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go with that then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Phew.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You got it, little sister.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I presume there&#39;s a risk our conversations may be<br> eavesdropped upon on the surface, Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Basically. You catch on quick, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It has been said.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s not really eavesdropping, though. It&#39;s more like<br> he&#39;s openly listening to everything anyone says.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They say it&#39;s because Zeus himself watches over<br> everything we humans do. That he&#39;s protecting us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So you live in a state of constant surveillance.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Zeus might be able to see everything that happens aboveground, but he can&#39;t actually tell individual people apart.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s just like how we humans can&#39;t tell individual ants apart. Or, well, that&#39;s about how I think it works.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh? Fascinating</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would certainly seem to lend credence to the A.I.&#39;s belief that Zeus is exceptionally powerful, but not truly omnipotent.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> However, his hearing&#39;s a different story. He listens to every single conversation people have on the surface.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...You mean he&#39;s able to meaningfully hear and comprehend the utterances of ten million people down to the sentence simultaneously?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can scarcely imagine what such immense data processing capabilities must be like. Small wonder he had so little difficulty traveling the universe.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Such incredible multipurpose functionality would certainly make him appear omnipotent, even if he is not truly so.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Well, he&#39;s not a god for nothing.<br> Not to mention, this is Zeus we&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> He does a bunch of things that&#39;d be<br> impossible for humans to pull off.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Most impressive. It sounds as though he&#39;s essentially<br> Olympus&#39;s one-god ECHELON program.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;ve heard of that! That was a kind of super<br> surveillance system a few countries colluded on, right?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha. No, Ms. Miyamoto, ECHELON was never anything more than an urban legend. It&#39;s no different than the purported devil at the crossroads, or a serial killer hiding under your bed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then again, perhaps the devil at the crossroads is more of a Mystic than ECHELON? Well, no matter. It&#39;s still the same broad category.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But the same is not true for Zeus. His surveillance mechanisms and control devices are unabashedly present in all aspects of life here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I took Olympus for a utopia, but in fact, the control its government wields over its people is far greater than any we&#39;ve yet seen in a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No wonder the division between the coexistence and ruling factions was so great that it led to a full-blown machia.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re starting to understand<br> what things are like here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, think we can get going now?<br> Oh good.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s get this great summoning circle<br> operation underway! Everybody ready?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Seeing how those soldiers we ran into last time<br> all looked like they came from the East District...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll be in for an especially rough<br> time around here, so let&#39;s be ready for that.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thank you, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But we were actually hoping to stop by our house before<br> we begin the operation in earnest, if that&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You have a house here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You two used to live here?</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh, um, actually...<br> We forgot something there and we need to get it.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yes, we have to postpone the start of this mission.<br> I&#39;m sorry. We should&#39;ve told you sooner.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ugh, seriously? Screw that noise. I&#39;m takin&#39; a nap. Wake me up when you finish whatever stupid crap you&#39;re going to do.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So you&#39;re going to camp out here just like that!?<br> Then again, I guess I&#39;m not one to talk.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What are you, stupid? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s dangerous<br> for a woman to camp out by herself?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ahaha, really?<br> You&#39;re really going to lecture me on that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Adele?<br> Can I ask what it is you forgot at your house?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s something we&#39;re all going to need.<br> The last time we used it...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...we messed up the timing,<br> and our whole squad got wiped out...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your entire squad...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay. Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No problem. Let&#39;s start by getting this thing you forgot.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is Olympus&#39;s East District...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are so many statues as big as skyscrapers here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And the city itself is so elaborately designed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yet it&#39;s also filled with a real gentle<br> sense of beauty everywhere I look...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Well you&#39;re going to see giant statues in the art district. Hehe, is this your first time coming to this part of town?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...Oh, right!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I have to assume that our old backstory about<br> being from the countryside won&#39;t work anymore.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, no, of course not. But it has been long enough<br> that I couldn&#39;t help but get a little worked up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> True, they really are impressive statues.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s always impressive to see them again after a long absence.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof. Fou. Woof. (Special Translation: Don&#39;t mind me.<br> Just your ordinary, everyday doggo here.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who&#39;s a good boy, Plato?<br> Yes, you are. Yes, you are.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof, woof!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Good. It doesn&#39;t look like anyone is paying<br> Senpai and me any special notice.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Da Vinci&#39;s disguise kits must<br> still be working as intended.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It seems like they&#39;re affecting Musashi too,<br> just like we hoped. So far, so good.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a long time since you&#39;ve been here too,<br> hasn&#39;t it, Plato? Come on, who&#39;s a good boy?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey! What&#39;s with the cold shoulder!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Come on, enough playing around.<br> Our home sweet home isn&#39;t much farther from here.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we head back to the house and take a breather before we look around the city? You guys could use one after all the hard work you&#39;ve been doing.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Plus, I think Sister here has been looking<br> forward to cooking something for you.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Can&#39;t say I&#39;m especially looking<br> forward to it myself, but...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Okay, okay, I want to have your cooking for<br> the first time in a long time, too. Happy now?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I swear, a few hundred years without cooking anything,<br> and now you can&#39;t wait to get in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Well of course. You know we haven&#39;t seen our distant<br> relatives in forever. We have to make them feel welcome.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Right?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Uuu, fowow!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aah! What&#39;s gotten into you, Plato? I was just watching a couple of beautiful people doing a little back and forth.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Frrrrrr...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Stop that, Plato.<br> You know it&#39;s rude to growl in public.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong></p><p>Hey! It&#39;s Macarios!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong></p><p>Look, Adele&#39;s here, too!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Hey, yeah! They&#39;re both back!<br> Oh man, it&#39;s been so long!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Ooh, they&#39;ve even got a dog with them! At least,<br> I think that&#39;s a dog, right? It&#39;s so cute!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Frrrrrr...</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Where&#39;ve you guys been all this time? Oh, yeah,<br> you&#39;re traveling all around Olympus now, right?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> I think you went to the South District last, yeah?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> It looked like things were pretty bad down there.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Are you two okay? Did you get caught in the cross fire?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;re fine, thank you. But it was scary<br> seeing the city there in such disarray.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...You guys been doing okay while we&#39;ve been away?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Oh yeah! We&#39;ve been having ambrosia<br> every day, so we&#39;re doing great!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> How about you two? Have you been okay?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, we&#39;re fine, thanks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (So this ambrosia is still being distributed,<br> even now that Demeter is gone...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Does this mean Zeus has taken over Demeter&#39;s role, even while he&#39;s still pouring magical energy into Olympus and the Tree of Emptiness?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Just how much magical energy<br> does he actually possess?)</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> So did you guys see the Chaldeans while you were in the South District?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> They&#39;re demons who want to destroy our world, right?<br> Did they look really scary?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Beats me. We never saw them, so we have no idea.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> They say one of them&#39;s got a demonic,<br> bloodred mark on [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] right hand!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (We disguised Senpai&#39;s Command Spells too<br> this time, so we should be okay. I think...)</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> So who are these people? Are they your friends?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Are you guys from the south?<br> Did you see the Chaldeans, [\u2642 guy with the black hair /\u2640\uFE0F lady with the red hair]?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nope, I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Aww.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe I did, maybe I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Whoa, really!? You saw them!?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Oh, wait. Maybe you didn&#39;t see them? Which is it!?</p><hr><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> ...Hey, those Chaldeans aren&#39;t gonna come here, right?<br> I don&#39;t want all of us to die.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> I hate them.<br> I wish there were no such thing as bad people.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Me too.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> But it&#39;s okay! We&#39;ll be fine!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Even if they do show up here,<br> our dad&#39;ll take care of &#39;em!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> &#39;Cause you know what?<br> Our dad&#39;s a soldier! Pretty cool, right!</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Stupid Chaldeans. I hope Dad kills them all.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Yeah! They should just die and leave us alone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re unbelievable, that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> It&#39;s really scary knowing they&#39;re out there, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Stupid, evil, scary Chaldeans...</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> They should all just die and leave us alone!<br> Queen Europa said so, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I don&#39;t know if I agree with that.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> But Chaldeans do bad things.<br> That makes them bad guys, right?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Queen Europa even said so in her address.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> And if they&#39;re bad guys, then they<br> should definitely die. Simple as that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> See, I think \u201Cthey&#39;re bad, so they should die\u201D<br> might be a little too simplistic.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> If nothing else, I think it&#39;d be good for us<br> to find out why they are the way they are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Like, are they really destroying the world?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Are they really so evil that they deserve to die?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Who knows? Maybe they&#39;ve got their own good<br> reasons for doing what they&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Maybe there&#39;s some larger truth driving their<br> actions that we have to come to terms with.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...maybe they don&#39;t want to be here taking on Olympus, but they are anyway because they think it&#39;s the right thing to do.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s worth your while to imagine things like that, you<br> know? Especially since it doesn&#39;t cost you anything\u2606</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Nnn...</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> That&#39;s pretty tough...</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> If that was the case...I don&#39;t<br> know how I&#39;d feel about it.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Yeah. Me neither.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> ...But wait, hang on.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> It&#39;s still bad to do bad things, even if<br> you&#39;ve got a reason for doing them, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s true. You&#39;re not wrong there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But don&#39;t forget: there&#39;s nobody in the<br> whole world who never makes any mistakes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> People can&#39;t always make all the right choices. Sometimes, to stop evil, you have to let go of being good a bit.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And when you do,<br> the important thing is to be honest with yourself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You can&#39;t just rationalize your actions away by<br> telling yourself you had no other choice...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...or that what you&#39;re doing is somehow right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I know if I was up against someone who was under no illusions that they were doing something wrong for what they sincerely believed were the right reasons, I wouldn&#39;t want to kill them just because they were \u201Cbad.\u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;d want to know why they made a choice like<br> that\u2013what motivated them to do it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And while I was at it... I&#39;d want other people to know how they felt, too. At least, that&#39;s what I think. What about you two?</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Musashi...)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Is that why\u2013)</p><hr><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Ah! That&#39;s our alarm.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Sorry. We have to go home now.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Bye!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> See you later.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Later.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Goodbye.</p><p><strong>East District Children:</strong><br> Byyye!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...What was that all about? Why were you<br> getting so worked up over a couple of kids?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> What do you mean, kids?<br> Aren&#39;t they, like, ten thousand years old?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Heh, guess you got me there.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof! Woof!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Settle down, you.<br> Come on, let&#39;s go already.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> If those kids&#39; curfew alarms are any indication,<br> it&#39;ll probably be sunset soon.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> See that residential tower next<br> to the statue of Aphrodite?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios and I live there,<br> in apartment 5203 on the fifty-second floor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It&#39;s so spacious!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Does this mean they&#39;re upper class? No, wait. The whole concept of a monetary economy doesn&#39;t exist here.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (And since they also have nothing in the way of jobs or professions, I don&#39;t see how they could have class-based distinctions like \u201Ccommoner\u201D or \u201Caristocrat,\u201D either...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s so big!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you two have all this space all to yourselves?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This place is pretty average. People who really care about the size of their homes might choose somewhere bigger...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...but this is usually the kind of apartment you<br> get unless you have a big family or something.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Please, have a seat and make yourselves at home.<br> I&#39;ll go get us some juice.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> &#39;Kaaay.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (There! He just snapped his fingers!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (That&#39;s the sign we agreed on to let Holmes know<br> it was okay to come out of his spirit form.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (The Olympians might have found his outfit strange...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...but Zeus shouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I do beg your pardon for the intrusion.<br> I hope my footsteps weren&#39;t too loud?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, nobody&#39;ll notice footsteps. Just don&#39;t break into song or anything; our neighbors aren&#39;t too fond of that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I see. If Zeus were also monitoring the number of people making footsteps in a given room, he would notice something was strange when that number suddenly increased out of nowhere.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (But if I&#39;m understanding this right,<br> it looks like footsteps are beneath his notice...)</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Here you go.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not freshly squeezed,<br> but it&#39;s still nice and cold.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you, Adele. Most kind of you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mind if I do!<br> (Glug, glug, glug...) Ahh, that hit the spot!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, yes, don&#39;t worry, Plato.<br> I&#39;ve got a shallow bowl of juice for you, too.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Wouf!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yummy! The sweetness doesn&#39;t overstay its welcome,<br> and it&#39;s got just the right amount of tartness.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hehe. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not at all. Thank you for the lovely drink.<br> I won&#39;t soon forget this flavor, I assure you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, before we go over whatever it is you two forgot, I need to ask you a more personal question.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Tell me, Adele and Macarios,<br> may I ask where the rest of your family is?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...They died in the Olympia Machia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Killed?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah. Our mom and dad supported Athena and Ares, so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry we brought up such a painful subject.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to talk about it if you don&#39;t want to.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Relax, it&#39;s fine.<br> This was thousands of years ago, remember!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And besides, it&#39;s not like our family&#39;s all gone!<br> We still have you guys!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing taboo about discussing the machia.<br> It&#39;s basically like extolling the gods&#39; victories.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Besides, Sister and I weren&#39;t part of the<br> coexistence faction, like Mom and Dad were.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s lying.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He and Adele were both part of the coexistence<br> faction during the fourth machia.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (But he&#39;s assuming Zeus is listening in, and being careful not to say anything that would arouse suspicion.)</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Ugh, guys certainly do love talking<br> about the machia, don&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s getting late, so we should probably have<br> dinner soon. You&#39;ll help me, right, Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll help too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll help by playing with Plato!<br> Here, boy! Come on, boy!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Grrrrrr.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aww, come on. Why&#39;re you growling at me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all help them make dinner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t help, you don&#39;t eat, Big Sister.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ahaha, I should&#39;ve seen that one coming.<br> Okay, I&#39;m in. Besides, it looks like fun!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thank you, everyone. Hehe, I can tell this is going to be the most fun we&#39;ve had at dinner in a long time!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for the wonderful meal!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was so incredibly delicious...<br> I still can&#39;t quite believe just how good it was!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It tasted completely different from<br> the kind of food I&#39;m used to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I especially loved the, um, fish\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hehe, it&#39;s nothing special. All I did was sprinkle<br> a little powder on it before I cooked it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe so, but it was still exquisite!<br> You really are an expert chef, aren&#39;t you, Adele?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I already told you, she hasn&#39;t cooked for<br> hundreds of years. But, uh, still, thanks.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I know she&#39;s really happy to hear that.<br> Honestly, it makes me feel good, too.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hehe, hehehehehe. Ahh, I&#39;m so glad. I&#39;d forgotten<br> how fun it is to cook for guests!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Of course, it wouldn&#39;t have been half as fun<br> if you hadn&#39;t all helped, so thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no, not at all.<br> All I did was help with the simple prep stuff!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Slurp)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Slurrrp)<br> (Munch, munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ahh, that was delicious...<br> Best noodles I&#39;ve had in forever...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh! Sorry for polishing everything off. But in my defense, it was all so good I couldn&#39;t help it!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh no, it&#39;s quite all right.<br> We have more, if you want thirds.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Woohoo! If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that<br> you&#39;ve gotta stock up on good food when you get the chance!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fatty fou.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then, before I forget again: Adele, perhaps it&#39;s time you secured this forgotten item of yours?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. We should.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> First, let me give you a bit of backstory.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Um... Gosh, where do I begin...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Aphrodite.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Right. Thank you, Macarios. So, you know how the East District&#39;s Statuetown is also the district dedicated to art and beauty, right?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s because Aphrodite&#39;s protection is especially strong here. She hears any prayers in this region&#39;s branch temples.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Go on.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> So we thought we could use a guide here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> He&#39;s been cooped up in here sleeping for a while now,<br> but he should be waking up at any moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait. Huh? Do you mean this thing you<br> forgot wasn&#39;t actually a thing at all?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Munch, munch) More of a metaphorical thing, then.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> He&#39;s a huge help, even among you-know-who&#39;s friends.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah. All the more so in this part of town.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It seems Macarios is looking at...a refrigerator?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Yes, all I can see is a large refrigerator.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Now Adele&#39;s standing in front of it...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Wait! I recognize it now!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It looks just like the one they used in the underground base to keep that steel Chimera on ice!)</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting so long, Uncle.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But it&#39;s finally time for you to wake up.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (That&#39;s...the Heroic Spirit of Emperor Caligula<br> we met in the Second Singularity!!!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Wh-what in the world is he doing here!?<br> And kept on ice, at that!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Caligula!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (What in the world&#39;s going on here!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Indeed, it has been a long time<br> since I was last awakened.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Hello, my beloved twins, Adele and Macarios.<br> I am glad to see you both well.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> However...I cannot help but notice<br> that none of my friends are here.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I won&#39;t ask why.<br> Your faces tell me all I need to know.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> And good day to you, unfamiliar guests.

You&#39;re laggards<br> AND dipshits, and that&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Maybe so, but you could still sugarcoat it a bit.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And if you call us names for being late, you can&#39;t really complain if we call you names the next time you&#39;re late.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hmph. I&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Actually, no. That shit isn&#39;t happening. Late or no, if anyone even seems to come CLOSE to insulting me, they die.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good to be back!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What do you look so happy about?<br> I&#39;ve seen turtles who were faster than you lot!</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I was only gonna wait another hour or so before heading back to the base or the Border. Eh, at least you&#39;re here now.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I did not know I was keeping a proud warrior waiting.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Forgive me for the trouble I have caused you,<br> and allow me to make a formal apology.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I am truly sorry, and also most grateful for your patience. I hope we may put this behind us and join as comrades in our battle against the gods.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Wha... Who the hell&#39;s this guy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Emperor Caligula...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s supposed to be Emperor Caligula...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right, Senpai. This is Emperor Caligula,<br> the third emperor of the ancient Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History.<br> Although...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caligula?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Strange. While these underground corridors that connect the alliance base to the surface are indeed free from Zeus&#39;s surveillance...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...I also recall them being guarded by a large,<br> hostile machine.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> And yet, I can no longer sense anything<br> of the sort here. What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> If you&#39;re talking about Argos,<br> Mordred&#39;s gang already took care of it.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So don&#39;t worry, Caligula.<br> The underground&#39;s safer than ever now.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just me. He really IS talking, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, he is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m still not sure what to make of it. I&#39;ve never seen Caligula speak so, um, fluently before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, um, if he&#39;s one of the<br> Heroic Spirits in the alliance...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So he managed to survive somehow?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought all the God Destroyer Alliance Heroic Spirits were wiped out?</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Er.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Um.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> How can I put this...?</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Oh, what the heck. I&#39;ll just come out and say it!<br> We didn&#39;t tell you about him before because\u2013</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> We decided to go for dramatic effect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou!<br> Fourons!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you serious, A.I.!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m glad we have another ally, but come ON!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Now, now. Militarily speaking, it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to describe losing forces and no longer being able to continue an operation as &quot;wiped out.&quot;</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s odd. It seems we&#39;re having some<br> technical issues with our connection...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t be too hard on them.<br> We never told you the truth until now, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-oh, no, I&#39;m sorry.<br> We&#39;re shocked, yes, but we&#39;re not angry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, we&#39;d never blame you guys for this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Besides, there wouldn&#39;t be much point in lecturing a bunch of A.I. personas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, right! Good point!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, it&#39;s wonderful to know we have another capable ally now. From here on, we can include Caligula as part of our operations!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s true. We&#39;ll definitely be having<br> Caligula come along with us from here on.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Especially after the alliance\u2013we,<br> messed up last time.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo...?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So it was a bad call on your part<br> that got everyone else killed?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Would you agree that that&#39;s a fair interpretation<br> of what you just said, Macarios?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Tch. The hell were you losers doing out there!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Caenis. You should know that nobody wins<br> every battle they fight in a war.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yes, some great generals in Proper Human History might<br> have come close, but they never had to go up against a god.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And there&#39;s definitely never been a general anywhere who could win every battle they wage against multiple gods.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So do you really think it&#39;s fair to just dismiss<br> their efforts with &quot;the hell were you doing&quot;?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I guess you&#39;ve got a point.<br> Okay, I take it back.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. You always get serious outta nowhere.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Hehe. So Caenis doesn&#39;t apologize, but IS willing to take things back, huh. I knew there was a strong sense of responsibility buried somewhere in there!)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> In fact, I&#39;ll do you one better! Divine Spirits are one thing, but you brats were up against an actual god!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hell, not just one, but a whole buncha gods. I&#39;d say you did pretty damn well under the circumstances!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Caligula is our secret weapon.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Just like the Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon<br> was in our battle against Demeter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s why everyone in the alliance agreed to keep him hidden until Operation God Destroyer&#39;s final stage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So then, why didn&#39;t you hide him here in the base?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fom?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect it was most likely an effort not to concentrate their assets in one place.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It may have been a different story if they had been able to perfectly secure their base, but as things stand...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...if they had kept all their eggs in this proverbial basket, a single successful strike would have meant the end of the alliance.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> The underground infrastructure where we keep our base is very vulnerable to massive strikes, like what Demeter was capable of.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we hid Caligula in the East District. Freezing him let us completely hide his magical energy...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...and it didn&#39;t draw any attention, since there&#39;s plenty of Olympians who freeze themselves when they feel like taking really long naps.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The only problem&#39;s that\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aphrodite happened to show up, and the whole East District team was wiped out as a result.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Right...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But we&#39;re not gonna make the same mistake again!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This time, we&#39;re gonna fight back with everything<br> we&#39;ve got right from the start!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I get it, believe me.<br> But you can&#39;t let your anger get the better of you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> When things are most dire is when you gotta keep<br> a level head, or you&#39;ll start making mistakes.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Very well, if you&#39;ll allow me to make sure<br> I understand the situation correctly...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You expect that Aphrodite may once again try to thwart our attempts to complete the summoning circle operation...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...so you brought Caligula out of cold storage<br> as a means of fighting back against her.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Hmm. Doling out information to your allies in tiny bits at a time like this doesn&#39;t seem like a good call to me...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (But, I guess I can understand why they&#39;re doing it.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Everything they tell us about the gods only underscores how much of a threat they are, even with all the countermeasures they seem to have in place.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (And since they mentioned some of the Heroic Spirits who came here just bailed when they heard what they were up against, I can&#39;t blame them for being cautious.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (It&#39;s all about emotion, isn&#39;t it?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (No matter when or where, the human heart is always a key factor...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fo?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Uh, yes? What is it, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh!? Aww, just when I thought he<br> was finally warming up to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have a question.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can you tell us more about Caligula?</p><hr><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Of course. As long as it&#39;s something<br> that&#39;s within our ability to answer.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So what&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How is he able to speak normally?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What happened to the Berserker madness that stopped him from speaking?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, right. I was just wondering about that, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caligula as we know him is a Berserker,<br> and he can&#39;t really...communicate very well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But here...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What, like he&#39;s hard to talk to?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Whaddya talkin&#39; about?<br> He&#39;s talking just fine. Ain&#39;t that right, Emps?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I understand your bewilderment, and worry not,<br> for this is an answer I can give.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I believe it is because I was struck<br> by the moon goddess&#39;s attack.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fomuu?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> You see, back in Atlantis, Diana, ran me through with some sort of invisible force.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He means Diana, goddess of the moon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Diana was the Roman name for Artemis!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s another name for Artemis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe it was the name she was known by in Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, does that mean you were struck<br> by orbital cannon fire, Caligula?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, he specifically said &quot;invisible force,&quot; so we<br> should assume it was some other manner of attack.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Artemis was also the goddess of madness, so perhaps...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...she possessed Authority to control the mind, too?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Man...you really are sharp, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, well, I suppose the gods of these Lostbelts<br> do often call me a sage for a reason.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Caligula, the mad emperor of Rome beloved by the moon.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Given his connection to Artemis, we thought he<br> may have acted as a kind of lightning rod.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> So we used him to lure Artemis out...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...and when she blasted him with<br> a precision mental attack...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> ...He was transformed.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> The attack inverted his madness, making him rational.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Artemis was likely confused by this. We believe it led to her assuming Heroic Spirits of Proper Human History all possessed some kind of mental protection.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> So she gave up on her precision mental attacks...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> ...and resorted to a more direct manner of destruction, in the form of a massive orbital bombardment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I suppose it would be a fruitless endeavor to discuss whether a physical or mental attack would be the lesser of two evils.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> People of Chaldea,<br> I understand what your presence here signifies.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> My goddess, Diana, has fallen, hasn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, she has.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Orion, and many others, helped us bring her down.</p><hr><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...I see. So Orion fulfilled his purpose.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Then I will not grieve for my goddess, for I am certain she has returned to where she belongs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. I think she has, too.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Are you done?<br> Do you punks ever shut up!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Are we ever gonna actually get around to setting up<br> these Grand Servant summoning circles whatsits!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sorry. You&#39;re right, we&#39;ve taken long enough.<br> It&#39;s time we began this operation in earnest.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s head back to the surface. Holmes,<br> Caenis, Caligula, you three use your spirit forms.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Mash, Musashi, Fujimaru,<br> you three come with us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You got it!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go get revenge for your fallen allied Heroic Spirits and finish these summoning circles in one fell swoop!</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Hey, it&#39;s Macarios and Adele!<br> I can&#39;t even remember the last time I saw you guys.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> You two really love to travel, huh. How&#39;s that going?<br> Are you expanding your horizons?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you could say that.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to see you again.<br> We just got back from visiting the South District.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Once we&#39;ve got our things all sorted out, we&#39;ll be heading out again soon to Altartown this time.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Whoa, the south, huh!<br> Hey, wasn&#39;t that where\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh, yes. But fortunately, we weren&#39;t affected by all that...unpleasantness, thanks to Lord Zeus&#39;s protection.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Ahh, I see. It&#39;s true, we really do<br> have a lot to thank Lord Zeus for.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Thanks to him, the ambrosia supply hasn&#39;t slowed down one bit, even with Lady Demeter resting in the great shrine.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> It&#39;s just like how he provided for us<br> back during the Olympia Machia, too.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Ahh, what would we do without the omnipotent Lord Zeus, who took over the Authority of every fallen god? We&#39;re so lucky to have him.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re so right.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> By the way...I haven&#39;t seen those friends of<br> yours before. Are they from the south, too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey there!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. They&#39;re distant relatives, actually.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to take some time for the south district to be restored, so we thought we&#39;d take them to Altartown in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> What a wonderful idea. There&#39;s certainly no shortage of large branch shrines to visit in Altartown.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Olympus Citizen:</strong><br> Well, I hope your tomorrow is just as peaceful as today. May Lord Zeus&#39;s protection be with you.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Good, he&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man, you guys really do know a lot of people.<br> Are you sure it&#39;s okay to be out here with us?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. We can&#39;t just throw<br> you into the deep end of an unfamiliar city.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sure, we could always just give you a map,<br> but that wouldn&#39;t be nearly as efficient.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Right. We&#39;re bound to run into a lot of<br> trouble on our way to the second one...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...so this&#39;ll go much smoother if we show you the way there ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (If I&#39;m hearing Adele right,<br> then what she&#39;s really saying...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...is that there are going to be soldiers stationed near where we&#39;ll need to place the summoning circles.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (In which case, it would definitely be dangerous to try to navigate an unfamiliar city while checking a map, especially in the middle of a chaotic battle.)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Okay, it&#39;s not much farther now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yikes. There sure are a lot of people here, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose we can take<br> our plans elsewhere, can we?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Nope. Apparently, it has to be these spots,<br> though we&#39;re not entirely sure why, either.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They said it&#39;s got something to do with the position<br> of the stars, and things like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (So the summoning circles need to use celestial bodies. That makes sense for constructing a spell like this.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (If the Heroic Spirit this spell summons is really capable of destroying gods...then who, or what in the world is it going to be?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Woof!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s get started.<br> Is everyone ready?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m all set!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready when you are!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa, the middle of the street is glowing!<br> This is definitely going to draw attention !</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The spell&#39;s giving off magical energy!<br> There&#39;s no way the gods aren&#39;t gonna notice this!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Get ready! Enemies&#39;ll be here soon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The roads and buildings are all putting up shutters!<br> I&#39;m picking up hostile entities headed our way, Master!</p><p><strong>Mass Destruction Device:</strong><br> Attention, citizens of Olympus.<br> This is an emergency alert.</p><p><strong>Mass Destruction Device:</strong><br> The Chaldean demons have appeared in Statuetown, ward twelve. Please evacuate the area in an orderly fashion.</p><p><strong>Mass Destruction Device:</strong><br> Initiating destructive countermeasures.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> There they are! Guess we don&#39;t have to bother with these invisible disguises anymore, then!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Suspending disguise Mystic Code effects now!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Sorry, big guy, but we&#39;ve got a job to do here, and we can&#39;t let you through until we finish what we came here to do!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen that shining, giant red eye of yours before! You&#39;re one of those murder machines that just comes barreling after us without a thought in its metal head!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ll see your brute force...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...and raise you my razor sharp blades! Caenis!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So it&#39;s killing time now!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> It is, isn&#39;t it, samurai chick?!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!<br> Well, not killing so much as smashing, but same idea!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hahaha, smashing machines, eh? That takes me back to<br> the Luddite movement of the industrial revolution!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, while the Luddites are a thematic fit for us, as our enemies are machines, you should know that they ultimately failed, Ms. Miyamoto!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll just have to make sure<br> they succeed here in Olympus!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Who cares about any of that crap!?<br> Let&#39;s just get started already!</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Activating Ortinax&#39;s emergency combat mode! Output remains stable. Athena Klironomia synchronization successful!</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> I&#39;m good to go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll keep Adele safe!</p><p><strong>O\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s race! Will Adele finish the circle first, or will we beat our enemies?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hah! Like that&#39;ll be a contest.<br> We&#39;re gonna freakin&#39; smash these things!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You said it! All right then...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All hostiles eliminated.<br> Ortinax systems remain green. The battle is over!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nice job, everyone!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That was easier than I thought. I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have<br> to deal with any locals getting mixed up in the fray.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, it does seem like the<br> Olympians cleared out of the area very quickly...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s all thanks to their daily training? The gods must really have their people on a short leash...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...There, all done.<br> Come on, let&#39;s hurry to the next one.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Did it work? I thought magecraft was<br> s&#39;posed to be all flashy and shit.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Huh? Why would we want to draw more attention? If anything, Blavatsky went out of her way to make the spell as innocuous as possible.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You can talk about that stuff later, Sister! Now come on!

Preparing to move to the next target!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> I have one word for you, Demons of Chaldea\u2013<br> insolent miscreants who shun the gods&#39; glorious light.</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Die...<br> Die, die, die!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Die, become part of Olympus&#39;s underworld infrastructure, and maybe then you can start making amends to the gods!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ghh... Caenis!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Die this, die that. Is that all you can say, dumbass?<br> I got a better idea. YOU die!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Ghh!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Curse...you...Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry you had to die holding a grudge. Hopefully,<br> your soul will at least find respite in paradi\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, right. Olympians come back to life in no time at all, don&#39;t they? Guess there&#39;s no point praying for their salvation then!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> (All compassion one moment, the next she&#39;s... Huh.<br> What&#39;s with this chick?

The hell am I admiring her for!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, you freakin&#39; nutjob dual-wielder!<br> We gotta do this while my Authority&#39;s still working!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I can stop their instant healing bullshit,<br> but I can&#39;t stop it forever!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Hmmm?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but it&#39;s definitely a little easier to fight here now than it was before...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (The Klironomia&#39;s power-up is definitely part of it,<br> and Caenis has been a big help, too.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (But it feels like there&#39;s<br> more to it than that alone...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (What could it be?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, anyway, these Olympian soldiers really<br> do put up a hell of a fight, don&#39;t they!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And there&#39;s no end to them with this healing stuff, so guess that goes to show we&#39;ve gotta go after the big guys! Err...gods!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Right. Remember, we&#39;re not here to fight off soldiers.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Now come on, hurry!

We need a distraction!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Got it.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Heads up! I&#39;m gonna cast a smoke screen spell!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s not poisonous, but you&#39;ll still choke if you breathe too much in, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Cough, hack) Aha, so this is what<br> you used the first time we met!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The alliance developed this spell for emergencies!

You nailed it!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Looks like our idea about the enemy usin&#39; somethin&#39; conspicuous to cover up the site was right on the money!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> I&#39;m seein&#39; a monster up ahead that looks<br> ta be warpin&#39; the very space around &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I see it!<br> Is that...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s mean.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> What did I ever do to deserve being called a<br> monster by a bunch of lifeless faux ghosts?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I may be an Alter Ego working with the Foreign God, but I&#39;ve always strived to be a fair and impartial businesswoman above all else.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Chaldeans?

Please, stay with us!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> A human woman...?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Hell no. There&#39;s no way that...thing could be human! She&#39;s not even trying to hide her savage magical energy, or the smell of death that hangs around her...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What the hell are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tamamo Vitch Koyanskaya!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now what are you up to?</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Eee\u2606 What happened to the meek<br> little Fujimaru I remember?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I never thought you&#39;d ever try<br> to interrogate me so boldly!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> What could have changed you like this? Is it because<br> we&#39;re friends now? Because we bonded a bit in India?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Anyway, while I&#39;d love to discuss this newfound casual attitude toward me...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...let&#39;s not forget that I&#39;m still very much your enemy. I&#39;m afraid I have nothing in the way of products or information for you this time.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> No, this time, I only came to check up on my Phantasmal<br> factory, since I&#39;ll need it for my...future endeavors.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> See, just between us, I&#39;m actually trying to keep this<br> visit a secret from the gods of Olympus as well...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> So I think it&#39;d be best for everyone if we just pretended we never saw each other and went our separate ways.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I can see you&#39;re all very busy making preparations<br> to tackle this Lostbelt in earnest.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> My plan is to simply let things play out however they do, and hopefully come away with some choice Olympian products to sell when all is said and done.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t that sound nice? Everybody wins, nobody<br> loses! What more could you possibly want?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (...Well, you heard the lady.<br> What do you all think?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I want to know what it is she&#39;s doing here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I think it&#39;s time we found out exactly what it is she&#39;s up to.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Quite right, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Besides, now that Koyanskaya has seen us here,<br> avoiding conflict is no longer an option...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...since in the end, she is certain to be<br> the most formidable foe I need to face.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh my... And why is that, pray tell? Don&#39;t you remember<br> the lovely chai I made you in India?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! (Special Translation: You never made anything of the sort, you stingy, two-faced fox!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Koyanskaya is not part of Olympus&#39;s forces...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...so I rather doubt she could be motivated to actively interfere with our attack on this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, we can say that with a fair amount of certainty,<br> given her behavior in all past Lostbelts to date.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Does this then mean she sides with the Crypters\u2013that is, the Foreign God? Clearly not.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She has never once attempted to protect a Tree of Emptiness. If anything, she once treated it as no more than another product in her catalog.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Nor, for that matter, has she shown any sign of subservience to the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Koyanskaya, while you have told us several times<br> that the Foreign God commands three Disciples...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...you have never once directly declared<br> yourself to be one of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Your attempts to mislead us have been so brazenly obvious that the truth is quite apparent.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Why yes\u2606 You might say that&#39;s<br> just my way of being sincere.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You see, if a bunch of insects like yourselves were to accuse me of breaking a promise I never made, well, even I don&#39;t think I would be able to keep my cool\u2661</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Um... Is that true, Mash?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Y-yes, it is. I&#39;m quickly going through our past logs right now, and it&#39;s true.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (She never openly declared herself to be one of the Foreign God&#39;s Disciples! She&#39;s only ever said things that made it sound like she was!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Then she is just a fraud! I knew we couldn&#39;t trust<br> that damn monster! Being sincere, my ass!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Quiet if you would, please.<br> I was just getting to the good part.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now then... From here, our next question is obvious:</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who IS Tamamo Vitch Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We know she attacked Chaldea&#39;s headquarters, and that she dealt a critical blow to Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We also know that she takes pleasure in tormenting the Lostbelt&#39;s inhabitants and seeing their lives end, even as she continues to, for want of a better way to put it, name-drop the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even now, we can see her making moves in this Atlantic<br> Lostbelt as an unaffiliated third party.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Would it be all right with you if I voiced my<br> conclusions about her now, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Though of course, you may well have already<br> arrived at the same answer yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Wordlessly nod \u201COf course.\u201D)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Wordlessly nod in assent.)</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Who are the Foreign God&#39;s three Disciples\u2013<br> the Servants they summoned themself?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We can say for certain that two of them are Rasputin,<br> from Russia, and Limbo, from Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...And now, I suspect the third is Senji Muramasa,<br> whom we only recently learned of in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As Servants summoned by the Foreign God, they are naturally motivated to protect the Tree of Emptiness, and have attempted to do so at every turn.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You, on the other hand, have no affiliation with the Foreign God, yet their Disciples clearly hold you in respect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From this, we can infer you are most likely a<br> being on equal footing with the Foreign God...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or, in terms you might prefer,<br> a business partner. Correct?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I like to think of it as a mutual<br> back-scratching sort of relationship.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Indeed, the Foreign God and I did<br> sign a contract to that effect.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> \u201CI will not eliminate you.<br> In return, you will not comprehend me.\u201D</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> \u201CWe will both abide by our respective principles<br> and see this planet through to its end.\u201D</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But tell me, how did you come to that conclusion?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> How did you know that the Foreign God and I had<br> become something akin to business partners?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Elementary, my dear Koyanskaya. If we assume that to<br> be the case, everything else starts to make sense.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For one, it explains how you were able to work towards your own goals in each Lostbelt despite being in a similar position as the Disciples.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Namely, your goal of simply tormenting people, rather than growing the Trees of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We still have no data on what exactly the Foreign God is, and so cannot yet draw a clear picture of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We are, however, certain of their goal:<br> the destruction of modern humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I suspect your goal is similar. Something along the lines of becoming humanity&#39;s natural enemy and destroying the entire species.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is for that reason that the Foreign God did not consider you to be on the side of humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They may even have recognized you as a competitor of sorts. No doubt that is why they chose to enter into a business arrangement.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect this agreement involved you both promising to use each others&#39; resources, to ignore the other party as much as possible, and to avoid any direct conflict.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Never mind that the other party\u2013the Foreign God, that is\u2013appears to be the significantly greater threat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yet even so, the Foreign God clearly saw you as a threat, and so placed a collar upon you in the form of a contract.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You may be cruel, heartless, twisted, and depraved...but<br> for some reason, you take pride in being a businesswoman.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And of course, the quickest way to keep a freewheeling<br> competitor in check is to make them a partner.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> By entering into a noncompete contract of sorts, you arrived at a position where you both stand on equal ground.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Am I correct, Ms. Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> What an interminably long-winded explanation. Yes, that&#39;s all more or less correct.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...So? What am I then?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can only think of one entity who could give pause to<br> a god capable of wiping Earth clean in an instant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You possess an exceptional ability to freely travel between different worlds\u2013a power not even the other Alter Egos can wield.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You are a walking disaster\u2013one with which even the Foreign God wishes to avoid coming into contact.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In Atlantis, we met Orion\u2013a Grand Archer who<br> had been summoned by the very world itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And here in Olympus, the conditions appear to<br> be in place for a similar summoning ritual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Taking all that into consideration,<br> the answer is quite clear.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You are an independent disaster, a being dangerous enough to merit the materialization of a Grand Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words...you must be one of the<br> Seven Evils of Humanity; you are a Beast.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Beast!? But, her Spirit Origin is<br> still within standard parameters!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Because even though she&#39;s already reached a point that<br> warrants a Grand Servant...she&#39;s still not fully matured.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If she were, there would be little<br> call for caution on her part.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Well? Am I right, Ms. Koyanskaya? Or perhaps I should<br> call you by your True Name, if you&#39;d care to share it?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, Koyanskaya is just fine, Mr. Detective. After all, I don&#39;t have anything so silly as a True Name.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where&#39;d this fog come from!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Oh man, I&#39;m getting some serious chills!)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...At last.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> At long last, I&#39;ve reached the point I&#39;ve been waiting for. I would expect nothing less from you, my dear Chaldeans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> One of the stipulations in my contract<br> with the Foreign God states:</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u201CI must not reveal my name of my own accord.\u201D</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thanks to that binding clause, I had no choice but to<br> go about my endeavors slowly and painstakingly...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But now, at last...at last!!! I&#39;ve regained a body that I can finally...stretch in. And it&#39;s all thanks to you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hehe...<br> Hehehe...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ahhahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You humans. Your best intentions always bring about the worst results. What you think is good sense always devolves into insufferable self-righteousness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You, with your absurd egos, always yapping about protecting humanity! You make me sick!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh yes, I really must thank you again.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Thank you so much for demolishing Goetia&#39;s nauseatingly naive ambitions beyond any possibility of repair!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her magical energy readings are suddenly spiking! This massive aura... The way she&#39;s eroding the space around her... It&#39;s as though she really is\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve had my pick of all the finest breeds in every Lostbelt, I was wondering when the best time would be to unveil myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s been just unbearable, waiting for the chance to try out a tail or two of my own.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So I thought, why not give myself a treat...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...and toy with humanity personally for a change!?</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahahahahaha!<br> Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So I tell you what! As your just reward for figuring me out, I&#39;m going to take my time with you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Who knows? Perhaps my tails will end up crushing<br> you before the mechanical gods get a chance!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The target&#39;s shape and mass have both changed dramatically! It&#39;s absorbing nearby magical energy and growing larger!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> It appears to be some kind of shadowy<br> four-legged creature of unknown origin!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Here she comes!<br> Get ready, Mash!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ghh!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t figure her out! I can tell there&#39;s something<br> there, but that&#39;s it! I&#39;ve got no idea what it could be!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (So how the hell is she giving off this pressure!? Since when does magical energy alone make something tangible!?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (It feels like she could blow up this whole damn<br> Lostbelt if I end up poking her the wrong way!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s roaring!<br> She&#39;s about to blast the whole area!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It&#39;s not only that. She means to end this battle now.<br> At least, the one we&#39;re fighting here in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I bet she does!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I may not be able to get a solid read on her,<br> but I can definitely tell she&#39;s out for blood!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But as they say, it&#39;s all too easy to hide your head and end up showing your ass! And now, her ass is mine!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Followed by!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Up here, bitch!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! That got her good!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Not bad, you crazy samurai! Not bad at all!<br> How&#39;d you know I love taking my enemies by surprise!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A falling strike from a great height!?<br> I didn&#39;t even see the jump...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but never mind that! Caenis&#39;s strike finished her off! It looks like she&#39;s gone\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!<br> Fou fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No, she&#39;s not. She&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy Servant is still alive and well! In fact, her Spirit Origin doesn&#39;t even seem to be scratched!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t move, Saber.<br> This is not where you are meant to meet your end.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> So, we have a Lancer, a Shielder, a Master, and a coward who did nothing but stand back and watch.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s enough for my formal debut. Unless, of course, you&#39;d prefer to keep fighting until you all perish?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...No, we don&#39;t want that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s enough, everyone. Stand down.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...It seems the situation has changed.<br> I concur with [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru&#39;s decision.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So, are you satisfied now, Ms. Koyanskaya?<br> Was our combined effort enough to win you over?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Yes, it was.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You were neither too weak nor too strong.<br> You were juuust right.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Looks like there shouldn&#39;t be any problem with letting the gods of Olympus here deal with you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> At any rate, now that I&#39;ve had a good long stretch,<br> and my shoulders aren&#39;t so stiff anymore...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...why don&#39;t we stop all this fighting and prying so we can all get back to our respective business?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I wouldn&#39;t dream of breathing a word<br> of this little t\xEAte-\xE0-t\xEAte to anyone else.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Consider it a token of appreciation for giving me such a nice little massage.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Can I take that to mean you won&#39;t mention this<br> encounter to either Zeus or the Crypters?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would be a great help, and I see no reason to refuse. We are very much working against the clock, after all.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Good. Then we have a deal.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Just as well. I certainly have no interest in any<br> representative of humanity who can&#39;t even see the real me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> All right, good luck growing<br> even stronger in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I do hope your battles here<br> are fruitful and victorious.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s finally gone, huh. Phew.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Holmes, yeah? Got a lotta experience handling bitches like that or something?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oh, I wouldn&#39;t say that. While I do have some experience dealing with spies...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not at all sure that would<br> be the right category in her case.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Confirming that...um, I&#39;ll call Beast Koyanskaya for the time being, has retreated in her spirit form!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> The battle is over, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Great work, everyone!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Now, what about the second spot for you-know-what?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve got this! Luckily, the spot turned<br> out to be right where Holmes thought it would be.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I guess that weird shadowy monster<br> you fought must have been hiding it.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I already had the A.I. contact Caligula.<br> He should be here any\u2013</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Apologies for my tardiness.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Damn, speak of the emperor! Would be nice to take a<br> little rest... But I guess that&#39;ll just have to wait.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Now that our second objective has been fulfilled,<br> let us hurry on to the final one!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, fooou!</p><h2 id="section-12-thou-art-the-ardor-that-corrupts-the-stars-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-thou-art-the-ardor-that-corrupts-the-stars-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Thou Art the Ardor that Corrupts the Stars (IV)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Interstellar Mountainous City Olympus.

Why are you still allowing that imitation human there to remain alive?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> There is no need to restrain yourself merely because he happens to be a god-eating Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> He deserves a thousand deaths for his<br> insolent behavior in Zeus&#39;s presence.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> With your Authority, you could surely destroy any Servant with a Spirit Core connected to a brain and heart.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Big Brother, Aphrodite is\u2013</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Sorry, Dioscuri, but you&#39;ll just<br> have to grin and bear it.</p><p><strong>Aphrodite:</strong><br> Yesterday, I may not have stood by, but today, I am far more concerned with destroying the Chaldeans.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Eradicate Chaldea.<br> That is your task.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> This divine order is your highest priority.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Hear me now, Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, and my daughter.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Kill the Chaldeans.

Think they can win?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Zeus said they&#39;ve got one of Atlas&#39;s Seven Taboos, right? The Black Barrel, was it?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> They&#39;re trying to fight superweapons with an even stronger superweapon, huh.

But don&#39;t worry.<br> There&#39;s no way Aphrodite is going to lose.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> After all, she&#39;s not the kind of opponent<br> you can overwhelm with sheer firepower.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So it doesn&#39;t matter how many Heroic Spirits they throw at her. They&#39;ll still never be able to touch her.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> That so? Well, coming from you, that makes me feel a whole lot better. Sounds like Aphrodite&#39;s one hell of a goddess.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh yes. Not a very attractive woman, though.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...And she&#39;s plenty sad in her own way.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say. By the way, Pepe, any idea<br> where little Kadoc might&#39;ve gone?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t seen him once since Chaldea showed up here,<br> and I can&#39;t help wondering what he&#39;s up to.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> He&#39;s always had something of a rebellious<br> streak to him, after all. If Kirschtaria...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Or worse, the Foreign God were to start suspecting he was up to something, the Alter Egos&#39;d be all over him like white on rice, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Being the older brother figure for him that I am,<br> I can&#39;t help but worry about the little guy, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I&#39;ve told him &quot;if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em&quot;<br> a bunch of times, but it never seems to stick.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> So, got any ideas, Scandinavia Peperoncino?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> No, can&#39;t say I do. Now that you mention it,<br> I haven&#39;t seen Kadoc around anywhere, either.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But near as I can tell,<br> he&#39;s been hanging out in the city a lot recently.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You know how serious he is, right?

So, if love and beauty are worth,<br> then the god of both controls worth itself.</p><p><strong>Man&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> I suppose I should have expected such an ancient machine to come out swinging. It certainly seems to have worked.</p><p><strong>Man&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Though really, when it comes to humans\u2013intelligent life-forms with minds that constantly seek fellow souls to form connections...</p><p><strong>Man&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> ...I can see why an attack of this<br> manner would be so effective.</p><p><strong>Shadow:</strong><br> Gah!

Did the space around us just start warping?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I initially assumed this to be some manner of large-scale spatial manipulation spell, but it seems to be more akin to ultra high-speed matter transport...

Edison, Nikola Tesla, and Helena built it themselves!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Aphrodite&#39;s air-to-ground attacks cover way too much area, so we can&#39;t head straight for her Icarus-style!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Instead, we&#39;re going to use Stymphalides<br> to send you all up even higher!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I see.<br> So we will be looking down on the goddess from above.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> How very insolent.<br> However, I think such insolence suits me now.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I will go and face her from on high!<br> Who will accompany me?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, you better believe I&#39;m coming along too.<br> I&#39;ve gotta make up for attacking you guys earlier.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;ll come too.

And it looks like...<br> Ms. Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right!

This breathing Mystic Code should supply you with oxygen as long as you wear it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Haha, you really are weak, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And yet, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] still didn&#39;t think twice about coming<br> along with us.

Queen Europa insists that, as one of Olympus&#39;s production districts, it is too important to destroy.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> It seems the only way we will be able to destroy an entire district is if one of Father&#39;s revelations permits it.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> ...Queen Europa, huh? She&#39;s got a lot of nerve for a fusion of human Heroic Spirit and god.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> How dare she be the one to speak for Father, instead of proper gods like us? Whatever sort of connection she may have to Proper Human History, I still find her actions the height of insolence.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> I can only imagine how poor Lady Hera must feel, being fused with...that.

Then you might have other symptoms, too! You need to rest up as soon as possible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-come on, Senpai,<br> let&#39;s find a place where you can lie down.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hm hm, hmm. I see.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Mash, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]&#39;s fine! This is nothing like<br> what [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] went through after shooting Demeter.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It really is just the floor shaking<br> that&#39;s got [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] unsteady. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Thank goodness.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Dioscuri...

I swore I&#39;d avenge the others, but I&#39;m no closer than I was back then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe not, but you still saved our lives.</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Only because I can&#39;t have you guys die on us.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Now that even the Proper Human History Heroic<br> Spirits are gone, you&#39;re all we&#39;ve got left.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Failure&#39;s not an option. As much as I want<br> revenge, the mission still comes first.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...By the way, I need to tell you guys something. You know that smoke screen spell we used the first time we saved you?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Well, we can&#39;t use it anymore.<br> They&#39;ve seen it too many times now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aww, really? That&#39;s too bad. It looked like it<br> was even cutting off farsight spells and such.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fom.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Do you mean those Mystic Codes that resemble portable cannons? I was most impressed by how effectively you employed them for both offensive and defensive purposes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then again, I did notice how you were swapping between different spells and magecraft bases with every shot, so I suppose this means you&#39;ve used them all up.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We worked with both the Heroic Spirits and the<br> Collaborator to make these Mystic Codes we&#39;ve been using.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They can use Egyptian, Scandinavian, Eastern European, Greek, Celtic, and Roman spells without relying on Divine Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So your Mystic Codes can use spells from multiple different magecraft foundations in parallel... Th-that kind of thing would be unthinkable in modern magecraft...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really, they sound more like an incredible<br> artifact than they do Mystic Codes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is doubtlessly why they were effective even against gods. But unfortunately, it seems that effectiveness was short lived.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same with Caligula&#39;s Noble Phantasm...<br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work on them again, either.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> By now, the Dioscuri are sure to have figured out that it&#39;s a mental attack derived from Artemis&#39;s Authority.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So next time, they&#39;ll be ready for it.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...I see. So the ancient twin gods have<br> already seen through my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> ...Hello. Once again, I&#39;ve come<br> back without waiting to be rebooted.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Let me just launch right into an explanation!</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> Time for Operation God Destroyer...</p><p><strong>I\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> ...to enter its final phase!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> Thanks to you, the summoning circles are in place.<br> All that remains is the final key we need to destroy Zeus!</p><p><strong>J\uFF1A A.I.:</strong><br> That means we need to finish the Grand Summon Article. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t with the alliance&#39;s R &amp; D skills alone.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> At this point, we can only hope that the Collaborator<br> has made significant progress with its construction...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AA.I.:</strong><br> ...But unfortunately, we have<br> no means of contacting them.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You&#39;re shitting us, right? Hahahahahaha! You came all this way, and now you&#39;re just leaving the rest to chance!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So what, all this moving around we&#39;re doing<br> in this base really is just running away!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahaha! This is great! I love<br> flailing about and hoping I get lucky!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You guys are even bigger idiots than I thought!<br> Hahaha, I can&#39;t remember the last time I laughed this hard!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You might be idiots, but you&#39;re my kind of idiots!</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Well, I can understand where they&#39;re coming from,<br> at least in terms of security.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It just goes to show how cautious this Collaborator is being with their identity. They must have an important reason for keeping it secret.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though of course, I can make some...<br> educated guesses as to what it may be.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh yeah? Go on then, detective, let&#39;s hear &#39;em. And don&#39;t give me any of your clever talk shit or I&#39;ll cut your tongue off, and the rest of your head with it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> To begin\u2013</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;s enough of that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (When did she get here?<br> Did she completely erase her presence?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (No, that&#39;s not it.<br> She used some sort of spell to appear here instantly!)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Is he using some kind of godspeed technique? Jinsokutsu? But that&#39;s way too good for a mere human practitioner.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (He must be pushing himself really hard to pull off this kind of magical stealth.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (...Ugh, man, I didn&#39;t think I would change all that much even after I became a Heroic Spirit, but I guess this is part of my new Magic Resistance...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Man, it&#39;s weird being this sensitive to spellwork of some kind!)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell? Aren&#39;t you one of the Crypters?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hmph. After all the trouble I took to sneak past the Heroic and Divine Spirits and jump into your base while it was moving, this is the welcome I get?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I was hoping for a stiff cocktail,<br> not a bunch of silly infighting.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You really should have managed to learn at least a thing or two about style by now. Right, Mashie?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Pepe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roastbanana Peperoncino!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh, you! It&#39;s Scandinavia Peperoncino!<br> I know it&#39;s a fake name, but it&#39;s still MY fake name!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I swear, you are such a little imp!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Lucky for you, I love that sort of thing!<br> You&#39;ve got to enjoy the little things in life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Pepe! You&#39;re here in Olympus too!?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Long time no see, Mashie and Fujimaru.<br> Then again, maybe it hasn&#39;t been that long after all?</p><hr><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Anyway, I don&#39;t need to bother introducing<br> myself at this point, do I?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So, you remember Kadoc, right? Basically, I&#39;m the Collaborator&#39;s other little helper.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Kadoc all but begged me. He said to tell you<br> to come and get what you&#39;re looking for.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Wait. Does that mean what I think it means?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I think so! Are you talking about the last thing<br> we need for the operation&#39;s final phase?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You got it, hon. The Article you&#39;ve been waiting<br> for is just about ready for you to come pick it up.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hey, twin cuties. Uh, what were your names again?<br> Macarios and Adele?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You can move this base anywhere underground you like,<br> right? Then I can give you the exact coordinates right now.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...The coordinates to where, exactly?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Why, the Collaborator&#39;s secret workshop-slash-hideout,<br> of course.</p><h2 id="section-15-souls-to-be-equals-in-due-course-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-souls-to-be-equals-in-due-course-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Souls To Be Equals in Due Course (II)</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived at the designated coordinates.<br> ...We&#39;re immediately beneath Altartown, in the middle of the city.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to hoof it from here.<br> Come on, everyone, get ready to leave.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I want to see you all ready to be out the door in<br> thirty\u2013okay, sixty seconds! Looks like you&#39;re<br> already set, Mashie.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, y-yes, I&#39;m ready.<br> I&#39;ve already equipped the Ortinax.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m ready, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m good to go anytime, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> No problems here, either!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hehe, I am a swordfighter, after all.

Don&#39;t forget, there<br> could be autonomous weapons lurking around here too.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be a major pain if one of them spots you,<br> so if you see one before it sees you\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...You&#39;ll need to run for it immediately, &#39;cause<br> destroying it won&#39;t stop it from alerting the others.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Autonomous weapons?</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> You mean the Argos?<br> ...No, wait. We already destroyed the Argos.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Ugh, ah.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Yeah, right. Good point. They must be talking about the mass destruction devices and Anti-Personnel eradicators.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> They&#39;re all linked right up to Zeus&#39;s senses.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Zeus may not be able to see into the underground directly, but he can sense what his machines see.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Think of them as his eyes. They don&#39;t show up at the depths we normally hide the base, but...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...we&#39;re shallow enough now that they do show up.<br> Watch yourselves around here!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Is that really an A.I.? I&#39;ve never heard of one<br> swapping between personas like that before.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;d say they&#39;re more like a trustworthy partner who<br> keeps giving us plans of attack and secret weapons.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> They&#39;ve already helped us out a bunch so far...<br> Hm.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So you noticed too, huh, samurai chick?<br> Hey, isn&#39;t there a saying for this sort of thing?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Speak of the devil!<br> Fujimaru!

Everything is fine. I&#39;ve severed this<br> device&#39;s connection to Zeus&#39;s neural network.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> To simplify matters for the Chaldeans,<br> it&#39;s no longer online.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s not entirely true. I threw in some hacks so it&#39;d still seem like it was online.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> The point is, you don&#39;t need to<br> worry about leaving it intact.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Well, that&#39;s the best news I&#39;ve heard all day.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Just when I thought our only choices were to run<br> or hide, now we have a much, much better one!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoever you are, I&#39;m going to assume Lady Kannon<br> sent you and trust that you&#39;re here to help!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> How about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I believe them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take this thing out and keep moving!</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Are you serious!?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You made that call faster than I thought. It&#39;s the right one, too. Just trust in your intuition and keep going.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Initiating Ortinax combat mode. ...Hostiles are one hundred meters away. Preparing to engage in battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hostile has been silenced\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait! I&#39;m picking up another magical energy reading one hundred meters away! Heading straight for us at high speed!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Seems to me like another one of them happened to find us, rather than that last one calling for reinforcements! I&#39;m fine taking it on, but how do the rest of you feel!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! How do I feel? I feel I could take a couple hundred of these things without breaking a sweat!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Rrraaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All hostiles down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any other hostiles in the area. And the healing Authority doesn&#39;t seem to be working on their remains, either!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> &#39;Course not. Not with me here.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That bastard Zeus might&#39;ve taken over Demeter&#39;s Authority, but these things aren&#39;t gonna be instantly healing themselves as long as I&#39;m around.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say what&#39;s gonna happen once we leave, but at<br> least you won&#39;t have to worry about &#39;em while I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Man, reassuring you punks.<br> Shit&#39;s pretty messed up if that&#39;s what I&#39;m doin&#39;...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I must be getting soft in my old age! Hrah!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...It was already destroyed.<br> Did you really need to hit it again?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Mind your own damn business.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, didn&#39;t you once chop a guy&#39;s head<br> off after you&#39;d already taken him down?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, that? That was just me tying up loose ends.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Loose ends? You serious?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle is over, Master.<br> You did great.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, um...<br> About that giant hand we fought towards the end...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You recognized it too, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t we seen it in the simulator before?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. It looked just like the<br> one we&#39;ve seen in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From what I&#39;ve been told...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s been a mock enemy archetype in Chaldea&#39;s combat<br> simulator since the simulator first began operating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve also encountered similar-looking hostile entities<br> near the leylines of some Singularities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s still unclear exactly where<br> their design comes from.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yup, it sure was a big hand.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Damn, and here I thought that<br> was my chance to pet him...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Okay, everyone, great work.<br> Sure, I may not have helped, but it was a good show!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So, shall we be going then?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh, then again, maybe we should just ask the<br> owner of this little hideout for directions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The owner?</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s fine with me.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Of course, my secret workshop is just up ahead, so you don&#39;t have much farther to go.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Just keep going straight ahead.<br> Don&#39;t worry. The door&#39;s unlocked.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Welcome, God Destroyer Alliance and Chaldea,<br> to my Great Prometheus-Hephaestus Workshop.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hephaestus!? You&#39;re still alive!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But I thought you were destroyed in Atlantis!?</p><hr><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Yes, a version of me was destroyed, but that was more of a backup version of the me which resides here.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t that version of me tell you that another version<br> existed back before it met its end?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s right, you did! You said there was another, separate unit of you here in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> There you go. I am that separate unit.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Though strictly speaking,<br> maybe I should say I&#39;m more of a transcendent unit.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Anyway...this is very intriguing.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> It sounds like you&#39;ve come across my hands,<br> even in Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your hands?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou fou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aha! That giant hand was yours!? Well, being one of the Twelve Olympians&#39; own hands explains why it was so huge!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Those were your hands, Hephaestus!?</p><hr><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Oh, no, not mine.<br> I&#39;m sorry if my choice of words confused you.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> They&#39;re replicas of my hands from back when I was just Prometheus, before I became Prometheus-Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> It seems the version of me\u2013that is, Prometheus\u2013from Proper Human History was bestowing wisdom and experience on you. What a fascinating connection!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right... Prometheus, the god of wisdom,<br> is said to have give humanity the gift of fire!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, the enormous hand-shaped enemy we&#39;ve been known to encounter in the Chaldean combat simulator is\u2013</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Prometheus&#39;s hand of wisdom.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Here in this Lostbelt,<br> it&#39;s only the remains of my former self...</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> ...but in Proper Human History, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s doing<br> everything it can to aid humanity in its time of crisis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I... I don&#39;t know what to say, except...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...thank you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Prometheus.</p><hr><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Not at all.<br> After all, that was my Proper Human History self, not me.</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> Now, go on. This may not be quite the reunion you had in mind, but you are welcome in my workshop, nonetheless...</p><p><strong>Synthesized Voice:</strong><br> ...you who continue to defy the gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s definitely something...similar here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that reminds me of the temple remains we saw in Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this mean this whole workshop<br> is actually your brain...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Prometheus-Hephaestus?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right; it is. In one sense,<br> I suppose it&#39;s been a long time, Chaldeans.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> As for you, God Destroyer Alliance,<br> it&#39;s nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Same here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance,<br> O god of knowledge. I mean, god of the forge\u2013</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, either is fine.<br> In my current state, I&#39;m both neither and, well, both.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, come to think of it, you sound...different.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Say, is it just me, or are you sounding less, uh, mechanical?</p><hr><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about that. If my speech patterns sound different here, it&#39;s because Prometheus&#39;s brain is the primary operator for this facility.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> In that sense, I suppose I really did die once.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Or at least, the data-based intelligence<br> that called itself Hephaestus did.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In Proper Human History, Prometheus was said to be the<br> god of knowledge who bestowed wisdom upon humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Presumably here in this Lostbelt, you managed to survive by fusing with one of the gods who fell in the Olympia Machia?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I fused with Hephaestus, who<br> had been taken prisoner after the machia ended.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> It seems I wasn&#39;t able to disclose such<br> top secret information in Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...but I take it you&#39;re sharing all your information with the alliance? That&#39;s a wise decision, Chaldeans.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, well, I&#39;m afraid we have precious little to share in that regard when it comes to the Lostbelts. Indeed, we are practically starved for information.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Umm, I haven&#39;t really been following<br> this side of things too closely...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but does this mean you&#39;re the God Destroyer Alliance<br> Collaborator we&#39;ve been hearing so much about?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I am collaborating with the alliance, yes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm, hmm. Then, in that case, I have<br> to thank you for saving our bacon.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The Seven Link Heroic Spirit Cannon<br> really helped us out a ton.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It might not have been enough to let us win with it alone, but we definitely couldn&#39;t have won without it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure we&#39;re definitely going to need the Grand Summon Article we&#39;re about to take off your hands, too.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Pardon me. If I might, there is still one more thing I&#39;d like to know.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The first time we encountered the gods of Olympus,<br> we were saved in part by a kind of dissonant noise.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I noticed it interfered directly with Olympus&#39;s independent god-made leyline, and therefore seemed quite effective against the gods...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Ahh, so you noticed that, did you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And since neither Macarios nor Adele seem to possess such a thing, I can only conclude that it belongs to you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Tell me, would we be able to borrow it from you?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Hahahahaha.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t bother. That ain&#39;t ever gonna work on &#39;em again.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I mean... Ahem.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That was a special Mystic Code that built on the heroic<br> Orpheus&#39;s musical magecraft. Unfortunately\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve used it once, we can never use it again.<br> It&#39;s just like our smoke screens.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It might not be completely useless anymore,<br> but it won&#39;t ever work that well again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t realize you&#39;d been using<br> such valuable things to help us.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, Mash. It had to be done.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Adele...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Aah! Wh-what is it?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> That little fur ball just wants to jump on you!<br> Get away from her, fur ball!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh my, what&#39;s got into you, little one? Develop a weakness for pretty faces in the short time since we last met?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If nothing else...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re still alive, Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Well, I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m \u201Calive\u201D so much as I<br> \u201Csynched up with my backup unit,\u201D but thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m really glad to see you alive and well, Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> For the time being, I can promise you<br> this unit is running just fine, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> In the meantime, I&#39;m both proud and impressed<br> that you all made your way here to Olympus.</p><hr><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> In Atlantis, you defeated Artemis and Poseidon.<br> In Olympus, you&#39;ve defeated Demeter and Aphrodite.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Now that you have triumphed over so many mechanical gods,<br> you are practically at Zeus&#39;s throat.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...What you have accomplished so<br> far is nothing short of amazing.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> There&#39;s just one more thing I&#39;d like to ask you.<br> Did Aphrodite say anything about me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In Proper Human History&#39;s mythology, Aphrodite was the goddess of love and beauty, as well as Hephaestus&#39;s wife.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I gather from your question that you had a similar relationship with her in this Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...That was a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> At this point, I&#39;m just a mind without an Aletheia.<br> I don&#39;t blame you for killing my wife at all.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> But, however she may have changed after the Olympia Machia, she is still the woman I once loved.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...She was very loving herself, once.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She said your name right before she died.</p><hr><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Now then, about the Grand Summon Article...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Damn, he sure moves on quick!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> &#39;Course he does.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nn...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Forget cold-blooded; these things don&#39;t even have blood. Just &#39;cause they might look human sometimes doesn&#39;t mean they are.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And just like people&#39;ll never know what it&#39;s like to be<br> a beast, no god&#39;ll ever know what it&#39;s like to be human.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And if one did, they&#39;d be an exception among exceptions! Really, these things are just overgrown piles of junk that happen to know a thing or two thanks to their Authority.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re a god that sprung up all natural and shit from Earth, or a mechanical god that came from space.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> They&#39;re all nothing more than containers<br> for the huge-ass power we call Authority!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So yeah, of course this guy&#39;s gonna<br> be quick as hell to move on!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think the sea can ever know how a person feels?<br> Or a freaking storm?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...&#39;Course not. And there you have it.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Caenis.<br> You must be the one who gained Poseidon&#39;s protection.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Come now, there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t be friendly.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit that Poseidon could certainly behave in...<br> less than admirable ways, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you talk to me about him!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Just hurry the hell up and give us this<br> summon thing already, you pile of scrap!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Once you hand it over, I&#39;ll end your miserable life and<br> we can all be on our merry way! Now hurry up and\u2013</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMan&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Well some little punk&#39;s feelin&#39; grumpy today.<br> Didn&#39;t get a full lunch or something?</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMan&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> If ya need a quick meal to fix<br> yourself up, you can take mine.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMan&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Oh, and watch that spear of yours. You could poke<br> somebody&#39;s eye out with that thing if you ain&#39;t careful.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You...!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You touched my spear, didn&#39;t you!? What the hell<br> are you!? An Assassin? ...No, that&#39;s not right!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Who is that? And how did they<br> sneak up on Caenis like that!?)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t sense any bloodlust or hostile intent...<br> but something about this guy feels familiar!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-is someone there!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did someone sneak up behind Caenis!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, Senpai! But, I&#39;m positive there wasn&#39;t<br> anyone else here up until a moment ago\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What is this feeling!?

A customer?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong><br> If you are, then you oughta know to mind your manners.<br> I don&#39;t do business unless I hear a \u201Cplease\u201D and \u201Cthank you.\u201D</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMan:</strong><br> In the meantime, why don&#39;tcha put<br> that big stick of yours away?</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMan:</strong><br> It ain&#39;t a bad piece of work.<br> No sense in wasting it on some old geezer like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know you...

We&#39;ve seen him before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Senji Muramasa, an Alter Ego! He&#39;s a Heroic<br> Spirit who helped Senpai back in Shimousa, and now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...he&#39;s one of the Foreign God&#39;s Disciples!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Senji Muramasa, hmm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Eesh. Maybe this is my payback for<br> spending my whole life in the forge.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Sure, I always had faith in the Tsumukari, but that alone don&#39;t explain how I ended up an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Now I&#39;m a glorified errand boy for something called the Foreign God, and if that weren&#39;t bad enough, it&#39;s made me an enemy of goddamn humanity itself. If it weren&#39;t so damn tragic, it&#39;d almost be funny.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Well, at least I got to meet a true god of the forge outta this deal...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...though my excitement sure tapered off when he turned out to be a half-fossilized gizmo! Hell, he&#39;s more like an old man who&#39;s just been around &#39;bout as long as most gods!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> You know, there&#39;s something really sad about an already old man calling you an old man. Does smithing skill just have to come with a foul mouth?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Hey now, didn&#39;t mean anything by it. How &#39;bout I give<br> that bald head of yours a good polish to make it up?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I am not bald.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Master, he seems to be... Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s definitely not like any of the other Foreign God Disciples...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe he works directly for the Foreign God...</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;re one of the Foreign<br> God&#39;s Alter Ego Disciples, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The Muramasa I knew used to complain<br> about materializing as a Saber...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...so I guess you made up for it by being an Alter Ego this time? You sure get around for an old guy.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So...what are you actually doing here? Is it just a<br> coincidence we ran into you, or is it maybe more than that?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You here lying in wait to take care of Chaldea for<br> getting in the Foreign God&#39;s way or something?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...You know, that&#39;s a good question.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I want to honor my mentor&#39;s requests, but I also<br> can&#39;t ignore my duties as a Disciple of the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So, do I settle things now, or should I be on my way... What do you think, Chrome Dome?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Hmm...<br> (Chrome Dome?)</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> So, Muramasa, my very last apprentice, and Chaldea, the<br> ones who carry on my Proper Human History self&#39;s hopes...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...share a bond even I couldn&#39;t predict, hmm.<br> As the god of knowledge, I find this fascinating...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...but it seems it has the Chaldeans on edge. Not that<br> I can blame them, given they&#39;re up against another god.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Right? Plus, that Zeus fellow said I gotta cut &#39;em in two and serve &#39;em up as an offering if I came across them...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (Alter Ego, Senji Muramasa...)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (No matter what he says about not lying in wait for us, he&#39;s still the Foreign God&#39;s Disciple, which makes him our enemy.)</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> (...I should probably think of him as a whole other Senji Muramasa, with a different Spirit Origin altogether from the one I knew, but...)</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Hey, you. Tough-looking swordswoman.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> You recognize this face or something?<br> Don&#39;t tell me you knew this body&#39;s original owner.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Nah, that probably ain&#39;t it. I&#39;m guessin&#39; you just<br> met me during a past materialization or something.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Well, whatever went on with that,<br> I ain&#39;t got a single memory of it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Still...I gotta thank you all the same.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> You must&#39;ve really liked me, seeing how you&#39;re keeping<br> your hands off your swords even under these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Haha, never would&#39;ve thought a nioh like you&#39;d go easy on an enemy standin&#39; right in front of you.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh? Isn&#39;t he our enemy?<br> Th-the hell&#39;d he just say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I believe he said...thank you...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re not our enemy after all?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Nope. Least not for now. But I ain&#39;t your ally, either,<br> so don&#39;t go getting those lines mixed up.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...The hell? What&#39;s going on here?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> No fighting? No killing? The hell do you get off saying that kinda shit after you already picked a fight!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Me? I didn&#39;t pick no fight. I just warned you<br> to take good care of that weapon of yours.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell&#39;s your deal, anyway? A kid who&#39;s old at heart? And you&#39;re in with Fujimaru and the samurai chick?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ah, forget it. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t care, and I&#39;m bored. Wake me up when things get interesting again.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I, too, know nothing of this man whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> True, I&#39;ve never met a Heroic Spirit by his name before, either. He&#39;s definitely not like the other Alter Egos, though.</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> (Nodding simultaneously)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think I give a shit if you lot agree with me or not!? Tch. I&#39;m turning into my spirit form and going to sleep!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Senji Muramasa, Alter Ego.<br> I&#39;d heard your name back in Atlantis...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but I never would have guessed you&#39;d remain neutral. Another fascinating phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If an open discussion is on the table, Mr. Muramasa,<br> there are a few things I would like to confirm with you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> For example...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...can we assume you won&#39;t be sharing your knowledge<br> of our arrival here with the other Alter Egos?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you?<br> At this moment, I&#39;m just another smithy.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be bothered to worry &#39;bout anything else<br> till I&#39;m done with the job I signed on to.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Well, we greatly appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Hold up.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey, you! The one hiding in the shadows!<br> Who might you be!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I can tell you aren&#39;t even trying to erase your presence, so why don&#39;t you come out and say hi already!?</p><p><strong>Minerva:</strong><br> Hoot, hoot, hoot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A mechanical owl!<br> And it&#39;s the same model Kadoc had with him!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That must also be the device that was<br> used to set off Orpheus&#39;s spell.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But it would seem its master today<br> is neither Kadoc nor Peperoncino.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> That sacred owl has been entrusted to me.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Good day, Chaldeans and members of the God Destroyer Alliance.

The alliance would&#39;ve fallen apart<br> some time ago if you hadn&#39;t helped us.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry.

In response, Zeus recalibrated her Divine Core, causing her to go mad.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Do you mean to say Zeus has made<br> modifications to other gods then?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Yes, he has.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> It was Zeus burning Lady Aphrodite that made her forget how to love, and caused her to lose one of her two sides.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> It is said there were four gods who stood<br> by Zeus during the Olympia Machia...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...but the reality could not be farther from the truth.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> The truth is, none of the other gods stood with Zeus.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> So he killed five of them, and brought the remaining<br> five over to his side with sheer force.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The remaining five...?<br> H-hold on, please.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The gods who survived the fourth machia...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...were Artemis, Poseidon, Demeter, Aphrodite\u2013</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> And me, Hephaestus. Though in my case,<br> Zeus chose not to destroy me completely...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...but kept my brain alive in order to<br> help run Olympus more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Though of course, for my part, I&#39;ve been synching up with Prometheus and cutting off Zeus&#39;s supervision network...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> And together, he and I became the alliance&#39;s Collaborators.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So we&#39;re talking about a god who controls<br> people AND other gods, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Yikes.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I hope you can forgive me for speaking so<br> plainly in front of you, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Of course.<br> Frankly...I have felt the same way for a long time.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Lord Zeus was so loving in Proper Human History, but...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Ahh... Here in this Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...he chose to become something truly frightening.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Now, no one can reason with him.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Not me...<br> Nor Lady Hera...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Lady Europa...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...It is still too soon to weep tears of sorrow,<br> Great Mother Europa.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Now that we are all here together at last,<br> we shall be the ones to finally slay him.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> So please, dry your tears, O loving Europa, for our God Destroyer Alliance is now joined by Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> And your tears will be much sweeter<br> when they are tears of victory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t cry, Europa.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caligula is right.

Remember, a Demi-Servant differs from a standard Servant in numerous ways.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for thinking of me, Holmes.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, we definitely can&#39;t do anything on an empty stomach, so I&#39;m all in favor of having a bite to eat!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That said, Lady Europa...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...having you personally cook for us feels<br> like it&#39;d be kind of...wrong somehow?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, wait. Were you just joking?<br> Is this some kind of Greek humor?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Hm?<br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Oh, no, no, I promise you it was no jest.<br> I truly meant it.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I may not know any cooking spells,<br> but I am fused with Lady Hera now.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> And while Lady Hera may not quite have been as skilled a cook as Lady Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, she was still the goddess of the home.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> So if nothing else, I can certainly make sure that<br> every dish will be brimming with divine protection.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Uh... I see?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll help you cook.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What she said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;d be our pleasure.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Are you sure it&#39;s okay for us to join you too,<br> Queen Europa?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Of course.<br> I&#39;m sure there will be enough food to go around.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Prometheus-Hephaestus?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Oh sure. I&#39;ve had an apprentice staying here for over a year now, so there should be more than enough for everyone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Do you mean Mr. Muramasa?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Even though he&#39;s a Heroic Spirit, he&#39;s still in the habit of eating meals regularly. When he&#39;s not smithing, he&#39;s usually making some dish or other from a place called the Far East.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> He&#39;s been using my workshop&#39;s small garden to grow soybeans and rice, and as of late, he&#39;s also been making miso and sake.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Oh my! That sounds perfect for Japanese cuisine!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never had Japanese food before!<br> Would you please tell me how to make it, Muramasa!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Well, sure, I can walk you through it while I&#39;m making my own meal... But didn&#39;t you say you were gonna do the cooking tonight?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Might as well join you. I can show you<br> how to cook rice and miso soup anytime.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Great! I&#39;m going to hold you to that!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> S-sure thing... Ugh, you&#39;re a right different sort<br> when you&#39;re not around Zeus. It&#39;s really throwing me off...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Hm? What is it?<br> You that hungry?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Is something wrong, Adele?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh, no. I was just a little lost in thought.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I still can&#39;t quite believe that Queen Europa herself was our Collaborator, or that she&#39;s going to cook for us...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Up until today,<br> I never would have even imagined such a thing.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You know, it&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I know this might sound odd, but...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...ever since you all came here,<br> I&#39;ve been remembering what it was like to enjoy myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Only remembering?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. This is just like it was ten thousand years ago.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Back when we never knew what might happen,<br> and each day wasn&#39;t yet a foregone conclusion.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Back when today was different from yesterday,<br> and you knew tomorrow would be different for today.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right, Sister. I never thought the day would<br> come when we&#39;d actually get to slay the gods...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...and I never thought I&#39;d see you standing in<br> the kitchen happily cooking away again, either.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...And it&#39;s all thanks to you guys.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash.<br> Thank you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I&#39;m so, so glad...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad we rescued you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m really glad you did, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what we would&#39;ve done without you two.</p><hr><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Are you all done talking? Then I&#39;d like everyone<br> who&#39;s willing to help to come with me, please.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Coming.<br> Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Yeah, okay, I&#39;ll help too.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Wonderful. I&#39;m thrilled to see you&#39;re all such helpful<br> children. Now let&#39;s go make something scrumptious!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the others are busy preparing dinner, I would like to check my notes on this Lostbelt against your database.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Assuming that&#39;s all right with you, of course, Prometheus-Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Me? Well, since I&#39;ve tasked my apprentice with supervising construction of the Article, I guess I&#39;ve got time to spare.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Though my mental resources are sufficient for multitasking. I can answer your questions without slowing production.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> The Grand Summon Article should be ready<br> by tomorrow morning, no problem.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> So, sage of Proper Human History,<br> what did you want to ask me?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Yes, your theory about the continent of Atlantis is<br> correct, as is your understanding of each machia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, as I suspected, you and the other gods were originally supposed to lose your true mechanical bodies during the second machia...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Exactly. About ten thousand years ago, when we fought the White Death that descended from the sky...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...it was apparently supposed to wipe out the entire prehistoric civilization, gods and humans alike. At least, in Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> But we defeated it, and in doing so, managed to keep our Aletheia\u2013or our mechanical god bodies, as you call them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Just a moment. Did you say \u201Cprehistoric civilization\u201D?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I sure did.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, that must be the lost civilization of Atlantis<br> that disappeared during the second, Leucusmachia!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> It is indeed.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> O-oh wow, this is a huge discovery!<br> Then your hypothesis was right, Holmes!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So the mystical continent of<br> Atlantis really did exist...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. So it was destroyed in the second machia, not sunk by the wrath of the gods as Plato would have it.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> My data on the great floods all comes from Proper Human History, not this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I heard there were two floods in total, but I don&#39;t know any of the details. You&#39;ll have to ask our Proper Human History counterparts about those.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Assuming you ever get a chance to meet<br> them in your future travels, of course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While the chances of summoning a demiurge-level Divine Spirit are slim, I will hope for the best.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...You know, all this talk about the<br> second machia really takes me back.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That was one of the fiercest battles I&#39;ve ever fought. The White Death that came from space was ruthless in its quest to destroy everything.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> The invader was called \u201CSefar.\u201D Or perhaps \u201CSephyr.\u201D</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From space, hmm...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Was it anything like the Foreign God, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Not at all. The Foreign God&#39;s Trees of Emptiness are<br> still comprised of a structure we can understand.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> But the White Death&#39;s structure was far beyond the<br> comprehension of any intelligence on this planet.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> But, it has nothing to do with Chaldea&#39;s endeavors, so there&#39;s no reason for you to trouble yourself about it.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> It came here for the sole purpose of destroying<br> us and this world&#39;s prehistoric civilization.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> There was no life-form on Earth that could stand<br> up to it. We gods only managed to survive...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...because Zeus succeeded at becoming an omnipotent<br> composite god right at the last moment.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Composite god?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Yes, a combination of other gods.<br> Did you not already know that?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> We mechanical gods all possess the ability to<br> combine with one another. Or we did, anyway.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> In fact, we originally all used<br> to be a single being named Chaos!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Incidentally, our survival and combat capabilities tend to improve the closer we get to our Primordial Chaos roots.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> As evidence, the previous generation of Titan-class<br> warships were even sturdier than we are.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> But Zeus... Zeus is in a class of his own!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> He is the omnipotent supreme being\u2013<br> the demiurge who wields the thunderbolts!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> He defeated the Titans, stole the Holy Vessel Cronus Crown\u2013the mark of their flagship that ties our entire pantheon together...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...and even managed to obliterate the White Death.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Yes, the only reason we Twelve Olympians were able to defeat the White Death is because Zeus served as the core of our fusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So what you are saying is...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Zeus is really, really damn strong.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Indeed. If nothing else, I can tell you that in this Lostbelt, he has wielded power capable of obliterating an enemy from beyond this very planet.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Even if he should happen to lose<br> all the other composite gods...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...he is still the greatest,<br> most powerful god of all.</p><h2 id="section-17-souls-to-be-equals-in-due-course-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-17-souls-to-be-equals-in-due-course-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 17: Souls To Be Equals in Due Course (IV)</h2><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mmm, that was so gooooood!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve eaten in all sorts of ages and places,<br> and your cooking, Lady Europa...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man, when I first got to Olympus, I never thought I&#39;d get to have such great breakfast, lunch, AND dinner every day.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, I guess I never did end up having lunch today...but this dinner more than made up for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It really was a great meal!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it was! I learned so much about both<br> good nutrition and varied flavors from it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know, I&#39;d like to try cooking myself<br> once we get back to Chaldea Base.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think I may just be able to put these<br> experiences to good use in some way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There were so many textures and flavors I&#39;d never tasted before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There really were!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was like culinary techniques that had been honed to perfection over Olympus&#39;s ten-thousand year history were concentrated in every bite...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It honestly made me feel as if<br> I was tasting history itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The bread in particular was like nothing I could have ever imagined before today...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you so much, Queen Europa!<br> This has been an invaluable experience!</p><hr><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Oh no, I didn&#39;t do anything special. I was simply copying what I&#39;ve seen others do before. Adele and Macarios did all the truly hard work.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...You are far too generous, Lady Europa.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> All we did was follow your instructions. You&#39;re a way better cook than any mere culinary student.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Most of them only care about working on<br> their so-called cutting-edge research.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Hehe. As long as you know the basics of Olympian ingredients and culinary techniques, anyone can cook like that if they put a little love into it.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Still, I do appreciate the compliment.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Thank you all so much for helping me.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> If we continue working together like this, Operation<br> God Destroyer should succeed in no time. Hurrah!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Raaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-raaah!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Neroooooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh man, I haven&#39;t heard that in a while!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Caligula...!</p><hr><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I thought it only right that I shout<br> on Caenis&#39;s behalf as well.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> She may not have shown herself for dinner, but I am sure she is nearby, watching in her spirit form.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah, now that you mention it, I guess Caenis is probably still kinda ticked.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Though I probably shouldn&#39;t let Caenis hear me say that, or she&#39;s apt to materialize just in time to bring her giant spear down on my head.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Speaking of missing people,<br> is Holmes still at it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm, hmm.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then, how much magical energy<br> will the Grand Summon consume?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Normally, a summon makes use of the mana in<br> the atmosphere and the summoner&#39;s own od.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, if we are to summon a being capable of bringing down a god...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure even this Lostbelt&#39;s extensive reserves of atmospheric mana\u2013which admittedly far surpasses anything to hand in Proper Human History\u2013will suffice.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So if we&#39;re to complete this Grand Summon, as the Heroic Spirits called it, I presume we&#39;ll need to augment our magical energy supply somehow?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Of course you will.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Strictly speaking, this summoning ritual doesn&#39;t use a<br> summoner. Given its vast magical energy requirements...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve designed it to make use of<br> the infinity crystal above Olympus.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Have you now?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> More accurately, I&#39;ve designed it to access the infinity crystal through the Olympians&#39; own god-made leyline, thereby providing us with an inexhaustible supply of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> We will use the enemy&#39;s own power against them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...The god-made leyline.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That&#39;s the leyline that&#39;s kept completely<br> under the gods&#39; close supervision.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our spells weren&#39;t able to so much as touch it, but that won&#39;t be the case for you. Then, does that mean that the god-made leyline was\u2013</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;m the one who made it, even if I only did so reluctantly and under Zeus&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I suspected as much.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> So yes, I know all there is to know about the god-made<br> leyline, right down to its unusual vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Vulnerability, you say?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> The leyline may be an invisible magical energy network that serves as a transcendent source of magical energy, but since it was never completed, it&#39;s also full of holes.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Its greatest vulnerability is the fact that<br> it exists in spaces all throughout Olympus.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> By placing special spells and formations at these spaces, we&#39;re able to draw a truly massive summoning circle that covers all of Olympus, even as the gods remain none the wiser!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That is the summoning circle that lays at the heart of the operation, and they are the very spells that you, and the Heroic Spirits of the alliance, have already put in place.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Sounds like they&#39;re having a pretty, um...involved conversation.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to get some night air. A little walk to help my digestion ought to be just the thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous outside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. At this depth, the underground passages<br> are sure to be patrolled by autonomous weapons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going outside, I&#39;ll come with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I will too, Senpai. At this depth, the underground<br> passages are bound to be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no telling how many autonomous<br> weapons may be stationed nearby.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Old man Prometheus-slash-Hephaestus cut off their<br> connection to the surveillance network, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then, like I said, this ought to be<br> just the thing to help my digestion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be fine, I promise. If I really think I&#39;m in trouble, I&#39;ll hightail it out of there immediately.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I might have reached the void, but I&#39;m still an unscrupulous swordfighter at heart. I&#39;m not gonna challenge an opponent I know I can&#39;t beat!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s walk time.<br> Be back soon!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...You know you guys didn&#39;t<br> have to come with me, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Or are you just here on a hunch or something?<br> Well, Adele? Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Fujimaru and Mash were right.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous to walk along<br> these underground passages alone.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Besides...I couldn&#39;t help but notice<br> that Muramasa wasn&#39;t at dinner.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> At first, I thought he might be at the back<br> of the workshop, but he wasn&#39;t there, either.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ahahahaha.<br> Sounds like we&#39;re thinking along the same lines.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You hear that, Lord Muramasa? I know you can.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got things to talk about you don&#39;t want the Chaldeans overhearing, so I came to pay you a visit myself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Figured you&#39;d show up here, but I didn&#39;t<br> expect those twins to come along, too.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Just to be clear, I don&#39;t got anything to talk about.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh? That&#39;s too bad, because I sure do. And it&#39;s got<br> something to do with how insanely dangerous you are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I know you said you were staying neutral earlier,<br> but the moment you hand the Article over to Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re planning to cut [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]<br> in two on the spot, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...Well, yeah. When you finish one job,<br> you move on to the next, right?</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> That fake priest Rasputin gave me two jobs to<br> do as part of my Foreign God Disciple duties.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> The first was to protect Prometheus-Hephaestus in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Apparently, as the god of knowledge and the forge, his<br> skills are essential to keeping Olympus running smoothly.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> And since old Zeus signed off on that job,<br> I got no reason to refuse it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> The second job was to destroy Hephaestus in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Those would seem to be at, um, cross purposes...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> That one was all Zeus. Said he forbade Chaldea<br> and Hephaestus from coming into contact!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> And taking Hephaestus out was the quickest<br> and easiest way to ensure they didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> But, killing a god&#39;s still a big deal even in Atlantis,<br> and not even Lord Odysseus there could go through with it.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So that&#39;s where we came in.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Rasputin demolished the Proper Human History Heroic<br> Spirits while I cut the forge god&#39;s main unit clean in two.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That&#39;s terrible...<br> So here, you kept Hephaestus safe\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And elsewhere, you killed him, huh.<br> What the hell&#39;s the sense in that?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I told ya I cut &#39;em in two. Didn&#39;t say nothing about killing.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Though I did say that Hephaestus<br> had been destroyed in my report.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, what exactly does that mean?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...All right, here&#39;s the deal.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Prometheus-Hephaestus is incredibly skilled...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...but he&#39;s also the stubbornest<br> old mule I&#39;ve ever met.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Said he wanted to make a summoner thingamabob and<br> was gonna blow himself up unless I helped him.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t let him since it was my job to protect him and all, so I agreed to the apprenticeship until the gizmo was done.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> After that, he said his own manipulators were too old and decrepit for delicate work or some such, and wasted no time putting me to work.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> And one of those odd jobs...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...involved going to Atlantis to fetch his backup data.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Said he needed an additional brain<br> to finish making the Article.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Bunch of bull, eh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hehe, are you kidding me? That&#39;s ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> First you follow the order by cutting him in half, then you go get his backup to effectively bring him back to life!</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That sounds like something out of a comedy routine.<br> You&#39;re a real scamp, Grandpa!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Anyway...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I take it that means you liked Hephaestus so much you were willing to really stick your neck out for him?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...Ugh. We might not agree on most things...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...but that Greek god of the forge&#39;s work&#39;s so<br> good it damn near brings a tear to my eye.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Is that so...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Anyway, there was one other thing Zeus ordered me to do that didn&#39;t have anything to do with Hephaestus.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Get rid of you lot.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So once I finish this job,<br> that&#39;s the next one I gotta take care of.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Aint no sense in doing things outta order. Gotta do my jobs one at a time to make sure they&#39;re done right.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> It ain&#39;t like I&#39;m ignoring the Foreign<br> God&#39;s orders or betraying Zeus.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So, does that mean...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re ignoring Zeus&#39;s commands<br> until the Article is finished?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> &#39;Course. Ain&#39;t like Zeus is paying me for this job. I&#39;m just playing along with him &#39;cause they say he&#39;s the big Buddha in charge here.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh my!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yikes. Never thought I&#39;d ever feel sorry for Zeus,<br> but I guess there&#39;s a first time for everything.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...That being said,<br> it does feel like it&#39;s time for me to move on.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I might be able to handle Chaldea on my own,<br> but deep down, I&#39;m just a swordsmith.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> No way I could take on Chaldea, Musashi, Caligula, and<br> Caenis all at the same time, so I&#39;ll try my luck elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, now that you lot showed up, the Great<br> Prometheus-Hephaestus Workshop&#39;s all but done for.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> I&#39;d take the summon whatsit somewhere deep soon as you get your hands on it, before others come a-callin.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re going to leave us alone? I mean, that&#39;s great and all, but what about finishing the summon thing!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> You don&#39;t gotta worry about that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> It might not be done tonight, but I&#39;ve<br> set it up so it&#39;ll get done by morning.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Well, see you &#39;round.<br> Don&#39;t forget to give my regards to the Chaldea kid.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Uh, yeah, will do.<br> Take care.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Wait. You mean you&#39;re leaving right this second!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Aye. Rasputin&#39;s supervising the Crypters, and Ashi\u2013I mean, Limbo&#39;s is to keep an eye on the Lostbelt kings...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...but my job doesn&#39;t really begin until<br> this Foreign God guy actually shows up.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Apparently, I&#39;m supposed to be their butler or something. Anyway, if I&#39;m going to do that job right, I can&#39;t go letting myself get defeated now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> In the meantime, might as well work<br> on getting the big god some clothes.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> &#39;Cause if what they say is true,<br> they&#39;re gonna arrive here buck naked!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s just here as an arbiter. She can&#39;t do<br> anything to you, and she wouldn&#39;t even if she could.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Oh, and one last thing.<br> You two&#39;re the last alliance survivors, right?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> This might not be my place...but don&#39;t go throwing<br> your lives away like them Satsuma Hayato folk did.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t no point in winning a war if<br> it ends up costing you your soul.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> &#39;Course, that&#39;s just one man&#39;s opinion. I might be old, but I know I&#39;m a hell of a lot younger than you two, so I won&#39;t insist you listen to me.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re talking about,<br> but I do appreciate your concern for us.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So thanks for that, foreign smithy.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And thanks for showing our great god of the forge\u2013the last decent god in this whole kingdom...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...the kind of respect that even we couldn&#39;t give him.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Hey now, it&#39;s nothing like that. Like I said, he just<br> turned out to be even more of a stubborn old man than me.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to thank you too, Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> And...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I promise I&#39;ll remember your warning<br> right to our final moments.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...That so.

And as for the Grand Summon&#39;s final catalyst\u2013</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> That will not be a problem.<br> Consider that matter solved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean you already have a catalyst ready to go?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Haha, worry not, shield-maiden. I would not let<br> us come this far while we still lack a catalyst.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Rest assured, I will take care of it. And when the time comes to face this so-called omnipotent King of the Gods, I will show you something miraculous.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...Even with my capacity for calculation, I can&#39;t say what will happen once Aether has been activated, or how well the summoned being will fare against an omnipotent god.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> At this point, we are well into<br> the realm of the unknown.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Nonetheless, I can say this:<br> your chances for victory are nonzero.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> So as long as you keep that in mind\u2013</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...Oh.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I should have asked sooner: Does the<br> concept of zero exist in Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes, most assuredly.<br> We&#39;ve known about it since at least the third century.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I daresay we also have a fairly deep understanding of the concept. In fact, Ms. Miyamoto over there is something of an expert on it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Oho, fascinating. A mathematician or philosopher would be one thing, but I never would have thought a swordfighter could reach such an understanding.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> A scholar would no doubt use their understanding to pass the concept on to other people as knowledge, but for a swordfighter to understand zero...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> I see. Then you must have attained it as a skill,<br> rather than as knowledge.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Zero. The line that lies between positive and negative.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> A number smaller than any decimal,<br> and greater than any negative number.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> It is the void\u2013 the lack of existence.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...I see. The fact that you reached such an understanding with the sword just goes to show you humans truly are an unsolvable mystery.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, it was nothing.<br> I just happened to get lucky. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> My old man used to go on and on about how he was the<br> strongest in the world, and how nobody could surpass him...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So I figured, since the only number that could surpass<br> \u201Cone\u201D was \u201Cnone,\u201D that was what I had to strive for.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s pretty amazing that I actually pulled it off, if I do say so myself! Not every swordfighter could empty their mind as fast as I did!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s confident today!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s the Musashi I know and depend on.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey, I could never leap into enemy territory without<br> looking if I didn&#39;t think I could handle myself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aether here might be our trump card for the final showdown, but it&#39;s still my job to make sure we get that far.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And knowing you&#39;ve got someone else on hand to do the heavy lifting means I can really cut loose, in multiple senses!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re very modest, aren&#39;t you, Musashi? I think I&#39;m<br> starting to understand what makes you so strong.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You always walk a fine line between<br> trying too hard and not trying enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re open and honest with everyone,<br> without ever looking down on anyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I used to think of bushi and samurai as a kind<br> of warrior class particular to Japan...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But when I look at you, Musashi, I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... I&#39;m not quite sure how to say this...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You think I&#39;m a real badass?<br> Aww, thanks.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I am something of a freewheeling, happy-go-lucky warrior, so I think, deep down, I&#39;m really a lot like you guys.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Hehe. Very nice.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> You&#39;re all the very picture of<br> warriors brimming with hope!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Even as you are about to face Zeus himself, your smiles are unwavering! You truly make me think that if anyone can make this happen, you can!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> You know, Queen Europa, at first, I thought<br> this gamble would be all risk and no reward...</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...but I see that, even if my calculations say their odds of victory are zero, these people may just be able to pull it off.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Oh, their chance of winning is certainly not zero.<br> Of that, I have no doubt.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Hey, forge god?<br> Sorry to interrupt, but I&#39;ve got a question.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You said this workshop is cut off from the outside...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...and the only way in is through a door in the<br> underground passage that&#39;s been partitioned off, right?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then can you tell what&#39;s going on outside that door?</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> Hold on. I&#39;ll run a periphery scan now\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The outside partition was just blown to pieces!<br> Master!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Damn, I was too slow! Mash! Fujimaru!<br> Make sure we&#39;ve got a way out of here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Over here, Fou! You&#39;ll be safer inside my storage<br> space than you will on my shoulder!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> This magical energy feels as though it were burning. It has this Lostbelt&#39;s unique scent, and the gods&#39; unmistakable intimidating presence...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> But that is not all.<br> I also sense something unutterably foul here now...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Be careful, all of you!<br> There is a darkness here among us!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...My, my. How lovely to see you all here.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I suppose it&#39;s been some time since we last met,<br> fine members of Chaldea. And you, Queen Europa.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh yes, and I can&#39;t forget you,<br> members of the God Destroyer Alliance.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I must say, you&#39;ve put up quite a valiant struggle against the gods.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I suppose I should introduce myself, yes? I am but a<br> humble monk\u2013a Heroic Spirit named Caster of Limbo.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> There you are, scumbag.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I remember you, and how your good looks are completely wasted on that head that keeps regrowing no matter how many times I cut it off! What are you up to here in Olympus?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ah, screw it. I don&#39;t even care!<br> Your ominous aura tells me everything I need to know!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oho! My, my, if it isn&#39;t my beloved Shinmen Musashi!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, yes, I remember you too, and how very many times you&#39;ve thwarted my designs in the past!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What a shame that your vaunted Heavenly Eye is apparently so blind that it failed to even notice the spell thread I bound to the queen&#39;s garments!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> You... You tracked me with my own garments!?<br> How dare you, you...barbaric god!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Yes! Yes, that&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Your mewling sympathy for your home in Proper Human History was easily exploitable. Mmm, how utterly disgraceful!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Whatever you may have been plotting\u2013and plotting you were, by the looks of it\u2013it all ends now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a touch early for curtains.<br> In fact, I think we have just begun a whole new act.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Ah, but there I must disagree.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment<br> for quite some time now.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I&#39;m quite aware of everything happening here. In fact, I only refrained from acting sooner because...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...I was waiting for this Grand Summon<br> Article of yours to be completed.</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I can only imagine what lovely sounds you&#39;ll make when<br> you witness it shattering before your very eyes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You are just the absolute worst.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Limbo, you bastard!</p><hr><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, how very kind of you to say so!</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> ...My great workshop is like my home. It should have no<br> trouble detecting a spell from a single Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Prometheus-Hephaestus:</strong><br> What are you, really?<br> You&#39;re not a proper Heroic Spirit at all.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Detect? You thought you could detect my spell?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Why, of course you couldn&#39;t. Not when all<br> of my spells have been blessed by our god!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Ah, I should clarify. When I speak of god in this case, I am not referring to the gods of Olympus, but rather\u2013</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> You talk too much, barbarian.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Yes, he does.<br> Shall we kill them now, Big Brother?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Ahh, yes, I do hope you&#39;ll forgive me! Very well then,<br> I will leave the massacre to you two.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> After all, it would be quite absurd for a Disciple of the Foreign God to clean up a mess brought about by negligence on your family&#39;s behalf!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> ...Hmph. That&#39;s right, it would be.

You thought I&#39;m the one who<br> didn&#39;t belong among the gods?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You got balls saying that to my face after Kirschtara ground your asses into the dirt like it was nothing! Did you forget how you had to go crying to big daddy Zeus, pleading for your lives?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You got the great Caenis to deal with, and you dumb shits stay focused on these weaklings...

Mere magical energy light from an ordinary<br> Heroic Spirit can never hope to match ours.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Dioscuri, gods of light. They may indeed move at near-light speed, but it seems they aren&#39;t capable of nullifying all forms of light directed at them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Does that mean they have openings we can take advantage of?<br> As they say nowadays, the jury is still out.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Stay out of my way, Trench Coat!

From this point on,<br> no matter what you do, you will die!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Either we gods will tear you to pieces...<br> or you&#39;ll be destroyed along with this Lostbelt!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> So then, why!?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Why do you two\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Because both my brother and I believe...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...that a real tomorrow would be<br> far better than an endless today.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Heh... What a joke.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Now that Hades is gone, and there is no one left to ensure the souls of the dead find new lives, death is truly the end. Don&#39;t you see that!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah... We see it.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But even so, I...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We...</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...want to finally see a tomorrow<br> that&#39;s different than yesterday.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> Ahh...<br> Big...Brother...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The two enemy Servants&#39; magical energy is rapidly<br> vanishing. They&#39;re about to disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Quietly nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The Dioscuri certainly had a tough Spirit Origin, but it seems our attacks finally reached their Divine Core.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Behold what has transpired here.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> You both said it was impossible, but it was none other<br> than humans of Olympus who shattered your Divine Core.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> ...So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Very well then, humans, keep pushing your luck. Go ahead and forge your path to a future where only despair awaits!</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> And know that it will never be anything more than a single step\u2013right into a dead end!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Be that as it may...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We still don&#39;t want to live in a world where every day is like the one that came before.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Even if oblivion is the only thing waiting for us,<br> we still want to see a new tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...And there you have it. The Dioscuri have vanished,<br> and Prometheus-Hephaestus has completely shut down.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But Chaldea is still alive and well...<br> along with the two God Destroyer Alliance members.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh, and Caenis is still working with them, too.<br> She must be preeetty peeved at you for forsaking her.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes, I suppose he would be.<br> I cannot blame him for feeling that way, either.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course I can&#39;t imagine an apology from me would be met with anything other than a demand that I shut up.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!? You are a lot less<br> bothered by this than I expected!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I do feel bad for what happened to the Dioscuri, though. I wish I&#39;d been able to better get through to them.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Huh? What do you mean? I thought you<br> and the Dioscuri got along swimmingly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> We may have gotten along, but we never truly understood<br> one another. They hated humans too much for that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I told them I was going to make a new Age of Gods,<br> and even revealed my friendship with Zeus...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...but they simply weren&#39;t able<br> to discern what it is I seek.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And for my part, I wasn&#39;t prepared to face the full extent of their hatred.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You know, perhaps Fujimaru would have done a better<br> job than me of getting to the heart of their weakness<br> being their hatred for humans.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But the Dioscuri worshipped the ground Zeus walked on.<br> As his friend, didn&#39;t they look up to you as well?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That&#39;s different. They never got as far as forgiving humans. They only accepted me because Zeus did.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...You know, now that I think about it,<br> I wish I hadn&#39;t fought them in front of Zeus.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I doubt things would have turned out this way if they<br> hadn&#39;t had Zeus acting as judge in the background.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hey, what&#39;s done is done. You can&#39;t expect anything<br> and everything to go perfectly, even for you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So let&#39;s just forget the past and focus on the present.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> With Caenis and Dioscuri gone,<br> you&#39;ve lost almost every soldier at your command.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Are you sure you&#39;re in good<br> enough shape for the endgame?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Now that Zeus has lost Demeter and Aphrodite,<br> he won&#39;t hesitate to use the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> We both know Tree of Emptiness Magellan is currently the single biggest pool of magical energy on this entire planet.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But us Crypters are supposed to be the ones to use it.<br> We can&#39;t let Zeus get his hands on it first.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> And that means when the chips are down,<br> your alliance with Zeus will fall apart.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So doesn&#39;t that mean your greatest adversary isn&#39;t Chaldea, but Zeus protecting the Tree of Emptiness?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oh, I wouldn&#39;t put it that way. My greatest<br> adversary certainly continues to be Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I used up one of the last two times<br> I planned to personally fight on them.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame how that battle turned out.<br> Fujimaru was just too amped up to think straight.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] had held [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] ground as resolutely<br> as I heard [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] did in the Temple of Time...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...it would have been a much closer call for me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The truth is, in practice, there wasn&#39;t much difference<br> between Fujimaru&#39;s and my combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> [\u2642 His /\u2640\uFE0F Her] various exploits to date have<br> proven that beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I&#39;m still a lot more scared of you and your ability to say so. It shows you know you&#39;ve easily got the upper hand.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...If you say so. At any rate, whether or not<br> we have a rematch is entirely up to them.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already promised Zeus that I would fight him last.<br> It&#39;s even part of our contract.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You see, a rematch to decide the fate of this world<br> of gods was his condition for cooperating.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Rather heartwarming, isn&#39;t it? I guess not even the King of the Gods could permit a loss to stand.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Huh, that&#39;s a surprise. I never would&#39;ve thought the great and mighty Zeus would have such, well, human motivations.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course he would. No one lacking that quality would take on the task of being the god who leads humanity.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Which is why I pity him for the decision he is about to have to make.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Namely, the choice of what to do about Queen Europa,<br> and her betrayal of Olympus.</p><h2 id="section-18-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-18-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 18: I Am the Thunder that Smites Stars (I)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Directly beneath the Fifth Tree of Emptiness, Magellan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Interstellar Mountainous City Olympus.

Whatever you<br> decide, I urge you to make your choice quickly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So, you think we should make up<br> our minds soon, Emperor Caligula?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Indeed I do, shield-maiden.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Right now, our ultimate objective<br> is to cut down the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And to do that, we&#39;ll also need to slay Zeus.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Of course, we know what will<br> happen if we&#39;re successful.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Cutting down the Tree of Emptiness will end this Lostbelt, causing all of Olympus to disappear...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...and Adele and me&#39;ll probably both end up dying.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve never been able to observe from the inside exactly what happens to a Lostbelt when it disappears from Earth...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...so I can&#39;t say for sure what will happen...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But... Yes. We expect everything will disappear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And the chance of any life-forms<br> inside the Lostbelt surviving is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...vanishingly small...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. We understand.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> The gods once told us that the destruction of the Tree<br> of Emptiness would mean the death of all of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We knew that, and we still chose to<br> remain in the God Destroyer Alliance.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Even if we are all going to<br> die anyway once we succeed...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Queen Europa doesn&#39;t deserve to be executed.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> She should at least have a more...dignified death...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...No. No, that&#39;s not it. That&#39;s not really how I feel.<br> That&#39;s only a pretext. An excuse!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Everyone in Olympus gave up on being a father, or a mother, or any other kind of parental figure long ago!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> They&#39;re all just things to be protected! Mindless reeds who never think about anything besides prostrating themselves before the gods!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But...something about Lady Europa...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...reminded me of my mother.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. So she doesn&#39;t see humans like you and<br> Ms. Adele as mere things to be protected...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but rather, as children whom she wants<br> to learn and grow, as a true parent would.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I know we only spent a tiny bit<br> of time with her last night, but...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...when I saw her grieving the ten thousand years we spent in stagnation, and how she and Adele laughed together...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...for a moment,<br> it felt like I was looking at our mother again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your mother...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah. As far as Olympus is concerned... No, that&#39;s not<br> it. As far as we&#39;re concerned, Queen Europa is the<br> last mother to ever look out for us!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> She&#39;s the last person who ever wished for a future where we could learn and grow! That&#39;s why I\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I want to witness the Tree of Emptiness&#39;s destruction,<br> and face our final moments with her. Together.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Your final moments, huh?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s how we feel.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Sister...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I feel the same way, Macarios.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> There is dignity in death.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> As an Anti-Hero who stole that dignity<br> from far too many people, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...I too would ask that you grant their wish.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> So that the end of all things past may at least be a peaceful one.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Indeed, that is also the wish held by the many lives I stole\u2013lives that were lost thousands of years ago, and whose wish even now resonates firmly within my soul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> G-gnnn...<br> Gnnnnnn...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I don&#39;t get it! I just don&#39;t get it!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I could never make a choice that I knew would result in my death! Hell, I don&#39;t even want to THINK about making one! Or to remember that such choices even exist!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But, that being said...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I would never reject another&#39;s choice made under such circumstances. Neither would I mock or deride it. I just find it very...sad.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And I do understand that, if there was only one thing one could ask for in their final moments...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...it would be to share those moments<br> with someone precious to them.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-well, not me, of course! Certainly not me! As a mage, my mind easily transcends such mundane human concerns!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> At any rate... Very well, Adele and Macarios.<br> I understand how you feel.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So I think, under the circumstances\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go stop Queen Europa&#39;s execution.</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Right. Exactly. Besides, you two have done<br> nothing but help us ever since we arrived.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And while I&#39;d like to reward you, at the moment, I can&#39;t even present you with a single freshly-baked croissant.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So, er, while this will undoubtedly be risky, if this is the best reward the God Destroyer Alliance could ask for...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...then we at Chaldea are more than willing to help!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Hang on. You already agreed!? Why couldn&#39;t you<br> have let me finish my little speech first!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry about that, Director. And thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Because I was already sure you&#39;d agree.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You guys...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thank you so much.<br> We know we&#39;re being very selfish, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Selfish my ass.<br> You don&#39;t need to thank us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, we know plenty well by now how far you<br> two are willing to go for what you believe in.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I barely remember what my own mother looked like, but if I could, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have wanted to protect her, too.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So yeah, no way we were gonna ignore your request and go our separate ways after everything you&#39;ve done for us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> It seems like you&#39;ve reached an agreement. Then our next stop is Great Orbital Shrine Olympia Dodona!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Finally, Operation God Destroyer&#39;ll be takin&#39; the fight to the enemy! You guys better not mess up this last part!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Now, now, we want to encourage them,<br> not discourage them. Good luck, everyone.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Aww yeah, it&#39;s time for the final golden attack!<br> Let&#39;s go teach that asshole Zeus a thing or two!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...But first.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Caenis!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Oh, you finally wrapped up the sappy crap? &#39;Bout damn time! Also, y&#39;know, your samurai intuition or whatever can be kinda creepy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-Caenis!? You were in your spirit form!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Pick up your damn shield!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...You sense that? There&#39;s official guards headed<br> into every damn room in the underground!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I knew those Dioscuri bastards<br> must&#39;ve tipped them off about us!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Check it out! They&#39;re crawling up our<br> collective ass even as we speak!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caenis is right! ...I&#39;m picking up dozens of clearly<br> hostile magical energy signals near the alliance base!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou, fou!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Targets spotted!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> There you are, vile Chaldeans!<br> I see the God Destroyer Alliance is here, too!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> Listen up, you scum. Do what we say, and we&#39;ll<br> grant you the mercy of a painless death.</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> But, if you should show the slightest hint of resistance, we will bring the full force of the Olympus Official Guard down upon your heads!</p><p><strong>Olympus Official Guard:</strong><br> What is your answer!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get ready to fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone, get ready! We&#39;re gonna push through!</p><hr><p><strong>R\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Understood!</p><p><strong>R\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Activating Ortinax&#39;s emergency combat mode. Engaging auto-maintenance functionality. Output at sixty\u2013seventy. Stabilized at just over seventy percent.</p><p><strong>R\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> The Aegis&#39;s protection is still in effect.<br> Commencing battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...All hostiles have temporarily disappeared.<br> We&#39;ve subdued the guards!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Ha! These guards are nothing now! Ahhhhaha!<br> I must&#39;ve gotten even stronger than I was before!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> We all know they&#39;re just as tough as ever, Caenis. We just happen to have momentum on our side at the moment.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But that won&#39;t be the case if we have to face two more waves in here, so we&#39;d better git while the gittin&#39;s good!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I know! I just felt like saying it!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And why the hell do you talk so weirdly sometimes?<br> Cut it out! It gets on my nerves!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aww, now whatcha got against cowgirls?<br> We ain&#39;t nothin&#39; if not charmin&#39; as all git-out!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have to abandon this base! Come on, we can get<br> to the surface from the southern corridor! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Nikola Tesla. Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> ...<br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Well...this doesn&#39;t look good.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid our circuits were<br> damaged during that battle.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> I hate to say it, but it seems this is as far as we go.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> But please, don&#39;t worry about us, my lady.<br> We&#39;ve already said our goodbyes.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> At least, our Heroic Spirit selves have.<br> Remember, we&#39;re just A.I.s using their personas.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Indeed, and they certainly couldn&#39;t program<br> emotions into us on top of everything else!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> So while we may not feel sad at this parting, it was still an honor to have fought by your sides, even if we are only heartless A.I.s!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Not at all. The honor was all ours!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, everyone!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Farewell, Master of Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope we&#39;ll all get to see each other again someday.</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I just tell you!? We&#39;re A.I.s, not Heroic Spirits! We&#39;re not going to be summoned again like\u2013</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Wait, of course you already know that! Yes, we agree. It would be wonderful to see each other again someday!</p><p><strong>A.I.:</strong><br> Well, goodbye, Master of Chaldea! Take care!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently directly underneath central Altartown! We should be able to see the Great Orbital Shrine up in the sky once we reach the surface!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Our first step will be to escape to the surface, while<br> our second will be to use the aircraft to take flight!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From there, we&#39;ll make our way directly to the shrine!<br> Will that work, Macarios!?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t be a problem!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hey! Mustache!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A-are you talking to me!? What is it?<br> Do you have an issue with my decision?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Nah. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t make that call lightly.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;d just agreed to go along on the spur of the moment &#39;cause the twins&#39; speech moved you or some crap, then I&#39;d be smashing your fat face in!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But nah, you were actually<br> weirdly persuasive back there.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Hey. Goredolf Musik!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Y-you used my name? What is it now!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Once we leave the base,<br> we&#39;re gonna be fighting off enemies left and right.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So since we might not get another chance to talk,<br> I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say this now.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I WILL kill Zeus. On that, you have my word.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And when I do...we&#39;ll officially be even.<br> You good with that!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Absolutely! That sounds more than acceptable!<br> Good luck, Caenis!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Also, once you all take to the skies,<br> we&#39;ll be right behind you in the Storm Border!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Oho. So the Storm Border will be joining the fray as well! Now it&#39;s truly starting to feel like the final showdown is upon us.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While I doubt we&#39;ll be able to control the skies<br> completely, w-we can at least throw them into confusion!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We CAN do that much, right, Technical Advisor?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah we can. I personally guarantee it. At long last,<br> it&#39;s time for us to take to the skies of Olympus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re back! But what do you mean, take to the skies!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Captain&#39;s just about back up on his feet now, too. From here on, the Storm Border will be here to back you guys up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, we need to get it rebooted, but once we do that, we&#39;ll be ready to unveil its special flight capabilities!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Which means the next time we see each other,<br> it&#39;ll be up in the big blue yonder!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So make sure you survive long enough to take flight, and we&#39;ll do our best to survive long enough to reach the Great Orbital Shrine&#39;s airspace!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, Kadoc, but...<br> We&#39;ve got wyverns!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Are you kidding me!? I JUST defeated a Servant!<br> I&#39;m running on fumes here!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oh, I see. Fortunately, I still have a<br> little magical energy to spare, myself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh, is that so!? Must be nice for you, being a hotshot<br> elite with magical circuits out your ass!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Dammit, what the hell&#39;s with all those wyverns?<br> I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re actually blotting out the sky!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Not even the tropiest of tropey blockbusters would resort to a played out clich\xE9 like this! What&#39;re two Masters alone supposed to do against numbers like that!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You said it! I would expect the French of all people<br> to go with something more avant-garde!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What the hell kinda snark is that!? Just because I&#39;m using movie comparisons doesn&#39;t mean you should too!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Oh come on, now you&#39;re sulking!? I&#39;m the one who feels like sulking! Ugh, come on, let&#39;s just get out of here! There&#39;s no way we can win!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> First, we&#39;re gonna find a leyline, then we&#39;re gonna summon a Servant and start fighting back! Got that, Wodime!?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure as hell not giving up without a fight. We can&#39;t afford to lose, not with all of humanity counting on us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I already took my tendency to whine and my inferiority complex and tossed &#39;em in the Seine yesterday, so I&#39;m ready to do this thing, one way or another!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Yes. Exactly, Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re a much stronger, and more obstinate,<br> mage than you give yourself credit for.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Good grief... Just our luck that this one would be<br> Rome where seasoned emperors are alive and well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I wonder if the Five Good Emperors are here too?<br> I&#39;ve always secretly admired Emperor Hadrian...</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I warn you to keep that sort<br> of fanboying to a minimum, Wodime?</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> As if what you babbled about<br> in France wasn&#39;t bad enough.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> \u201CHold on, Ophelia. If we use the Arc de Triomphe as<br> a catalyst, do you think we could summon Napoleon?\u201D</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t believe it. Besides, that Singularity was in 1431, and the Arc de Triomphe de l&#39;\xC9toile wasn&#39;t built until 1836.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> So it wouldn&#39;t even have been there in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure. If history becomes muddled<br> in Singularities, why not space-time, too?</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> Please try to take this seriously.<br> Whatever happened to your usual coolheaded self?</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> All right, listen up. I&#39;ll handle direct combat.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> You&#39;ll handle things like negotiating with the locals,<br> ascertaining the situation, and coming up with plans.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> Any objections?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not at all. You&#39;re much more capable in battle than<br> I am, so I&#39;m happy to let you take care of it.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> ...Ugh, I swear. I didn&#39;t even know you<br> were capable of being so accommodating.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> Do I really have to remind you that we&#39;re the last two<br> Masters who have been entrusted with restoring humanity?</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> This is the whole reason we were invited to Chaldea.<br> We can&#39;t afford to make so much as a single mistake.</p><p><strong>Ophelia:</strong><br> So let&#39;s go do what we came here to do, Wodime.<br> ...It&#39;s our duty.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Come now, Hinako. You should know better than to go<br> out on the deck without taking proper precautions.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After all, you&#39;re... Well, you know what you are, right? Won&#39;t you drown the moment you fall into the sea?</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> ...I think the you-know-whats you&#39;re talking about that can&#39;t handle running water are a Western thing.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> Whatever the case, it has no bearing on me. I do know what I am, and it isn&#39;t what you seem to think.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> I&#39;m just an ordinary mage\u2013a Master like any other. You know that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been presenting myself all this time.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> ...If you knew my secret all along,<br> why are you only now bringing it up?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I wish I could take credit for figuring it out<br> sooner, but I can&#39;t. I honestly had no idea.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I knew you were hiding something, of course...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...but I didn&#39;t realize you were a... you-know-what<br> until this Singularity. It was quite the shock.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I never would have guessed you were hiding something this... Well, I don&#39;t know if \u201Cserious\u201D is the right word, but it&#39;s certainly fascinating.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> Fascinating my foot!<br> This is a matter of life and death for me, you know!?</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> Also, when did you get to be so insensitive!? I could&#39;ve sworn you were a lot more tactful back at Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re right; I shouldn&#39;t have<br> been so careless with someone else&#39;s secrets.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I suppose this Singularity just feels so open and liberating compared to the others we&#39;ve seen so far that I ended up being a bit more...freewheeling than usual.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve both been putting on an act then?<br> ...Now it&#39;s my turn to be shocked.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> I had no idea you were such a good listener. ...You<br> remind me of someone I once knew a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> He always acted and spoke like a perfect noble, yet he was surprisingly easygoing and soft on the inside.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> He was too kind for his own good, too. So much that he<br> ended up poisoning himself just to keep the peace around him.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you&#39;re really like too, are you sure we&#39;ll be okay going forward? You do know we&#39;re the only ones left who can restore humanity, right?</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> Well, not that it matters much to me either way. I couldn&#39;t care less if human history keeps going or not.</p><p><strong>Akuta Hinako:</strong><br> So if I ever get bored of all this and bail,<br> you&#39;ll have to figure out the rest all on your own.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to believe there&#39;s a Singularity in London as well. Even the Mage&#39;s Association is nowhere to be found.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> At least it looks like the Clock Tower underground is<br> still the same. What do you make of this mist, Beryl?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> It&#39;s definitely not cursed.<br> This toxic fog is based in science.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I&#39;d bet there&#39;s a giant boiler or something belching it out somewhere. I mean, we&#39;re dealing with the Industrial Revolution now, yeah?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Man, my old lady hated that age with a passion.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Said it made her little house in the<br> woods even more unbearable to live in.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What about you?<br> Is this mist affecting your magical circuits?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Aww, thanks, Kirsch! I didn&#39;t know you cared!<br> But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m totally fine.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> My old lady&#39;s the only one who hated consumer culture.<br> Me, I&#39;m A-OK with it.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Trust me, when it comes to settling scores, I&#39;ll take a<br> trusty pistol over finicky magecraft any day of the week.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> True, I have to agree with you there. But only as long as your opponent is vulnerable to firearms.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Yeah...that&#39;s a good point.<br> It&#39;s pretty much all ghosts and automata here.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Whatever, I guess I can act like a mage<br> and do some actual magecraft for once.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> All right, Kirsch, since most bad guys tend to make their hideouts underground, let&#39;s go find the nearest subway station so we can crush &#39;em and move on.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I gotta say though, between the two of us,<br> I&#39;m not too worried.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Sure, I was kind of shocked when I found out the rest of the team had been killed, but as long as you&#39;re around, I figure we&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> But watch yourself, you hear? I&#39;m not just weak, I&#39;m notoriously fickle, too. If we&#39;re not careful, I could just as well end up going over to the enemy&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> So just keep one hand on the reins while you&#39;re out<br> there trying to thread this needle, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe we need to cross the entire American continent on foot. That alone has got to make this the most difficult Singularity so far.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What I wouldn&#39;t give for a jet plane right about now...<br> Hell, I&#39;d even take a helicopter.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Now, now, that&#39;s enough whining out of you, mister.<br> It&#39;s only been three hundred kilometers so far, right?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be at a city where we can get ahold of a car soon<br> enough. Ooh, I wonder if they&#39;ll have a pickup truck?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You must have some very strong legs, Peperoncino. What was your movement technique called again? Jinsokutsu? One of the six Shugendou Rokujintsu?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been using magecraft to enhance my own legs, but that only goes so far. I&#39;m certainly not going to be running a marathon anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Come now, Kirschtaria, didn&#39;t I tell you to call<br> me by my real name? It&#39;s Myourenji Arou, remember?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I figure it&#39;s the least I can do to show you a bit of respect after everything you&#39;ve been through.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Is that one of your powers, too?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Right you are. Tashintsu, the power to read others&#39; minds. Though in my case, I can only tell the color of others&#39; auras.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Still, with a color scheme as complex as yours,<br> that&#39;s enough to give me a pretty good idea.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I swear, gods can be so cruel.<br> And you&#39;ve done absolutely nothing but help us.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Anyway, tell me, when do you think I&#39;ll croak?<br> Which Singularity?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> If I know that ahead of time,<br> I won&#39;t have to hold anything back...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...and that might help me be<br> at least a little help to you.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I really can&#39;t say. But I do know that no one<br> has ever made it past the halfway point.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And we&#39;re at the third Singularity right now,<br> which means we&#39;ll be at that point ourselves soon.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But in your case\u2013</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You think I could stick around helping you out to the end? It would certainly be lovely if you were right.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But unfortunately, there&#39;s one<br> more power I have: Rojintsu.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> It tells me how long I&#39;m going to live,<br> and what my destiny will be.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> And it&#39;s telling me there&#39;s no way<br> I&#39;m going to make it to the end.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Rojintsu... I see. So that&#39;s why<br> you were always so fatalistic.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You were unfailingly considerate of everyone else back in Chaldea, but when it came to yourself, you only went through the motions.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I always found it strange how someone so kind<br> to others could be so cold to himself.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Aww, please don&#39;t look at me like that, hon.<br> Trust me, I feel way worse about this than you do.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how many times you&#39;ve done this before, but you did say that everyone else died partway through, right?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So you must have managed to finish the job all on your own. And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just what you&#39;ll do this time too, even if you have to fight back your tears over my death.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I want you to know my real name.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> For me, this whole journey has been like a dream.<br> When I come back to life, it&#39;ll be like it never happened.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But if you use my real name, that&#39;ll be all my<br> \u201Ctrue\u201D self needs to know I can trust you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> And that you really are the right person to lead us.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose it would. You always have<br> been the most observant member of Team A.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Is something wrong, Wodime?<br> Your mind seems to be closed off.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you the one who asked to see me?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. My apologies, Zeus.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I was just...reminiscing a bit, and I must have<br> been more lost in thought than I realized.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I hope you can forgive my rudeness,<br> however unintentional it was.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m only human, after all. It&#39;s difficult for me to<br> concentrate with your divine aura this close by.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What&#39;s so funny?<br> I&#39;m here because I&#39;m concerned about you, you know.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I wanted to talk to you about Queen Europa&#39;s execution.<br> I don&#39;t think you should go through with it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not only for her sake, but for yours as well.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...The revelation has been proclaimed.<br> My decision will not be overturned.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I understand it is a fatal choice for me...but it<br> is what must be done to maintain order in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It is what must be done for your<br> world that named us as gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I seek not to protect myself, but Olympus.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Or rather, the miracle that is this world we only managed to find after years spent wandering.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You know, now that you mention it, you never did tell<br> me the story of why you all crossed the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...I suppose I haven&#39;t, have I?<br> It was a very, very long journey.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Before the intelligence that created us died out...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...they sent us on a meaningless expedition,<br> without so much as a single life-form aboard us.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Our very universe was on the brink of death.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So our flagship, Chaos, exhausted ninety-seven percent of their resources to send us to your universe.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> When we arrived, we found this<br> universe to be brimming with life...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...but we were still unable to locate a planet that met the landing conditions with which we had been programmed.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> We spent thousands upon thousands of years looking,<br> until there were only a scant few of us left.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Unable to maintain our convoy, most of our functions ended up wearing away and fusing together.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Then, just as we had come to terms with our fate, and accepted that our journey was about to end with our goal unaccomplished...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...we discovered this planet.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It was a miracle...a planet that met seventy-eight percent of our landing conditions.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> We quickly made an emergency crash landing on this<br> planet&#39;s surface...and the rest, you know.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You humans gave us names. Even me.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> In our fleet, the only ship with a name was our flagship, Chaos...and Chaos never landed on this planet.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> After the first machia...<br> I became our fleet&#39;s flagship in Chaos&#39;s place.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Once, we were only functions, but then you humans gave us names, believed us to have personalities, and worshiped us as precious beings.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> We were uncertain of how to respond The names, the personalities, the worship...none of it was important or even useful for voyaging.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> And yet\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You were delighted. So you decided to<br> accept the faith people put in you.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Yes. We were delighted.<br> It was the first time we had ever known joy.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Joy was a function we neither anticipated nor needed...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...but we also could not bring ourselves to abandon it.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> In the end, we all agreed to operate from<br> that point on not as functions, but as gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But...I was the only one who understood...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...that putting down roots on this planet would mean<br> turning our backs on our original directive.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It was not to ensure the people of other celestial<br> bodies flourish, but to revive our home planet.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I see. So you decided to conduct yourself as though you were a god. Or rather, you changed your own programming.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And you did so in order to protect the people of<br> Earth\u2013of Olympus, no matter what it may cost.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That meant ruling over not just the people<br> of Earth, but the Twelve Olympians as well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You encroached on the other god-ships&#39; roles and<br> overstepped your bounds, and did so knowingly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And by integrating all functions within yourself...<br> you became an all-powerful god.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It was the only way to resolve an<br> otherwise insurmountable problem.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Fourteen thousand years ago,<br> a calamity made its way to this planet.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I knew that something like the White Titan, Sefar\u2013<br> a planetary envoy, and destroyer of civilizations...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...existed somewhere in this universe.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But, I never expected it to<br> make its way to this planet.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Sefar was an invasive weapon\u2013a being capable of destroying entire civilizations whose threat only grew greater the more time passed.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> There was no time to discuss what<br> to do with the other god-ships.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So I took control of the other Twelve Olympians functions, became a single god-ship, and drove off Sefar.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Thanks to that, Olympus was saved...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...but the other god-ships all came to hate me.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> And who can blame them? I stole their functions<br> knowing it would lead them to ostracize me.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> While all the other god-ships had the same integration<br> ability...I was the only one who chose to use it.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I was the only one who overstepped my bounds.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I was the only ship...who went mad.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong there, Zeus. In that moment, as far as this world&#39;s people were concerned, you were the only true god.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> My story is just like yours, Zeus.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I was changed in a way I never would have experienced if I&#39;d stayed solely within the bounds of my assigned destiny.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> All of a sudden, I had motivations I had never been<br> expected to have...and a goal far beyond my reach.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> All this...excess drastically disrupted what<br> my life was originally supposed to be...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But even so, I decided to dedicate the rest<br> of my life to that so-called excess.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ever since, it has been my guiding principle\u2013<br> the most important thing in my life.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I understand, Zeus. All you did was decide to leave your past self behind in order to save those who gave you meaning.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m hearing a lot of commotion on the surface. It seems Chaldea has made their way here to rescue my queen.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> How is the Tree of Emptiness faring, Wodime?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be long until it is ready. Once it is, the<br> only remaining step will be to have one of us use it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If you&#39;d like to use it now,<br> I could always deal with Chaldea myself.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...No. If they are here to save Europa,<br> then I should be the one to greet them.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I will save the Tree of Emptiness for after I<br> have both eliminated Chaldea and defeated you.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That certainly sounds ideal to me...<br> But are you sure that&#39;s what you want, too?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It is. This is the only way I can repay you.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to erase this terminal now. It will be the last self of mine I ever make for conversing with a human.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Thank you, Kirschtaria.<br> You gave me something I never had.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Something I could never have hoped for once I became all-powerful and began my rule of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I never had a chance to share my burdens with<br> either Hades or Poseidon...but I did with you.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Farewell, young mage. Farewell...friend.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...And farewell to you, King of the Gods.<br> I hold you in the highest respect.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We made it to the surface!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any civilians in our vicinity.<br> Checking magical energy signals now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple magical energy signals detected!<br> Hostiles closing in from all directions!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> I expect we&#39;re in for a string of fights, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Focus on breaking through a single point up ahead!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Understood.

But then, I suppose the Greek gods would never do anything by half measures!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Haha! Now we&#39;re talking! I love killing big nasties!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Come on! Those of you with a death wish\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> No, scratch that!<br> Those of you who want to die by my spear, come at me!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Wow, nice! Now I feel silly for ever thinking you might<br> be bored! It&#39;s great having you on our side, Caenis!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You know, now that we&#39;re coming up on the final battle,<br> I think I&#39;ll get dressed up for the occasion!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What&#39;s with the outfit!? Isn&#39;t it gonna get in the way of fighting!? You don&#39;t want it to get ripped in battle, do you!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hah!

Okay, Wodime, don&#39;t mind me.<br> I&#39;m just gonna take a little peek at your files here.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They&#39;re password protected.

Based on the<br> date, this would&#39;ve been when Chaldea had captured me.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Weird. Why&#39;s this the only file saved by itself?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Sorry about this, Ophelia.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m contacting you in regards to the relationship<br> between the Lostbelts and the Trees of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> To clarify terms, I&#39;m defining Lostbelt as an extension of the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon\u2013an alternative history that could never exist on Earth as part of Proper Human History...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...and the Trees of Emptiness are the anchors<br> holding these lost histories in place.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...This is witnessed by the fact that Trees of Emptiness and their respective Lostbelts are so closely tied together.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> All observational data we have for the Lostbelts further substantiates this connection, leaving no room for doubt.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> As proof, we can look at the Russian Lostbelt, which is disappearing as I speak now that its Tree of Emptiness has been cut down.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...The timeline definitely lines up.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So, the Russian Lostbelt disappearing is what definitively proved the connection between Lostbelts and their Trees of Emptiness, huh.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, that sounds right.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...the Russian Lostbelt&#39;s disappearance only proves<br> one particular trait about the Trees of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> There is still one major mystery<br> remaining about the Lostbelts:</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> How do they fill in the gaps between when they were pruned from human history, until they were \u201Creplanted\u201D in the present day?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> That mystery is what I&#39;m reporting in on today.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> The other day, I heard something from the king of the Scandinavian Lostbelt, Sc\xE1thach-Skadi, that points to one possible answer.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> She clearly remembers the events of the past few thousand years, and does so as though it were perfectly natural.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, she did so even while understanding<br> that the Lostbelts, including her own...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...were cut off from Proper Human History because their continued existence was deemed extraneous.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> This means she is fully aware that nothing could have happened during the several thousand years between when Ragnar\xF6k took place and the present day...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...and yet, she and her Lostbelt all exist as though those several thousand years of lost history had actually taken place. Quite the contradiction.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> Of course, while we can&#39;t make any definitive statements based on one king&#39;s single passing remark...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...I do feel confident enough to propose a hypothesis.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> I suspect that the blank period between when a Lostbelt was pruned, and when it was \u201Creplanted\u201D in the present day...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...may have actually taken place<br> inside each Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> In Russia, that period would have been about five hundred years. In Scandinavia, it would be about three thousand.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> In China, it would be about twenty-two hundred, and so on and so forth.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> To further expound on my hypothesis...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> I suspect that the Trees of Emptiness take the point<br> at which a Lostbelt&#39;s history is pruned...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...and then simulate what would happen if that<br> history had continued on from that point.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> By doing so, the trees effectively prove that history&#39;s<br> existence, and the result is projected onto the planet itself.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> If my hypothesis is correct, that would mean the trees<br> are essentially creating history, not rewriting it.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> Not even a demiurge-class Divine Spirit that once ruled the entire planet could wield this kind of Authority on Earth in the present day.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> Wodime.<br> I mean, Lord Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ATransmission Log:</strong><br> ...Just what is the Foreign God, anyway?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Foreign God, huh.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Guess you didn&#39;t know, Ophelia.<br> Me neither.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...No, it&#39;s not just you and me. None of us Crypters know what the Foreign God looks like.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All we know is, they&#39;re something that resurrected us from our Coffins in exchange for making us raise Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Except...Wodime&#39;s the only one of us who&#39;s heard directly what the Foreign God&#39;s goal is...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> What&#39;s this text file over here by itself?<br> Looks like some kind of note.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Gotta say, Wodime. Between this, and the easily<br> guessable password, you&#39;re getting sloppy.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hang on. Is this really a plain text file?<br> ...What is this?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On the Trees of Emptiness and<br> the Bleached Earth Phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> With the exception of us Crypters<br> and the Alter Egos...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...the Trees of Emptiness are the only method<br> the Foreign God has employed to tamper with Earth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We therefore interpreted this phenomenon...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...as signifying that it was the Trees of Emptiness<br> that wiped Earth clean when they descended to the<br> ground.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...However, after re-reviewing and reanalyzing the<br> data taken from Earth&#39;s surface, I&#39;m no longer so sure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To come straight to the point:<br> we may have been mistaken.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...The Trees of Emptiness only appeared after Earth<br> had been bleached. This order of events is crucial.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know which of the Crypters will end up viewing<br> this file, but whoever it is, I hope they find it<br> useful.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re telling me the Trees of Emptiness only<br> came down to Earth AFTER it had been wiped clean?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But, that doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> I thought for sure it was the Trees of Emptiness<br> that wiped out Earth and humanity...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But if Earth had already been bleached before the Trees of Emptiness showed up, then why make them, or the Lostbelts, at all?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Wait. If the Foreign God wanted to get rid of humanity, they wouldn&#39;t bother making Lostbelts in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If anything, it seems to me like the whole reason they want to see a bunch of different possible human histories is because they don&#39;t know anything about us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But then...why?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe the bleaching wasn&#39;t to wipe out humanity...<br> but to make an environment they could set foot in?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Maybe they only got rid of humanity<br> because they had no other choice?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe a world covered in pure white, brand-new textures<br> is the only kind of world the Foreign God can visit?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But then, if that were the case, the Lostbelts would only get in the way. So what are they and the Trees of Emptiness for?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Dammit, I&#39;m just going around in circles. There&#39;s<br> still some crucial piece of information I&#39;m missing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ugh, just my luck! There&#39;s too many files<br> on this terminal to find the data I need!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And why are these folders scattered all over the place!? Is it some kind of anti-hacking measure or something?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Shit. I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to touch the big files, but at this rate, I&#39;ll have to copy everything.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (The Foreign God...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (There&#39;s no question that they&#39;re an aggressor,<br> and that they can&#39;t coexist with our history.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (As for the whole \u201Cgod\u201D thing, it&#39;s way more likely<br> they&#39;re a new kind of life-form we know nothing about...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...and \u201Cgod\u201D is just the best word we have for it.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So why make the Lostbelts? Why use us at all?<br> Is it because they still don&#39;t know much about Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nah, that can&#39;t be it. We&#39;re talking about a being capable of wiping the whole planet clean in a second.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Come on, Kadoc, think. There&#39;s no way the Foreign God<br> doesn&#39;t know the first thing about Earth or humanity.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They must&#39;ve done their homework, or they wouldn&#39;t have<br> known to attack us\u2013Chaldea, before making any other moves..</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...So from that, you can tell that the Foreign God is really, really cautious, which is why they&#39;re so careful about keeping their identity a secret.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Zeus is omnipotent and omniscient, so he doesn&#39;t bother to hide who he is. He&#39;s also had no problem crushing any form of dissent himself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Foreign God&#39;s not at that level yet, which is why they&#39;re still so careful about any information pertaining to them.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s it. The Foreign God&#39;s got one major, fatal<br> flaw: they don&#39;t have a physical body yet.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If they did, even if it was just a Divided Spirit or<br> a terminal, they wouldn&#39;t have to rely on anyone else.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they enlisted the Alter Egos, and us Crypters, to be their hands in this world.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Rasputin. Limbo. Muramasa. Why would a foreign being use Heroic Spirits from Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They might&#39;ve dressed their Alter Ego Disciples up a<br> little, but they&#39;re still figures taken from our history...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Hang on. What if the Foreign God can<br> only make use of things on Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not even that. They can only use things from the past\u2013things that USED to be on Earth.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (At some point, the Foreign God plans on descending<br> to Earth. At least, that&#39;s what they told Wodime.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (And once a Tree of Emptiness is fully grown, it&#39;ll become the Foreign God&#39;s body... So what happens after that?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (Maybe, when the Foreign God descends<br> and incarnates on Earth...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...they&#39;re going to base their body on the data<br> about Earth we&#39;ve all been collecting for them.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Yeah, that&#39;s not a bad theory.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If the Foreign God absolutely has to have local<br> life-forms, then they must be for output... No, wait. For reference.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And from there, as long as the Foreign God<br> can guide the local life-forms successfully\u2013</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong></p><p>My, my, how very perceptive.<br> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong></p><p>It would seem that, given enough time, humans will indeed cease to be mindless reeds and start reaching...conclusions of their own.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I used to laugh at the idea that a few Crypters putting<br> their heads together could ever arrive at the truth...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...but now that I see how close you&#39;ve come to figuring out the Foreign God&#39;s true nature, it&#39;s clear I underestimated you, Lord Kadoc.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Crap! An Alter Ego!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Indeed, it is I, Limbo!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AKadoc:</strong><br> Guh... Agh...!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> This simply won&#39;t do, Lord Kadoc.<br> Mmmmmm, no, it simply won&#39;t do at all!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to go snooping around like a spy, you really must be more prepared for the possible consequences! Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Wait... Oh, I see! I suppose you were prepared after all! Well, I do beg your pardon! I didn&#39;t realize that flimsy little shield around your body was meant to provide meaningful protection!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AKadoc:</strong><br> ...Bas...tard!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh yes, I&#39;m terribly sorry.<br> It seems I&#39;ve gone and punctured your little spell.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> And, this wound being quite fatal,<br> I&#39;m afraid this is as far as you go.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Much as I hope to see you again one day,<br> that seems rather unlikely now... Alas.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AKadoc:</strong><br> Gaaaaaah!<br> You...Alter...Ego!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> So tell me, have you shared this pet theory<br> of yours with any of the other Crypters?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> For example, should I assume Kirschtaria Wodime<br> has reached the same conclusions as you have?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Ah, but no, he hasn&#39;t!<br> He&#39;d never permit himself to do such a thing!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> He&#39;s very smart after all, so he knows he&#39;ll be<br> disposed of if he should arrive at the truth!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> That&#39;s why he kept his thoughts strictly as raw data rather than mulling them over and drawing conclusions! No wonder the Foreign God chose him for their Executor!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AKadoc:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh my, I do apologize. I completely forgot about<br> the pain curse I still had embedded in my nails!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> No wonder you can&#39;t answer my questions then!<br> Hahahahaha, how careless of me!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Well then, pitiful Crypter without a Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...it would seem this is goodbye.</p><h2 id="section-19-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-19-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 19: I Am the Thunder that Smites Stars (II)</h2><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> ...Rather a lot of noise down below.

I&#39;m told she&#39;s highly abnormal, even for a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Haha...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> She was probably pretty abnormal as a human, too.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The only kinds of people who&#39;d save someone from being executed just to let &#39;em die another way&#39;d have to be either crazy, or samurai.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe she&#39;s rubbing off on them...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...You know, Rasputin...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They say that samurai...<br> don&#39;t fight, or die, for gods...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Instead...they risk their lives for duty...<br> and loyalty...and stuff like that...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It might be...derived from<br> Confucianism or something...but still...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> A samurai, huh. That doesn&#39;t quite sound right.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> From everything I&#39;ve heard about her, Miyamoto Musashi<br> is about the furthest thing from a samurai.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> In fact, if anyone is rubbing off on anyone...<br> I would guess it&#39;s Chaldea rubbing off on Musashi.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...That so...?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Honestly...I don&#39;t really know...<br> what you&#39;re talking about...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> All I know is...the way things are going...<br> this place is gonna see...some serious action...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So what&#39;re you...gonna do...Rasputin?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Me...I&#39;m...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> So, your strength finally gave out, Kadoc Zemlupus.<br> I&#39;m not surprised, given how much blood you lost.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you were able to walk this far after Limbo tore that hole in you.

I&#39;m really not in the mood for jokes right now.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Good, that works out nicely.

Too bad he got taken out like a chump.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> &#39;Course, if he&#39;d resigned himself to actually being<br> a chump, I&#39;d just&#39;ve killed him myself.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Either way, Kadoc was on his way out the moment he came back from Russia with his tail between his legs.

Judgmental much?<br> What do you even know about me, anyway?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You kill people you find boring.<br> You kill people who deserve to die...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...and you kill people whose deaths would be tragic.<br> That&#39;s what gets you off.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> And I have no interest in dealing with a brute like that. They make for terrible clientele.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to bother asking what sort of prey you&#39;re looking for, so I suggest you relax and enjoy your time in this palace until it all falls to pieces.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going to say my<br> final goodbyes to Father Rasputin before\u2013</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Aww, don&#39;t be like that, Koyanskaya.

I thought that might get your attention, Vitch! I knew you were just as much of a sicko as I am!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Honestly, all this talk about establishing a perfect<br> Age of Gods is a little too big for my britches...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...so I thought I&#39;d cut you in on something<br> a little more...life-sized.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not gonna call you a cowardly fox<br> or anything. I know what you really are, after all.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> So here&#39;s my proposal, Koyanskaya.<br> I&#39;ll find you something you&#39;ll really like...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...if, in exchange...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...you get me out of this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Olympian guards have joined the fray!<br> And there are more hostile entities incoming!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still...they&#39;re not the only force to be reckoned with!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That ought to take care of all the ones from the north!<br> Adele!

Not that the great Caenis is gonna go out like some punk in a goddamn FALL.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hey, twins! Sage! Emperor!<br> You lot&#39;re all alive too, right!?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> No problems here. As far as I am concerned, this may as well have been a walk in the park. Well, a garden, in this case.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I daresay I managed all right myself.<br> Oh, do watch your footing there, Adele.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Thank you, Holmes.<br> There we go...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...So nobody else dislocated their shoulder or<br> anything like I did, huh? Well that&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let me see that, Macarios.<br> I&#39;ve had some training in treating dislocated limbs.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s already healed. We haven&#39;t been drinking ambrosia for the last ten thousand years for nothing.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Remember? We can&#39;t die, not even from falling<br> or illness. Only the gods can kill us.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad you guys are all okay,<br> since you don&#39;t automatically heal yourselves.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I do.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t talking to you.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hah! That&#39;s funny! Didn&#39;t think you even had a sense or humor, always sulking every goddamn second. Moody shit.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Who asked you?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Okay, so we&#39;re all here. Good.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> The Stymphalides isn&#39;t gonna be much help anymore,<br> so we&#39;re gonna leave it behind.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left now is to keep moving forward. We should assume Zeus is hearing everything we say, so try not to talk too much.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios and I will operate Aether. We&#39;ll make sure it goes off without a hitch. I promise.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> So...in the meantime...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...can we ask you to ensure it&#39;s not<br> destroyed before we can activate it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll keep it safe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Aegis that Queen Europa and<br> Prometheus-Hephaestus gave me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...is still inside my shield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how well it&#39;ll be able<br> to withstand Zeus&#39;s thunderbolts...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but regardless, we&#39;ll make sure to keep you two, and Aether, safe.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Worry not. The Grand Summon WILL take place.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I swear it upon my name, Caligula, third emperor of Rome, and upon that empire&#39;s timeless glory!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Rest assured...the light of your prayers<br> will even reach the ends of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Caligula.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou fou!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh no you don&#39;t. Adele&#39;s too busy to play right now.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Just keep that fur ball stored away, all right?<br> From here on out\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be in the heart of enemy territory.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hear you. So, do you know where this great altar is?</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> No human&#39;s ever seen the inside of the orbital shrine before, but we have a good idea of its layout thanks to a few myths we&#39;ve heard about it.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This is probably the hanging garden that surrounds the shrine, which means the Machina Corridor shouldn&#39;t be far from here.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Machina Corridor?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It&#39;s just as its name suggests. It&#39;s a corridor of the gods big enough for even their massive mechanical bodies to traverse it.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> And according to myth...the corridor ends at<br> the great shrine where almighty Zeus resides.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Got it. Then let&#39;s go.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This corridor&#39;s the path we need to take now.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please hold on tight to me, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to try to get there as quickly as possible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we&#39;re going to reach the great altar soon\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Then a Heroic Spirit&#39;s legs are<br> the fastest way to get there!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Fujimaru&#39;s used to this sort of thing by<br> now, but I hope you two are handling it okay, too!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Relax, I ain&#39;t gonna drop him! Just make sure you don&#39;t touch the spear, you damn brat!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Brat!? I&#39;m over ten thousand years old!<br> I&#39;m way older than you are!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I, um, I&#39;m sorry about this, Holmes...<br> Are you sure I&#39;m not too heavy?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hardly. A gentleman is honor bound to serve as a lady&#39;s<br> escort. Besides, I assure you, you&#39;re light as a feather.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Hahaha! If you wish to be cradled in my arms, merely say the word, and I will let you experience an emperor&#39;s embrace all the way to the great altar!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ooh, an emperor&#39;s embrace!<br> That sounds like quite the treat!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now, now, settle down, Fou! Mash literally has her hands full with Fujimaru right now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait! Stop!<br> I&#39;m picking up a large amount of magical energy nearby!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I was hoping we could get to our goal<br> without any more interruptions...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but I guess it&#39;s no surprise they<br> weren&#39;t gonna make it easy for us.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, I recognize this feeling, even if it isn&#39;t quite like any other kind of magical energy or Heroic Spirit aura.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Show yourself, scumbag!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;d recognize that ominous stench of<br> death and unrepentant evil anywhere!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahaha.<br> My, my, well done. Well done indeed.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> No wonder you were able to reach the void, Swordswoman!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Believe it or not, I was casting a few stealth spells to stay out of sight, but apparently, you found me by my...stench, anyway. Hmm.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> How strange. I didn&#39;t think<br> I had done anything THAT evil.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Well...not in front of you, anyway.<br> Mmmmmm, how very unusual!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shut up, Limbo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stop. I don&#39;t need to hear anything else from you.</p><hr><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...Well now.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s certainly learned how to be brave! I see, I see. So you&#39;re here to rescue the queen!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> How very noble of you! Especially since you&#39;re still planning to squash her and this entire Lostbelt like bugs! Mmmmmm, what a most delightful joke!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea!<br> Heroic Spirits of humanity!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Please, enlighten me, if you would be so kind!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Why... Or rather, how long are you going to continue filling back in these holes you keep digging?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What you&#39;re doing now is no different from toppling a pile of stones you&#39;ve just stacked yourselves.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> While I have been doing my best to<br> be a good jester for my god...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...I could never hope to compete with the sheer comedy<br> of destroying lives that you yourselves saved!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up a powerful magical energy signal!<br> Be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something&#39;s about to show itself up ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s...Cerberus, the Divine Beast! It&#39;s probably a lot like the ones we encountered in Atlantis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Here it comes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hraaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now to finish this!<br> Baritsu!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Well now. Well, well, well, well. How strange.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I&#39;m quite sure I heard these things worked<br> very well against you in Atlan\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ALimbo:</strong><br> Oh, my...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you get him!?</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...No. It felt like I was cutting through paper.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I destroyed his body, but I didn&#39;t hit his Spirit Core. He must&#39;ve been using a substitute body or something.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> M-mm...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, mmmmmm, how unfortunate!<br> It seems a shikigami is no longer a match for you!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> But, be that is it may, I&#39;m afraid this is as far as this little jest of mine goes today. Indeed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh, believe me, while I would love nothing<br> more than to toy with you endlessly...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...the king of this Lostbelt is far more cautious and<br> temperamental than the innocent one we saw last time!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Of course, I did try to kill him myself, but, as you can imagine, I&#39;m afraid he was just too divine for me.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...I wonder how all of you will fare?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Needless to say, Zeus is the king of this Atlantic Lostbelt\u2013a genuine omnipotent god</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I wonder, what will you do when faced with his overwhelmingly powerful thunderbolts!? Mmmmmm, I look forward to seeing you, as they say, do your worst!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Oh yes, I&#39;ll be enjoying the show from\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Shut up already!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Guh!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...Ha, haha, hahahahaha! Yes, by all means, go ahead<br> and do whatever you like to this shikigami body!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> You can&#39;t truly hurt me!<br> My life extension method is invincible!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh? Life extension, huh?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s a very bold claim, Limbo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But when you see the same trick over and over\u2013like, say, a seemingly immortal Spirit Origin that keeps coming back to life no matter how many times you kill it...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...it&#39;s just human nature to want to<br> finally trip it up, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit, you did a good job piling concealer upon concealer. I doubt most people would ever be able to see through them all.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But thanks to my Tashintsu, as far as I&#39;m concerned,<br> they might as well not be there at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Pepe!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pepe!</p><hr><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Hey, Chaldeans. Hope you don&#39;t mind my taking<br> advantage of this little opportunity you gave me.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Now then, Mr. Alter Ego Limbo.<br> It&#39;s about time I paid you back...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...for all the ways you screwed with my Indian Lostbelt!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Wha...!? What...is this!? Onmyoudou?<br> ...No! This is...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Shugendou!?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a little technique I whipped up just for you: a combination of Tashintsu and Rojintsu.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> I hope you enjoyed your trick of prolonging your life by spreading it out over countless shikigami, \u201Chon,\u201D because you&#39;re never going to get to use it again.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Namushinpen Great Boddhisatva: Rojin-Tashintsu!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to die feeling every bit of<br> the hatred and regret you&#39;ve incurred.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What are you...!?<br> Oh no. No, no, no!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Now I see... You figured out that my secret life extension method is a form of false reincarnation!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Why yes, I did. Usually, Rojintsu is only<br> used to end your own reincarnation...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...but in this case, I decided to use<br> Tashintsu to let you have it instead.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Now, you won&#39;t be substituting shikigami to save your<br> own skin anymore. That little trick is gone for good.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Your next life will be your very last.<br> Enjoy it while you can.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Curse yooouuu!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Toodles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Pepe.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That&#39;s me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess I should say...thank you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Aww, you don&#39;t have to do that, hon.</p><hr><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get the wrong idea here.<br> I just did what I had to.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> The rest of you should do the same.<br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not gonna stop you.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Even if I wanted to, I spent all my magical energy on that spell, so I&#39;m just going to kick back and watch the rest from the sidelines.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Oh, and just so you know, I can&#39;t root for you<br> when you go up against Kirschtaria, okay?</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> That said, you might be interested to hear what Kirschtaria once told me:</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> \u201CFujimaru and I are actually quite closely<br> matched in terms of combat ability.\u201D</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> \u201C[\u2642 His /\u2640\uFE0F Her] various exploits to date have<br> proven that beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201D</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> \u201C[\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] is fully capable of defeating me all on [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] own.\u201D</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> It seems positively silly if you ask me,<br> but that&#39;s what he told me. Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um... Does that mean Kirschtaria wants us to\u2013</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> And for my part, I&#39;ll say that I finally realized<br> you and Kirschtaria are a lot alike.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re both very hard workers. You&#39;re both exceedingly earnest. You both stand up to adversity like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...And you&#39;ve both had more than<br> your share of painful goodbyes.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Neither Daybit nor I could ever<br> hope to defeat Kirschtaria.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> But you... You just might be able to. In fact...<br> I think you might be the only one who should.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Well? Now do you feel like paying him back for what he put you through in Atlantis?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah. I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This time, I&#39;m going to use everything I&#39;ve got.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s the kind of heart I like to see. No holding<br> back, putting your whole body and soul into it...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Does this mean you&#39;re ready to show him how badass the<br> Master who restored humanity all by [\u2642 himself /\u2640\uFE0F herself] really is<br> then?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> I&#39;m seeing multiple hostile entities headed our<br> way from up ahead! They look to be Phantasmals!</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Ooh, right. This really wasn&#39;t the best<br> time for pleasantries, was it?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...So, it seems there are beasts that must be slain.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;re gonna be doing more walking than running from here on out. Well, more like walking and fighting at the same time!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Heh! They can throw as many of these pissants as they want for all the good it&#39;ll do them!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say this isn&#39;t starting to wear on me physically, but if ever there were a time for a stiff upper lip, this would be it. I&#39;ll continue to support you as best I can.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> As for you, Scandinavia Peperoncino, I appreciate your<br> assistance, however unintentional it may have been.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> You&#39;re very welcome, hon.<br> All right, go on now.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> Kirschtaria never asked me for help because<br> he&#39;s absolutely convinced he&#39;s in the right.</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to sit back and see for myself just how right he really is. And I&#39;ll do it from far enough that I don&#39;t get in your way.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa, you have Tengentsu? There can&#39;t be many Masters<br> with this many of the six knowledges out there, right!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, never mind that now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get ready to break through them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Keep going! Don&#39;t look back!</p><hr><p><strong>J\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> ...Understood, Master.

It&#39;s just ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although...I don&#39;t see Pepe here anymore, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll run into him again. You know how much he loves to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s true. I&#39;ll have to make sure I thank<br> him properly for all the help he&#39;s given us then.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Come then, let us be on our way.<br> Twins, prepare the Article.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Right now, we have no way of knowing<br> what has become of Queen Europa.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Perhaps we will be able to rescue her first...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...or perhaps we will need to do battle with Zeus first! At this point, we simply cannot say!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We know.<br> Right, Sister?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Leave it to us. We&#39;ll do whatever we<br> have to in order to activate Aether.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If we&#39;re lucky\u2013or is it unlucky? Regardless,<br> our showdown with Zeus is surely close at hand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I trust you&#39;re all ready, ladies and gentlemen?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You don&#39;t gotta ask me! Just try and stop me from bein&#39;<br> the first one to that overgrown rain cloud&#39;s altar!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To the great altar!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s put this corridor behind us!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Haha!

This ferocity!<br> It feels like the second coming of Vairocana!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s a cut above any demonic sword, demon, or demon king. So this is the most advanced being in this entire world...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The other mechanical gods were a hell of a fight,<br> but this sheer swirling power makes them look like nothing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the power of a Divine Spirit.<br> No...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He is of course, an ACTUAL, all-powerful god!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> ...Here he comes.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...You have been granted an audience<br> with the King of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> This is neither a blessing, nor cause for joy.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Now, kneel.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Kneel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This...pressure...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> High gravity...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So the god of the heavens is even capable<br> of controlling gravity itself!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My whole body feels...like lead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s like...the very air...is pushing me down!</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Ghh...

Not bad! That was pretty cutting, for you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Screw cutting! It&#39;s the truth, plain and simple! This god is pretty spiteful for a \u201Cmagnanimous\u201D deity!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That said, I can&#39;t deny this is a worthy opponent. And hey, now we&#39;ll get a chance to make up for our piss-poor showing from last time!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Let&#39;s show this overgrown marionette what we&#39;ve learned since the last time we saw him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First we take out Talos, then we take back Europa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can save Europa once Talos is destroyed!</p><hr><p><strong>M\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Understood!<br> Raising Ortinax output and switching to combat mode!</p><p><strong>M\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> Preparing to engage enemy!</p><h2 id="section-21-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-21-i-am-the-thunder-that-smites-stars-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 21: I Am the Thunder that Smites Stars (IV)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let him...step on my shield...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...so I can push him up and<br> throw him off balance with it!

Ahhh...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> My Talos... My poor Talos...!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I still remember...when my beloved gave him to me...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Ahh, Talos...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Holmes!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not to worry, I merely put her to sleep by means of a pressure point. Surely you know by now that I would never take the life of a lady.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...That being said...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have a feeling the omnipotent god in the room may not appreciate my chivalry. Or share it, for that matter.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Why did you not kill her? Have you forgotten that<br> I ordered you to carry out Queen Europa&#39;s execution?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> It is through my grace that you have been given this<br> opportunity. All you need do is carry it out swiftly.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So I ask again:<br> Why did you not kill her?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Is it because you still believe, even now, that humans are merciful creatures moved to help each other? Is that what you would claim?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I sure don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I wanna kill as many as possible! And I especially<br> want to kill every last one of you Olympian gods!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That bastard Poseidon might be long gone by now, but<br> you&#39;ve still been pissing me off plenty, Zeus.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Now, it&#39;s your turn to die!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So why don&#39;t you dissolve back into your heavens and<br> lightning until you&#39;re completely gone from this world!?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Caenis, who is blessed with Poseidon&#39;s Authority.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Despite being Kirschtaria&#39;s Servant, you refused to obey the gods or amend your foolish ways.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Ultimately, your arrogance led to your defeat at Chaldea&#39;s hands, followed by your purging at Dioscuri&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> That much, I foresaw. But your actions since<br> then have been utterly incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> How did you not disappear?<br> Why do you stand with Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> How did... No, never mind. You must have been<br> given a path along those lines to follow.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Impressive, Wodime. Indeed, now that I see this,<br> I am hard-pressed to find fault with you.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You wanna know why I&#39;m standing with Chaldea?<br> &#39;Cause you Olympians are all freaking idiots!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Wantin&#39; payback&#39;s perfectly natural, yeah?<br> So that&#39;s what I decided to get for myself!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I see. So you say the gods&#39; arrogance led to<br> this situation, including your own destiny.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...What about you, Miyamoto Musashi?<br> You are not a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You too have been cast out from an excised history,<br> just like Olympus and the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So why do you turn your sword against the gods?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Uh, because you&#39;re Chaldea&#39;s enemy?<br> That&#39;s all the reason I need.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> As for whether Proper Human History deserves to be called that, or if the Lostbelts have a right to exist...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...or which one&#39;s right and which one&#39;s wrong...<br> frankly, I can&#39;t be bothered to care.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> All I care about when I fight for another&#39;s sake<br> is whether or not I can really, truly trust them.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the kind of person I am.<br> I&#39;m a scoundrel at heart, after all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And right now, I&#39;m wielding my swords for my own sake.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> To surpass the limits I&#39;ve been<br> trying to push up against my whole life.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I thought you might be the opponent I was looking<br> for at first, Zeus, but now, I can see you&#39;re not.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re not the ultimate destination my swords have been<br> seeking. You&#39;re just a big obstacle on the way there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re the shower of sparks I need to brush<br> aside if I&#39;m gonna keep moving forward.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> A shower of sparks...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So, that is what you would compare me to, swordswoman who travels with no destination? Me, the omnipotent god of the heavens?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Then tell me, while you are here in Olympus...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...What will you do when you are confronted with flames<br> that threaten to consume your body and soul?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> How will you defend yourself then?<br> How will you continue to walk your own path?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ll force my way through no matter<br> what it takes, of course!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Be it the heavens, or lightning, or anything else,<br> I&#39;ll cut down whatever blocks my path!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And right now, that path leads towards the Tree of Emptiness, far above our heads! ...No, towards Atlas, the World Tree, and the roots of cosmic fantasy!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And once I reach it...I&#39;ll cut down<br> every last empty root it&#39;s got!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Oho.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> How truly fascinating.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Humans. Heroic Spirits devolved from humans.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You all think in different ways.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You all carry different hopes and distress<br> within your small, fragile bodies.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Once, during the Leucusmachia about<br> fourteen thousand orbits ago...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...I\u2013We, managed to defeat the titanic shadow Sefar, the incarnation of ruin and death.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Yes, this world\u2013our world\u2013was originally destined for ruin, and we saved it from that fate through our sheer strength.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But you, Proper Human History...<br> You are neither ruin, nor gods.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You are not even ruin incarnate,<br> nor the Divided Spirits that are the Gigantes.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> No, you are much...much smaller than that.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> You are weak. Infinitesimal.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> So I ask you once again, humans of Proper Human History:</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...Why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I must say, Zeus, for an omnipotent being, you certainly ask a great many questions. Is this your way of showing us compassion?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Or perhaps you are merely reaffirming information<br> you already know to be true?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While I strongly suspect the latter in this case\u2013</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Why do you continue this journey? Why do you kill the Lostbelts, and those of us who live in them?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Especially now that this planet&#39;s humanity and history<br> have all been wiped away as though they never existed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I already told you why.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Indeed. To take back your world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> To take back our world.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I see. To take back your world.</p><hr><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...So you are here to save this planet?<br> To save all of Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Haha.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Haha, hahahahahahahahahahaha!<br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ghhh...!<br> There&#39;s that pressure again!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Hilarious!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> What a truly amusing bunch you are. It would be one thing if you wanted me to carry out your wishes for you...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> ...but you insist on carrying them out yourselves, with your trifling power! And at my Olympia Dodona&#39;s altar!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Indeed, it has been a long<br> time since I laughed so hard.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Yes... I see. Now, it is clear to me how you defeated<br> my daughter, Artemis! My brother, Poseidon!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> My sister, Demeter! And my daughter, Aphrodite! Their<br> empty, soulless metal husks could never hope to defeat you!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Not in the face of your gleaming,<br> unabashed straightforwardness!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Dammit...! Is this gravity trick...all you&#39;ve got!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This weight...!<br> It&#39;s like it&#39;s...grinding my bones together!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mash! Stay close to Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Your protections ought to take some of the<br> weight off [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her]... At least, I hope so!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! Please stay close to me, Master!</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> If I were my Proper Human History self, Chaldeans,<br> I would surely have made you into constellations.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I am not.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> I may be generous, but I am not a god of mercy. I am a god who rules over humanity with mighty thunderbolts.</p><p><strong>Zeus:</strong><br> Come to me, my Aletheia.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> ...Great electricity, confirmed.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Great demiurge, authenticated.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Cronus Crown synchronization complete.<br> Deactivating Aletheia spatial camouflage.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Setting spatial expansion to directly above great altar.

No! It can&#39;t be!<br> Aaaaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Wh-what is it!? What&#39;s got Ares so shaken up!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, here&#39;s something I never thought I&#39;d hear myself say... Please, Mr. God of War, try to calm down!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Wait. On second thought, do you know<br> what that...thing up there is!?</p><p><strong>Crimson Machine God:</strong><br> You...! You&#39;ve been in that rift this whole time!?</p><p><strong>Crimson Machine God:</strong><br> They are the very first starship\u2013the source of all Twelve Olympians, a colossal interstellar mothership, and the oldest machine god of them all...!</p><p><strong>Crimson Machine God:</strong><br> Chaos!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Crimson Machine God:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A solitary beam fires from the eye, traveling faster than light.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Only Quirinus and the crimson machine god could react in time.

What happened to Ares...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t Ares just there...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Ares&#39;s readings have...completely disappeared...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What just...happened?</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> He died saving your lives.<br> His Spirit Origin has already been vaporized.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> He was killed by a ray of sunlight\u2013great Authority that even exceeds that of Apollo in his prime!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So this eye can wield the Authority of machine gods that no longer exist? But I thought that functionality was restricted solely to Zeus!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> No, wait...<br> Ares said that thing was called Chaos.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then...that would mean the true nature of the being<br> peering down on us from a crack in the sky...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...is the source of every god in all of Greek mythology...</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Chaos!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Chaos!? As in, confusion!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t \u201Cchaos\u201D just another word for \u201Cconfusion\u201D!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-not quite, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While they do use the term \u201Cchaos\u201D in scientific circles to describe unpredictable situations, that&#39;s a strictly modern usage of the word.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In Greek mythology, Chaos is the largest,<br> most ancient god of all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and their name means \u201Chole in the sky.\u201D A void.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> That thing is nothing less than a colossal interstellar<br> mothership\u2013the spherical space-time fortress known as Chaos.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> They are the being from which all<br> of the machine gods originated.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> The truth is that all Twelve Olympians, including Zeus, were nothing more than a way for Chaos to divide their countless functions.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> They are the source of the Titans, Olympus,<br> and every machine god.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> They are a supernatural god that has become one with the gaps of our universe&#39;s space-time! Their core is the very eye you see peeking out there from within the rift!</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> The truly massive shell that makes up their colossal body uses a star from an ancient, distant system for its core!</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> In terms of sheer scale, this god of the heavens far surpasses our entire planet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A colossal structure covering a star...?<br> You mean, like a Dyson sphere!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A Dyson sphere, originally named for the physicist who conceived it, is a theoretical construct of an artificial structure designed to completely cover a star in order to make use of its energy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But, you&#39;re now saying such a sphere truly exists?<br> And has for eons, at that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That would make Chaos here a god that embodies every concept and natural phenomenon under the sun... No, even that fails to do it justice!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We&#39;re now up against a star capable of covering every centimeter of the sky!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So why&#39;s this thing only showing up now!?<br> To protect Zeus!?</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> No. Zeus&#39;s Divine Core is well and truly gone.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Just as a Heroic Spirit cannot maintain their existence without their Spirit Core, neither can a god maintain their body without their Divine Core.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Lord Zeus is no longer with us.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I expect that Chaos there...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...has shown themself in order to carry<br> out Lord Zeus&#39;s will in his stead.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> But, this is all wrong. Lord Zeus wished to preserve this civilization\u2013to keep it alive as long as possible.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> However, Chaos has no particular<br> feelings towards Earth.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Chaos&#39;s highest priority is preserving the fleet...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> So Chaos means to absorb not just Olympus,<br> but every resource on this planet&#39;s surface...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...and return to voyaging across the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> But... Ahh, this is terrible.<br> There is no longer anything there...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> There is nothing and no one left where Chaos resides!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> All that remains there is...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...a gap in the cosmos!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Chaos, the primordial god.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In Greek mythology, they are said to be the source of the gods... No, more than that. They are the source of all on Earth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It never occurred to me that their true identify would be a titanic rent in the universe itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A massive eye that peers down on this planet from a gap in the very fabric of space!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, they now wish to revert this planet to its primordial state, and return to the sea of stars!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Subjects and civilization...irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Intelligence and minds...irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Shrine Voice:</strong><br> Prosperity...

B-but... They can&#39;t DO that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s the point of unbleaching the Earth if it&#39;sjust gonna have a huge gaping hole in it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. Suffice to say, if Chaos is successful, Earth<br> will no longer be a suitable planet for human life.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, hang on.<br> It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s going to attack us, right?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Chaos perceives the universe on a vastly greater scale than Zeus. I suspect they are not even aware of us.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> The magical energy they fired at<br> Ares was more akin to a reflex.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> They don&#39;t mean to attack us. Their only intention is to make off with this planet&#39;s surface, Lostbelt and all...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...and set sail on another<br> voyage across the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So they just wanna turn us into fuel or some shit for an interstellar pleasure cruise? Screw that noise!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who this Chaos bitch thinks they are,<br> but I&#39;m sure as shit not letting that happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We still haven&#39;t cut down the Tree of Emptiness.<br> ...We can&#39;t afford to stop now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The Black Barrel has sustained damage. The Ortinax&#39;s<br> total output has fallen below fifty percent...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but the auto-maintenance function is still working.<br> I can temporarily boost output to sixty percent for combat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My shield remains intact,<br> and Aegis&#39;s protection is still in effect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. We can&#39;t afford to stop here. We have to keep fighting back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The only question is, how do we fight that thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It must be at least twenty thousand meters away from us. We simply have no way of reaching it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And even if we could...we would need<br> to fight them inside that rift.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And fighting in outer space is uncharted territory even for Heroic Spirits like us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if there were a spacefaring Heroic Spirit here, the battle would be over by the time they were to reach Chaos.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Goetia, the King of Demon Gods, managed to store all the magical energy of human history in bands of light...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but even if we had equivalent energy at our disposal, we would still be unable to destroy Chaos.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That... That can&#39;t be\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Excuse me, Mr. Holmes? I have a question!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Go on.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Remind me, are these machine gods<br> different from conceptual ones?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They aren&#39;t. It&#39;s difficult to convey accurately, but they are close indeed to gods born from deified natural phenomena.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So while they are fundamentally dissimilar to natural gods, they still function as gods who preside over nature and various phenomena.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t explain it any better than that.<br> Do you understand now, Ms. Miyamoto?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I see, I see.<br> So they&#39;re basically still natural phenomena, huh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Great! No problem, then!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I might not&#39;ve been able to beat Zeus on my own,<br> but I can totally take this Chaos thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow, Musashi, that&#39;s amazing!<br> But...are you sure?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Cut the shit. I know you wanna put on a brave face, but this ain&#39;t the time for jokes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thank you, Caenis. That may be the first helpful<br> assertion you&#39;ve made since we first met.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ms. Miyamoto, I&#39;m afraid that, regardless of how exemplary your sword skills may be, there is simply no way you can destroy that enormous mass from\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Who said anything about destroying it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That overgrown temple up there usually sticks to its own side of the universe and never interferes with ours, right?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The only reason it&#39;s able to stick its, uh, pupil into<br> our business now is because of that hole up there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So in that case, all I&#39;ve got to do is get rid of the hole. I might not be able to destroy the eye, but I can close the window it&#39;s looking through, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> True, but the problem is, that hole is not a window.<br> It&#39;s a hole in space itself\u2013a total absence of form.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It is a void...<br> Ms. Miyamoto!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now you&#39;ve got it. I finally figured out why I&#39;ve kept popping up around you guys all this time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Haha, I know I said there was something out there I&#39;ve<br> still yet to slice, but I never thought I&#39;d find it here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. Hang on.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Nope, sorry. We don&#39;t have time to wait for permission from some high-and-mighty official, not my style.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Every Heroic Spirit here gave everything<br> they had to save Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I might not be from there myself,<br> but it&#39;s not like I have anywhere else to go right now.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And hey, remember what I told you before?<br> About how I got to Olympus ahead of you guys?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve tried lots of times to get back to my own world,<br> only to end up drifting into all sorts of others.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> When I get to the boundary between worlds,<br> there&#39;s a light field I always end up falling through.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You can see hundreds of entrances to all sorts of worlds there beneath your feet, so I&#39;d always pick one and jump in, thinking that would be the one that finally gets me home.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But I always just ended up in a different world each time. That&#39;s how I happened to run into you in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, though we did have that really close call back in<br> the American desert, didn&#39;t we!? Man, that place was a blast!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But anyway... The more I drifted, the fewer entrances were left with each trip.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s no surprise, really. I knew that eventually, there<br> wouldn&#39;t be a world left that would accept me.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> \u201CThere is no place for you in any world.\u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I mean, it only figures, right? The Japan I came from was long since pruned away. Looking back on it now, it must&#39;ve been a Lostbelt itself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And so, I became a wanderer<br> drifting through space-time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I kept barging into all sorts of worlds under the pretense of finding my way home, and kept getting kicked out.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Sometimes, when I found myself in a really nice world, I&#39;d even try to settle down there.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to face reality. My options were dwindling rapidly and I didn&#39;t want to deal with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then...when you said you&#39;d stopped ending up in other worlds\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...She meant that this one would be her final stop. Coming here was her fate.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> When I first heard about her condition in Russia, and how this was the only world she had ever revisited via Shimousa...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...I knew then that this would happen someday.<br> Sadly, Ms. Miyamoto&#39;s world-hops are not infinite, but\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Never mind that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Never mind that crap now.</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh my, so angry\u2606</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Fujimaru.<br> Thank you for getting so angry on my behalf.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But this is my karma, and my time to shine.<br> Plus, you know how I am!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now that you and I&#39;ve formed such a close bond, I&#39;m going<br> to make sure I do you proud with this one last thing.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right!<br> This is where my journey comes to an end!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And I couldn&#39;t ask for many final opponents<br> more worthy than a giant mechanical sky god!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Besides, once I perfected my zero sword,<br> I always knew I someday wanted to take it even further!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve made my decision! No more bouncing from world to world for me! Whatever happens here, happens! Woohoo!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Hold up. You can&#39;t face that thing alone\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait just a damn minute, Musashi!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><p>Phew! Sorry we&#39;re late!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><p>But we&#39;ve finally made it to the great shrine&#39;s airspace!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Bahaha! Who cares about Zeus and his overblown sparks!<br> He&#39;s not making MY hair stand on end today!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> After a fierce and daring battle against the Zeus terminals trying to keep us away from the shrine, we&#39;re here and ready to back you up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Storm Border!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Perfect! Just what the swordfighter ordered!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wait. Just what in blue blazes is going on here!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> When I had Captain enable the Border&#39;s secret<br> jet feature to bring us up past the clouds...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...the last thing I expected to<br> find was a...crack? In the sky?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-wh-what IS that...thing up in the stratosphere!? And is it just me, or is it the most terrifying enemy we&#39;ve faced!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get a read on its magical energy! It&#39;s got to be either a Divine Spirit, or a machine god\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You got it, Da Vinci!<br> That thing is the original Chaos!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s the literal mother of all machine gods,<br> including the Twelve Olympians themselves!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now they say they&#39;re going to dissolve and absorb almost half the planet&#39;s resources before just setting sail on a voyage across the sea of stars! Talk about a pain-in-the-ass deity, huh!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So it&#39;s going to slurp up the whole planet!?<br> Can it just transform anything into magical energy?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Welp, hard turn to starboard! Let&#39;s just go back to the ground and pretend we never saw a thing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Sorry, can&#39;t let you do that!<br> Hup!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Musashi! Get back here!</p><hr><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hehe. As if that&#39;s ever worked on me before! I don&#39;t<br> even go back to restaurants to pay my checks!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Just keep the ship headed for that fissure, Director! I&#39;ve got a special move that&#39;ll take care of this in a flash!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-what are you saying!?<br> Surely that can&#39;t be possible!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Go on, Fujimaru, say something!<br> Is there any way she could possibly pull this off!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not a chance in hell!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I knew it. Fortunately, as you can see,<br> I always make it a point to keep a level head.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And right now, my level head is telling me this nightmare I&#39;m seeing before me could actually destroy the world!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Technical Advisor!

H-hang on, just a moment!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru is...is glaring at me,<br> and I think [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s] crying too!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...This is Captain Nemo speaking.<br> I&#39;m the captain of the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Saber Miyamoto Musashi.<br> I&#39;ll light the way up to the Border&#39;s bow...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...and max out its inertia control and repulsion<br> conservation to keep you safe.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Storm Border might not be as<br> strong as my father, Poseidon...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> But with my Nautilus, the Shadow Border, and Hephaestus&#39;s power all helping out, we can still give him a run for his money.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I promise we&#39;ll get you to your destination,<br> no matter how rough our course might be!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Thanks, that&#39;ll be a big help! It&#39;s definitely a little far to reach on my own, no matter how good with a sword I might be!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a long journey.<br> I&#39;ve slain people... Monsters... And now, gods.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I finally encountered my destiny in the keep of Shimousa&#39;s Toke Castle, where my sword at last reached zero!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> After all that, I could wish for nothing more than to end this journey by setting out for one last selfless act!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Truth be told, most of my journey was so pathetic<br> that I&#39;m glad no one was there to see it all...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...but like I think I told you before, the times when<br> I got to fight alongside all of you were an exception.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> A female version of Musashi like me never really fit in anywhere...but with you guys, I finally got to fight for a decent cause.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I think I could have been a hero. One who could even measure up to Proper Human History&#39;s Musashi.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, thanks for everything, Fujimaru!<br> Do it, Captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Roger that! Setting a course for the fissure in space-time! Fill speed ahead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Choking back tears)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never forgive you for this, Musashiiiiii!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Current airspeed is twenty-seven thousand kilometers per hour! But I still can&#39;t get a read on our distance to the target! Waaah!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I can see Chaos with the naked eye,<br> but they&#39;re still not registering on our sensors!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Unless something changes, I don&#39;t think the Storm Border will ever make it to Chaos, not even if we had a million years!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean!? I can see it right there!<br> Can&#39;t we just keep heading straight for it!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, we can&#39;t. The only reason it looks that way to us<br> is because all we have are our simple human senses to<br> rely on to perceive it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But the distance to Chaos\u2013or rather, the route<br> to that void is actually absurdly complicated!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Exactly! It might look like we&#39;re going in a straight line, but we&#39;re actually going every which way BUT straight ahead!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Whoa! I just took a look at our course on the map, and it looks like some sort of jigsaw puzzle! And a three-dimensional one at that!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t there anything you can do about this, Captain!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I do have a route planned out,<br> thanks to the Paper Moon acting as our compass.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We&#39;re following that route right now, and it&#39;s slowly but surely getting us closer to Chaos.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Paper Moon&#39;s route to Chaos will take us sixty-two<br> hours times six-hundred and seventy-two attempts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, the Storm Border will never last that long,<br> to say nothing of Miyamoto Musashi up there on the bow.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-then what are we supposed to do!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Let me just make sure of something, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Have you gotten the hang of piloting the Storm Border<br> yet? Do you think you can operate this ship by yourselves?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not easily, but yeah, I think I can manage. I&#39;ll never<br> be able to leave this computer room again, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, and I think I&#39;ll also need the marines.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can manage the systems from here okay, but I&#39;ll still<br> need people to keep all the interior facilities clean.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Got it. Then I&#39;ll leave more clones behind.<br> I&#39;m sure I can. I&#39;ll make sure I do.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Besides, they&#39;re not much more than extras. There&#39;s no need for them to come along with me.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Captain?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If our route to Chaos is too long to traverse in Reality Space, then we&#39;ll take a shortcut through Void Space.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll cut the distance down from infinite to finite<br> by making a series of intermittent Zero Sails.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> What!? You can&#39;t do that, Captain! Not even the<br> Nautilus could handle consecutive Zero Sails!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Besides, the Border is made for punching through Void<br> Space, not jumping through it like a flying fish!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I can do it. I&#39;ll make it happen. I swear it<br> on both my Triton and Nemo Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marines:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, come now, Captain. You know you shouldn&#39;t<br> be so quick to volunteer to risk your li\u2013</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wait. Hang on. You... You don&#39;t mean...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yes, I do. Goredolf, this chair is yours now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Though I have to say, you seem like you&#39;d be a lot more at home in the cockpit than the captain&#39;s chair.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wha\u2013 You can&#39;t be serious!<br> You can&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...No. No, I...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m off to the engine room.<br> It&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Just think of this as the Storm Border<br> gaining a new Triton engine.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>That will not be necessary.</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Worry not, child of the sea. You may be short in stature, but you are great nonetheless. We shall make a path for you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What the!? I can&#39;t believe it!<br> We&#39;ve got a road!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s giving us a straight shot right to Chaos...cutting through every layer of this cross-dimensional maze!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We are Romulus=Quirinus, ally to all determined to carve new paths in this world.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> We were saving the power left in this body for what comes after, but no more.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> We have decided to use all our remaining divine aura, and all our Authority, to see you to your destination.</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Captain, waaait!<br> We can go straight there now!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> It&#39;s only two thousand meters to Chaos now!<br> The Border can get there in under three minutes!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Yeah. No need for the report, Marine.<br> I can see it for myself.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> What a beautiful view.<br> It&#39;s like looking at an ocean of light.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better stairway to the sun.<br> How can I ever repay you?</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> We may be a god, but we do not seek compensation. Neither would we see you throw your life away.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Now go forth, gallant crew of the Storm Border, and reach the destination we all seek.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> That is why we were sent here.<br> All roads lead to Rome.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Who...was that just now...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Engine room! Crank the engines up<br> to one-hundred twenty percent output!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if we end up stranded three minutes from now! We&#39;re going to get this job done come hell or high water!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Ahh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ahh, this journey was so much fun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m so lucky I got another chance to keep traveling<br> even after I met my end in Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who it was that gave me that chance,<br> but whoever you are: thank you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, but if it was humanity, then I take it back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I mean, it was humanity that made me an outcast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Musashi subject to Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, so I&#39;ll never get summoned again once I disappear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wish I could record these thoughts somewhere before<br> I&#39;m gone, but that&#39;s probably easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...But that&#39;s okay. Really, it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all, I made it this far, and I did it without<br> changing who I am. That&#39;s all I need!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Goodbye, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I might not have been able to pull it off myself...<br> Hell, I never really even thought about trying to...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but you&#39;d better make sure<br> you take back your world, okay?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay! Now that I&#39;ve said my goodbyes,<br> it&#39;s time to become the ultimate sword!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This battle is what my Heavenly Eye was made for.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Here me now, kaleidoscope of all things in this world<br> that are born, grow, and multiply.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I will sever every path, cut off every branch,<br> and draw forth the null that lies at your essence.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I will slice off every bit I possibly can,<br> then continue to slice off what remains.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Thus, I shall become ultimate. I shall become the heavens. But even that is not enough to fulfill my dream.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So I will smash through the wall of the heavens,<br> and glare at what lies beyond.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Once I have severed the formless\u2013the void...the face of pure nothing\u2013then, I shall become the Buddha&#39;s sword, and slice through destiny itself.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...Namu, Tenman Daijzai Tenjin.<br> Now is the time for me to use everything I&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Distance to target: !<br> We&#39;ll need to punch through several layers of space,<br> acting like a Bounded Field! Brace for impact!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There&#39;s still three...four...five impacts left!<br> Make sure you don&#39;t fall off!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Current speed: twenty-nine thousand kilometers per hour. Temperature of the outer hull is four-hundred degrees Celsius and rising!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Musashi, are you still there!?<br> Are you still alive!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Even at this speed, we still can&#39;t get close to it!<br> It&#39;s a lot farther away than it looks!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;ll take twenty\u2013No,<br> thirty seconds until we reach the fissure in space!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Can you hang in there until then, Musashi!?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...an.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Of course I can, Captain!<br> Don&#39;t worry about me! Just keep punching it!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Keep the bow pointed up and all the engines at full<br> throttle! We&#39;re going to do this thing in style!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...You got it! Setting elevation angle to ten degrees! Once we get above the Bounded Fields, it&#39;ll all be up to you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Chaos! Sorry for the late introduction; hopefully, you won&#39;t mind if I let my swords do the talking!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This is nothing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yikes, that was close! Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m gonna get shot<br> down before we get close enough to make my move!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let that happen! The Border is going to back<br> you up as best it can, right to the very end!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll handle defense.<br> Just save your strength for when it really counts!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Spiritron cannon, continue firing!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Whoa, nice! Thanks, Captain! I can tell from<br> your voice that you must be a real cutie!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Aw man, now I really wish I&#39;d met up with you guys sooner!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Me too, Miyamoto Musashi! But keep your focus on Chaos!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Six thousand meters to go until we reach the fissure!<br> Estimated time until collision: sixteen seconds!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Got it! Thanks for the ride, Captain!<br> You did an absolutely fantastic job!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Not at all. It was an honor to help.<br> Your bravery is an inspiration to us all.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Man, that sure is a big eye you&#39;ve got there.<br> I wonder, can you really see me with it?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Even if you can, you&#39;re probably thinking,<br> \u201CShe&#39;s only a human. What can she possibly do?\u201D</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re not wrong. There&#39;s no way a normal attack would<br> ever do a thing to a fissure in space-time or the universe.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Any kind of physical attack would be pointless.<br> As would any form of resistance.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Basically, even the katana of the greatest swordfighter ever is even less significant than space dust as far as you&#39;re concerned.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right! Everything I&#39;ve ever done<br> has amounted to no more than space dust!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I told myself I was walking the path of the sword even as I lost my way. I kept resisting, trying to accept what I couldn&#39;t come to terms with...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I left anything of value behind.<br> I don&#39;t even know if I gained anything at all!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But even so!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The one thing I do know...is that I&#39;ve been<br> lucky enough to meet some incredible people.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So here I am!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now, after a long and self-centered journey,<br> my blade\u2013my sword\u2013is ready to reach you!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Chaos! Your giant fissure in the<br> universe might be devoid of form...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But slicing the void is my destiny!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hey Shinmen Muni, you shitty old man? Y&#39;know how you love saying you&#39;re the strongest in the world? If you&#39;re out there, I hope you&#39;re watching this!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Because I&#39;m about to go where you never could!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This is for you, Ishanaten!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I shall break through the void to reach the truth!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I shall pass beyond the state of zero!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...It was a single flash of a sword.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A blade that should never have been able to hit its target. A zero slash that reached its mark with perfect accuracy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How can I prove the existence of something<br> that reaches beyond void\u2013beyond nonexistence?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> How can I describe what she did to reach a being<br> whose very essence lies in nonexistence?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To strike at the chaotic void that lay past a gap<br> in the universe\u2013beyond time and space itself?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can&#39;t. It&#39;s impossible to put into words.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All I can do...is tell you what happened afterward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Her blade did indeed rend the very sky, causing the god of void to disappear beyond space-time without so much as a gasp of surprise.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was, in the truest possible sense...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...a god-destroying strike.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Mmmmmm...!!! I did it! I cut the last god!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Not a bad job for a Musashi who shouldn&#39;t even exist, huh? That was beyond perfect, if I do say so myself!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ehehe, I hope everyone else saw that!<br> I knew I could pull it off if I tried!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Wh-what was that? What just happened?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know! Our sensors are all going berserk,<br> so I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s going on outside!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What about Musashi!?<br> Is she still out on the bow\u2013</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...No. She&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Chaos and Musashi are gone.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This ship is part of me, so I can tell there&#39;s nothing<br> outside anymore. No god, no Heroic Spirit... Nothing.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The fissure in space-time\u2013the gap in the cosmos\u2013is closed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then...does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;m not going to mince words.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Chaos returned to their original null state.<br> They&#39;ll stay silent forever now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Miyamoto Musashi burned out every ounce of her<br> Spirit Origin...and completely disappeared.</p><h2 id="section-23-the-day-to-bring-down-gods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-23-the-day-to-bring-down-gods" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 23: The Day to Bring Down Gods</h2><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!? What the hell kind<br> of bullshit magecraft was that!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell do you think you are, raining meteors down on me like it&#39;s no big goddamn deal! That shit was at least as powerful as Zeus&#39;s damn thunderbolts!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course. This is the same magecraft I used to defeat Zeus, though only the one time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So, would you agree this display of might is enough to show that I am worthy of being your Master, Caenis?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now are you willing to form a contract with me, your<br> summoner, and rise up against Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> (...Goddamn. Guess that bit about him beating<br> Zeus wasn&#39;t bullshit after all...)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Hah, no thanks. I don&#39;t take orders from any man.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Especially not the kind of man who tries to make me<br> obey by force just &#39;cause he&#39;s stronger than me!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...You think I&#39;m strong? Me?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m not. I&#39;m a weak, fragile human. Even this<br> victory only came at great personal cost.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I only managed to win by using every trick at my disposal. You would easily beat me if we were to fight again now.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...(Like hell I would. This bastard hasn&#39;t<br> even worked up a single damn bead of sweat.)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m not trying to compel you.<br> What I seek is a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re just the Heroic Spirit I need. I want your help.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find my plan to be to your liking.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...In fact, I&#39;d even say that, in one sense, you&#39;ll find it irresistible.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You see, while I have, truthfully, declared that my goal is to end the world of humans and build a world of gods...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> No, on second thought, I&#39;ll go ahead and tell<br> you everything. Just between you and me...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s the true nature of my plan.<br> Now do you see what I mean?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What the hell&#39;re you thinking!?<br> Why would you tell me that!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> The hell&#39;m I supposed to do now that you&#39;ve<br> basically told me you mean to betray Olympus!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> B-besides, shouldn&#39;t you be telling secrets like that to someone more obedient, like the Dioscuri!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...You still don&#39;t understand? I told you this precisely because I knew I could trust you.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> M-me? &#39;Course you can&#39;t trust me.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You know how I said I don&#39;t take orders from any man?<br> Well, I was lying!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just any man. I don&#39;t take orders<br> from anyone: man, woman, human, or god!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You know why I ended up in this body, right? &#39;Cause I&#39;m a killer who hates everyone, god and human alike!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes, I know. You hated the gods for their flaws and tyranny, and humans for being weak\u2013yourself included.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But even though you were so enraged and despondent as to rend your own body, you still chose to survive instead of taking your life.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ultimately, you asked the sea-god who wounded you, and whom you hated more than anyone, for indemnification, and were turned into a Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t do it to become a god like Poseidon. You did so to ensure you would never lose all hope for yourself again.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t talk about me like you know me.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Try it again, and I&#39;ll put my spear through you even if it&#39;s the last thing I do before one of your meteors crushes me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m aware of the potential<br> consequences if I misspeak.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no need to worry about meteors.<br> Didn&#39;t I already tell you you&#39;d win next time?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Here, see for yourself.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh? The hell&#39;re you talking your gloves and cloak off for? What&#39;re you thin\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...The hell? Why&#39;re your hands so wrinkly?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been like this ever since I was brought back to life. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve ever revealed this to.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ahh. I&#39;d forgotten how good it feels to dress lightly.<br> To tell the truth, I&#39;ve always hated wearing cloaks.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh. Now I can&#39;t help but want to keep going.<br> Okay, I think I&#39;ll take my shirt off too.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Huh!? Now what&#39;re you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> First you bring up Poseidon, and then you start taking your clothes off right on this beach!? Not even Zeus would insult me like thi\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Damn, you look terrible.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Thank you for your honesty.<br> It&#39;s refreshing to hear the truth spoken so plainly.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You could give Prometheus a good run for his money,<br> least in terms of sheer emaciation.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hmph. &#39;Course, I expect there&#39;s probably a more<br> fitting example in your fancy religion.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...So what about that scar on your chest?<br> How come that one isn&#39;t healed?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oh, this? This happened back in my<br> hometown, before I came to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It was a curse designed to damage my magical circuits<br> directly. My father inflicted it on me when I was a child.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Afterwards, I was shut away in a basement<br> for several days. That&#39;s how I got this.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Shut away, huh.<br> That&#39;s a real gentle way of putting it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s the only way I can put it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Anyway, to make a long story short, I made it out of that basement, made my father retire, and successfully assumed leadership of my family.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That was the point when my objective became clear.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I swore then and there that I would find a way to overcome betrayal... Oppression... Discrimination... Prejudice... Fear... Jealousy... Anger... Anxiety...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> All the human weaknesses and defects that<br> cast a pall over our lives and minds.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Caenis, your summoning was no accident, nor was it a compromise. You are my first\u2013indeed, my only choice. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you were the first to show it could be done.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t told anyone else my true objective.<br> Not Zeus, and not the Dioscuri.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I came to you because I believe you&#39;re the only one who will understand how I feel, and why I made the oath I did.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So, how about it, Caenis?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I have enough power to shock you to your core,<br> but my body is not nearly so tough as yours.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I may be overwhelmingly strong, but not so much so as to make the opposing side give up in despair.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Am I correct that that makes this a particularly<br> enticing offer for someone as annoy\u2013Ahem, hard to please as you?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You were just gonna call me annoying, weren&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Perish the thought.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, all right, I got it! Now hurry up and put your clothes back on before my bloodlust starts to fade!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> By the way, I would like to make one thing clear:<br> I am, of course, not an exhibitionist.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never forgive the gods of Proper Human History.<br> The gods of this Lostbelt can piss right off too.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Same goes for humans. Don&#39;t give a shit what side they&#39;re on; they&#39;re still all just a bunch of hairless apes.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You&#39;d have to be out of your goddamn mind to<br> come up with a plan that crazy. I love it!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, Kirschtaria, you win.<br> I&#39;ll play along with this scheme of yours.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna be using you for my own ends, so it&#39;s only fair you go ahead and do the same.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Heh. So you&#39;re gonna \u201Cprotect Olympus\u201D<br> and \u201Cbring back the Age of Gods,\u201D huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Heh... Hehe, ahhh ha ha ha!<br> Talk about a careful choice of words!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> This has gotta be the cruelest scam ever! That bastard Zeus has no idea who he&#39;s teamed up with!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is the Storm Border. I expect you probably know<br> what&#39;s happened by now, but just to be sure:</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We succeeded at severing Chaos&#39;s connection to this space-time. I can confirm that, as of this moment, they have been permanently sealed away.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> However, the Storm Border sustained significant damage over its long voyage, and we&#39;re currently far off-course from the great shrine.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be about an hour until we&#39;ve repaired the<br> ship and can return to your present altitude.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Mash.<br> Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Tree of Emptiness has begun to make its<br> way down to the ground... Towards Olympus.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Da Vinci thinks its trying to make<br> contact with the Earth&#39;s surface.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> One thing&#39;s clear right now the tree&#39;s internal magical energy is continuing to rise, and shows no sign of stopping.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> There&#39;s no time to wait for us to come back you up. I&#39;d like you to go ahead with the operation to cut down the Tree of Emptiness immediately.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...I should also tell you that the signal for the Servant who handled the Chaos situation has been...lost...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...and her record in the Chaldea Spirit Origin graph<br> stored on the ship now only says \u201CData Lost.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s all I have for you right now.<br> Good luck.</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Musashi...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...\u201CData Lost,\u201D hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...(That&#39;s every last Olympian machine god dead.<br> So what gives?)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> (Do these idiots not understand that means our truce is over, and we&#39;re enemies again now?)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> (They&#39;re all so wide open it&#39;s ridiculous... Dammit,<br> there&#39;s no reason not to sneak attack &#39;em right now.)</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...<br> (All right. Guess I&#39;m doing this.)</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Caenis. Do not be so quick to sully your<br> honor for the sake of your Master.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> There are as many different Masters as there are people, are there not? Would yours, himself a man of honor, be happy with you ending things in this manner?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hmph, so you&#39;re as considerate as you are insightful, Mr. Holy Progenitor? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not gonna do it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> They all just looked so pitiful that I couldn&#39;t<br> help but think about it for a moment.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Remember our agreement? I said I&#39;d only<br> help you lot out until we take down Zeus.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Now that that&#39;s done,<br> I&#39;m gonna go head back to my boss.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> With Zeus dead, and Chaos gone, he&#39;s all set to swoop in and take everything for himself.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hell, I bet he&#39;s hanging out in front of the Tree<br> of Emptiness looking all smug even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. You&#39;re still Kirschtaria&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m that pretentious show-off&#39;s<br> Servant. Always have been, always will be.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;ll say this for the bastard...<br> He&#39;s worth it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll tell you this too, Fujimaru and Mash:<br> he&#39;s worth fighting, and fighting as hard as you can.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I might be a misanthropic killer, but that much,<br> I can say for damn certain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caenis...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Worth fighting as hard as we can...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Caenis. How can we reach the Tree of Emptiness&#39;s roots?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What, you need me to tell you that? Isn&#39;t it obvious?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> See that palace off to the side from the Cronus Crown?<br> It leads right to the Tree&#39;s roots.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> &#39;Course, it&#39;s losing altitude along with the Tree now,<br> so you&#39;ll have to go up to the Machina Corridor first.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> From there, just keep heading up.<br> You&#39;d have to be complete idiots to miss it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Let me give you one last word of warning.<br> This goes for you too, twins.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Us?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t wanna die...<br> No, wait, that&#39;s not right, is it?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If you wanna stay alive as long as possible,<br> then get out of Dodona and go back home while you can.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna kill the Chaldeans one way or another.<br> They got no choice but to fight. But you two\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;re not going anywhere. We swore to put an end to this world, and that&#39;s just what we&#39;re going to do.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...That so? All right, got it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> If it&#39;s death you want, I&#39;ll be glad to give it to you! And while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll show you what a REAL Master is like, too!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Hmph. Got anything to say in response, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s just get this done.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to cut down the Tree of Emptiness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to defeat Kirschtaria!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right!<br> That&#39;s the most crucial mission we&#39;ve been entrusted with!</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> ...Well done.<br> It seems there is nothing left for us to say.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Holy Progenitor Romulus... Is it just me, or is your<br> body glowing even more brightly than before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-it&#39;s not that, Europa. That&#39;s his Spirit Origin<br> dispersing. It means his manifestation is almost over!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What happened, Holy Progenitor Romulus!?</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Forgive us.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we will not be able to join you for your battle against the mage who grew Atlas\u2013the opponent you must defeat at all costs.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Though Aether may have summoned us here,<br> we retain a Grand-class Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> And the only time a Heroic Spirit with Grand status<br> appears...is when the final showdown is close at hand.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> And while, owing to this Lostbelt&#39;s own peculiarities, two Grand Servants were summoned here...</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> ...we made the same choice the other did: to protect this world rather than eradicate our enemy.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Escorting the Storm Border to the void spent the last of our magical energy. Soon, our Spirit Origin will vanish.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Whatever battles are yet to come, you will now need to fight them alone. We hope you can forgive us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thank you for helping them get there. It&#39;s okay. We&#39;ve got this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry! We&#39;ll beat &#39;em in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> ...We see. Then we leave the rest in your hands, o mage of modernity.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> If, in the battles to come, you should encounter a foe<br> that threatens to shatter your very soul...look to the sky.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Emptiness\u2013or, to think of it another way, space with which to dream\u2013is within grasp to all who reach for it. Even that which lacks form can serve as fuel for the heart.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Furthermore, emptiness belongs not to the gods, but to humans. Do not be afraid to reach out and take it.</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> Do that...</p><p><strong>Romulus=Quirinus:</strong><br> ...and your hands will reach even those terrible heavens as surely as ours.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Was that an earthquake?<br> ...No. That shaking was the floating shrine starting to move.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now that Zeus is gone, Olympia Dodona has begun to lose power.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We&#39;d best be on our way, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru.<br> It appears we don&#39;t have much time left.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There, I&#39;ve made it to the ground safely.<br> No hostiles detected in our vicinity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Go ahead and jump down, Master.<br> It&#39;s okay; I&#39;ll catch you!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You okay, Fujimaru? I can&#39;t believe you need help<br> getting down from a little ledge like that...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I guess people from Proper Human History are even more fragile than I thought.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Stop that, Macarios.<br> You know [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] doesn&#39;t have the same protections we do.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I do, yeah... Sorry, Fujimaru.<br> I&#39;ll be more careful from now on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice catch, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-thank you, Master. I&#39;m just glad I could help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Fou okay, too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course.<br> He&#39;s right here inside my shield&#39;s storage space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aah! Please get back in there, Fou! We&#39;re almost certainly going to be fighting another battle soon!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> All the many defensive mechanisms that were in place have shut down. The quakes have become more frequent as well.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I can no longer sense Lord Zeus&#39;s light<br> from within the Cronus Crown.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> The Cronus Crown controls the crystal mountains, and their massive magical energy supply. It gave Lord Zeus the power to wield many different kinds of Authority.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> So the fact that it has shut down must mean...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s only a matter of time until this shrine falls to the ground...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Then we&#39;d better hurry.<br> We just need to keep heading up from here, right?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Yes, there&#39;s a small purification temple inside the palace. It should have a path that leads to the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s this place...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A table that differs significantly from Olympian design... Seven chairs... A modern-day magical circuit in the room...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems most likely that this<br> is the Crypters&#39; meeting room.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I expect this is where Kirschtaria<br> and the other Crypters\u2013Hm?</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> Attention, my fellow Crypters evacuating to Olympia Dodona.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> If you&#39;re hearing this, Zeus has fallen to Chaldea,<br> and the Tree of Emptiness now belongs solely to me.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> The moment is at hand. The Tree of Emptiness&#39;s stored magical energy has reached a critical point.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> Now that my Tree of Emptiness,<br> Atlas, is about to fully bloom...</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> ...our contest to grow our Lostbelts and determine the next course of human history is over, and I&#39;ve won.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> I only hope that you&#39;re all still<br> alive to hear this.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Voice:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you have many thoughts, but I hope you can accept the new world that will soon be upon us. Farewell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was Kirschtaria! Then that corridor must be<br> the one that leads to the Tree of Emptiness!</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? Master, the woman we saw in the Russian Lostbelt<br> is standing in front of the corridor\u2013</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Huh? What are you talking about, Mash?<br> There&#39;s no one near the corridor.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios is right. There&#39;s no magical energy there, either. Are you okay? Are you sure you&#39;re not just exhausted?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? But...I can see her right there, plain as day...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I guess this means the twins can&#39;t see her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come to think of it, our instruments couldn&#39;t observe her in Russia, either...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Perhaps she wishes to tell us something, or perhaps she&#39;s some kind of random phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Regardless, we have no time to deal with her now. As it seems she won&#39;t be getting in our way, it may be best if we moved on and ignored her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah. I guess you&#39;re right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Okay. Come on, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I... I know you&#39;re right, but...<br> She seems like she does want to tell us something...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Forget about the invisible girl and come on!<br> We&#39;re almost at the end of this!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What&#39;re you scared of at this point!? This guy completely kicked your asses in Atlantis, right?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want to return the favor this time!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah. You&#39;re right. Right now, I&#39;m just going to focus on Kirschtaria!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! Well said, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry.<br> I wish I knew what it is you want to tell us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Next time, I&#39;ll make sure to hear what you<br> have to say, but right now, I have to go!</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Hmm. You know, even I can never<br> tell what it is you&#39;re thinking.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Tell me, Priestess, did you want to stop them,<br> or did you want to kill them here and now?</p><p><strong>Foreign Priestess:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I see. It goes without saying, does it? Then, as I<br> suspected, you simply don&#39;t care one way or the other.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Understood. In that case, I won&#39;t interfere<br> with their battle either.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Perhaps Kirschtaria&#39;s inhuman resolution<br> and unshakable willpower will prevail...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Perhaps it will be the daring and unpredictable Chaldeans, who carry the fate of humanity on their shoulders...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Or...perhaps our luck will prevail over them both,<br> even after making enemies of everyone.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Regardless of what happens, as a lone priest,<br> I will simply watch and see...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> ...what form the Foreign God&#39;s own truth will take.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the Atlantic Lostbelt&#39;s tree!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the biggest Tree of Emptiness on the planet!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? That&#39;s strange. I&#39;m not getting<br> any response from Sheba.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not seeing anything in the way of confirmed future attack patterns with future prediction, either. It looks like...it doesn&#39;t have any hostile intent whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (What...? Does this mean this Tree of Emptiness doesn&#39;t possess any means of attacking its enemies? ...Or perhaps, that it has no need for them?)</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> So this is Tree of Emptiness Atlas.<br> Even I have never seen it this close before...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It really does look like there&#39;s a galaxy inside an empty tree... I mean, I could see that from the ground before too, but...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah... Seeing it up close is somehow overwhelming.<br> I mean, it&#39;s definitely beautiful, but\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>But more than that, it&#39;s terrifying, I take it?<br> I feel the same way, Adele, Macarios.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Hello, Chaldean remnants and Olympian traitors.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>As a representative of both worlds...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...allow me to welcome you to Tree of Emptiness Atlas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Limbo!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Right you are! It is I, the very Limbo you defeated only a short while ago.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Surprised? Shocked?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> No need to say anything. I can tell exactly how you feel! You&#39;re positively aquiver with astonishment, yes?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> But as you can see, I am indeed immortal. No matter what manner of harm is visited upon me, I will always bounce back as surely as turning a page\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I never gave you permission to speak, Limbo.<br> Be warned that I am not as lenient as Zeus.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now be quiet, or you&#39;ll find yourself burning to cinders like the page to which you&#39;ve just likened yourself.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> ...What was that?<br> A mere Crypter, daring to tell me what to do?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You mean you still haven&#39;t noticed? Unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You do understand that you&#39;re the shikigami Limbo left<br> here to keep an eye on the Tree of Emptiness, yes?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Well, the thread tying you to the real Limbo has been cut. You are now Limbo&#39;s last remaining clone.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, impossible! I&#39;m afraid you must be mistaken!<br> Only that onmyouji could ever hope to sever my spell&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What!? It HAS been severed!? How!?<br> What could have possibly happened!?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> This is terrible, absolutely terrible! What a horrible<br> joke! I can&#39;t believe I can only die one more time!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Very well, if you&#39;ll excuse me, Kirschtaria Wodime,<br> I believe I shall leave this in your hands.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to wait over by the Tree of Emptiness<br> and watch you all kill one another from afar!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Good grief. Incorrigible to the end.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> First off, let me congratulate you for prevailing against Zeus. I was sure your chances were almost nonexistent.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you managed to defeat him without<br> losing a single member of your team.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Did you say without losing anyone...?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oh? Was I mistaken? Let me see...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> There&#39;s you, Fujimaru... Mash Kyrielight...<br> Queen Europa... Sherlock Holmes...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Was there another who deserved to be counted<br> among the ranks of Proper Human History?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...(Easy, . Just breathe.)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If it is all the same to you, I would appreciate if you kept the provocations to a minimum.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Much as I would like to speak with you at length,<br> we simply haven&#39;t the time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That Tree of Emptiness behind you is in a very precarious state, and we&#39;re not about to let all our hard work thus far be for nothing. We WILL be cutting it down as soon as possible, whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> A most practical decision.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re a bit too late.<br> My Tree of Emptiness is already complete.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Before, it was simply waiting to fully bloom.<br> Now, it&#39;s using over half its power to protect itself.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Once a Tree of Emptiness&#39;s bark reaches that point,<br> it&#39;s no longer possible to interfere with it externally.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The only ones who can make the Tree die are Zeus,<br> who was connected to it directly...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...and myself, since I possess the right to use it as I see fit. And that means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If we want to cut down the Tree of Emptiness...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...our only choice is to defeat you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. That&#39;s right, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime, if what you say is true...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...then all you had to do was<br> stay out of sight and wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But instead, you chose to show yourself<br> and confront Master Fujimaru directly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that must mean you&#39;re prepared, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I am. If you are able to defeat me, I&#39;m prepared to hand over the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Oho. You never wore an expression so fierce as the one I see on you now, Mash.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You too, Fujimaru.<br> I&#39;m glad I&#39;m finally getting to see your true selves.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I knew you two weren&#39;t fighting me<br> with all you had back in Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Or at least, what I saw of you there didn&#39;t quite fit what I&#39;d heard about you before.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I was told you two never give up, no matter how powerful your opponent is. That you swallow your despair and rise up to meet any challenge.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I was also told that you acknowledge your fears, remember to search for answers, hold on to hope...and never doubt who you are.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That you were a Master who faced impossible odds and fought through them all, all while carrying the future of humanity on your shoulders.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Ahh, this is so exciting.<br> At last, you are finally as I imagined.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now, you look just like Daybit described. Now, you<br> are indeed the greatest enemy I could hope to face.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s a lot I want to say to you...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But it can wait until after we&#39;ve beaten you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Whoa! When did you learn to talk<br> tough like that, Fujimaru!?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> True, I never thought I&#39;d hear you say anything like that either. And yet, strangely enough, it also sounded just like something you WOULD say!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Indeed, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.] Fujimaru does seem to be back to<br> [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] old self\u2013as [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] used to be at Chaldea.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Right now, it&#39;s clear [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s] not consumed with<br> sympathy for this Lostbelt, nor preoccupied with the mystery of the Foreign God.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ([\u2642 His /\u2640\uFE0F Her] only focus right now is on<br> the powerful enemy before [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (...Now I see. So this is what you wanted, Kirschtaria.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (A battle to determine the greatest Master...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (...and a way to entrust what&#39;s to come to<br> Fujimaru without putting himself in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] debt...)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Wonderful.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what I was hoping for, Master of Chaldea, though you were never one of us.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to pull an Akuta.<br> I&#39;m simply going to obliterate you here and now.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1AMash:</strong><br> The enemy Master has assumed a combat stance! Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right... Let&#39;s show him what we&#39;re made of, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Come, Caenis! Let&#39;s begin! This will be the last<br> battle ever to be fought between humans!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Dammit, these guys just won&#39;t let the hell up!<br> What a pain in the ass! The hell&#39;s going on here!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, Kirschtaria, what&#39;re you holding back for!?<br> Do the thing already!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Hm? What thing? Do you mean what I<br> showed you on that beach back the\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Not that, dumbass!<br> Those meteors you love to throw around!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I never got to see &#39;em in Atlantis, and I wanna kick back and enjoy the show from the winning side for once!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ahh, you mean my meteor rain. Naturally, I&#39;m not going to hold anything back. However\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...It would seem it&#39;s time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Excuse me, Fujimaru,<br> but would you mind pausing for just a few seconds?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! The Tree of Emptiness&#39;s inner<br> magical energy is spiking rapidly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Get back! It&#39;s not safe!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something&#39;s coming down from the sky!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Could this be the Foreign God&#39;s advent!? Though right<br> now, I must admit...I&#39;m more concerned with that sky.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (It&#39;s neither the night sky nor outer space... It&#39;s not even the same cross-dimensional space where Chaos resided!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Even I can&#39;t make heads or tails of it!<br> What IS that!?)</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Did the Tree of Emptiness&#39;s insides just disappear?<br> ...No, wait, I can see something inside...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Is that...a giant?<br> It looks humanoid...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm! Mmmmmm! Indeed!<br> That is the body of our god!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> That glorious form of our glorious god is the<br> very reason we Disciples were summoned!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Excellent work, Kirschtaria! Excellent! I&#39;m impressive to see a mere human accomplish this! Well done!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I admit, I had my suspicions that your little tiff with Chaldea may be violating your contract with the Foreign God...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> But, as they say, all&#39;s well that ends well! And indeed, with this, humanity has fully and finally reached its end!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Now, no one can stop the advent of God!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The Foreign God cannot take physical form on this planet. Thus, when the Tree of Emptiness grows to completion, and its hollow is fully filled...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...the Foreign God will descend to Earth,<br> using the tree as their vessel.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s just like what you did with Grand Summon Article Aether. It&#39;s over. Game, set, and match.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Khh...! Kirschtaria!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not over yet! I&#39;ll stop you right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Mmm, hehe. Hehehehehe!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> You put up a good fight,<br> but you&#39;re simply far too late and far too powerless!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> You know, since this is all so incredibly thrilling, I think I&#39;ll go ahead and deal with you myself, so that Lord Kirschtaria need no longer\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> However...there is no place for the Foreign God here.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Look closer, Limbo. See for yourself exactly what&#39;s inside my Tree of Emptiness, what is offered to it.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Hm? What are you talking about? That form inside the Tree of Emptiness is clearly the body of... Of... What!?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What is this sickening Divinity!?<br> How can there already be another god inside!?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Who is this loathsome squatter!?<br> Who is this other god!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Who the hell do you think? You forget all the times Kirschtaria mentioned his name?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> This Tree of Emptiness&#39;s name ain&#39;t Magellan.<br> It&#39;s Atlas!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> !?<br> Then... Then...</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> You mean you summoned a Divine Spirit inside the tree!?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Atlas... Grrr, who is this Atlas!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In Greek mythology, Atlas is the name of a titan who<br> literally carried the world on his shoulders...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you brought him here ahead of time, Kirschtaria?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Yes, I did.<br> I actually summoned three Servants in total.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Caenis, a Divine Spirit from Proper Human History.<br> The Dioscuri, from this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And Atlas, the giant who served as the foundation<br> of the Greek world in Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After coming to a mutual understanding,<br> he agreed to aid me in my plan\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> A plan to build a new Age of Gods on this world,<br> rather than hand it over to the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> How dare you!? This is a clear breach of contract!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not at all.<br> I&#39;ve obeyed every instruction the Foreign God gave me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Our agreement was that I grow my Tree of Emptiness to<br> completion. We never agreed on what was going to fill it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Despite its name, it didn&#39;t feel right having it sit there so empty, so I took the liberty of preparing a resident for it ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Th-the halos are glowing red!? You mean<br> its communications have been cut off!?</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> This is a disaster! The Foreign God will never be able to descend like this!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> What is the meaning of this, Kirschtaria Wodime!?<br> How dare you disobey the Foreign God!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Obedience was not what I offered the Foreign God to begin with. We merely made a deal, as equals.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never stopped believing in the future\u2013<br> the possibilities\u2013of humanity.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> My own body may no longer fit in with Proper Human History thanks to the Foreign God resurrecting me...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But I never attempted to overthrow humanity<br> for the Foreign God&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I moved away from Proper Human History<br> so I could expel them.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Suffice to say, Limbo: I&#39;ve always despised you,<br> and the way you take twisted pleasure in destruction.</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> How dare you speak to me like that,<br> you wretched traitor!?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Not so fast, idiot! You wanna get to Kirschtaria,<br> you&#39;re gonna have to go through me first!</p><p><strong>Limbo:</strong><br> Khh...! Impudent false Divine Spirit! This is a new<br> low, even for a barbaric Servant like yourself!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You think? I hardly gave you a second thought, Limbo.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You wasted so much energy mocking everyone you could that I knew you were gonna end up the biggest laughingstock of all!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So...does this mean the Foreign God<br> isn&#39;t going to come here then?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Correct. There is already another god occupying<br> the one place they could manifest.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So the Foreign God will never appear<br> here as long as Atlas is around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then...does this mean Kirschtaria did all this<br> to protect Earth from the Foreign God?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...If only it were that simple.<br> But it isn&#39;t, is it, Kirschtaria?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At long last, I&#39;m finally beginning to see exactly<br> what it is you pose a great threat to.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Right you are, sage of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Your insight and observational skills are remarkable\u2013all the more so considering that Zeus interfered with your mind.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I have no desire for the Foreign God to rule Earth. But, I also refuse to submit to Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!? But, you just said that you were going against the Foreign God! That everything you&#39;ve done was to help humanity&#39;s future!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not humanity&#39;s future. Humans&#39;.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I have no wish to protect Proper Human History, nor do I think that human history thus far has taken the optimal path.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> In that regard, it makes no difference whether I or the Foreign God use the Tree of Emptiness, Mash.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I simply can&#39;t bring myself to choose a future for Proper Human History. You of Chaldea are the only ones who can do that.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Is this... the calm before a great flood? The kind that once drowned the world of Proper Human History?</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> No, that can&#39;t be right. This will still no doubt<br> destroy the world, but...it&#39;s so very warm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just tell us what it is you&#39;re after already, Kirschtaria!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The rebirth of humanity, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The bell of revolution has been rung.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Atlas will use the magical energy stored in the Tree of Emptiness to create new laws\u2013new textures\u2013and spread them across the world.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As for myself, I will make my declaration. Human wisdom has met its defeat. Human power alone is simply incapable of progressing beyond this point.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Humans are fundamentally incapable of making the right choice. I, of course, am no exception.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> No matter how many times we deliberate, fight, and so on and so forth, our history will never become what it should.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Why? It should be obvious. Humans are hopelessly limited by our life spans.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> We are weak. Exceedingly so.<br> Not as individuals, but as a species.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Only those within certain, privileged environments are<br> capable of love, acceptance, and respect.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> At its heart, human intelligence is built on taking from others\u2013on selfishness.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> There is no utopia to be found down that path.<br> Worlds such as that will always produce innocent victims.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The hell that was Proper Human History proves<br> as much beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But...that doesn&#39;t mean we can give up. For something this important, there&#39;s no room for compromise or backpedaling.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What I&#39;m after is simple.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If a utopia is beyond current human reach,<br> then I&#39;ll revolutionize what it means to be human.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If the human species is weak,<br> then I&#39;ll make it stronger.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.<br> Every human on this planet is about to be reborn.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> They will leave their weak human forms in favor of superior bodies, heightened senses, and marvelous potential.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I will have them become something greater than human\u2013<br> a new life-form that even surpasses the machine gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Naturally, that goes for all of you as well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This is my plan: a new Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Once everyone is like unto a god themselves,<br> there will be no more inequality.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Every last person will have the power,<br> and the responsibility, to influence the world.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And one day, should all these new gods be willing...they will give birth to a new intelligence who can and will lead history to a much better place.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That is my conclusion\u2013my own Operation God Destroyer.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As of today, humanity will erase<br> the very concept of gods.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> D-does that young man realize what he&#39;s saying!?<br> Grr, why is this ship only picking up audio!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Get Kirschtaria up on the screen already, dammit! Ugh, I can&#39;t believe the god-unfearing delusions that not-so-sweet summer child is spouting!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> How dare he try to make all of humanity into gods!?<br> We can&#39;t let him get away with such a dastardly\u2013</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wait. Did he say gods? Not monsters,<br> or spare parts for some nightmare ritual?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No, no, that can&#39;t possibly be right.<br> There&#39;s simply no way he could do that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s the whole trouble with kids these days.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> They think they can attract all the votes they need just by dangling an impossible manifesto in front of\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think he&#39;s exaggerating, Director.<br> It looks like he&#39;s telling the unvarnished truth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All the Storm Border&#39;s instruments<br> support what Kirschtaria is saying.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right now, Tree of Emptiness Atlas is spreading the<br> True Fifth Element\u2013True Ether, across the world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In fact, even as we speak, it&#39;s refining your soul&#39;s<br> spiritual format\u2013its grade, in other words.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And not just for you. It&#39;s doing the same for<br> Fujimaru, Mash, and all the Border&#39;s staff, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If this keeps up, even as you retain your humanity, you guys really will turn into beings that will eventually have the same capabilities as Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or, to measure you on humanity&#39;s scale...you&#39;ll<br> end up being on the same level as gods.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh come now, surely you jest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your magical circuits are improving<br> in both mass and quality!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, wait, it&#39;s not just you.<br> It&#39;s happening to me, Macarios, and Adele too!</p><p><strong>Olympus Twins:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Unfortunately, Mr. Wodime,<br> that plan is pure fantasy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You think making everyone into superior, godlike<br> beings will usher in a new world?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Even if you succeed at giving people everything they need, whether it be a sense of fulfillment, long and healthy lives, or physical abilities that eliminate the necessity for competition...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...so long as people retain their intelligence, there will always be conflict.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The only difference will be in scale and destruction.<br> What you are trying to do here is\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I understand that. As long as individuals exist,<br> fighting will remain the only cycle of growth.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But, that WILL come to an end one day.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> With a larger perspective, broader wisdom, and a longer life span in which to learn and grow...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...humanity will be sure to reach the next cycle.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. You will all be able to break<br> the chains that humanity thus far could not.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> From here on, humans will no longer need to make gods to save them. Everyone will be a god capable of saving everyone else.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (But...something about this still seems...)</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...That being said, some things will certainly<br> be lost in service of this greater good.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This revolution will be limited to humanity on Earth as it exists right now. I don&#39;t have the power to bring back the people from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Once Atlas&#39;s textures cover Earth, Proper Human History will be gone forever\u2013well and truly lost.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After all, it will no longer have any place to return to, just like the Foreign God cannot occupy the Tree of Emptiness with Atlas keeping them away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What...?<br> But...then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then your plan is essentially the same<br> as the Foreign God&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not any different from having wiped Earth clean...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree that my plan has merit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Under different circumstances, I&#39;d think it&#39;s incredible.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But...as things stand now, I can&#39;t accept it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Do you think I am merely running away?<br> That I seek to abandon the past and the present?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re not wrong. I have no good response to that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> While I do believe you&#39;re capable of bringing that past and present back...I also can&#39;t deny that I&#39;m passing all that work onto you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But what you&#39;re doing is no different than the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong there, Fujimaru. It may not be my<br> place to say anything, but since I&#39;m the elder Master, let me give you some advice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now that you&#39;ve seen the Lostbelts for yourself, you know they&#39;re no different from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> They all had the same goals: unify humanity,<br> make full use of Earth...and keep the world alive.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But the Foreign God is different.<br> They don&#39;t care about Earth or humanity.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You might be wondering why they bleached the world then. And you would be right to.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Think back to Goetia. He didn&#39;t incinerate humanity simply to destroy it, not really. It was only a side effect of his true goal.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> The same holds true for the Foreign God.</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...It seems the Foreign God has<br> taken measures to deal with me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I suppose it only makes sense that they would seek to end my life, since they can&#39;t touch the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m afraid none of you have a choice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to use Tree of Emptiness Atlas to revolutionize<br> the world before the Foreign God can break our contract.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What you do next is up to you,<br> Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You can choose this revolution and its bright future\u2013<br> a future of gods where everyone is happy...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...or, you can choose Proper Human History in all its bleakness, with its myriad problems and dead ends.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But be warned: if you try to interfere,<br> I will show you no mercy.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This is MY Grand Order; it is the ideal I have fought for through my entire life.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If you wish to stand in its way, then you must fight with all the strength you possess.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This planet&#39;s future rests upon<br> the outcome of this battle.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If you think you can choose a greater future than I...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> If you believe you are strong enough for me to entrust<br> you with the Tree of Emptiness...then prove it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I am Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> As a Crypter, I denounce Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I am an enemy of Chaldea, and by extension, you...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And I am the leader of Team A,<br> who fought to protect humanity!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (...I see. So this is the Master you raised, Doctor.)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (I feel as though I&#39;m going to be blinded.<br> I feel as though my heart is going to burst.)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (I was never too worried about what might happen if I<br> collapsed along the way, or if I lost my way altogether...)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (...because I trusted Daybit would be<br> there to carry on where I left off.)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> (But amazingly, it looks like there was yet another candidate stronger than me all along.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How do you like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That was for Atlantis!</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Indeed, you&#39;ve put up an incredible fight, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It can fairly be said that you defeated me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Of course, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you, like me, are so utterly spent that you can no longer stand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> So you accept your defeat?<br> Does that mean you&#39;re going to shut down Atlas?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t do that. At this point,<br> not even my death will cause Atlas to stop.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re all going to become new gods, whether you want to or not. For that, I am truly sorry.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But once you have, you&#39;re free to use<br> the Tree of Emptiness however you like.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...There may not be a way to defeat them now, but once your senses have been heightened to godly levels...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll eventually find a way to stop the Foreign God&#39;s plan as we\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The sky is burning... No, it&#39;s not the sky.<br> Is it...the Tree of Emptiness&#39;s branches...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru, get back! It&#39;s not safe!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The branches stretching across the sky are setting fire to the Tree of Emptiness!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean the Tree of Emptiness is burning!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> How is this happening!? Nothing should be able to burn<br> a fully grown Tree of Emptiness from the outside!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I know. That&#39;s why I burned it from the inside.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I burned down another Tree of Emptiness right from its roots and used its branches to spread our wildfire to your tree.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You said the trees&#39; branches formed a network, right?<br> So I used them to deliver a little...viral payload.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kirschtaria, behind you!</p><hr><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Damn, seriously!? Have you ACTUALLY got<br> eyes in the back of your head, Wodime!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I could say the same to you, Beryl.<br> I thought you would be more careful than this.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Even if you had managed to kill me now,<br> the Chaldeans are still alive and well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So I have a hard time imagining how you could<br> make it out of here without a Servant.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Well, damn. Aren&#39;t you Mr. Calm and Collected?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You figure out I was all kinds of eager to get my backstabbing on or something?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Not until just now, no.<br> To be honest, I&#39;m still a little shaken.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> You have no reason to betray me, Beryl.<br> Why are you interfering with my plan now?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you understand that this will make you a god too? Once you are, you&#39;ll be free of the Foreign God&#39;s control.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> (Sigh)... You really don&#39;t get it, do you?<br> Figures. Of course you wouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> So hey, on a different subject, Kirsch:<br> Why were you so scared of the British Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like you ever came by to see it for yourself,<br> right? So how&#39;d you know something had to be done about it?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Because I spent awhile thinking on it...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...and realized it posed a different but equally serious threat as the Foreign God themselves.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> No good could ever come of a Lostbelt appearing in Britain. It could only be a...curse that would take this very planet down with it.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Damn, seriously!? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking<br> about, but it sounds like a hell of a thing!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> They&#39;re definitely a scary bunch, that&#39;s for damn sure!<br> But hey, that&#39;s what made this all worthwhile!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> So as thanks, I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret of my own. I&#39;ll tell you why I came to your Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You remember what I told you before about<br> how I betrayed the fae folk, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Well, thanks to that,<br> they&#39;ve got it out for me reeeal bad.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> In fact, all I&#39;d have to do is raise my voice a bit and say \u201CHere I am!\u201D and they&#39;d bring divine retribution down on my ass just...like...that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...!<br> Macarios! Adele!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Oh good, so you know what&#39;s coming then. Awesome.<br> Welp... So long, Wodime. It&#39;s been real.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Mash! Fujimaru!<br> Get out of here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that...Rhongomyniad!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Kirschtaria is right! We need to evacuate immediately!<br> Then again, the sheer heat is so immense that\u2013</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Everyone, this way!<br> I can at least let all of you escape to the Crown!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (It&#39;s no use! We&#39;ll never make it in time! Especially given that we&#39;re all still exhausted from our earlier battles!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Queen Europa can most likely only manipulate gravity and<br> offer physical protection. It won&#39;t be nearly enough!)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (Then again, even if we were able to teleport to Olympus proper, that light is going to punch straight through everything in its path!)</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...No. This isn&#39;t over yet!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let this happen!<br> I can&#39;t let their journey end now...!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...No? Well, guess you get to die after all.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Especially since you&#39;re vulnerable as shit right now.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Kh...<br> Gh...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Wanna know why you lost, Wodime?<br> It&#39;s &#39;cause you were too damn busy.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You never would&#39;ve been so stupid as to let me handle<br> Britain if you&#39;d ever seen it for yourself.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> You know, originally, I was just gonna burn this Tree<br> of Emptiness down and head back to Britain...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> But after that bullshit speech you made, I pretty much had no choice but to shiv your sorry ass.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> What was it you said?<br> Everyone will be like a god unto themselves?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> That basically means it&#39;d be a world where<br> I couldn&#39;t kill anyone anymore, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> To hell with that. I&#39;d die of boredom before the end of the first day in that new world.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I don&#39;t wanna be some great enlightened version of myself.

That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And now that he&#39;s shown his true colors,<br> that makes me an enemy of the Foreign God, too.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I see. I&#39;m sorry to hear that. And what of you, Beryl?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> We now know that Kirschtaria, the leader of the Crypters, was a traitor.

Precisely the sort of thinking I&#39;d expect from a purebred hunting dog like yourself.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I take it that means the British Lostbelt is<br> now officially opposing us then, Beryl?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Since you appear to have sworn loyalty to their king,<br> can I assume you&#39;re also speaking for Britain?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Hell yeah, assume away. The old lady outright told<br> me I could do whatever I liked on her behalf.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, that Rhongomyniad we just saw was a special spell Her Majesty whipped up just for the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> We were always planning on taking Olympus out,<br> no matter what Kirschtaria got up to.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Understood.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> The Foreign God only saved Kirschtaria from death, thus giving the Foreign God control over his continued existence.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> And as Kirschtaria was the one who saved your lives,<br> the Foreign God has placed no such restrictions on you.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> You are therefore free to live out the remainder<br> of your days on this dying planet as you choose.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> ...As an enemy of the Foreign God, that is.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> Koyanskaya! Warp me over to Britain right now!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m getting some serious chills down my spine! I gotta get out of here before it&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well now, I was wondering when I&#39;d get to<br> make my entrance. How...anticlimactic.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But, very well, Lord Beryl.

If she had stayed, it would only have been a matter of time until they were at each other&#39;s throats.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> All right, you&#39;re up, Muramasa.<br> Go on and swing that katana of yours.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> This very moment is what the Foreign God chose you for.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it!<br> Atlas&#39;s body is...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (I suppose I should assume the internal fires have left the Tree of Emptiness in a permanent state of incompletion...

Status report.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Given what happened with Kirschtaria,<br> it seems like things did not go entirely as planned.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid Seyfert&#39;s flames set Magellan<br> ablaze before it could become your body.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> While your Spirit Origin is unaffected, I suspect you may be unable to make full use of your Authority as a result.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmm. So it would seem that my body still has yet to fully eclose. Well, that&#39;s all right. It will give me something to look forward to.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure I can find something here that will make up for my deficiencies. In fact, I see a meal before me now that should do the trick nicely.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Usually, a single Lostbelt wouldn&#39;t be<br> nearly enough to satisfy my cravings...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...but since I only just acquired this body,<br> it should make for a well-balanced wake-up snack.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Seeing these insects buzzing around my appetizer<br> is putting me right off my appetite.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Are those the Chaldean stragglers? Why haven&#39;t you killed them? They certainly don&#39;t look like they&#39;re at all capable of giving my Disciples any trouble.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> For that matter, why don&#39;t they fear me? I thought those of this planet were obliged to hold gods in reverence.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, I know. It would be all too easy to grind them to dust beneath my heel, but I wish to sate my curiosity for now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Tell me, Fujimaru:<br> Why do you not fear me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t humans like you supposed to bow your heads, beg for enlightenment, and submit to the every whim of great and powerful beings?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I mean...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re Olga Marie.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What the heck are you doing, Olga Marie!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What is this Earthling talking about?<br> What is a \u201Cdirector\u201D?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;ve gone mad with terror.<br> Well then, I&#39;ll be kind and explain.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I am a god who has descended upon this world from the void. I have come to right this planet&#39;s wrongs and eradicate its evil once and for all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> As the ultimate ruler, I will make Earth into a single<br> nation and personally govern every last one of its people.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, I am the sovereign of Earth...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> U-Olga Marie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Did she just claim to be Earth&#39;s president or something!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now I REALLY don&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> First she declares she isn&#39;t Olga Marie,<br> then she claims she is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just try to stay calm, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s right...

I can sense brain waves of fear and confusion.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> Now, the time has come for me to wipe this planet<br> clean of everything that once existed here.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> The human race. The Lostbelts. You lot. My Disciples<br> using silly Heroic Spirits for their vessels.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> Now that I have a physical body,<br> I have no more need for any of you.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> Now get out of my sight, beg for mercy, and repent for your misdeeds, for even my infinite patience has finally reached its limit.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> A gravitational field!?<br> It&#39;s sucking up everything that isn&#39;t nailed down!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Dammit, it&#39;s even bigger than the Tree of Emptiness! If it keeps going like this, there really won&#39;t be anything left!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed, including us!<br> Is this really what you want, Rasputin!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Because it seems this god of yours has no qualms about erasing even her own Disciples!</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> If this is what my God wants, then so be it.<br> I only wish I could have been of more use to her.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> If we use that black light on her, we could...!

I don&#39;t know if it<br> would be enough to defeat the Foreign God...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> At this rate, it&#39;s going to suck up not just<br> all of Olympus, but this entire Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (So, I&#39;m finally getting to see a Beast in person...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t need to use my Noble Phantasm to tell that<br> humanity simply has no hope of defeating her.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> (The sheer magnitude of her Spirit Origin alone vastly eclipses anything humanity could throw at her.

Of course you can&#39;t fight back.<br> I don&#39;t know why I ever thought you could!</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong><br> I suppose it only makes sense.

I didn&#39;t see that coming, but I can&#39;t say I dislike it.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Kirschtaria Wodime...<br> I didn&#39;t realize you were still alive.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> We mages have magical crests.<br> We don&#39;t go down quite so easily.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Holmes, you just said there was no possible<br> way for you to turn things around...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...but that all depends on how you look at it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> For example, my victory would be my plan to slay the<br> god succeeding, and my loss would be it failing.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now that Atlas&#39;s Tree has been razed to the ground, and the Foreign God has descended upon this world, my plan has ended in abject failure.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It represents a complete and total loss for me.<br> There is no hope of me turning things around now.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But the same is not true for you.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> For you, loss would be dying,<br> and victory would be living.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So even if the Foreign God has descended upon this world, and even if all you can do right now is run away...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...merely surviving is enough to ensure your victory.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And since you haven&#39;t truly lost,<br> you still have a chance to turn things around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I understand this is all a bit much coming from me, since I&#39;m the one who invited the Foreign God here in the first place, but oh well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now then...I think it&#39;s time I played my last card.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Rest assured,<br> I won&#39;t let the Foreign God get away with this.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Even if it is ultimately fated to vanish once its Tree of Emptiness is gone, I will protect Olympus right to the end.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> After all...I promised Zeus I would.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure the Foreign God goes away,<br> though I can only do so temporarily.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now go. Get out of here.<br> I&#39;m afraid you&#39;d only get in my way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;re obviously badly hurt...</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not as bad as it looks.<br> I&#39;ve still got plenty of fight left in me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame you and I weren&#39;t able to finish our duel,<br> though. We&#39;ll just have to take a rain check on that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> At any rate, you&#39;ve got much more<br> work ahead of you than I do.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry about this, Fujimaru. I wish I didn&#39;t<br> have to ask you to take on such enormous responsibility again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It might not be easy, but I&#39;ll give it everything I&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s okay. I haven&#39;t come this far just to lose now!</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Mr. Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Very well. You have my word that I will do everything in my power to give Chaldea a chance to turn things around.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Good. I&#39;m relieved to hear that.<br> All right then, this is goodbye.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But before you go, Mash, let me<br> give you one word of advice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I won&#39;t deny that, as a Crypter, I considered you and<br> Fujimaru my most dangerous enemies, and tried<br> to eliminate you accordingly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I did so because, at the time,<br> I firmly believed that to be what was right.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...But of course, humans are fundamentally<br> incapable of making the right choice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So the least we can do is keep shamelessly moving toward those things we have chosen, right or wrong.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I believe that&#39;s what it means to be human. We are nothing if not great at rationalizing our actions.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Still, trust me when I tell you that there&#39;s no need to fight to assuage a guilty conscience, or to atone for past misdeeds.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget, the reason you left Chaldea to go on<br> a journey was to get as much out of it as possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid the palace won&#39;t last much longer. We need to evacuate to the great shrine! Come now, quickly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...U-um, Kirschtaria!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for everything you did for me at Chaldea!<br> I wish we could have all talked a lot more!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Are they gone, Caenis?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> What&#39;re you, stupid?<br> Can&#39;t you see for your\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Yeah, they&#39;re gone. They left your sorry ass behind. Didn&#39;t even look back. So you don&#39;t gotta worry about them. Mess this bitch up. Hell, I&#39;ll even let you lean on me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Thank you. That will be a big help.<br> ...What about you, Father? Aren&#39;t you going to stop me?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Not at all. Not unless the Foreign God gives the order to eliminate you two.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I&#39;m only here to serve as a witness.<br> Truth be told, it should be quite educational.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> No matter how powerful one may be,<br> this planet still follows its own rules.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> This will be an excellent way for the<br> Foreign God to learn that lesson.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...In that case, don&#39;t mind if I do.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Stars.

Its mana was stagnant, like anecdotes from the Curses Department...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I knew I must have been poisoned with an Anti-Mage toxin\u2013one designed to attack its target&#39;s nerves and blood.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Enough time had passed for the toxin to work through my body. Both my crest and circuits were completely dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I could no longer counteract the toxin myself.<br> I would require assistance.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ghh... Agh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The situation couldn&#39;t have been worse. I was trapped in enemy territory, and what strength I had was fading fast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The only hope I had of surviving was if my grandfather noticed something amiss and sent someone to rescue me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The problem was,<br> I had no way of knowing if I would last that long...</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Heehee. Heehee, heehee...<br> Awake... Awake, awake...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...especially with more of my father&#39;s assassins looking for me.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Hee... Heehee...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It felt as though the basement room&#39;s already<br> pungent stench had suddenly gotten even worse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The boy was wearing a coat that someone else had clearly thrown away, and his hair hadn&#39;t been washed in years.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He must have carried me here to where he lived when he found me crawling through that alley after the attempt on my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I could only guess he thought he could make money off of me based on my clothes and appearance.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee... Heeheehee.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Still alive... Alive...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hearing the boy digging through a can full of garbage,<br> I was unable to hide my disgust.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was deeply ashamed by the fact that such<br> a pitiful creature had saved my life.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee... Treasure...<br> Treasure...</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Here... Eat...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The boy pressed a piece of completely stale,<br> moldy bread up to my mouth...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...and forced me to eat it, wiping the crumbs off my face with his filthy sleeves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Whatever his intent, his efforts were far from helpful. My wound had closed, but my digestive system was only barely working.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Rather than helping me recover my strength, eating barely edible food like this would only upset my stomach and make my condition worse.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> It&#39;s good...<br> Eat... Eat...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But, I lacked both the strength to resist and the energy to refuse. So I reluctantly opened my mouth and choked down the rock-hard bread.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee. Heeheehee. Heeheeheeheeheehee!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Once I managed to finish the food he forced upon me, the boy stepped away from my \u201Cbed\u201D with a satisfied smile.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He then moved to a corner of the room where he sat down<br> cross-legged, and continued his unsettling laugh.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...(Cough)<br> (Cough, hack)...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Though I was wracked with both chest pain and<br> shame about the predicament I found myself in...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I realized there was nothing I could do,<br> so I simply lay back and closed my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This would all be over in a few hours, anyway. My assailant was almost surely a mage, and so it would be trivial for them to track me down.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was only a matter of time until they discovered this place and came to finish me off while I was still incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Any help that might be on its way<br> would never get here in time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not even a god could rescue me from this situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But...my assailant never showed,<br> even after several days had passed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I think I must have spent about ten days on that<br> hard wooden bed without ever getting up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> My body was still paralyzed, but by that point,<br> I must have gotten accustomed to my environment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Slowly but surely, I took stock of my current situation.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee, heehee...<br> Here... Eat this, too...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...No thanks.<br> Could I have some water instead?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The fact that this shed was located under<br> a bridge was the one silver lining.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Thanks to that, we had access to potable water,<br> even if it wasn&#39;t entirely clean.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s better.<br> Say, how long have you been living here?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ?<br> ???</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee... Never mind. Eat, eat.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My best guess is, the boy had been living here<br> since he lost his guardian several years ago.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This shed\u2013his home,<br> must have belonged to his guardian.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even now I do not know if his parents abandoned him,<br> or whether he was an orphan from birth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He had very little in the way of language skills.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This was hardly surprising, given that he could not have had a single real conversation with an adult in all his life.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What&#39;s your name?<br> Surely you must know that much.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I was shocked. I couldn&#39;t believe there was a child in this day and age, in a modern city no less, who didn&#39;t even know what names were.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No... More than that, I wondered how he had managed<br> to stay alive on his own all this time.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee, heehee...</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Scary, scary.<br> Everyone scary.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Hide, hide.<br> Safe here. ...Always safe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>As the boy told me this,<br> he stroked a pendant he wore around his neck.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Well I&#39;ll be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Even though I couldn&#39;t use magecraft at the time, I could still tell that the boy was holding a Mystic Code of concealment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>What&#39;s more, it was an antique of incredible value:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>A talisman that belonged to a sect of witches who have been living in England&#39;s deepest forests since even before the Clock Tower was founded.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Now I see. That explains it...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No wonder my assailants hadn&#39;t been able to find me. The room I&#39;d been staying in was rendered almost completely invisible.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. That really is a treasure.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I couldn&#39;t bring myself to ask the boy if his parents had left him the talisman or if he had discovered it for himself somewhere, but at least I now understood his situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was the pendant that had enabled him to carry<br> me here from the alley without being seen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It must also have been what enabled him to<br> safely \u201Cborrow\u201D food from nearby stores.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I couldn&#39;t make up my mind whether his<br> situation was encouraging or depressing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was thanks to that pendant that the boy had been<br> able to survive on his own all this time...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...but it was also thanks to that pendant that he&#39;d<br> never needed to become involved with anyone else.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In a very real sense,<br> he had slipped through the cracks of society.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So you&#39;re... Um...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Unsure of what to say to him,<br> I ended up saying nothing.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee, heeheehee...<br> It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty. Pretty.<br> Treasure. My treasure.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The boy gave me a big smile while gently tucking<br> the pendant away, never grasping my true intentions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...Even thinking back on it now,<br> it still makes my chest ache.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Several more days passed,<br> and I made a number of new discoveries.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Always. Saw you. On bridge.<br> Always. I saw.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>That finally jogged my memory.<br> This boy was the vagrant I&#39;d seen when crossing the bridge.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Always. Saw you.<br> ...Always.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I&#39;ll never understand what<br> I must have seemed like to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No, I&#39;ll go further. I should never<br> presume to think I could understand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>All I can say is that, as far as he was concerned, I was someone he&#39;d seen crossing the bridge, and that was enough for him to help me.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The boy may have been ignorant, but he wasn&#39;t stupid.<br> In his own way, he understood the current situation too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For starters, he never once left the room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Some part of him understood that if he went outside,<br> even with the pendant...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...there was a chance the people who<br> attacked me would discover us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So for almost two weeks,<br> he fed me using food he already had on hand.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Food...<br> ...Food, food...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?<br> Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Heehee, heeheehee.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> No, no.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> No problem.<br> Safe here. Safe...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> I see. Well that&#39;s all right then.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even having grown accustomed to this environment,<br> I was beyond exhausted.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I still couldn&#39;t move my limbs,<br> and my strength was no closer to returning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was no surprise. The food the boy was giving<br> me had no nutritional value whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And while his pendant may have kept us safe from my<br> assailants, it also kept us hidden from my allies.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I sighed loudly in despair, and closed my eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As I slept, I dreamed of my body rotting away like a decaying tree until I finally died.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Wake up, wake up.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was the first time the boy had<br> ever woken me up of his own accord.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee... Heeheehee.<br> Food, food.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Eat, eat up.<br> Have lots. Lots.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Is that...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>My voice all but broke in shameless excitement.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>In his hands, the boy was carrying a<br> basket filled to the brim with bread.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>And not stale, moldy, leftover bread like he&#39;d been giving me so far. This was bread that had clearly been freshly baked that morning.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This is amazing. Although... It&#39;s all just bread, huh. Don&#39;t misunderstand, I do appreciate this, but if you were going out anyway, it would have been nice if you had gotten some other things, too.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Here, food.<br> Eat, eat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I didn&#39;t realize until later why the<br> boy had only had stale bread on hand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It was because, for the entirety of his life,<br> he had never known any other sort of meal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t understand that back then,<br> since mine had been a life of luxury.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, there was something else I failed to<br> notice, too. Something much, much more important.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Very well, don&#39;t mind if I do.<br> Mmm, yes, this is much easier to eat. It&#39;s great.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> Heehee... Heeheehee...<br> Hee... Hee...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The boy suddenly fell into the bed as if he&#39;d<br> tripped on a rock, his arms clinging to the top near my pillow.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He looked just like a child dozing off at their desk.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Hm? Are you oka\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The boy had always looked so malnourished...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...that I hadn&#39;t even noticed how sunken his cheeks<br> now were, or the fresh bruises on his body.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Ah.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He&#39;d been living alone all this time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course he wouldn&#39;t have enough food on hand<br> to feed two people for over two weeks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The only reason he&#39;d had any at all was because nobody<br> had stopped him from taking it, thanks to the pendant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The food he&#39;d had on hand was only enough for one person\u2013only enough for him to survive on his own.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And ever since he&#39;d taken me in,<br> he&#39;d not so much as set foot outside.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He knew that if he left with the pendant,<br> this room would no longer be safe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So he left it by my bed...to keep ME safe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In an instant, it was clear as day what he had done to bring me more food.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He must have been accosted and beaten over and over.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And since he had barely eaten a thing<br> ever since he took me in...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...the malnourished child simply<br> could not endure such punishment.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Trea...sure...<br> ...Safe...safe...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No. He couldn&#39;t have. No one would ever do something so absurd, so patently foolish...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He may have been ignorant, but he was smart.<br> He would never willingly choose to do this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Still on the bed, the boy looked at my face as<br> I lay there as though he was gazing at the stars.</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...Pretty...<br> Heehee... Pretty...pretty...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...No. No, no, no.<br> Hang in there. Please. You have to\u2013</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong><br> ...So...pretty...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> At the time, I wasn&#39;t overcome with grief,<br> or shock, or anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was just...done, with my own stupidity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was completely and utterly fed up with how foolish<br> I had been to only look at the future...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...without seeing or relating to those I had previously treated as though they didn&#39;t exist.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...Hah.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Create something beautiful?<br> Born to be a king? A chosen genius?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What a joke. No... Jokes are at least funny.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had no idea what I had been talking about.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I bragged endlessly about creating beautiful things, blindly trusting that simply calling them \u201Cbeautiful\u201D was enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had never once stopped to think about<br> what it was that I considered beautiful.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The boy&#39;s value hadn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He had wasted his life on something so foolish, so stupid as saving me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was from the upper crust, and he was from the bottom of the barrel. That much was clear from what we were each bound to contribute to the world in the years to come.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, still...could I do what he did?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Could I risk my life solely to keep<br> a perfect stranger from starving?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Could I risk my life without receiving anything in return, all for something I felt was beautiful?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why, of course...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I can do that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I roused my body from its long, long slumber,<br> very literally burning my soul for energy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I could feel my magical circuits\u2013a gift I had had all my life up to that point\u2013physically crumble away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then, after paying that steep price\u2013too little too late by then\u2013I ate every roll the boy had brought me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If he could do it, then I had to as well. Now that he had shown me what was possible, it was incumbent upon me to pay him back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For what he lacked in property,<br> he more than made up for in benevolence.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> ...I need to set my sights higher.<br> I need to be stronger than ever.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I shamelessly shoved the food into my mouth,<br> silently willing my cells back to life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I had no time for regret of self-pity. No, I had a job to do...and I was determined to see it done.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This was an entirely new motivation.<br> I certainly wasn&#39;t born with these convictions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If my life had continued as planned, this new ideal would never have even occurred to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But now...I&#39;ve vowed to dedicate my life to it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To take all the many gifts I was given\u2013gifts that boy couldn&#39;t even dream of\u2013and use them to demonstrate the value of human life for as long as my own lasts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After taking the full force of Kirschtaria Wodime&#39;s Sirius Light, the Foreign God disappeared from this sector of space.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Whether she was forced to retreat due to injury, or simply did so reflexively in response to the unexpected strike, is still unclear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Regardless, her exit meant that Olympus would be spared immediate destruction, and left only the Master and his Servant behind in the palace.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...So much for that. In retrospect,<br> I may have set my sights a bit too high.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> What the hell&#39;re you smiling about, you idiot? You look like a kid who just got caught with his hand in the candy jar.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servant knelt down beside their Master<br> despite the insults that continued coming...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...painfully aware of how he would never walk again<br> now that the bottom half of his body had been obliterated.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master rested what remained of himself on the floor as it crumbled beneath them, and turned to look up at the sky.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Damn, that Sirius Light was some serious shit.<br> Ophelia&#39;s didn&#39;t do anything even close to that.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Well, this IS how they were originally supposed to be used. Director Marisbury told me that in confidence.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> He said that if things ever looked truly bleak, I should use mine to save the world. Hehe... No pressure, right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master coughed dryly and brittlely as he spoke. His cough sounded like the rattling of dead tree branches.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There was no more sign of the melodic springlike lilt<br> that had previously been a fixture of his voice.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say? And here I thought all of Chaldea&#39;s<br> directors were weak and pathetic.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Sounds like this Marisbury punk was a hell of a guy.<br> Never would&#39;ve guessed.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Yes, he was. I always did respect him, but he turned out to be far more capable than me.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> He may have been an avid scientist who only cared about his research, but he was also just as dangerous as you&#39;d expect one of the Clock Tower&#39;s Twelve Lords to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master laughed, acknowledging his defeat.<br> There was no trace of regret in his voice.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> I must admit, I never would have guessed that you would cooperate so willingly with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> I was so shocked, I spilled my tea when I heard you joined their side just like that. I thought that would have taken considerably longer.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Part of me was even a bit jealous. For a moment, I wondered if it meant you&#39;d join anyone who defeated you.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Hey! It wasn&#39;t \u201Cjust like that,\u201D and they never defeated me! That was all &#39;cause Poseidon messed up!</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Then what convinced you?</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...I guess it was Chaldea&#39;s leader asking me about you.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Said he wanted to know what Kirschtaria Wodime<br> was like now. Not as a mage, but as a person.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> I think...that was the big reason<br> I helped &#39;em out this long.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Well that doesn&#39;t sound very worth your while. You&#39;ve been helping them all this time without anything in return?</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Who said I didn&#39;t get anything out of it? In exchange, I had him tell me a shit ton of stories about you from your Clock Tower days!</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Ha! Some born champion you turned out to be!</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Turns out you were nothing but an overly cautious,<br> stubborn-as-hell coward!</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Guess both the Dioscuri and Ophelia were completely wrong about you all along!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servant laughed joyously.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t laughter meant to mock the ones who had misunderstood the Master. It was meant to commend him for keeping up such a perfect front for so long.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master looked up at his Servant when he heard the laughter, squinting as if they were too bright to look upon.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> His eyesight had clouded over,<br> and his breathing was already sharp and shallow.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...Hey. What about you? You got anything you still<br> want to say, or something you still want to do?</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Go on, let me hear it.<br> I&#39;ll at least do that much for you.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...Something I still want to do, huh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, one small piece at a time,<br> the Master told his Servant about his \u201Cwhat-ifs.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He explained how each Crypter was required to have an accomplishment worthy of overturning their death in order to bring them back to life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So the Foreign God created environments\u2013customized,<br> subjective worlds...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Worlds that would let the dead<br> Crypters achieve such a thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master was then Shifted to these worlds that<br> might have been, yet were never meant to be...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and from there, he and his fellow Crypter undertook<br> a journey to restore humanity.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...Damn, seriously?<br> So what, you saved the world with them?</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Only as part of a simulation.<br> They were nothing compared to the real Singularities.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Kadoc and I came to trust each other.<br> Ophelia and I shared a laugh with each other.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Akuta and I helped each other.<br> Beryl and I disagreed with each other.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> Pepe must have saved me dozens of times. Arou may seem<br> frivolous, but he has a strong sense of integrity.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...I really enjoyed getting to understand them better. Getting to know their lives...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, all the time the Master spent with his teammates was no more than a dream, an illusion that was broken the moment his accomplishment was complete.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now, the only one in this whole world who remembered their trying but important journeys was the Master himself.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...And you still treated &#39;em like that?<br> What, is your heart made of stone or something?</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> What else...could I do? If I&#39;d told them...<br> they wouldn&#39;t know...what to make of it.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> So I just...kept it all to myself...like any other dream.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> More precisely, he locked the experiences away so he would never look at them again. To make sure that, regardless of what happened, they would never fade away.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...Heh. A journey to...restore humanity, huh.<br> That may not be...the best way to put it...</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> But, if it were at all possible...I wish all of Team A...could have saved the world together.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Master truly loved his teammates.<br> Not as their leader, but as their friend.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They&#39;re the same, the Servant thought bitterly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This Master, and Chaldea&#39;s Master,<br> were in the exact same position.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As his breathing slows, one last thought flits across the Master&#39;s mind, like a shooting star in the night sky.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...The hell were you thinking, you idiot?<br> You didn&#39;t have to try so hard all by yourself.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> ...Haha. I&#39;m glad to hear you...say that, Caenis...<br> but you&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> I was never...all by myself.</p><p><strong>Master:</strong><br> All humans are...trying to do their best.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Tch. Like hell they are. Don&#39;t you try and pull that shit with me, Kirschta\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no answer.<br> His soul is already gone.</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servant turns towards the sky as though watching a bird fly away, never to return.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Mistakes flood the Servant&#39;s mind.<br> Unquenchable hatred pounds the Servant&#39;s heart.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servant wasn&#39;t about to reject the past or previous actions. The pride this Heroic Spirit held refused to sully the very nature of a hero.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all, the Servant had been the one who laughed at the world of humans\u2013the one who mocked and wreaked havoc upon it. That aspect would never change.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Servant was well aware they were a villain who hated humans, despised gods, shunned what was right, and embraced what was wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But even so, in spite of all that...</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> Dammit...</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m the idiot.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even if everything about her/him was evil...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...she/he remembered what she/he was meant to protect,<br> even as she/he regretted failing to do so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She/He took up her spear of lightning,<br> and a golden bird took flight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Her/His next actions would not<br> be for her/his own glory...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but to show that she/he was indeed the<br> right Heroic Spirit for her/his Master.</p><h2 id="section-26-one-day-at-the-beyond" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-26-one-day-at-the-beyond" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 26: One Day, At the Beyond</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that light!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...That looked just like Ophelia&#39;s)</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...There you are!<br> It&#39;s about time we finally got a decent connection!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Right then!

Come on,<br> let&#39;s head back to that intersection and\u2013Look out!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fo, foooooou!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t just watch your step!<br> Keep an eye on what&#39;s above you, too!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You guys are flesh and blood humans, so even a little falling debris could end up killing you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right. I&#39;ll be fine, but Senpai is\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> With the Ortinax&#39;s output so low right now, you&#39;re not much more durable than an ordinary human. So please, be careful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right. I will.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> The situation seems dire. While we do have some floating Mystic Codes prepared, we simply no longer have enough magical energy to make use of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> We could never make them last long enough for the Storm Border to reach us, and there&#39;s no guarantee that we wouldn&#39;t end up hurtling to our deaths!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have much magical energy remaining<br> either...but there may still be something I can do.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Adele. Macarios. I&#39;m going to use the last of my magical energy to provide the children of Chaldea with a defensive Bounded Field and a floating spell.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> While I would be very grateful if you would help me...</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> ...whether you do so or not is entirely up to you.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Europa?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Of course we will, Lady Europa.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What Adele said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait. A Bounded Field and floating spell would be<br> a huge help, but why stop at just us? Can&#39;t we all\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Operation God Destroyer is complete now. Even the Tree<br> of Emptiness is finally gone from this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This is our new future\u2013the one we&#39;ve<br> been dreaming of for a long time.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Right. Today is finally different from yesterday. I&#39;m sure our cells are growing again for the first time in forever.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We can finally pick up from where we<br> left off ten thousand years ago.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s all we need.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Besides, we&#39;re not as weak as you guys,<br> so we can get down from the shrine on our own.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> What Macarios said.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Even if this Lostbelt does soon return to its original<br> form...our time is only just beginning.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Take care, everyone.<br> ...Take care, Mash and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> And thank you...for everything.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This time we spent together may have<br> gone by in the blink of an eye...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...but I enjoyed every second of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...We enjoyed it too. That&#39;s exactly why)</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Haha, come on, don&#39;t look at us like that.<br> We all accomplished what we set out to do, right?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit...there were a number of times<br> when I thought it might be hopeless.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I mean, I could tell from the first time I<br> saw you guys that you weren&#39;t bad people...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...but I thought we might be screwed<br> when it came to the operation.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> But you really came through...<br> You gave us the tomorrow we were hoping for.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I can feel it right now, at this very moment.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> We&#39;re in a different day now than we were yesterday.<br> We&#39;re finally growing again.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This Lostbelt may end up disappearing, but even so...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I still feel as though anything could happen today.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> This is what I wanted...<br> What I&#39;ve long since hoped to feel.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So, thanks.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I know most Olympians would probably consider you guys<br> and us to be the most evil people ever, but...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. Most Olympians may very well think that.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t. Not one bit.<br> And isn&#39;t that enough?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;ll never forget you guys...even if this world was never meant to exist.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So as long as you guys remember us proudly...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s plenty meaningful right there.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> We&#39;d much rather you remember us like that<br> than to keep on living aimlessly forever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you both so much for helping us get this far.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thanks, Macarios, Adele.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t we at least stay together until the en</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s very sweet of you, Fujimaru.<br> But, no, I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Our end&#39;s not gonna be the same as yours.<br> Even Kirschtaria said so.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So don&#39;t worry.<br> We&#39;re okay going our separate ways here.</p><hr><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to thank you all as well.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Thank you for watching over Lord Zeus&#39;s loving heart,<br> and over Olympus&#39;s pride.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> May you all live on, children of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> O beloved Zeus in heaven, send your winds from the far reaches of humanity to aid these travelers.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> And may your protection keep them safe<br> from all manner of disaster that may befall them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It worked... We now have a defensive<br> Bounded Field, and a flight spell...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Bye, Mash! Bye, Holmes!<br> Bye, Fou! Bye, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You Proper Human History humans might be weak,<br> but you were still a great Master anyway!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You proved that beyond a doubt when you faced off with<br> that other Master Zeus himself called a friend and won!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Sniff)... You guys...!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, what&#39;re you crying for!?<br> You&#39;re supposed to be proud about that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You twins were both amazing, too!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh come on, you&#39;re lumping us both together like that!?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You could at least try to compliment us more individually!<br> Ahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Fly away, Chaldea. Fly away.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And make sure you land somewhere far from here!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Give our best to everyone on the Border! And to all the<br> other people in the world once you&#39;ve saved them!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Man, you&#39;re amazing, Queen Europa.<br> They&#39;re already so high up I can&#39;t even see them anymore.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Do you think they&#39;ll be okay?<br> I hope they don&#39;t get hit by any debris or anything.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Not to worry. The gods will surely protect them.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Yes. I have no doubt that all the gods who fell here...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...and the gods from Proper Human History,<br> will keep them safe.</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> Indeed. That would be lovely.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Hey, Macarios?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> What is it, Sister?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Remember how you said we can get<br> down from the shrine on our own?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You weren&#39;t very convincing.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Aw man, I can&#39;t believe even<br> you could tell I was lying!</p><p><strong>Europa:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry, you two\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to apologize for, Your Majesty. We wanted them to take to the sky, and they did! That&#39;s all we need!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Proper Human History, huh? They never did tell<br> us much about it. I wonder what it&#39;s like?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> It must be a wonderful world if it managed to produce people like them.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Yeah. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Then we really did do the right thing.<br> This has gotta be what&#39;s best for Olympus.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I&#39;m not regretting this.<br> I&#39;ve been dreaming of this day since forever.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> This is exactly what we wanted.<br> Now, everything&#39;s gonna go...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Don&#39;t do this, Macarios.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Sister, but...I&#39;ve gotta say this.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...You know what?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get me wrong.<br> I really do think this was for the best.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I&#39;m not just saying that; I really mean it.<br> It&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to keep fighting for so long.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> But...all that said...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> All that said...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I know we&#39;ve killed all the gods and betrayed<br> all the other Olympians, but...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> If there was a chance\u2013even a tiny, one in a billion possibility of having just one wish granted...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even know who could possibly grant<br> it now that all the gods are gone, but...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> There&#39;s a tiny, tiny part of me that feels like...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...if, somehow, I could have one wish granted, then...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...just once...I wish I could&#39;ve seen beyond tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And, especially...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...I wish I could&#39;ve seen what you were<br> like when you were all grown up.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh silly.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t have to tell me that.<br> I&#39;ve always felt the same way...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> I can see everyone&#39;s Spirit Origins! It looks like<br> they&#39;re floating, but I&#39;ll go ahead and guide them to the deck!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Meuni\xE8re, switch the Border over to thruster mode.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Maintain airborne altitude until Fujimaru&#39;s<br> team is safely inside the ship.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Roger that! No problemo! Okay, let&#39;s see, where were the thruster controls again...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Grr, I thought I told them to wait at the altar! Why did they have to go to the extra risk of using flying magecraft!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well, nothing to be done for it now.<br> Open the deck hatch!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> As soon as we&#39;ve collected the field team, we&#39;re getting out of this airspace faster than you can say \u201Cskeddadle\u201D!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Hi, yes, sorry, I&#39;m afraid I have an emergency<br> report to make before we get to that.</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> A powerful Spirit Origin signal is headed towards us from the Dodona palace. It will reach the ship in ten...nine...eight...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> So we&#39;re STILL not out of the woods!?<br> What in the world do we have to deal with now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...We actually managed to make it back. I almost can&#39;t believe it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Though it looks like Europa&#39;s defensive<br> Bounded Field is gone now...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Indeed. It was an absolutely perfect spell while it lasted. No question as to why she was queen of the gods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> If not for her delicate magecraft, I rather doubt we could have flown this far in safety.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> What are you just standing around for!?<br> Get in the hatch already!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s an unidentified Spirit Origin headed your way<br> right now! It&#39;ll be there in three...two...one\u2013Aah!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hey there. So, you punks really did make it out of<br> there alive. Good. Wouldn&#39;t be any fun otherwise.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But weaseling out of tight spots is one of the things you lot do best, right? Knew flying here was the right choice.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So where&#39;re the twins and Europa?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Aha. So they&#39;re dead. Well hey, that figures.<br> No point in saving their lives now, right?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So you went around pulling all the shit you wanted and decided to scram before it got real, huh? I like that. Hell of a lot less cleanup that way.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Only problem is...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You assholes got no business being the only<br> ones to make it out of this scot-free.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think, Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Caenis.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Caenis? As in Caenis, the Divine Spirit!? So she managed to survive too? Well, that&#39;s just grand!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Go ahead and invite her to celebrate this victory with\u2013<br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hold on. Are you sure that&#39;s really Caenis? That Spirit<br> Origin pattern doesn&#39;t match the one in our records at all.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While Caenis did have some Divinity mixed in previously, now there&#39;s divine aura emanating out of the Spirit Origin&#39;s every pore! It&#39;s almost like a purely Divine Spirit!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s precisely it, Goredolf. I don&#39;t know how this happened, Caenis as she appears now is quite clearly a god in her own right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In fact, at this moment, it would be no exaggeration<br> to call her a direct proxy of the sea-god himself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...Keep the hatch closed for now, Goredolf.<br> There&#39;s about to be a battle up here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh!? But why!? Our battle here is ov\u2013</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Shut up. You shoulda hung up on Mustache a while ago, Detective. Perceptive as always though, I&#39;ll give you that...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...but we don&#39;t need a peanut gallery getting<br> in our way during our fight to the death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Caenis, there&#39;s no reason to fight us anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already lost your Master,<br> and any reason you may have had to protect this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And despite all that, you still want to fight us?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...You done?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> So, now we know what your Servant thinks, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> How about you? Got anything to say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Only this:</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to back down, are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Hell no.<br> This unfinished business ain&#39;t gonna finish itself.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> You punks brought down freaking Olympus.<br> That&#39;s huge. I couldn&#39;t ask for more worthy opponents.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And hey, I might not be your typical Greek Heroic Spirit, but it&#39;s still what I am. And if there&#39;s one thing we all know Greek heroes are about, it&#39;s revenge, ain&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It sounds almost farcical hearing that from you, Caenis, given how much you despised Olympus...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t deny that your will to fight, your drive,<br> and your spirit are more united than ever before.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> This must be your final destination\u2013the one you failed to reach in your lifetime It seems you&#39;ve finally arrived at your answer, Caenis.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Then as such, we are obligated to respond accordingly,<br> even if this battle is entirely unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I&#39;m aware your magical energy has also<br> long reached its limits, but...can you still do this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You know it. Let&#39;s go, Caenis!</p><hr><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Ha. Well, look at you...a goddamn weakling of a Master glaring at me like you actually know your shit!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Fine, then let&#39;s go. When we&#39;re done, all that&#39;s left of you and your Servants will be dangling from my spear!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> One last thing:<br> remember my name.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I am the one who made Poseidon pay for violating me,<br> and took his place as a god in recompense.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I am the foolish king who lost himself to the vices of killing, violence, anger, and pride.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But right now, all that I do,<br> I do for my contracted Master!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I am Caenis, the Divine Spirit!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> And I am the only Servant who<br> Kirschtaria Wodime truly trusted!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Damm, so you wanna bring every human<br> up to the gods&#39; level, huh?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> That explains a hell of a lot, Kirschtaria.<br> No wonder you&#39;re so desperate to get things moving.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> I dunno what the hell you did to yourself, but it&#39;s pretty clear you could drop dead any second.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But, if this plan of yours works, you&#39;ll be set<br> for a nice, long life. Typical human thinkin\u2013</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Ah, my apologies. I clearly didn&#39;t explain myself well.<br> My plan is to make every human besides myself into gods.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> So this revolution won&#39;t include me. Even if my plan works flawlessly, I&#39;ll still be an ordinary human.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Well, you might say it is similar to how a doctor can treat anyone except themself.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> This revolutionary rain of meteors I&#39;m envisioning requires a central spellcaster to work. One can&#39;t turn both the central axle and the world that turns around it at the same time.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Really, if I&#39;m being completely honest,<br> my plan isn&#39;t entirely foolproof...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> But when I shared it with Atlas, warts and all,<br> he also reluctantly agreed to it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> That being said, I have no intention of dying anytime soon. I plan to keep on living for as long as I&#39;m able.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> Besides, if my plan goes well,<br> then it will be everyone else&#39;s turn to shine.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong><br> And who knows? I may end up living for quite some time yet, since I plan on taking it nice and easy in my retirement.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What the hell? He&#39;s gotta be shitting me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He wants to make everyone else in the world ascend to the next plane of existence, at the cost of him becoming the only relic of the past?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After all the hard work he&#39;s putting into making a<br> new world, he&#39;s gonna be the only one left behind?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No freaking way. I don&#39;t believe it. I don&#39;t even wanna think about it. That&#39;s not just cruel, it&#39;s goddamn brutal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...But he talks about it like it&#39;s the most natural thing in the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He sounded so excited about it, like he couldn&#39;t wait for this new, better version of humanity to arrive.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Your twisted nature couldn&#39;t be more plain, Caenis.<br> Both your heart and your mind are warped beyond redemption.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Castor:</strong><br> Even becoming a god has done nothing to fix that.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> You were never anything more than a recipient of the sea-god&#39;s love. How could you possibly begin to match us?</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> You never even understood Lord Kirschtaria&#39;s vision for bringing about a new Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Dioscuri - Pollux:</strong><br> All you ever did was flail about in anger, curse the gods, and think of nothing but yourself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...They were right.<br> That sums up my whole life right there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I could never get behind his goddamn plan. Not really.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I never once thought it was a good idea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Shit, the idea of a world where everyone&#39;s a god sounds like my own personal hell on Earth, and I told him as much.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, all that aside...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He still lived a life I can&#39;t even imagine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> He had a dream so huge and stupid nobody else would<br> even think about trying to make it reality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Seriously, how messed up is it that he got me,<br> of all people, to want to support someone?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And not just anyone!<br> A stuck-up world-is-my-oyster type like him!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Crap. No wonder these Chaldea dipshits beat me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The second that happened, my fate was sealed.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> ...Ha. Well, this is pathetic. Can&#39;t believe I picked a fight then went and lost it.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> But you know, it&#39;s okay.<br> At least I got to go out swinging.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> This&#39;ll tie a nice little bow on my stupid summoning.<br> Now I don&#39;t have to worry about you punks or him anymore.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> All right, assholes! This is where I&#39;m getting off!</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> See you all in hel\u2013On second thought, guess<br> you won&#39;t be going to our hell, huh, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong><br> Well, whatever. Point is, I&#39;ll be waiting for you on the other side!

You know we&#39;re back online now, right?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> W-we are!? Dammit, Spinach, why didn&#39;t you<br> say so sooner!?

I trust you can all hear me!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Once I open the hatch, which I&#39;m about to do in a moment, I want you all to get inside the Border double quick!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> As soon as we&#39;ve confirmed your safe return,<br> we&#39;ll be getting out of this airspace immediately!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You can make your report to me after<br> you&#39;ve had a good, long rest!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> However...there is just one thing<br> I would like to say first.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Well done, Fujimaru. Well done, Mash.<br> Well done, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Now that you have returned,<br> I am officially marking the following mission complete:</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Order Lostbelt No. 5, and its Sub-Order,<br> Those Who Cross the Sea of Stars.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I daresay your performance deserves full marks across the board. I advise you all to look forward to your next bonus, for I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Come on, Mash.

I&#39;m not usually one for revenge...</p><p><strong>Peperoncino:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;ll make an exception for you, Beryl Gut.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Screams. Shrieks. Groans.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Despair. Misery. Fury.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> This is what should have been heard all across Olympus, the supposed utopia of the gods.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was so looking forward to basking in them, to feeling joy and sorrow with my entire being as I laughed at the humans collapsing into tears!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was all set to point and laugh, to mock these humans as they succumbed to despair...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but I never expected to encounter someone<br> who could use Rojintsu in such a manner.</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> ...He, hehe, he.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can feel my entrails waking up from their slumber. It&#39;s been a long time indeed since I last made use of my true body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I must admit, I am most vexed with myself.

Academia? Art? Did<br> those so-called legacies amount to anything whatsoever!?</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> They gave their pets eternal life,<br> and even limited their value...</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> ...and in the end, they were done in by<br> rogues they utterly failed to control!</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> A mere two specimens of humanity\u2013larvae left over from the Olympiamachia who went and betrayed their keepers!</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> And now that Chaldea and company have had their way with them, not a trace remains...</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> What else could one call this but a glorious farce!<br> He, hehe, hehehehahahahahaha...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I come not to bury the gods, but to praise them!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Rest assured, this Alter Ego will never forget these<br> old ones&#39; final moments, nor their death throes.</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> Indeed, now that I&#39;ve witnessed this beautiful sight,<br> I can scarcely restrain myself any longer!</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> Yes, next time...</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> I, Ashiya Douman...</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> ...shall entertain the god-slaying<br> Master in my true domain...</p><p><strong>Beautiful Carnivore:</strong><br> The bowels of hell itself!<br> Hehehehehehehahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...Zero Sail systems are all green. Magical Reactors<br> are operating in parallel. Hull damage minimal.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> In that case, there won&#39;t be any need for us to do a rush dive. We&#39;ll be able to begin a standard one before this Lostbelt disappears.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Meuni\xE8re, would you mind giving me a hand?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> You got it, Captain!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> No, wait, forget just giving you a hand. You only just got back on your feet, so you should still be taking it easy for a while. Just sit back and let me handle things for now.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Solid as a seashell. Now go take a seat in the<br> copilot&#39;s chair, and don&#39;t forget your seat belt.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> R-roger that.<br> ...Solid as a seashell?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Dimension-piercing battleship Storm Border, preparing for deployment. Setting a return course to the Wandering Sea.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All hands, I&#39;ll do my best to keep the ship steady,<br> but stay alert just in case!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...You know, now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ve really got our work cut out for us, don&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Getting through Atlantis and Olympus was a huge<br> ordeal...and fortunately, the Atlantic Lostbelt&#39;s<br> Tree of Emptiness is technically gone now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But its branches covering Earth&#39;s stratosphere haven&#39;t gone anywhere, the Foreign God made her descent...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, she manifested with the Spirit Origin of Beast VII\u2013one of the Evils of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> At one point, the Foreign God was one step away from<br> wiping out all of Olympus and taking you guys with it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but a massive burst of magical energy fired at her from the palace put a stop to that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That seems to have done some damage to her,<br> from the looks of it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...since she responded by pulling in two of the Alter Egos, Rasputin and Senji Muramasa, and disappearing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> At the moment, not even the Border&#39;s sensors can determine where they might have gone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just as well, really, seeing how we wouldn&#39;t have<br> a snowball&#39;s chance in hell if she tried to attack us now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Anyway, the big problems now are the Foreign God&#39;s name, and what she looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> U-Olga Marie...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The sovereign of Earth...</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Yes, I recognized that face from the database!<br> That was definitely Olga Marie Animusphere!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But how!? She was killed right after the bombing at<br> Chaldea that began the Incineration of Humanity!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> What in the world is going on here!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me this means Chaldea<br> was behind everything after all!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Did I really make a once-in-a-lifetime bet on an<br> organization that&#39;s trying to wipe out all of humanity!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I... We&#39;re not sure about that, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Was that really Director Olga Marie?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A fair question. Given both yours and her reactions,<br> it seems safe to say there are strong similarities...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but there were also too many clear differences to say they are the same person.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> First, we know that the Foreign God manifested in the spitting image of Olga Marie, and that she also claimed the former director&#39;s name as her own.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Second, her Spirit Origin was far from human.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She is neither Heroic Spirit nor Servant.<br> The Foreign God manifested as a Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Third, she did not know who you were, and she also<br> seemed unfamiliar with Earth culture and language.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Taking all this into account, it would seem Beast VII shares many similarities with Beast I, Goetia...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...and the way he manifested using King Solomon&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Th-then, the Foreign God is using Olga Marie<br> Animusphere&#39;s body in the same way?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The body of the daughter of the Animusphere family, which was formerly among the Lords of the Clock Tower?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...This is a disaster. A highly talented<br> mage&#39;s body being used as a vessel...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then, if I had happened to be there...that means the Foreign God would have looked like me!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Calm down, Goredolf.<br> I do understand the terror of the unknown...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...but remember, we do know a great deal about what sort of person Olga Marie Animusphere was.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> While we may not yet know what it is, we can assume there is a reason why the Foreign God chose to resemble her.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Fortunately, all the Animuspheres&#39; data was also brought along to Chaldea Base...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...so I&#39;ll start going over it once<br> we&#39;ve returned to the Wandering Sea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have no doubt we&#39;ll find some manner of clue<br> in there that will help lead us to the truth.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-I see. You&#39;re certainly taking all this in stride, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Actually, I just had a thought...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> According to the report I just received, it looks like one effect of your being struck by Zeus&#39;s lightning was a reduction in brainpower...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> S-so how are you doing now? Are you back to your old<br> self yet, or are you still something of a moron?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouron?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Not to worry, Goredolf.<br> My brainpower has very nearly fully recovered.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though I will say, seeing what it&#39;s like to voice and act upon my thoughts immediately has been a most novel and informative experie\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Never mind that now, Holmes. You&#39;ve been pushing yourself way too hard for way too long!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! I know all about how you&#39;ve been using your Noble Phantasm this whole time to come up with ways out of all the jams you guys kept finding yourselves in!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I know we&#39;ve got stuff to talk about, but it can wait until after you&#39;ve gotten your ass into the recovery pod!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That goes for talking to Kadoc in the infirmary, too!<br> It can all wait until everyone&#39;s recovered!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. Did you say Kadoc!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kadoc...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;d you just say, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Kadoc in the infirmary?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what are you talking about!?<br> Do you mean Kadoc&#39;s on the Storm Border right now!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, he&#39;s in the infirmary...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh, right! It completely slipped my mind!<br> We have Kadoc in custody right now!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It was right before we were about<br> to make our way up to the altar...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ve nothing to fear from me.<br> I&#39;m not carrying any NFF Services weapons this time.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I simply have a delivery for you.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1APriest:</strong><br> This delivery is not from me as a Disciple of the Foreign God. Rather, it is from Rasputin\u2013or at least what remains of his Heroic Spirit within me.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong><br> Take care of Kadoc for me, would you?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> ...That mischievous Grand Duchess was more worried about someone else&#39;s future than her own safety.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> So rather than letting him die, I thought I should at least give him a fighting chance.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> But do let him know that this was<br> a onetime only occurrence.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I won&#39;t be lifting a finger to help him again, not even if I should happen to see wild dogs eating him alive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And just like that, he dropped Kadoc right where he stood and left him. He was covered in blood and obviously in critical condition, so we got him to the infirmary right away!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But by the time we got out there to collect him,<br> Rasputin was already long gone!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That said, Kadoc is still in a coma.<br> We&#39;re not sure what will happen next with him.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> According to Nemo Nurse&#39;s diagnosis, we&#39;ll need to<br> keep him in the recovery pod for several months.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But once he IS fully recovered, mark my words,<br> I&#39;ll be grilling him for every bit of info he&#39;s got!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well don&#39;t forget, Kadoc&#39;s not the only one who needs<br> to rest, Gordy. We could all use a good, long break.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Y-yes, very true. Between Atlantis and Olympus, we have completed our largest and most trying operation to date.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> While we may indeed have our work cut out for us, I think we&#39;ve more than earned the right to take some time to relax and recover!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You said it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Okay, Fujimaru and Mash,<br> I&#39;d like to say a little something too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Congratulations on resolving the Fifth Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like we said, we definitely still have our work cut out for us, but you don&#39;t have to worry about that yet. Right now, your only job is to get some rest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can talk turkey over what comes next<br> once Holmes is back to his old self.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, that&#39;s all from me for now.<br> Great work, you two! You did awesome!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Senpai? Could I talk to you for just a<br> little bit before we go back to our rooms?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Senpai. I was just wondering something...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you make of the Foreign God\u2013of U-Olga Marie?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know Holmes thinks she&#39;s an imposter who<br> only looks like Director Olga Marie, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was totally her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have anything concrete I can point<br> to to explain it, but I felt the same way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s just something about U-Olga Marie that<br> tells me she&#39;s the same Olga Marie we knew!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, and that makes this an even bigger concern.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...now we&#39;ve got to figure out how we&#39;re going to save her.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! That&#39;s exactly right, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know we still have a lot of thinking to do<br> about what we can do and what we should do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if our goal is to save her rather than defeat her,<br> I&#39;m more than willing to fight!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Never thought I&#39;d end up back &#39;ere.<br> Guess even a Servant life&#39;s full of surprises.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So what happened to the Foreign God? How come she locked herself up in the workshop as soon as we got here?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> She sure settled down quick for all that heavy<br> breathing she was doing. What&#39;s the deal?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> She having second thoughts after one of the Earthlings<br> she treated like fleas managed to cut her?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Try to be understanding. She couldn&#39;t help but be surprised when something she considered merely part of the scenery decided to attack her.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> If a pebble laying on the ground jumped up and slashed<br> at you out of nowhere, wouldn&#39;t you be shocked, too?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Suppose so. Hell, I&#39;d lose my shit if the eggplant I was having for breakfast suddenly came at me with a sledgehammer.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Guess it&#39;s a lot like how some<br> people are scared of bees.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> ...So what, this mean Kirschtaria&#39;s<br> Sirius Light thing actually\u2013</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Of course it didn&#39;t actually hurt the Foreign God.<br> Why, it didn&#39;t even come close to breaking her skin.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> But the fact that there were beings willing to attack her at all has made her stop and rethink her approach.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> She&#39;s currently using this terminal to review human history\u2013even if she doesn&#39;t seem very happy about it.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> You know, in a sense, Kirschtaria saved our lives as well.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Thanks to him, the Foreign God is now willing<br> to let us stay on as her Disciples.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Never mind that we&#39;ve lost contact with Limbo for the moment.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Huh? Isn&#39;t the Foreign God s&#39;posed to be all-powerful<br> or some such? What would she still be needing us for?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting to that. You see, there are two surprising<br> things the Foreign God learned from these events:</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> The fact that there are insects on this world willing to attack her\u2013reckless and meaningless as those attempts may be\u2013and that there exists a lance of light capable of burning down even the Trees of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> She&#39;d like you to go investigate the latter.<br> And destroy it, of course.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> She says she&#39;ll teleport you<br> there as soon as she&#39;s ready.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> That so? Well, can&#39;t be any worse than here.<br> No telling when this place&#39;ll up and disappear anyway.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So how &#39;bout you? You gonna stay here as her escort?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ll be heading out shortly myself.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> The Foreign God desires a more durable vessel than the one she has now, so she&#39;s sending me out to procure one.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> Ain&#39;t she plenty strong as she is? Hell, it&#39;s not even possible to make a stronger Spirit Origin anywhere on Earth, right?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong><br> So where&#39;re you gonna find one better<br> than what she&#39;s already got?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> Not to worry. I already have just the place in mind.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> You see, the machine gods of Atlantis aren&#39;t the only foreign beings who made their way to this planet in ages long past.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> There is a golden sea of trees in the belly of the underworld known as Xibalba that is home to an enormous beast.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong><br> It slumbers in a world where Alaya is stable, and wriggles to life in a world where Gaia shows itself.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1APriest:</strong><br> ...I speak, of course, of an Ultimate One\u2013a<br> being who came here from the Oort cloud.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...Hey, uh, you up now?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Oh good, you are.<br> There&#39;s something you oughta see.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> I went back and forth on whether to bring this to you...but ultimately, I thought you deserved to see it.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Sorry to spring this on you when you&#39;re still tired,<br> but...I didn&#39;t think it could wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, what is it I oughta see...?</p><hr><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...A video file from the God Destroyer Alliance base.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> According to the timestamp,<br> it was recorded after you guys took Demeter out.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> We&#39;re not sure exactly when it was sent, but it looks like it was right before you guys left for the Great Orbital Shrine.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how they pulled it off, but the file&#39;s in the exact same format we use at Chaldea. Man, Olympian tech never ceases to impress me.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Anyway, I already sent the file<br> over to your personal terminal.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> ...We already watched it ourselves, but I&#39;m not gonna demand you do the same. Whether you do or not, it&#39;s totally up to you.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Though I will say that Goredolf decided to<br> designate them as MIA after watching it himself.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Said something along the lines of:</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> \u201CWe can&#39;t confirm their deaths, so who&#39;s to say<br> they won&#39;t come back to us again someday?\u201D</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Like director, like field team, I guess.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> But hey, who am I to judge? We could all stand<br> to get a little sentimental now and then.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s all I wanted to say for now.<br> Later.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Good, the camera&#39;s working fine.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Testing, testing...<br> Good, no problems with audio, either.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m all set to record.<br> Now I just gotta make sure no one sees me.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that I want to cause any infighting, but every<br> organization needs to perform an internal review sometimes.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> And while the God Destroyer Alliance might not have many members, it&#39;s still an organization. We should know how everyone really feels.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like the idea of surreptitiously filming them... But then again, Edison said it was perfectly normal.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Anyway, this&#39;ll only be for reference, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Macarios? Where are you?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I could have sworn he was around here.<br> Maybe he&#39;s in a private room? Ugh.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s up, Adele? Something the matter?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I wanted to ask Macarios to help me with something,<br> but I can&#39;t find him anywhere.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm, gotcha. Maybe I could help instead?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I appreciate the offer, but that&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You see, I wanted to ask him to<br> fine-tune your and Mash&#39;s Klironomia.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Right. Yeah, I probably couldn&#39;t be much help<br> with that. Not exactly my area of expertise.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Well, I wouldn&#39;t say Macarios<br> and I are experts, either.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Maybe not, but how many years have you<br> guys been fiddling with that stuff?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> A thousand or so. Oh, right. I guess in other worlds, that would make us experts, huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You can say that again!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Haha, I see your point.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...There you are, Sister.<br> Hey, Musashi.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh good. Listen, Macarios\u2013</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You want me to fine-tune their Klironomia, right? I&#39;ll take care of it. Gotta make sure there won&#39;t be any aftereffects and such, after all.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Anyway, on a different subject...<br> Can I ask you two something?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Well... I was just wondering what<br> you think of the Chaldeans.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> They&#39;re our comrades in arms.<br> They&#39;ve been invaluable to our alliance.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> How about you, Musashi?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm, good question. Maybe travel companions...?<br> No, that&#39;s not quite right.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I honestly don&#39;t know much about Holmes.<br> I&#39;ve barely even talked to any of the other staff, either!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But I do love Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And Mash too, of course!<br> Mmm, really, I just love them both to bits!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> At first, I didn&#39;t really know<br> anyone besides Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> And my first impression of Mash was basically<br> just that she seemed really earnest...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> But then, once I saw how she fought...I got it.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> The whole reason Fujimaru&#39;s able to<br> live the way [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] does...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...is because [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s] been with her all this time.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Once I figured that out, well,<br> I just fell in love with Mash!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Now I can&#39;t help but smile whenever I see<br> her and Fujimaru doing their best together!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s so touching. I just love that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> You think? I don&#39;t really get the appeal myself...<br> Anyway, next question.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Are there any requests you&#39;d like to make of them?<br> Maybe something you feel like they could be doing better?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Huh? What kind of question is that?<br> We doing some kinda performance review thing?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> O-of course not. I&#39;m just, uh, making conversation.<br> I wasn&#39;t asking for any particular reason. Nope.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh reeeally?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Okay, if you say so. Anyway, let&#39;s see...<br> Something I&#39;d like to request from them, huh...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Hmm. I guess I&#39;d like them to do<br> all the living I won&#39;t be ab\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Uh, on second thought, just forget that one.<br> Here, let me try again.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I think what I&#39;d like to request from them...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...is that they live happy lives!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Wh-what kind of answer is that?<br> That&#39;s not even a request.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I want them to live as long and as happily together as possible, so that they never have to go through any pain or hardships.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one and only request I have for them!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Well, that was...helpful...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You really do love those two, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Absolutely. Like I said, I love them to pieces!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> So, what about you two?<br> What do you think of Mash and Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Us?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> You&#39;re the only other ones here, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> W-well, uh... We definitely couldn&#39;t<br> have beaten Demeter without them.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> In fact, the alliance never actually managed<br> to destroy a single god until they came along.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So\u2013</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> I like them, personally.<br> And I don&#39;t just mean as comrades or alliance members.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> S-Sister!</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> If we hadn&#39;t met them while we were<br> in the middle of fighting a war...</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I even think we could have been friends.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well of course you could. Honestly, I thought<br> you were all already friends. Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure. I hope so.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Well, I could&#39;ve sworn you were, so.<br> Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got it. Somebody mark the date, because this gal just had herself a fantastic idea!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> Wh-where&#39;d that come from?<br> And what is this idea, anyway?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad you asked! Like I said, it&#39;s fantastic! My idea is, once Operation God Destroyer is well and truly done...</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> ...we should have a party to celebrate.<br> One with lots of yummy food.</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. That does sound lovely!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Sure, but that only works if the operation goes off without a hitch, we don&#39;t have any casualties, and we have enough time to put something like that together.</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> So I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it fantas\u2013</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> It&#39;s gonna go great!<br> We&#39;re gonna MAKE it go great!</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Macarios:</strong><br> ...Good point. I mean, the plan is for the operation to work out as intended, so why not?</p><p><strong>Adele:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll have to start thinking of what to make for the occasion. Hmm... Now what would be good for a party...?</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Udon! Definitely udon! For the rest, we&#39;ll have to go<br> around asking everyone else what their favorite foods are.</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> Oh, and we&#39;ll definitely have to get Goredolf<br> to make his special omelets!</p><p><strong>Musashi:</strong><br> This party&#39;s going to be so much fun! Just you wait!</p>', 12501);
