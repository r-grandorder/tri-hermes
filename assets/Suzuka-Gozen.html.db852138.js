So while she is proud of high school girl lifestyle she is disappointed with herself when calculating the losses. Therefore Suzuka Gozen does not proactively use this.</p><p>(TL Note: Daitouren and Shoutouren are both divine swords belong to Manjushri Bodhisattva.

But this Suzuka Gozen is the daughter of the demon king of the 4th heaven.</p><p>Suzuka Gozen received order from Shangdi, ascended from heaven to turn Japan into a country of demons, but she did not feel like causing chaos in a mere country of humans, as she is daughter of Demon King of the fourth heaven.</p><p>The reason she did not follow orders from her father is because to her, that job should be done by the tenmas, or onis inhabiting the land. But not just the fact that it\u2019s a troublesome task, more than anything her pride refused such \u201Cboring job\u201D.</p><p>But father\u2019s order is absolute. So reluctantly, Suzuka found an oni inhabiting Takkoku cave, Otakemaru.</p><p>\u201CI will make you my subject, so do as I say. First, invade Japan in my place.\u201D</p><p>That\u2019s what she wrote to him. But for some reason he did not reply (with that kind of letter, of course not). Angered by his disrespectful attitude, Suzuka sent him a final letter explaining why she will come to kill him.</p><p>\u201CI, after countless times of being disrespected, am extremely pissed off. You, despite being an oni, dare to reject orders from me - Daughter of Tenma. Thus, it is certain that you are evil. Come to me so I can kill you. As Tenma\u2019s daughter I\u2019ll be fair and chop your head off from the front!\u201D</p><p>Good good, now Otakemaru will show up for sure. And then after I beat him up he will have to follow my orders, thought Suzuka.</p><p>Sure enough, a swordsman shows up before Suzuka. He is Sakanoue no Tamuramaro.</p><p>To put it bluntly, Suzuka fell in love at first sight, but pride takes priority. She attacked the demon who dare disobey her. She mistaken Sakanoue for Otakemaru. And Sakanoue is also wielding the sword he used to slay the onihime.</p><p>But the story is different. The moment of their final clash, Sakanoue is about to lose, he screamed in desperation as his death is certain:</p><p>\u201CI was worried about this awhile ago! My name is Sakanoue no Tamuramaroooo!!!\u201D</p><p>Suzuka is like being struck by thunder, her eyes opened with a shocking expression \u201CWhattt??\u201D. Seizing that chance, he slashed her across her shoulder and the battle was decided.</p><p>The defeated Suzuka fell down, but Sakanoue still could not believe in his last attack, thinking it\u2019s deception. As a result, he did not kill Suzuka. Later on, Suzuka changed and fell in love with Sakanoue, and they lived together on Suzuka mountain.</p><p>The couple had a daughter named Shourin together, and went on to exterminate the oni Otakemaru and Akuro.</p><p>(In Fate interpretation, when Suzuka declared that \u201CMy life on Earth is only 25 years\u201D, Sakanoue accepted that explanation)</p><p>Of course the Demon King is angry, but seeing his daughter happiness, the daddy side in him thought \u201CHm...it can\u2019t be helped. If she is laughing happily like that, then the country of human isn\u2019t that bad afterall\u201D.</p><p>Just when we thought this would be a happy ending, a flag from the past popped up. It\u2019s Otakemaru who received those disrespectful letters earlier. He also loves Suzuka!</p><p>However, the pride of a man does not allow him to snuggle up to her, so his strategy was to wait till she arrives, but the result is what we\u2019ve seen.</p><p>Otakemaru got angry at Suzuka who fell to humans, and marked Sakanoue who took Suzuka away (in Otakemaru\u2019s words: NTR) as the enemy. Day by day, the amount of curses weaving Takkoku cave continues to increase.</p><p>To Suzuka it\u2019s just an eyesore, but not for Sakanoue. He decided to battle Otakemaru.</p><p>Suzuka, knowing from the start that Otakemaru\u2019s body is as hard as rock that no arrow or sword can pierce, went to Takkoku cave herself and became Otakemaru\u2019s (fake) wife.</p><p>Of course, it was all for Sakanoue\u2019s sake. However to deceive Otakemaru, only her knows the details of her plan. So without explaining to Sakanoue, she became Otakemaru\u2019s wife, an oni princess, and used her Supernatural Power to soften his body. Three years later, she successfully assassinated Otakemaru in the cave.</p><p>As she let out a sigh, thinking she can finally return home, she noticed another assassin appeared. It was Sakanoue who was devastated by the thought of Suzuka abandoning him, betrayed him, and his country was destroyed.</p><p>Sakanoue, blinded by love and hate, walks towards Suzuka, who realized there\u2019s no salvation left and that she made a mistake. Deep down she apologized to him, as she is killed by him.</p><p>(If she is killed when considered doing an evil act, then at least Sakanoue will not be tortured by \u201Cregret that he killed his love one\u201D)</p><p>And thus, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro killed both Otakemaru and his wife.</p><p>After this, it is uncertain if he realized the truth and went to the Underworld to take her back. There are various theories about whether the story of their reunion in the Underworld told in \u201CSakanoue and Suzuka Gozen\u2019s activities\u201D happened before or after she became Otakemaru\u2019s wife.</p><p>(TL note: Tennyo is equivalent of angels, kijo is oni girl. The 4th heaven in Buddhism is where Buddha candidates stay b4 ascending or incarnate so there is no demon king there. Originally she is daughter of the demon king of the sixth heaven (Mara/Tenma), which is still true here, but the 4th heaven thing is from typos in later versions.</p><p>Shangdi is equivalent of Christian God in Chinese religion, sometimes considered to be Indra, but it might be a typo of Tenma because her father is Tenma, big name like Shangdi being here is weird.</p><p>Otakemaru is the oni god inhabiting Suzuka mountain, not Takkoku cave. Akuro no Takemaru is the oni god inhabiting this cave instead. However various versions of Suzuka legend mixed up these 2, as well as the Other Otakemaru mentioned in the part about her and Sakanoue having a daughter, a lot, including their homebase, so it is speculated that all 3 names are pointed to 1 single oni god that is Otakemaru.</p><p>Shourin - the daughter of Suzuka and Sakanoue also has the nickname Little Rin due to it having the same pronunciation as Shourin. Legends said that she is just as beautiful as her mother and inherits her 3 divine swords that she left behind for Sakanoue)</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Suzuka who drowns in love only has one wish, that is to be happy and live happily ever after with the one she loves. That was not granted to her.</p><p>Being summoned as Servant, living in love again, she wants to be happy this time around but has no idea that she is clumsy in love.</p><p>Suzuka, known to be a beauty, decided to pursue her own beauty.
