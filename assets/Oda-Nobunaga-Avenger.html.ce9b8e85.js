A state that strongly reflects the Nobunaga who was called a fool in her younger days. Call me a Nobunaga, nay, a Kipp\u014Dshi who&#39;s a literal soldier of fortune and who gives off a good vibe!<br> Demon King Nobunaga, the conclusion that one could call Nobunaga&#39;s destination.

The Nobunaga with the form closest to the original Nobunaga&#39;s Saint Graph. Putting it this way isn&#39;t strictly correct either, but as a matter of convenience, that&#39;s how it&#39;s been commented on.</p><p>While she has been summoned in the class of an Avenger, her state is akin to when she is summoned as an Archer. However, the body that houses the karma of the fear and resentment felt towards her by the masses can not be contained within the Saint Graph of a Heroic Spirit who was &quot;originally just a human&quot; and with each successive ascension, even more possible Nobunagas are edified.<br> A multitude of possibilities sounds good on paper, but the end result that awaits is her meaning vanishing due to diffusion which Nobunaga is fully aware of yet doesn&#39;t mention.</p><p>She gained a mysterious arquebus, the Demon King Gatling Gun as a new armament. Isn&#39;t this quite the superior, delightful and cool matchlock what with being able to perform a rotating rapid-fire?</p><p>&quot;Well, there&#39;s all sorts of me, but even among them I am the most charming and cute, don&#39;t you agree? Actually, isn&#39;t the biggest me pretty frightening?&quot;</p><p>Oda Kipp\u014Dshi. Kipp\u014Dshi was Oda Nobunaga&#39;s name during her childhood.<br> She&#39;s done many odd things as a child and was called a fool by her surroundings.</p><p>&quot;Actually, at that time, I wasn&#39;t called Kippoushi. Nevertheless, since other than me, amusingly enough, Nobunaga is around as well, it will be easier to understand it this way, no? Wahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p>Demon King Nobunaga. The Nobunaga who&#39;s the furthest from every possible Nobunaga and the one closest to the abyss.<br> Calling herself the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, her body that has the fear and reverence felt towards Nobunaga throughout the ages seared into it is hollow yet powerful, and she is reborn into an existence that should be called a true Demon King.</p><p>However, fundamentally, her form is not one that denies the gods and Buddha, but something that demonstrates Nobunaga&#39;s belief that &quot;The possibilities of mankind belong to men, while the gods and Buddha should be respected and not relied upon; actually, do you guys just plan to depend on the honorable Buddha for everything?&quot;.<br> That is what&#39;s &quot;Innocent Monster&quot;-like about her, however, her existence as the Demon King Nobunaga that became the enemy of gods and Buddha and who imposes a severe life on all living beings is akin to that of the Heavenly Demon, even if she could be called a supporter of Buddhist teachings.</p><p>&quot;I am Demon King Nobunaga\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500The enemy of gods, Buddha and all living beings who&#39;s been reborn through surpassing the Heaven of Pleasure.&quot;</p><p>Still, a point to make note of\u200B is that it&#39;s not like this &quot;Demon King Nobunaga&quot; is the pinnacle of Nobunagas. While it may be true that she&#39;s one of the most powerful forms born from the story known as &quot;Nobunaga&quot;, that doesn&#39;t make her the &quot;pinnacle&quot;, but the embodiment of the one furthest from the &quot;truth&quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500the human-shaped blaze that burns brightly in the beyond.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Demon King Gatling Gun/Heshikiri Hasabe/Souza Samonji[2] /Demon King Sword<br> A mysterious style called the Demon King fighting style where she forcefully pushes herself to the very limit in an extraordinary manner.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Okita S\u014Dji</strong></p><p>Good grief, we might have an undesirable yet inseparable relationship, but we sure have kept each other company for a long time.

Three Thousand Great Thousand Heavens (\u4E09\u5343\u5927\u5343\u5929) is probably a reference to Buddhist cosmology where the universe is made up of Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds (\u4E09\u5343\u5927\u5343\u4E16\u754C). Basically, Nobu is calling herself the Demon King of the Heavenly Universe or something.<br> [2] Both Heshikiri Hasabe and Souza Samonji are swords that belonged to Nobunaga in real life though the latter was also owned by the other two unifiers of Japan: Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br> [3] Nobunaga&#39;s nickname for Toyotomi Hideyoshi.<br> [4] A Japanese samurai of the late Sengoku era who was originally a junior retainer under the Sait\u014D clan, then switched to the Oda clan and finally served under the Tokugawas. His moniker &quot;Bamboo Grass&quot; came from the fact that he took many heads in battles, but due to their great numbers he couldn&#39;t hang them all on his waist so, in order to identify them after the battles as his, he stuck bamboo grass into their mouths or their necks.<br> [5] A samurai famous for his strength and loyalty to Nobunaga and Nagayoshi&#39;s younger brother.<br> [6] Nobunaga&#39;s nickname for Akechi Mitsuhide.<br> [7] Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s childhood name.</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 84);
