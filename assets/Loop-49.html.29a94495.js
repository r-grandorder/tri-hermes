When push comes to shove, I&#39;ll destroy everything, including the bridge!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Wait, wait, it&#39;s great that you returned to normal, but that&#39;s overdoing it.</p><p>If you destroy the bridges, they will be harder to control. They are simple beasts, if the bridge falls, they will just cross the river themselves and pour into Shinto. But as long as the bridge is here, they will naively believe there is no other place to go.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh... I-I knew that already! I&#39;m just saying it to make things more interesting. Sheesh.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Tsk,&quot; she clicks her tongue in dissatisfaction.</p><p>&quot;Seeing how bad things have become, destroying one or two bridges would make for a nice view,&quot; is what she seems to be saying.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally now... that&#39;s the &quot;go all the way&quot; side of you.</p><p>Haven&#39;t you picked up any ladylike manners during these six months at all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is who I am since I was born. What about you? Your habit of talking too much can&#39;t be cured, can it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CMine depends on who I am with. For the time being, I am contracted to a Master who occasionally needs to be advised.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat a coincidence. I also happen to know someone who likes finding faults with others a little too much.\u201D</p><hr><p>She breaks out into a smile at the pointless exchange.</p><p>In the middle of the bridge, directly underneath them, the corpses march on.</p><p>This is the last opportunity to start the battle.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay. Are you with me, Archer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes. A Servant is one who follows his Master.</p><p>Finally, this is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015The end. We can fight without holding back.\u201D</p><p>The red cloak appears.</p><p>As a symbol of fighting for her, the bowman displays the holy shroud.</p><hr><p>Needless to say, there is a deeper significance to the armament.</p><p>The red symbol is used only in proper battlegrounds when there is a master worth serving.</p><p>Nostalgia that ought to have been forgotten long ago burns in his chest once more.</p><p>For just one moment.</p><p>For a moment that will last until the break of dawn, he is back to the self that used to stay at her side.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Idiot. You fuss over the silliest things. You&#39;re either way principled, or just pretentious.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? As far as being principled goes, I&#39;m still behind you.</p><p>After all, we&#39;re wagering our lives against I&#39;m not sure whom, for I&#39;m not exactly sure what reasons.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Geez, I can only bear to watch for so long. Your generosity isn&#39;t something one can buy on a moment&#39;s notice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha. Yeah, that right hook is going to cost you.\u201D</p><hr><p>She focuses on the enemy.</p><p>Her family crest spins up halfway to full capacity, letting her use the magic at half the maximum power.</p><p>There&#39;s a long way to go, after all.</p><p>She has no choice but to fight on the bridge to the bitter end, right until this rainbow hanging in the sky vanishes.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll leave the first strike to you. After you stop the frontline of the group, I will go down to the bridge.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a war of attrition after that. Keep making holes in them from here, and I will mow down the ones that escape.</p><p>Any questions, Rin?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo objections from me. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a few that manage to get through the two-fold attack, but let&#39;s just ignore them.</p><p>Our duty is to exterminate the army. We&#39;ll think about the small fry after taking care of the enemy in front of us.\u201D</p><hr><p>There&#39;s no telling how many corpses will break through this formation.</p><p>And there will probably be some that will swim across the river and head into Shinto themselves.</p><p>But those are still less than one in a thousand.</p><p>The outliers will have to be taken care of by those who walk the sky.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, speaking of meddlers, we aren&#39;t alone, either. Let&#39;s leave the small stuff to them.\u201D</p><p>The family crest is glowing with light.</p><p>Nimbly, she releases the magical energy and magecraft stored in the gems in the shortest time possible.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015<ruby>Anfang<rt>Begin</rt></ruby>.\u201D</p><p>A huge flower blossoms from the dark-stained ground.</p><p>The magic blaze lifts the curtains on the battle. Turning into a star on earth, it illuminates a path to the sky\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>The serpent&#39;s fangs pulverize the corpses.</p><p>The forehead, the throat, the heart and the spine.</p><p>It is an iron fist that strikes at each of these spots with precision and lightning speed.</p><p>If this is a swarm of the dead, then standing in its way is a fearsome demon god.</p><p>The dead that crawled out of Kageyama shall meet death once again, and be driven back to hell...!</p><hr><p>Three fatal strikes in the span of one breath.</p><p>Reinforced through magic, his fists turned into iron clubs which crush the faces of the dead.</p><p>But those are just superficial wounds.</p><p>In spite of losing their faces and their intestines, their fierce claws don&#39;t stop coming.</p><p>Because what powers the dead is not the heart and mind, but rather plain malice.</p><p>Only when they lose all five senses will this mad struggle end\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Assassin.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? Do not mention it, Souichirou. Our enemies flinch not when struck, die not when slain - we are both in a rather poor situation.\u201D</p><p>A light-hearted tone, completely out-of-place in this battleground.</p><p>Moonlight reflecting off the five-foot long sword in his hands, the samurai steps into the swarm of the dead.</p><p>The tip of his sword dances in the air.</p><p>Only after they fall to the ground can you tell that they were sliced.</p><hr><p>\u201CHm. Indeed, one cannot move after having all four limbs chopped off.</p><p>Souichirou, it may be difficult, but let us aim for the limbs instead of the head. It may be against your policy of delivering only deathblows, that shall be plenty for these wooden puppets...!\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Flowers and grass.</p><p>Their ways are different, but words are not required between two masters of their arts.</p><p>Crossing each other&#39;s paths, the fists and sword ganged up on the enemies and overwhelmed them.</p><p>Their backs against each other, sprinting all over the battlefield, these two gods of death continue to overwhelm the dead...!</p><hr><p>\u201CBut how come you changed your mind, Souichirou? You were overlooking them until yesterday, so why did you step out to stop them this evening?</p><p>Anyway, had this plague happened because that witch of yours lost control?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015No idea. If you&#39;re tired, go to sleep, Assassin.</p><p>These ghosts will disappear if you sleep. They won&#39;t harm anyone in his dream.\u201D</p><hr><p>In other words, he had overlooked these shadows roaming the streets at night till today.</p><p>But that still makes no sense.</p><p>If what he says is true, then all he has to do is simply sleep tonight.</p><p>No matter what their number is, there&#39;s no changing the fact that they won&#39;t harm humans in bed.</p><hr><p>\u201COh? So why should you be bothering with this?</p><p>I do not know whether you would continue on or go back, but you could have still returned to your everyday life by sleeping quietly at home.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re right. But this battle is the one wish I have no choice but to grant.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Assassin&#39;s long katana drops ever so slightly.</p><p>The samurai looks stunned, as if taken by surprise.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see, I see, indeed!</p><p>Haha, I could never earn your kindness, but looks like you&#39;ve changed your mind a little, Caster!</p><p>Oh dear, you&#39;re rather sweet, aren&#39;t you-\u201D</p><p>\u201CShush! Quiet, you blockhead\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>Arrows of lights pour down from the sky.</p><p>The witch&#39;s hammer turns into a squall and washes the dark away.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, looks like some external medicine is what the doctor ordered for these creatures, after all.</p><p>Caster, time to show off your specialty! Looks like the wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing is no longer feigning innocence tonight!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s enough, Assassin. Your role is to provide backup for your Master. If you can&#39;t do even that, then I shall turn you to ashes along with the small fry.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha, do not be angry. It is your desire that I fight alongside Souichirou, is it not? Same as yourself, my Master&#39;s delight is my source of joy. If you are happy, then I am happy, as well.</p><p>Our role is to clear this mess, more or less. Say, Souichirou, that is not much to ask of a man, is it now? Seems you are putting a bit more force into your punches than usual, are you not?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Sorry. I am not about to hold back, not in front of my spouse.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll have to trouble you, Caster.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Both of them are bewildered.</p><p>Those that know him would surely realize just how unusual it is to hear such a remark.</p><hr><p>\u201CCaster, reinforcements are coming.</p><p>Whether you are protecting Ryuudou temple or going to stop the culprit, looks like we do not have time to talk much.</p><p>I&#39;ll leave the coordinating to you. I&#39;ll fight as you wish... Such opportunity probably won&#39;t come again.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Souichirou-sama\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s why you should have no regrets,&quot; is that what he wanted to say?</p><p>Kuzuki Souichiro embraces her determination.</p><p>The witch accepts the end of the days, albeit with much regret in her heart.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes, I understand, Master.</p><p>From now on, I will strive towards my desire without hesitation.\u201D</p><p>The bells on her staff peal.</p><p>The magus from the age of the gods starts weaving an even more mysterious spell.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, Caster, what are you going to do?</p><p>I&#39;m tired of keeping this up. How about we go smash the very foundations?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph, that&#39;s not something for one that can&#39;t venture outside to say, Assassin.</p><p>We are not obliged to help to such extent to begin with. As for me, I am content with simply protecting this place; only helping the shameless trash that barges into people&#39;s homes with mud on their feet realize their standing.\u201D</p><hr><p>A black shadow keeps spreading.</p><p>Born behind the mountain, many of them descend the mountain towards Miyama. Some of the corpses, pushed by the horde, pour even into Ryuudou temple.</p><p>Nobody hates that more than Caster.</p><p>Had she wanted to just protect herself, all she had to do was to seal her Master and herself in the temple.</p><p>A boundary field to ward off the bodies would have been sufficient for just the two of them.</p><hr><p>However\u2015\u2015\u2015on some unknown whim, she did something completely illogical.</p><p>On its way to Miyama, occasionally the shadow detours into Ryuudou temple.</p><p>Caster burned all of it to ashes, leaving none out.</p><p>As a result, having sensed an obstacle in their path, they started concentrating on the temple.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat do you expect? I don&#39;t care about what&#39;s going on down there, but anyone who crosses the threshold of my home becomes my enemy.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, I will burn you to ashes, Avenger.</p><p>That&#39;s what you wished for, is it not\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>A Divine Aria spreads along the empty sky.</p><p>Not only is it more than enough to protect the whole of Ryuudou temple, it is a spell well capable of punching a hole in the very foundation they came from...</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015To be honest,</p><p>I would have liked to continue for a little longer. Now feel my wrath\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>The witch protecting Ryuudou temple burns away the corpses heading for the town.</p><p>Even if their numbers are unlimited, the annihilated ones will not come back immediately.</p><p>Like a burst of divine punishment, the sorcery continues tearing the pandemonium apart.</p><hr><p>...But the outpouring black stain still does not stop.</p><p>The corpses seemingly cover half the earth.</p><p>This place will be protected, no matter what. And the bridge shall greet the start of a new day undefeated as well.</p><hr><p>\u201C....The situation at Miyama is looking rather bad, though.</p><p>Those kids worked hard, but looks like this is it for them\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Heaving a sigh of pity or maybe compassion, the witch looks down at the town below.</p><p>...She is looking at the northern part of Miyama. Like the eye of a needle, a tiny white spot, a traditional residence remains standing there.</p><hr><p>The wave of corpses is trying to swallow the Emiya residence whole.</p><p>Although it is Servant Rider we are talking about, she should not be able to repel this onslaught on her own.</p><p>Had it been only a single wave, she could have used her Noble Phantasm to sweep them away, or to petrify them with her Mystic Eyes.</p><p>But this enemy is unlimited.</p><p>Employing her Noble Phantasm or Mystic Eye consumes large amounts of magical energy.</p><p>She may hold the upper hand for a while, but as her supplies run out, she will become unable to offer barely any resistance at all.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, behind you...!\u201D</p><p>Rider&#39;s hair flows, reacting to her Master&#39;s voice.</p><hr><p>Her blade and the claws clash.</p><p>She has nowhere to escape after leaping to the back.</p><p>The corpses, having invaded over the stone walls, attack Rider as if competing for an achievement.</p><p>With her speed, she can slip through one or two of these claws easily.</p><p>But these claws surround Rider like a dense forest of spears\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura...!?\u201D</p><p>The previously unstoppable Rider halts in her tracks suddenly.</p><p>The magic being employed now is by her Master, Matou Sakura.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s a magus, and using magic once or twice shouldn&#39;t warrant any surprise.</p><p>However\u2015\u2015\u2015the kind performed just now was the one that Matou Sakura detests the most.</p><p>Was it not taboo for her to draw on her innermost, dark self, baring it akin to a blade?</p><hr><p>\u201CYou must not! It is still to early for you to use that as a weapon...! I shall intercept them, so please maintain the field inside the house!\u201D</p><p>The anxious voice makes for another fatal opening.</p><p>The swarm of the dead pounce on the still Servant.</p><hr><p>\u201C<ruby>Es flustert<rt>My voice forms a prayer</rt></ruby>\u2015\u2015\u2015<ruby>Mein Nagel reist Hauser<rt>My fingers scrape the earth</rt></ruby>.\u201D</p><p>Vast shadow skewers the intruders as if they were mere fog, captures them and swallows them to the world below.</p><p>That is a side of her she possesses as a magus.</p><p>The vortex of darkness has no trouble sweeping the dead back to where they came from, the underworld. To be able to bind opponents with invisible uncertainties, that is the special trait of the imaginary number magic.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m fine, I can handle this much...!</p><p>Don&#39;t worry, Rider. I have worked hard for the past six months...!\u201D</p><p>;</p><p>Her voice strained, as if trying to encourage herself, she manages to keep her trembling legs and a body about to rip apart by the magic&#39;s recoil in check.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Does she respect her Master&#39;s decision and continue defending this place? Or does she take Sakura and flee away?</p><p>There&#39;s still time to escape.</p><p>With her Noble Phantasm, Rider can carry Matou Sakura to Shinto in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In spite of that\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CRider, concentrate on protecting the outer walls. I&#39;ll take care of the ones that break through...!\u201D</p><p>She retains her faith in Sakura, who is now holding her ground desperately against the enemy, and turns to her own battlefield.</p><hr><p>Originally, Matou Sakura did not have the foundation to perform magic on her own.</p><p>By forcing her own darkness, her magic circuits that can emit nothing but her shadow, to the surface, she is able to function as a magus... for the time being.</p><p>By doing that, she is crushing the human side of hers.</p><p>In her state, she may be swallowed by her &quot;dark side&quot; if her heart wavers even a little.</p><p>Ashamed and fearing the worst, she grits her teeth and continues on.</p><hr><p>\u201C<ruby>Es flustert<rt>My voice forms a prayer</rt></ruby>\u2015\u2015\u2015<ruby>Mein Nagel reist Hauser<rt>My fingers scrape the earth</rt></ruby>.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Thinking about it, this conflict could have been avoided. No, it should have been avoided to begin with.</p><p>The remains of a Servant envelop the town.</p><p>Night after night, these things were bursting out and overwhelming the place. Rider sensed that immediately.</p><p>But she did not put up a fight.</p><p>They would simply pass those that are asleep.</p><p>Indulge in sleep as usual, and they will disappear by the time morning rolls around.</p><hr><p>\u201C<ruby>Satz<rt>My will is absolute</rt></ruby>\u2015\u2015\u2015<ruby>Mein Blut widersteht Invasionen<rt>My shadow shall wield the sword</rt></ruby>......!\u201D</p><p>Every time she repeats her aria, she languishes more and more in pain.</p><p>She spits out words as if they were blood...</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015I won&#39;t lose\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>A frail but powerful voice.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I, I won&#39;t lose here...!\u201D</p><p>On this night.</p><p>Before they realized, Rider and Sakura were alone in Emiya residence to greet the midnight end.</p><p>The ones who advance forward and the ones who defend.

So, what?</p><p>Are saying that I&#39;ll be living my whole life like a loser?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot like a loser, I&#39;m saying you are one.</p><p>You were deceived and stabbed in the back, and so you confined yourself here as a loser. As long as you have that thought, you will always continue to suffer.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Tch, enough...! Traitor, traitor, traitor...!</p><p>Isn&#39;t this place your wish!? Then, I don&#39;t mind even if it&#39;s painful for me...!</p><p>The outside world is the same anyway. At least to me.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;The same.&quot;</p><p>The woman said that continuing to live is hard.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s wrong.</p><p>Didn&#39;t you understand how tough life is since you were born?\u201D</p><hr><p>That way of being is what made me side with her.</p><p>This woman is weak. I have no complaints about her abilities, but her existence itself is too fragile. Possessing doubts about one&#39;s existence is a fatal flaw.</p><p>A soul that is on the verge of dying at any moment.</p><p>A pessimism that might lead her to cutting her wrists if she weren&#39;t always bracing herself.</p><p>However\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015But, didn&#39;t you still make it this far?</p><p>You were awkward and clumsy.</p><p>But you always did you best to become someone even a little better.\u201D</p><p>Pushing hard in spite of being weak, you struggled to somehow improve yourself.</p><p>You continued breathing despite the pain up until now.</p><p>...If you don&#39;t acknowledge your pride in that...</p><p>Then who else will?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Stop it. You&#39;ve said enough of your opinion. Don&#39;t talk so high and mighty while ignoring your own problems...!</p><p>...You don&#39;t even know anything about me. Your eyes can&#39;t even see anything anymore\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><p>The woman shakes her head.</p><p>She refuses to discard her wish.</p><p>Like a child throwing a tantrum, believing that everything would really end if she lost the argument here.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s not just your eyes. You can&#39;t even see yourself. I don&#39;t want to die either. But\u2015\u2015\u2015your regret will be incomparable to mine.</p><p>You wanted to just have fun. You didn&#39;t even want to fill in the gap. Because you knew that you would return to the void.</p><p>And yet you kept repeating those ordinary days for yourself.\u201D</p><hr><p>She really is dense.</p><p>I&#39;m tired of seeing such things.</p><hr><p>\u201CI can&#39;t see, huh? What about you? Can you see me properly?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...I only see a shadow. You are already fading away into nothingness.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re right. That&#39;s correct. Don&#39;t be mistaken, Master.</p><p>This body, this character was born by wearing the shell of Emiya Shirou. I am originally nothingness. I don&#39;t have love or regrets. Since I&#39;m originally something that can neither think nor do anything.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s of no concern to me if I return to the void.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You&#39;re lying. You&#39;re lying, you&#39;re lying, you&#39;re lying...!</p><p>I won&#39;t be fooled, I won&#39;t abandon you...!</p><p>Continue fulfilling my wish, Avenger...!</p><p>Even if you get tired of it, even if you can no longer create any more new events, if you are telling me to continue fighting alone I&#39;ll stay with you...!</p><p>There are still gaps remaining, right? Then fine. Even if they&#39;re small, as long as there&#39;s still something to be seen...\u201D</p><hr><p>Keep this world turning.</p><p>Keep going through those golden days.</p><p>Keep experiencing that which you never could obtain, yet should have originally been given to you\u2015\u2015\u2015*</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re so persistent.</p><p>Sorry, but I can&#39;t fulfill that wish. Let&#39;s end this meaningless time here.\u201D</p><p>I take a step forward.</p><p>...What a joke. In the end, Bazett didn&#39;t even try to stop me.</p><p>In short, she is so angry because,</p><hr><p>\u201C...Stop. You&#39;re still moving forward, even though you know you&#39;ll return to being a corpse? Even though you can repeat the fun times as many times as you want, if you remain here?\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s this obstructive thought that&#39;s continuing the wish.</p><p>If I say &quot;Yeah&quot; to that, then I&#39;ve already reached the point of breaking since long ago.</p><hr><p>\u201CDidn&#39;t you enjoy yourself...?</p><p>I had fun. It was painful, but in the end, the pain was...\u201D</p><p>Then the rest is easy.</p><p>I&#39;m already tired of this, so I need to get to the conclusion already.</p><hr><p>\u201C...In the end, that pain was the joy of living.</p><p>I know you don&#39;t want to return to that void... This place isn&#39;t my wish at all.</p><p>Angra Mainyu. This world was your dream.</p><p>If my wish was to try to continue the Heaven&#39;s Feel, then those peaceful days are...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A dream that has passed.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to continue anymore. No matter how fun it is, if I fill all the gaps...</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. But I&#39;m already tired of it all.\u201D</p><p>For the sake of something new,</p><p>\u201Ceven if it is the end, I have to see it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The tension disappeared.</p><p>What a shame. I can&#39;t see what expression she&#39;s making now.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You are really...\u201D</p><p>\u201CMaster, give it up. With this, I&#39;ll vanish without a trace. No matter what either of us wish for, this world is at an end.\u201D</p><p>A voice which asks, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>...Geez. I explained it all just now, so why do you ask that?</p><hr><p>\u201CIt will collapse. Once something is made complete, all that&#39;s left is for it to fall apart, right? Once everything becomes nothing, you and I will also simply vanish.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Why? To become nothing is to become &quot;0&quot; right? If there is nothingness, you will be revived countless times.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because &quot;1&quot; exists. If it is complete nothingness, then nothing will be born... &quot;1&quot; uses the emptiness of &quot;0&quot; to flow. But if &quot;1&quot; doesn&#39;t exist, then &quot;0&quot; can&#39;t do anything at all.\u201D</p><hr><p>And there is no concept of &quot;1&quot; inside me.</p><p>Everything uses the void to flow.</p><p>But the void never partakes in those new events.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes, this is the end. I experienced so many events. But in the end, I couldn&#39;t learn anything from them.\u201D</p><p>A gentle voice.</p><p>She is a little afraid, but as a person resolved to die, her heart is more than prepared.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s an issue to be dealt with after this.</p><p>Well, they were like illusions from the start. The spoils of a war that retained form.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah.</p><p>I see, so I can leave that behind at least.</p><p>Despite everything, I&#39;m still her Servant that existed and lived for half a year. I&#39;ll make wiggle room for that at least.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Avenger?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, I was just thinking to myself. More importantly, what&#39;s happening to the Holy Grail?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...It won&#39;t last long, I think. Cracks are running along its surface at several places.\u201D</p><p>I see.</p><p>In that case, this body should be satisfied as well.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Stupid monster. You&#39;re really insane, aren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>...Just once, I saw the dream of a foolish man.</p><p>Unfortunately, his way of life makes me want to vomit, but I&#39;m grateful that I had the chance to become that distorted person.</p><p>A way of living completely opposite to mine.</p><p>The form of an ideal that everyone dreams of, and in the end, discards as its own hypocrisy makes it evil.</p><p>That foolish naivety\u2015\u2015\u2015I probably yearned for it at least once.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. Come, let&#39;s go return to our respective places, Master.</p><p>I completed it for this. We have to end it once and for all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Avenger. You say return to our respective places, but what am I supposed to do?</p><p>At this rate, I&#39;ll disappear along with you, the Holy Grail.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t have to accompany me that far.</p><p>Look, you take the entrance there, and I&#39;ll take the exit in the other direction. This is our final farewell here.\u201D</p><p>I point towards the horizon.</p><p>The entrance is the world after this. In other words, the fifth day.</p><p>The exit is the world before this. In other words, the void.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot; Bazett asks in surprise.</p><p>It shouldn&#39;t need to be said, though.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, it&#39;s because you&#39;re alive.</p><p>Those who are not dead cannot go to that side.\u201D</p><p>Her breath seems to catch in her throat.</p><p>Well, she probably can&#39;t believe it after being told that all of a sudden.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease wait. I&#39;m certainly-\u201D</p><p>\u201CNot dead. It was your wish not to die, right? I merely fulfilled that wish.</p><p>At that time, you were in a state of suspended animation. I&#39;ve been constantly preserving you in that state for half a year.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015, ah.\u201D</p><hr><p>The problem is after that.</p><p>The girl from the Church found Bazett in the secret chamber, and carefully treated her, which complicated things.</p><p>If she hadn&#39;t come, things\u2015\u2015\u2015couldn&#39;t have continued much longer.</p><p>It seems Bazett&#39;s body was at its absolute limits. If that girl hadn&#39;t discovered her, this four-day cycle probably would have suddenly ended someday.</p><p>Even if I had continued acting as a life-support machine, Bazett&#39;s body might not have been able to last in this state of suspended animation longer than half year.</p><hr><p>\u201CB-But...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you know this saying? Only the living can bring back the dead. If you were dead, then you wouldn&#39;t have been able to summon me from the dead.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right.</p><p>The dead cannot fulfill any wish. It is always the breath of life that causes things to happen.</p><p>Even if the deceased were to be granted life once again, without a doubt, the dead cannot bring back the dead.</p><p>Wasn&#39;t that the first thing I was told?</p><p>The only ones that can ever call forth a miracle are the living.</p><hr><p>...I hear something.</p><p>For a place that should have hurried off to take its curtain call and dissolve away, it&#39;s doing pretty well to hang in there for us.</p><hr><p>\u201CHurry. The path won&#39;t remain forever. It&#39;s almost dawn outside as well. If you escape through there, you&#39;ll reach the fifth day you wished for.\u201D</p><p>\u201CB-But, then you-\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust hurry up and go. You told me to fulfill my own wish, right?</p><p>Then don&#39;t stop. If you remain here, my wish won&#39;t be fulfilled.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s all I wished for.</p><p>What a boring sentiment.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I can&#39;t. Even if you suddenly tell me I&#39;m alive, what am I supposed to do?</p><p>In the first place, you&#39;re the one who said that the outside is the same as in here. If I return to reality like this...\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust continue what you&#39;ve been doing so far. I meddled in many ways, but I&#39;ve got no complaints about your way of life itself. You should just live in that timid manner of yours.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDidn&#39;t that stupid priest say it as well? If you reach a dead end, cross the sea. That&#39;s the right way.</p><p>...Bazett, the world still continues.</p><p>Even if you&#39;re on the verge of death, even if you&#39;re writhing in the final throws of agony, you&#39;re still living like this even now.</p><p>You&#39;re\u2015\u2015\u2015just going to laugh that off as having no hope?\u201D</p><hr><p>If the host is still struggling to live, it&#39;s absurd for the parasite to give up.</p><p>Whatever the case, if there&#39;s still life remaining, there should still be plenty of things that can be accomplished.</p><p>I can&#39;t care if it&#39;s something acceptable and good or unacceptable and bad.</p><p>I can&#39;t pass judgment on living beings that run in the present anyway.</p><p>All life,</p><p>runs without receiving any reward, in order to have their value acknowledged by those that follow after them.</p><hr><p>\u201C......That&#39;s unfair. If you say that, then I can&#39;t say anything in return.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThink of it as a grudge. I&#39;m a demon, something naturally dishonest, so I deceive people with sweet words.\u201D</p><p>I grin broadly.</p><p>It&#39;d be nice if the shadow made in my shape could actually express that smile.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I didn&#39;t know that you were a demon.\u201D</p><p>Just a little energy returned to her voice.</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying? Angra Mainyu is the name of a terrible devil, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s true, but you don&#39;t seem like such a great person at all.\u201D</p><p>Then, I heard a strained laugh.</p><p>...Geez, even though she&#39;s a coward, she&#39;s only good when it comes to retorts.</p><p>My lovely Master seemed to have begun gazing at the distant entrance that lay at the root of this place.</p><hr><p>\u201CBut now I believe you. Telling me to return to the outside world can&#39;t be anything other than sweet talk.</p><p>In short, you&#39;re just telling me to continue suffering, right?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course. I kept it a secret, but I actually loved seeing you struggle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph. My oh my. You really are a Servant that&#39;s quite bad at keeping secrets.\u201D</p><hr><p>...That was the best farewell I could wish for.</p><p>Looks like I enjoyed this relationship of ours.</p><p>Surely that is the reason why I accompanied her without violating or killing her.</p><p>That&#39;s why I wanted a farewell like this at the very end.</p><p>We&#39;ll part in the same manner as our relationship has always been.</p><p>If there is one thing we haven&#39;t done, it&#39;s only the fact that we never fought while covering each other&#39;s backs right until the end.</p><hr><p>\u201COops, the chitchat ends here. I don&#39;t really mind if you don&#39;t go, though. I&#39;ll be taking my leave first.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t worry. For the time being, I won&#39;t stand still either.</p><p>...But, there&#39;s something I want to ask you before that. Umm, I&#39;m asking this seriously, so please do your best to answer as well.\u201D</p><hr><p>She sounds nervous.</p><p>Wondering what she could possibly be holding back at this late hour, I tilt my head in curiosity...</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Why? Why did you choose someone without any redeeming features like me?</p><p>Just like you said, I am a weak and boring human.\u201D</p><p>...An awkward question indeed.</p><hr><p>\u201C...So you don&#39;t get it, huh? It&#39;s because that part of you is what&#39;s good about you. I like that weakness of yours.</p><p>You hate yourself and have never once been able to like yourself, but even while knowing that, you struggled on, wanting to become someone even slightly better than before.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind awkward people like that. I like people that move forward for their own sake, regardless of the end result.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Not for someone else&#39;s sake, you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Leave that kind of thing to people that have the free time for that.</p><p>You should be a bit more self-aware of how much your hands are full just taking care of yourself. Since you&#39;re an idiot.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015kh.\u201D</p><p>I hear a noise get caught in her throat.</p><p>I can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s holding back a yell or a laugh.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I get it. In other words, you helped me because I&#39;m just another inconsequential human.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s precisely because you&#39;re such an ordinary human, precisely because you were so weak\u2015\u2015\u2015that you were an irreplaceable light to me.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I understand. I&#39;ll go along with your whim then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s good. Well then, shall we each go our separate ways together?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, let&#39;s leave with our backs to each other... Somehow, I feel like I&#39;ll slap you if I see your face now.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She speaks with a bright voice.</p><p>At the very end, I accomplish what I couldn&#39;t before.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Will that really work? Do I even have a back?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou do. Now turn around.\u201D</p><p>We are back to back now.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel any sensation of contact, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;s behind me.</p><p>I can no longer feel warmth or anything else for that matter, but my joy-filled heart is still alive and working.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou got it. Then, I&#39;m off.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re so impatient. Since we&#39;ve come this far, let&#39;s start off at the same time. We&#39;ll start running after a three-second countdown.\u201D</p><p>Like sprinters.</p><p>With a prepped signal gun in each of our hearts.</p><hr><p>3. I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201CAh, don&#39;t try to steal a march and start running before the three seconds are up. This isn&#39;t a competition, after all.\u201D</p><p>2. I enjoy that typical anxiousness of hers.</p><p>\u201CAhaha. \u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re so naive. If it were me, I&#39;d run away at the first second and escape while my opponent was waiting for the three seconds to be up.\u201D</p><p>1. A retort just like usual.</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s true. As for me, after waiting out the three-second countdown, I&#39;d shoot an opponent that did that in the back.\u201D</p><p>A loud laugh.</p><p>0.</p><hr><p><ruby>\u25A0<rt>M</rt></ruby> <ruby>\u25A0<rt>y</rt></ruby> vision is filled with nothing but the void.</p><p>There is no trace of the happiness I felt from behind <ruby>\u25A0<rt>m</rt></ruby> <ruby>\u25A0<rt>e</rt></ruby> .</p><p><ruby>\u25A0<rt>I</rt></ruby> hear a crumbling sound.</p><p>That sound will also probably return to the void soon.</p><hr><p><ruby>\u25A0<rt>I</rt></ruby> run.
