I could not remember for the life of me.<br> ...Mm.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> What is this stuff?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Apple chips.

Hello, Nitocris.<br> Thank you for helping Senpai out.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Of course. Though I must say, I didn&#39;t expect to come back to such a sad state of affairs.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> How can you still call yourself a teacher,<br> wallowing about like a pig?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> It&#39;s deplorable... All the other witches from the great Age of Gods would be ashamed of you!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Ugh, lay offa me! What are you, my mother?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> O-of course not.<br> M-more of a conscientious younger sister.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> At any rate, I know Medea already talked to you about this too...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> ...but make sure you fill out the Caster bulletin and put it back where it belongs like we asked you to!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, I got it already.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong><br> Hmph...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Who&#39;s turning into a pig now?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><p>Aah!

I&#39;m doing better than okay!<br> What a coincidence, running into you here!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If you&#39;re tired, I&#39;ve got some kykeon all ready to go for an afternoon snack!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I&#39;ve also got a remedy that&#39;ll double your fatigue now but make it all go away like magic in a few days if you like.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> When are you going to figure out that administering it in small doses only ends up increasing your target&#39;s poison resistance?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everything okay, Circe?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I believe she is panicking about being compared to all the new Greek additions that have shown up as of late.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Please do not be too harsh with her.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Stop that! Don&#39;t you look away like that just &#39;cause you&#39;re feeling awkward, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-here, Senpai, why don&#39;t you have a seat?<br> I&#39;ll go make some tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;re you watching there, Atalante?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I couldn&#39;t help but notice you&#39;ve been watching it very intently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I also noticed you tearing up at times,<br> so I wasn&#39;t sure what to say...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> O-oh... This?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> This is an old video I found in Chaldea&#39;s library.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> It is so painful to watch that it took my breath away.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> It tells the story of children still too young to attend school who are forced by their cruel parents to go on a trip to procure supplies.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> It has everything. Trials, tribulations, tears,<br> twists, triumph... I could watch it forever.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Jason&#39;s journey to find the Golden Fleece was nothing compared to what these poor children endured!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...really saying something.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Aw come on, that&#39;s not fair to Jason.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You should know that, Atalante,<br> seeing how you were one of the Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Hmph... You have always been too soft when it comes to sailors.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> That is why you are always so put upon.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Haha...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Were Circe and Atalante always such good friends?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Good question.<br> It does seem like they get along very well.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Did you hear that?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, maybe they have a point.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t have a lot of contact in our own time,<br> but that might have been for the best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d tell us about the time you two met?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A story from Greek mythology?<br> I&#39;d love to hear that as well.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hmm. A story about the good old days, huh?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I... I would rather...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Fine with me! Anything for my darling Piglet!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Though it was nothing grand enough to be recorded in poems or stories passed down through the ages.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... Our story begins long before the Trojan War was a glimmer in anyone&#39;s eye...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>	\u2013 Aeaea Island \u2013  \n</code></pre><p><strong>Piglets:</strong><br> Oink, oiiink! (Squealing and sobbing)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> There, there. I know it hurt.<br> You must&#39;ve been so scared. But it&#39;s all okay now.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Circe, tell me, what business does a famed witch have with us?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> A warning! What else!?<br> Listen up, Jason, captain of the Argo!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;re staying on this island, you&#39;re free to fish anything you want from the sea, or to pick any of the fruit of this land.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But do not lay so much as a finger on this island&#39;s animals!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Remember, this island is my domain. If you, or any of your Argonauts, should break my rules...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...you&#39;ll be lucky to escape with your lives,<br> let alone a repaired boat!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Duly noted.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Damn, and here I thought I&#39;d finally get some steak for the first time in ages... Guess it&#39;s back to wyvern jerky.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hey! You two!<br> Put those pigs back where you found them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Huh? Are you talking to me?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> You&#39;re Fujimaru and...Mashaea, was it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Long time no see, Jason.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> The hell&#39;re you talking about, creep?<br> We just saw each other this morning.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> That goes for you too, Mashaea,<br> or whatever your name was. Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Mashaea? Senpai, when did we become sailors?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this mean we&#39;ve joined Jason and become members of the Argonauts now?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> That is correct.<br> Still...it is quite a shame...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Had I known what would happen,<br> I would have strangled this prey on the spot...</p><p><strong>Piglets:</strong><br> O-oiiink!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So... You&#39;re the one who set a trap for my precious piglets!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Wait. Why would you even do that after I made some kykeon to welcome you all!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> How stupid do you think we must be to accept a gift from the witch of Aeaea Island at face value?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hehe, I believe you mean QUEEN Witch!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t sail all this way just to have you poison us and make off with our treasure.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, I wouldn&#39;t do that! For one thing, I&#39;d never lay a hand on my own brother&#39;s treasure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Treasure...? Do you mean the king of Colchis&#39;s most prized possession?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way... The Golden Fleece!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> None other.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> After everything my crew and I have been through, you&#39;d better believe we&#39;re going to be on our guard.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Though I guess it&#39;s no surprise you two wouldn&#39;t know that, since you only just joined us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So then, we must be in the middle of the Argo&#39;s voyage to bring the Golden Fleece back from Colchis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As I recall, during that voyage, Zeus got angry and hurled a tremendous storm at the Argo...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Med\u2013Queen Medea killing her younger brother, Prince Apsyrtus, was the catalyst for his wrath.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Once he learned of this crime, Zeus flew into a rage.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> He struck the Argo with lightning, battered it with great waves, and plunged it into a storm so fierce the keel was nearly torn apart.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> The only reason we managed to barely survive was my mastery of the sail and rudder...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...as well as the courage of my loyal Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...I expect Castor and Pollux&#39;s pleas must have reached Zeus&#39;s ears.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So what happened to Medea?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> She&#39;s inside the Argo&#39;s wreck over on the beach.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> She shut herself up in the cabin after she killed Apsyrtus and hasn&#39;t spoken to anyone since.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> The only exception she will make is for our rostrum oak from Dodona.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> The oak from Dodona... You mean the talking wood that&#39;s only found in the land of Zeus&#39;s oracle?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So she&#39;d rather talk to a piece of lumber than you or your crew? Aren&#39;t you ashamed of that!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Ohhh, right. Technically, you&#39;re my aunt-in-law, aren&#39;t you, Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> And here I still haven&#39;t thanked you properly.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If you&#39;re gonna call me your aunt,<br> then you&#39;d better take good care of Medea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...I wouldn&#39;t have even let you near Aeaea Island if she hadn&#39;t been on your ship.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Zeus will eventually get over his rage,<br> but the Argo will still be cursed.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> It&#39;s only a matter of time until you run into more foul weather, or get stranded somewhere else. Just look how beat-up your ship is.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> How many times have you wrecked that thing? Forget repairing it; you should just throw it away and find a new one.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Wha...!? Don&#39;t be ridiculous!<br> I can&#39;t do that!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> The Argo is my ship! It&#39;s going to guide me back to my home of Thessaly!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Now, now, easy there, Jason.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?<br> Who&#39;s that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (A young man in impressive clothing just showed up...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Is that a human...or a demigod? Who is that?)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you continue such drastic repairs, your ship will, in essence, become a new vessel.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Should that come to pass,<br> would you still call it your beloved Argo?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Of course I could. It&#39;s the only ship worthy of being with me for my whole life.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let it go no matter what,<br> not even if it gets smashed from bow to stern.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Of course that&#39;s your answer.<br> I suppose that is one way for a hero of the sea to live...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Now then. Circe, beautiful ruler of Aeaea Island, goddess of mercy with the wisdom and providence of Artemis...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I apologize for not introducing myself sooner.<br> It is a genuine pleasure to make your acquaintance.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Oh? Well now, I can&#39;t remember the last time someone paid me the proper respects. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I wonder who that is?<br> No...hang on...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Those Ionian looks...<br> That tropical accent...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> And that expensive himation with the pattern reserved strictly for royalty...!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I know...who you are.<br> I think I know your name, too...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the king of Athens!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Indeed I am. I&#39;m honored that you know of me. But right now, I&#39;m just Jason&#39;s friend and fellow Argonaut.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well no wonder the Argo&#39;s cursed if it&#39;s got guys like you on board!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I...I can&#39;t believe you have the guts to show your face before me, Theseus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Theseus...!<br> The heroic young king of Athens...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s been on board the Argo this whole time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I believe so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard that name before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... I&#39;m sure you have, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s the hero who made his way through the great labyrinth of Crete and defeated the Minotaur.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> A hero, huh... Yeah, maybe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Theseus did help my sister, Pasipha\xEB,<br> wrap up one of her loose moral ends.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> After he escaped from the labyrinth, I heard he took her daughter, my niece, Princess Ariadne...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...who was, I would add, the spitting image of her mother, as his bride.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> And yet, for some reason, I haven&#39;t heard anything more about Ariadne after that happened. Not a peep.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Instead, all I&#39;ve heard is how the king of Athens recently welcomed a new queen to his palace.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Why is that, Theseus? What was so wrong with Ariadne that she couldn&#39;t be your queen?</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> ...I still love Ariadne, even now.<br> I&#39;m more grateful to her than you know.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> But unfortunately, she had no intention of bearing me an heir.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> As a man, I could accept that choice and respect it.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> But as the king of Athens,<br> this created a problem that I had to solve.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> Much as I wish it weren&#39;t, that is part of my kingly duty. I am so sorry.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Ghh...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I swear! What is it about my family that makes heroes everywhere just wanna mess with us?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s enough, Theseus.<br> Step down. I&#39;m plenty calm now.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I trust you understand why I didn&#39;t want you and Circe running into each other?</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> Yes, I do, Jason.<br> I&#39;m sorry for overstepping my bounds.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll get back to supervising repairs on the Argo.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Circe, Queen Witch, it is too soon for you to lose hope and curse us.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> You have Medea.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> She speaks of you often, and clearly has fond memories of you as her teacher.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> And right now, Medea wants nothing more than to see the Argo&#39;s voyage completed.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I know she is not here asking you for help,<br> but I also know that is what she wants.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Indeed. Atalante is absolutely right, Circe.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> So I ask you now, as the leader of the Argonauts:<br> please, help us return to the sea.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> For my wife&#39;s\u2013for Medea&#39;s\u2013sake as much as ours.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...I guess my bloodline was just fated to be the plaything of gods and heroes alike.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I actually did not care a great deal about all of that.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I only wished that Medea&#39;s twisted romance would hurry and end, so she may find happiness again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So then, Circe did go on to honor Jason&#39;s request and help the Argonauts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed Jason pulled that off. Talk about a model hero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So, that&#39;s how you shamelessly sweet talk someone intogiving you what you want. Good to know.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...what happened next?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to myth, the Argo continued its voyage for quite some time after that, right?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Indeed. And that is exactly what happened.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> However...Circe was dead set on getting Medea to resolve the situation for herself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> She kept trying to wake her up to the disaster she had invited and face up to it.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...At least, that is what you were trying to do, was it not?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Yeah, it was. Not that it did any good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> My former pupil refused to see me,<br> even after I came to the Argo in person.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> She refused to open up, and wouldn&#39;t let anyone besides Jason come near her.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure Jason&#39;s attempts to console her got through.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Eventually, I just ended up waving my wand to dispel the Argo&#39;s curse.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...All right, listen up, brave Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go over the dispelling ritual one more time.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> This elixir I whipped up will make ephemeral concepts corporeal for a short while.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Once you sprinkle it over the hull, it&#39;ll make its curse something you can touch\u2013or, more to the point, hit.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If you can defeat the curse before the elixir&#39;s effects run out, the Argo should then be free of it for good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But be warned: if you fail to defeat it, it&#39;ll get even stronger and come back to haunt this ship with a vengeance.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> So the curse will take the form of a monster, huh.<br> I suppose it being only one monster would be too much to hope for?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> If not, that&#39;s where Theseus&#39;ll come in!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Now that Heracles is gone, there&#39;s no one else on the crew who can match his might. Haaahaha!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Are you nuts?<br> I&#39;d rather die than ask Theseus for help.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So, before it comes to that...I&#39;m willing to lend a hand myself.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You? For real?<br> Are you sure you even know how to fight, grandma?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You&#39;re the last person I want to hear that from!</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;ll be joining the fray.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> I only hope that the ship doesn&#39;t get wrecked again now that it&#39;s almost repaired.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong><br> Also there&#39;re some ominous clouds making their way toward this island. If the seas start acting up, there&#39;s no telling what might happen to the ship.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> It&#39;s the curse pulling those storm clouds here. How is that a surprise? Of course the gods aren&#39;t gonna be thrilled about this, you jagoff.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Nonetheless...I swear to Hecate that your sails will be filled with wind again.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Now come on, Jason, grab your sword and help us!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Grab my sword? I&#39;ve got my hands full just keeping Medea&#39;s cabin safe!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Are you serious!? This is YOUR ship! You are sincerely dedicated to being a complete dick, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> It is nothing new for him.<br> If any monsters try to escape, I will take care of them.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mashaea, I would appreciate your help as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right...!<br> I&#39;d be glad to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be any help whatsoever, but I&#39;ll do what I can.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Good to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m worried about Medea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> There, now that I&#39;ve finished off this bottle of wine,<br> let&#39;s get to the beach and do this thing!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Okay Argonauts, go forth and get our home back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Haaa!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> There, that takes care of all the monsters on the deck!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Now we just need to take care of the ones in the hold. What are your orders, Jason!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, uh, I&#39;m afraid...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jason got hit by a barrel of apples and knocked out...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Jason died a hero&#39;s death in defense of his ship, I hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Again, hmm. Very well then,<br> we will just have to finish this ourselves.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Circe...?<br> ...Ah...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...So, you&#39;ve finally shown yourself before me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Medea&#39;s...commanding the curse monsters...?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> What... What is the meaning of this, Medea...!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Hello, Circe, Atalante... Did you come here to laugh at me while I was bawling my eyes out?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Or perhaps to admonish me for my sins...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Medea...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...No, nothing like that.<br> I&#39;m here to celebrate this new chapter in your life.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> New chapter...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Just as I will never again be seen merely as a priestess...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Medea, you too have become a woman to be feared as a witch.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So of course you&#39;re gonna mess other people&#39;s lives up something fierce. You can&#39;t help it! You&#39;re a witch!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Go ahead and seduce any man you want,<br> then toss him aside when you&#39;re done!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> That&#39;s one of the best parts of being a witch, you know. You should be proud that you&#39;re worth that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Although, I gotta say...you don&#39;t look all that happy about this to me.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I can see you&#39;re smiling while we stand here, but I can also tell you&#39;re crying on the inside, and I have to say I don&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> These curses come from me...<br> They&#39;re my sins made manifest.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll take them with me when I go.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I cannot let you get away with that, Medea.<br> Those curses will not stop until they sink this ship.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> (Sigh)... How many times did I tell you to learn the medicinal arts too, Medea?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hecate&#39;s medicinal arts don&#39;t just heal the body.<br> They have a powerful effect on the heart, too.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But only if you spent time devoting yourself to the study of how the heart works while learning them.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If you do that, it&#39;s a wonderful way to tame the monsters lurking in your heart.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> For a disciple of Hecate, I gotta say...I&#39;m disappointed in myself for releasing such a half-assed witch into the world.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...This is exactly why I didn&#39;t want to take on an apprentice in the first place.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But, now that we&#39;re here, I guess this scuffle&#39;s as good a time as any to teach you one last lesson!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...what happened to the Argo then?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Nothing, Piglet. There were no more mishaps, happenings, or even minor inconveniences worth mentioning after that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> The Argonauts defeated every monster on board the ship and dispelled Medea&#39;s self-destructive curse.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> After that, I thanked them, threw them a big kykeon farewell party, and sent them on their merry way.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> And you already know the rest from the myth.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> All right, you have your own stuff to take care of, right, Master? Go on then, get out of here.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> That&#39;s it for today&#39;s kykeon party.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Circe? I really do appreciate you telling us that story, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re sitting on Senpai&#39;s bed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hey! Where do you think you&#39;re going with that pillow!? Put it back! Don&#39;t you click your tongue at me!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...(Sulk)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I have rarely seen your lips so loose, falcon witch.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I never expected you to discuss your past in such detail.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Well, so what? Felt like it, so I did.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> That&#39;s all water under the bridge for Medea and me anyway.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hm...? What is it?<br> Why&#39;re you looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Let us say...hypothetically...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...you encountered the hero of your dreams once more. What would you do?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Wh-what kind of stupid question is that?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...I am merely curious.<br> I have no real experience in romance myself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> And as such, I cannot imagine what it is to be driven mad by it, as Medea was.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Granted, the odds of that happening are vanishingly small, and so likely not worth considering...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hehe, oh, I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I&#39;m not the same old Circe I used to be. You don&#39;t really think I&#39;d make the same mistake all over again, do you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> In fact, you&#39;ve got the whole thing back asswards. He&#39;s the one that would end up falling for me, the Queen Witch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Who&#39;s falling for who now?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Bwaaa!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> P-Piglet! Where the hell&#39;d you come from!?<br> Don&#39;t scare me like that!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re just going to the bathroom? You can&#39;t go in your own room &#39;cause you feel like someone&#39;s watching you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> K-kind of an overshare, isn&#39;t it!?<br> Go on, get out of here!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Phew...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> So, you would make him fall in love with you...<br> You are nothing if not confident, witch of Aeaea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Hell yeah I am!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hehe. Still, that said...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If I&#39;d just stayed a hermit out on my island...I&#39;d never have learned to be so recklessly confident.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So I&#39;m grateful to Pig\u2013I mean, Master for that.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Hmm. That&#39;s nice. (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;re the one who started all this.<br> Isn&#39;t it kinda rude for you to just shut down like that?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I guess you didn&#39;t really care after all...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...The Oak of Dodona once told me something while it let me listen to the ocean wind through its knothole.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> It said love would paddle in from far overseas and drop an anchor deep within your heart.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Hmm...<br> A divine prophecy, huh.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Whoever heard of a piece of wood being an oracle? Is it a dryad with a direct hotline to the gods or something?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Anyway, that said...I hope it&#39;s right! Wherever the tree gets its info from, I am definitely a fan of this prophecy.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I know there&#39;s a much better guy for you out there.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Jason might have the makings of a hero,<br> but he&#39;s got a long way to go before\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Um, Auntie...?<br> That prophecy? It was about you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...H-hey, tree, who told you you could go making predictions about my future, huh!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The Oak also said...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...that a hero you would never forget would come visit Aeaea Island one day.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Stop that. I&#39;m the Queen Witch, remember?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t funny. I&#39;m a disciple of Hecate herself.<br> No way I&#39;m letting Zeus pull that kind of stunt!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, Medea, look!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> The sailors are praying to Zephyr as we speak.<br> It won&#39;t be long before you set sail again.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...I know.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> ...Well, my defiant disciple, this is the last piece of advice I have for you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> Stay on my island.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> The Argo&#39;s curse is gone.<br> I&#39;ve washed away its stain.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> The Argonauts can handle the rest of their journey without you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> And nobody from Colchis would ever come looking for you here.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Auntie, but I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> You saw what happened for yourself, right?<br> Jason needs me.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Besides...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t want to be just a footnote in history like Ariadne.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> ...I see. Well then, I guess there&#39;s nothing left to say but goodbye.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> I guess not.<br> Take care of yourself, Auntie.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong><br> Even though I&#39;ll be staying on, I pray you&#39;ll find the kind of love that would make me insanely jealous.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong><br> You never change, do you!</p>', 408);
