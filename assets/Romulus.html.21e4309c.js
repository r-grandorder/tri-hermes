I&#39;m in a great mood today.<br> Indeed\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s sad I won&#39;t see Fujimaru and Mash ever again, but I&#39;m the emperor of Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As long as my people have smiles on their faces, all I need is to reign over and govern Rome with unlimited love!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My talent has no limit, and neither does my love.<br> The applause of roses will always resound in Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m so excited!<br> Which song should I sing today?</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong><br> Oh, I see her Imperial Majesty over there!<br> She&#39;s as bright as Apollo, and as beautiful as Venus!</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong><br> Long live her Majesty!<br> Hurray for Emperor Nero Claudius!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu.<br> Keep on, I&#39;ll allow for the applause.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If there&#39;s one thing to be added, I&#39;m also as talented in art as a Muse.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Now let me sing!<br> Young girls, come here and hold flowers!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Honor of Imperium is here! I&#39;ll sing with my sweet voice to people throughout the capital, no, the whole land of Rome.</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong><br> Oh, wow!<br> Look, her Imperial Majesty is about to sing!</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong><br> We&#39;re blessed, but you have to put up with it!<br> Don&#39;t lose your concentration, otherwise you won&#39;t last!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehe, even the people passing by are excited!<br> I&#39;m so happy. This is the Rome I love!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Whew!<br> That was a great recital.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But those orchestra folks that rushed to join.<br> Isn&#39;t their performance a bit too loud?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t it drown out my sweet voice and block my singing from reaching my people?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I understand that they get excited, but I need them to remember to be patient.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Anyway, I spent the whole morning singing. I should work on some official business in the afternoon\u2013</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong><br> Your Majesty.<br> I bring news.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, my Knight Burrus.<br> What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong><br> From the provinces ruled by the United Empire, we&#39;ve received letters from the viceroys and director-generals who went missing.</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to bother you, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you can read it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, Burrus.<br> What you just brought in is nothing less than good news!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hand over their letter to me.<br> I&#39;ve been concerned about them.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (If what Mash and others said was true, all the matters associated with the fake United Empire)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (will disappear without a trace at some point.<br> But, umu. For now I should just read the letters.)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (My dear vassals. How did they survive from the attack of the United Empire?)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (I should learn that.<br> I&#39;m already someone who&#39;s killed her own mother\u2013)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (All that&#39;s left is to continue to be the Emperor.<br> I believe my love will reach both my vassals and my people)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (...Isn&#39;t that right, O Romulus?)</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong><br> \u2013Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Sorry, I think I got a little tired from singing.<br> But not to worry.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Give me the letters. I&#39;ll make sure to hear what the governors and others must say!</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> ...Your Imperial Majesty.<br> You seem to be pushing yourself too hard.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> It&#39;s already late at night.<br> You should rest soon.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, Seneca.<br> Hehe, thank you for caring for me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I got a stack of official work to deal with. I wish there were a few more of me so it wouldn&#39;t take this much time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But that wouldn&#39;t work either.<br> For I am the one and only in Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hehe. It&#39;s okay.<br> I&#39;m glad to hear you say that to me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Once, when my mother was alive\u2013</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh... Well, excuse me.<br> Never mind what I just said.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;ve noticed my migraines are coming back.<br> Indeed this prevents me from finishing my work.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Certainly, I think I&#39;m a little tired.<br> I&#39;m going to bed now.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Can I ask you to sleep by my side, private tutor?</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> Please stop kidding.<br> But I&#39;m glad you changed your mind.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> Please rest well.<br> You are our only Roman Emperor.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong><br> You should never push yourself too hard.<br> Your recklessness will lead to Rome&#39;s recklessness.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu.<br> That makes sense\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No one is here.<br> Nero appears to have gone to her bedroom.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow, Imperial Privilege EX is incredible!<br> It shut off your presence completely!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Besides, not only Romulus himself, but both Mash and Fujimaru as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wonder which skill he used?<br> Um, is it possible to tell us\u2013King Romulus?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Romulus?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you worrying about Nero?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Sure.<br> To Romulus, Nero is like a &quot;descendant,&quot; I suppose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rome?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Every Roman is my child. Nero Claudius.<br> One of my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> With such a tiny body, the fragile girl tries to support everything in the far-off land, Rome.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> I, Rome, witnessed love in her.<br> It&#39;s not gods&#39; love, and yet not human&#39;s love, either.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> It is exactly... One of many forms of love a Roman emperor ought to possess.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Even if that path heads to none other than the Underworld itself\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. In several years from now Emperor Nero&#39;s political power becomes weak, and she loses the support of everyone under her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I cannot tell her the truth,<br> but sadly, it&#39;s just how the history is.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Even if everyone rejects her, even if the gods reject her.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> I, Rome, shall never reject her.<br> Nero Claudius is great.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> She is\u2013<br> truly a great &quot;Roman emperor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Therefore, leave immediately.

A ghost-type monster perhaps?<br> But this is too powerful for something naturally created.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Augustus\u2013!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Tiberius, Claudius!<br> O, Trajanus! Hadroanus, Severus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Names of the emperors of the ancient Roman Empire?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, I got it!<br> Those ghosts are the &quot;emperors&quot; themselves!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Those &quot;emperors&quot; were chain-summoned by Romulus&#39;s existence, attracted by it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can sense hostility in their magical energy.<br> Senpai, this is going to be a battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get ready for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!<br> Your orders, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rome!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!<br> S-Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Emperors from the past!<br> Emperors from the future!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> You must all leave now! You certainly are Rome,<br> but now is the time of Nero!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> The short-lived United Empire is no more!<br> Hence, O, my children, gathering in the void!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> \u2013Behold my spear!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> This spear I hold is Rome.<br> Hence, you shall\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Return to Rome through my spear.<br> O, O, Magna Voluisse Magnum!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> \u2013Rome!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle is over.<br> All hostile targets were destroyed.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Rome will never collapse. Even if all the Roman emperors end up crawling on the ground.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Rome will continue to shine in the past,<br> present, and future. I, Rome, can see that.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Look, heavenly gods.<br> Behold my Rome, no\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Behold Nero&#39;s Rome, one that lasted longer than mine.<br> Beautiful. This moment of beauty is infinite.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think I can understand, or maybe not.<br> Hmm. What exactly is he saying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s Rome</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s Rome</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh, sure Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a second. Mash, you just gave up on thinking, didn&#39;t you? And Fujimaru, you&#39;ve been\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Rome...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rome...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.
