important than anything else.<br> The nature of the God Child was supposedly lost due to the wish of Miyu herself, but the reason why it was registered in her Saint Graph was because she\u2019s in \u300Ea form that grew while retaining the nature of the God Child\u300F.<br> Maybe because the body is different, maybe because the land is different, the reason is unknown but it doesn\u2019t seem

The third Ascension is the form of the if of\u300CWhat if she became a magical girl while retaining the power of the God Child\u2026\u2026\u300D. Sapphire reads the mood and changes as well. For Miyu the power of the God Child is like a curse from a certain lineage, but on the other hand there\u2019s the aspect that she was able to meet her old brother and Illya because she had that power. The Miyu who naturally uses the power of the God Child, understanding and accepting it, is a form I couldn\u2019t draw in the original story so I feel very happy to have been able to introduce it in FGO. Her lines also separate her feelings as the God Child and those as Miyu individually.
