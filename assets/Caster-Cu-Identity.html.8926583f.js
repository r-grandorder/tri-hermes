To begin with, the Celtic druids used ash trees, so it is natural that CasCu uses ash trees when he is a druid, but the fact that the English name is stated as Yggdrasil Tree makes it all the more suspicious.</p><ul><li>CasCu in the Nordic field (Boudica\u2019s 3rd Strengthening Quest)</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9fxGgHp.png" alt="Nordic Fields"></p><ul><li>The only one in the Singularity F Memorial Quest with a Class name instead of a True Name</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wxnwjYV.png" alt="4th anni"></p><p>In the Memorial Quest, Cu Chulainn is the only one who has his Class name, Caster, used.</p><ul><li>Human Order Reorganization statement in Valentine\u2019s Day</li></ul><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mjjrrlT.png" alt="Valentines"></p><p>During Valentine\u2019s Day for his return gift scene, he talks about the Human Order Incineration and the Human Order Reorganization.

It\u2019s not a private account, the name being used was Moro, and it was only discovered because he was tweeting information and behind-the-scenes stories about a Servant that was going to be strengthened, which only those involved should know about. This account has now been deleted. However, it was clear he was on Twitter based on his behaviour.

In the case that he truly materializes as the hero Cu Chulainn, he will no longer possess this Skill, but instead will possess the Noble Phantasm Gae Bolg.</p><p><strong>(In other words, a situation where the materialized hero Cu Chulainn does not possess either this Skill or the Noble Phantasm Gae Bolg\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014should be essentially impossible.)</strong></p></div><p>Setanta was implemented in FGOAC.
