John the Baptist possesses legends where he used various Magecrafts, so that head is a clump of Mystery, converted into a Magecraft Mystic Code of sorts.

She fell in love with John the Immerser, also known as John the Baptist, and she used the fact that her stepfather King Herod was in love with her to obtain John. She seduced King Herod, who is said to have not allowed the Immerser alone to leave prison, and had him decapitate John\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014She had then attained the head of her beloved one.</p><p>Although her name did not appear in the New Testament, it turned out to be \u201CSalome\u201D in \u201CAntiquities of the Jews\u201D that was written by Flavius Josephus, a Hebrew writer from the same time period as Salome\u2019s.</p><p>It turned out that the situation of \u201CJohn the Immerser\u2019s head was placed on a platter, carried in that condition, and handed over to a girl\u201D gave vivid inspiration to artists of posterity, those artists painting religious paintings of it in great numbers from over the Renaissance Period to the Baroque Period. Through these artworks, various speculations were made regarding Salome\u2019s motive.</p><p>In the story \u201CH\xE9rodias (the French word form of Herodias)\u201D \u2013 which was written by Gustav Flaubert, a novelist of 19th Century France \u2013 Salome\u2019s ambitious mother Herodias was afraid of John\u2019s influence, and that was treated as the reason for the incident taking place, Salome herself being depicted in a complicit role all the way to the end of the story. But afterwards, it turned out that Oscar Wilde published the play \u201CSalome\u201D in the year 1893[1], which resulted in the play being made into an opera by Richard Strauss, and that allowed the deplorable image of Salome \u2013 a girl who is deeply in love with Jokanaan (John), resulting in her eventually wanting his head \u2013 to take hold.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Although she was a pure girl in her lifetime, it appears that Salome has materialized in a state where her mind was fixed as it was at the moment when she approached her end, yearning for love and perishing in madness.</p><p>As a Servant, Salome is overflowing broadly and generously with her love, which should have been devoted only to John the Immerser. That is to say, she will completely fall in love with even those who oppose her. It seems that if she is controlled well, Salome can work as a powerful Berserker, but it appears that each time she kills an opponent who she fell in love with, her mind will creak and break even more.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A crystal skull, which is a Noble Phantasm.

I tried to draw her as a dancer with a moderately erotic impression and one who has an oriental sensation. There is a mature impression about her as a result of her makeup, but she is considerably younger in her setting. The performance of her voice actor regarding that area was splendid I tell you.
