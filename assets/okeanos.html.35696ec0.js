HAHAHAHAH! AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA LOLOLOLOLOL!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2014I woke up at the same time today.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I checked my temperature. My five senses. To drive the point home, I said my name out loud.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> A deep breath\u2014I confirmed my consciousness,as I was told it might disappear each time I fell asleep.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I was myself. My existence had been approved one more day.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Good morning, Number 2. Aren&#39;t you cold? The temperature outside is 70 below.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s especially cold this morning. Well, I suppose that&#39;s irrelevant as long as you&#39;re in this room.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> There in that clean, comfortable room,I said what came to my mind, &quot;That&#39;s quite troublesome. &quot;</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Any inconveniences? If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like, please let me know.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> He smiled as he told me that,and gave me a very pained look.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I thought, perhaps, that part of his body was in pain. &quot;Are you okay? &quot; I asked him.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Guess my worries were unwarranted. Good morning, \u25A0\u25A0. Congrats on your 5,110th awakening.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; I responded. It was how I genuinely felt.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I was extremely happy. For one more day,I&#39;d get to enjoy the wonders of this world.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!

You should use a gentler touch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if they are as dense as a rock. See, like a blade peeling a carrot.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Good morning, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m already awake, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...My. Non-REM sleep to fully awake in a single second...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, and very impressive, Senpai. You&#39;re clearly enthusiastic about being entrusted with the Continuation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m serious about it too. Let&#39;s be optimistic and head to the control room!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good morning everyone, how did you all sleep? I didn&#39;t sleep much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We defeated Lev Lainur and retrieved the second Holy Grail...That&#39;s great, but there are more questions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What was that pillar of flesh? Who was that,claiming to be one of the 72 Demon Gods?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We unfortunately don&#39;t have the time or resources to analyze these questions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Dr. Roman. Speaking of the 72 Demon Gods, well...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I can only think of one thing. The familiars who served a certain ancient king.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ancient king?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Familiars?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The King of Ancient Israel,and the greatest summoner in the world of mages!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The familiars who served him were the infamous 72 Demon Gods!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh! Are you Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes. Good. Perfect! Mash, I love your reaction!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was worth slipping those cue cards to Roman! As a genius, my stage entries must be grand!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Sigh. Please don&#39;t tire me out so early in the morning, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Also, please refrain from spreading rumors. None of this information is substantiated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To begin with, the 72 Demon Gods are all fantasies. Demon Gods don&#39;t actually exist.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> These days people speculate that they were merely familiars broken down into 72 different roles, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. But since the roles were so clearly defined,some theorize that they may be the origin of angels.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And since he actually claimed to be one, it&#39;s not unrelated?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How about the hypothesis that Lev, or the mastermind behind him, summoned &quot;a certain ancient king? &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That possibility does exist...Still, I find the idea of 72 Demon Gods hard to believe...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Why is that? I mean, Fujimaru actually fought one, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why. The data I have seems to correspond with what I would expect from a &quot;demon. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, uh, how do I put this...It follows the legend too well. The concept of demons came much later than that king.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Suppose that king really did turn into a Heroic Spirit. His Noble Phantasm would be a lot simpler and smarter.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It would be strange to have such an ominous Demon God, one that modern-day people know of, serving under him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm. You have a point. The chance that they&#39;re just assuming the name is high.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now, if we could just ask Servants related to Demon Gods a few questions, it would make our lives infinitely easier.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. That&#39;s why, for now, I won&#39;t comment on the Demon God Lev transformed into. It&#39;s still anybody&#39;s guess.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Back on topic...Let&#39;s talk about obtaining the third Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This may seem sudden, but Fujimaru,did you get seasick back in Rome?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A little bit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see.... Right, of course.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Humans are creatures that have learned to adapt. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not very reassuring, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good! How reassuring. I was about to get motion sickness meds that &quot;work&quot; on the central nervous system, if need be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> FOU!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh? Fou is going to head out again?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I&#39;m not superstitious, but when Fou&#39;s around Mash&#39;s mental state stabilizes...I&#39;ll be counting on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry Doctor, but if Fou&#39;s nearby during a crisis, I just feel so much calmer...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> N&#39;kyu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> New land always awaits us with each Rayshift. The more we find familiar, the better. Take him with you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The year is 1573. The location\u2014 An ocean as far as the eye can see!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ocean, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. The geography is shifting correspondingly with the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s an area that can be specifically marked &quot;here. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The sea only has several islands scattered around. I would like you to investigate the cause of the Singularity immediately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope we don&#39;t end up in the ocean...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to worry about that. We&#39;ll input the necessary coordinates for the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At the very least, you shouldn&#39;t end up in the ocean. Besides, you have another promising ally with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ally?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Here, I invented it. It&#39;s a rubber floaty. You can use it in case you get into trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Sigh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Roger that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm...It would be quite troublesome if we landed in the middle of the ocean right after being teleported.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how to swim. Senpai...You&#39;re not a great swimmer either, are you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve taken that into consideration for the purposes of the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At least you won&#39;t end up in the walls somewhere. In case you do end up in the ocean\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Here, a floaty! Cool, isn&#39;t it? I took the liberty of designing it in Decalavian style.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. This is needlessly prickly! Fitting the ocean theme, it&#39;s like a starfish!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Dr. Roman? This is putting Senpai&#39;s safety on the line, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Sorry. It was just a little joke before departure. I shall tend to the Rayshift at all costs.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I still have some worries,but we don&#39;t have the time to address all of them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s go. I will give it everything I have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s do it, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. Leave the combat to me once we arrive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have a couple of errands...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Leave the errands till after we&#39;ve returned to Chaldea. Now, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. Mash has really started to take charge. Fujimaru is the type that gets henpecked, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re coming after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll carry you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> N&#39;kyu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;re all set.

Since you&#39;re so great, you&#39;ve probably already noticed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something is wrong with this era, with this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The ocean you&#39;ve spent your days in,and the ocean we see before us, are not the same.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Heh, all this talk about the world, the era,they were things I decided to completely ignore...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...But I can&#39;t ignore talk about the ocean. You&#39;re right, something did feel strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I thought so! We can explain why\u2014</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> \u2014But when I say &quot;strange,&quot; I don&#39;t mean it as a bad thing. There&#39;s no other world that&#39;s as fun as this one!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, you scumbags?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Woo-hoo! You bet! You&#39;re the best, Boss! Hear, hear, to never-ending rum!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whaaaaaaaat?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You see? We pirates long for freedom,even if it entails evil deeds!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you insist on speaking with me...You must pass some tests first.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Try to defeat me, THE Francis Drake. Then we can talk!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m as drunk as they come right now! Let&#39;s see if you have what it takes to sober me up!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I guess too much freedom is sometimes a bad thing. Like in France, please use the back of the blade!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Of course! I shall respond to Captain Drake&#39;s request. Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-So powerful...This person is flesh and blood, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-Well, she should be. Thing is, I&#39;m getting a magical energy reading from her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So she&#39;s either a mage\u2013or a hero from birth?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahhhh! That hits the spot. Rum&#39;s got nothing on this, I&#39;m telling you.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Hey Boss! You all right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hahaha! What are you talking about? Of course I&#39;m all right!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That aside though...Seems that I lost.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You can boil me, fry me, sleep with me,anything you want!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pass.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m good.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I don&#39;t think you need to reply every time...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh? I see, I see. In that case, I guess it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, a loss is a loss,I&#39;ll hear you guys out.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But, you know what? From the looks of it, you want a ride, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You&#39;re looking for something, but are unfamiliar with these seas. That&#39;s why you need to rely on me, pirate or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You being a pirate is irrelevant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need you, Francis Drake.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I see.... Hmm, hah, so that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So? What exactly do you want from us? We lost, so we&#39;ll give you anything other than our lives.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...First, we must understand the situation. &quot;Where&quot; exactly are we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> England? Or closer to Spain, perhaps? Or are we in the Caribbean?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Uhh, sorry. Come to think of it, we don&#39;t know either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So all that revelry and you don&#39;t even know!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Right, because there&#39;s no shortage of food or booze.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right. Now that we&#39;ve surrendered to you,we&#39;re officially part of your crew!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> How about we start off with a toast!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-Hey, wait a sec...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> C&#39;mooon, it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s all good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s NOT good! Hey, what are you...No, wait! Master, save me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hm? What are these readings...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nah, must be an error. I&#39;ll make some adjustments.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, men! To our two new comrades, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? That&#39;s backwards. To their new comrades, us\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Cheers!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Cheers!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but we really don&#39;t have time for this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t give in so easily! We have to set sail and check out these waters immediately...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What&#39;s with the gloomy look? You&#39;ll never find treasure with an attitude like that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what I mean. If you&#39;re going to help, please consider our situation\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, I get it, more or less. These waters are abnormal, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I mean, I&#39;ve seen superhumans walking around who won&#39;t even budge from cannon fire.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Servants!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Being a pirate myself, see,I&#39;ve been through my share of chaos.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I can usually tell when it&#39;s something bad and unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> These waters are abnormal. One moment we&#39;re in a jungle, the next we&#39;re in a temperate Mediterranean climate\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The currents and winds are a mess, too. I mean, even sailing straight out into the sea is tricky.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Moreover, there&#39;s no &quot;continent&quot; in this ocean. Nor is there an &quot;England. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, you already knew that much...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hence why we were already planning on a new journey as soon as tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t make sense for pirates to settle down on land. Gotta find a town to call our home base.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Tonight was supposed to be the pre-party. But, you guys showed up out of nowhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry for interfering.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Pardon us.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Don&#39;t sweat it. You guys are a good omen!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> From what I can tell,you know how to handle a cannon or two. Right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never tried, but probably.... Um, so if you already knew this much, why did you attack us?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahahaha! Well, isn&#39;t that obvious? Because it seemed like fun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Such a trivial reason...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So, Fujimaru you say? You the\u2013captain or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something similar, I would say.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Heh heh heh. In that case\u2013Drink up!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s be friends. From one captain to another, eh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!? Fofou? FOOOOOOOOOU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now, someone knows how to hold their liquor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Umm...Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The H-Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, the Holy Grail\u2013!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not what I mean. The Holy Grail...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For everyone who fought with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, okay.... That&#39;s not what I mean, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do our best, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash :</strong><br> Senpai, how many fingers am I holding up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see two Mashes, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash :</strong><br> Get ahold of yourself! Senpai! Right in front of you! The Holy Grail! It&#39;s here!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Why&#39;re you staring at me all of a sudden? You see someone you recognize?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it at all! That thing! What the captain has in her hands!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ah-ha! You got a fine pair of eyes there. Gold tankards are usually so tasteless, but not this one.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just the never-ending booze from it, either.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Place it on the table, and behold! It produces endless meat and fish!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I just happened to pick it up,but I doubt you&#39;ll find anything like this anywhere.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> What&#39;re you talking about, Boss? This wasn&#39;t coincidence. It was an adventure for several lifetimes!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Seven endless nights! Giant destructive whirlpools in one ocean after another!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> And from within the maelstrom,the legendary lost city of Atlantis!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> &quot;The time is upon us. By the 12 gods of Olympus, I shall create another flood and destroy all civilization! &quot;</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the big thing said right before Boss kicked its ass and seized the treasure!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> And with that, as crazy as it sounds,she became a hero! She saved the world!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? Was it really that epic? It got on my nerves, so I gave it a piece of my mind.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That big lug called itself Poseidon. Can&#39;t really have that as a sailor.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I put it in check and took its treasure, see? I even sank the entire city into the whirlpool. It was great!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1APirate:</strong><br> Bwaaaahahaha! Way to go, Boss! Both fortune and misfortune smiled upon you!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1APirate:</strong><br> You&#39;re gonna be single till the day you die! Or maybe you&#39;re actually a dude or something, eh Boss?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now this is fun! We&#39;ve got a new crew, and the booze is tasty! But we&#39;re takin&#39; Bombe in a barrel later, and sinkin&#39; him!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now we sing, you idiots! Golden Hind, sing the crew&#39;s theme song!</p><p><strong>Drake &amp; Pirates:</strong><br> \u266AReap our treasure! \u266A\u266ADown our ale! \u266A</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...FOOOOOOOU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahhh...Aahhh...I don&#39;t believe it...They&#39;re not lying!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, the Foundation of Humanity was on the verge of destruction in this era before we arrived!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And...Captain Drake, without even knowing,resolved it on a whim.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And the result\u2014</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Whoa, it&#39;s sinking into my body. I never get used to this, really.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> With this treasure,I can even deal damage to those invincible guys.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But it goes in and out of my body. Makes my chest so tight, I can&#39;t stand it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That Holy Grail! Captain Drake is the owner of this era&#39;s Holy Grail\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, by saving this era, the Holy Grail chose her. She is truly the rightful owner of the Grail!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, yes, yes, what is it? Can you get back to me later?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The search program is acting up a bit. For some reason,it says the Holy Grail is right in front of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The Holy Grail is here! In front of us!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Case closed! Woohoo!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And, Fujimaru seems to be in an awfully good mood?</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Ow! Hey, what the hell do you think you&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Huuuh? Shut up and mind your own business.</p><p><strong>Pirate A:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Pirate B:</strong><br> Huuh?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> And, now they&#39;re fighting. Looks like we have to stop them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is insane...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So...What? You guys came for this magical tankard...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I mean the Holy Grail? You can go back to your country if you have this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Well, that&#39;s it, more or less.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm. Well, I can&#39;t deny that I lost to you,and I even said I&#39;d give you anything but my life.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Here, take it. You came here from a distant era, right? Thanks for making the trip.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-Thank you very much. Since we&#39;ve retrieved the Holy Grail, we&#39;ve resolved the Singularity of this era...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Have we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we have.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, the Holy Grail has been secured. Have there been any changes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not that I can tell. The Bolt of this era is still left unsecured.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Holy Grail is indeed functioning to a certain extent. But, it&#39;s not as strong a force as before.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Maybe it&#39;s the real Holy Grail. The one that was in this era to begin with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...In other words, it&#39;s different from the Grails we&#39;ve seen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. The Grails that Lev Lainur supposedly placed disrupt the seven Foundations of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, there was another Holy Grail in these seas. Captain Drake is the one chosen by that Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The reason behind the turbulent seas is that the opposing forces, the two Holy Grails, are in contention.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> &quot;The rightful Grail held by the savior Captain Drake,&quot;and &quot;Lev&#39;s Holy Grail brought in from the outside to disturb the world. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as Captain Drake is around, this era won&#39;t fall. However, it won&#39;t return to normal, either.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In order to restore the seas\u2014I fear we must retrieve Lev&#39;s Holy Grail after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. So it&#39;s not as urgent as previous eras,but the final objective is the same.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There&#39;s that odd voice again...Say, who are you talking to, Mash?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You got a pet gnome or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not quite that cute. The Doctor is, how shall I say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Think of it as a mysterious fairy,talking to us from a town really far away.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sure. So, he&#39;s making you guys fight,while he gets to cozy up in his home?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> In the end, what&#39;s this all about? You get what you came for?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No. It seems there&#39;s another Holy Grail, Captain Drake,one that shouldn&#39;t exist in this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unless we retrieve it,the ocean will be like this forever.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, that sounds real dangerous.... Are you serious?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dead serious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Absolutely.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which is why I&#39;ll give this back to you.... You were meant to have it, Captain.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> O-Okay. I appreciate your courtesy.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Boy. I&#39;ve never given up a treasure so easily,or had it returned so easily either...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, can I get some advice?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> H-Hey, just hang on a second. I&#39;m thinking. This is way beyond what I imagined...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then, may I ask a few questions?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Francis Drake. I know this may seem very sudden, but do you have a wish?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Wish?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For example, you&#39;re a pirate. You wish to gather all the treasures in the world, do you not?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yeah, I suppose I do. So, do I just wish on this Grail to have it come true?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Most likely. Are you going to?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Of course not. You know I&#39;m a pirate, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> A pirate that gets treasure by praying\u2013That&#39;s a bad joke if I ever heard one.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Treasure should be won through power, wisdom, and courage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, that would mean your immediate wish is simply to secure enough water, food, and safety.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In other words, you already had that wish granted.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...I suppose that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Holy Grail you hold has the power to create this world. However\u2013this ocean is not what you desire.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Which means, &quot;something&quot; is causing this world to exist. Someone is disrupting your ocean, and your era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s only one thing to be done, right? You need to reclaim your own world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The people next to you, Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, exist to resolve issues of this nature.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They&#39;re professionals who have defeated what you call &quot;invincible guys&quot; many times.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I see...I think I understand now. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So, who does that make you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Leonardo Da Vinci. I died about 20 years before you were born. I&#39;m a genius.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh. Never heard of you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> W-What...did you say?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So, this world is broken after all. Which means that there&#39;s no treasure to begin with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You could be right. I don&#39;t think there is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No\u2014there is! I believe there is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you a little too excited?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In this world and era, &quot;pirates&quot; are a common thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For better or worse, the Age of Exploration was an unavoidable event that expanded the world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The planet&#39;s pioneers entrusted their dreams to the unknown seas and the other side of the horizon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...And with all those &quot;thoughts&quot; and &quot;desires&quot; gathered,I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a treasure really did exist here.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So, it does exist? Enough gold and silver and spices to sink this ship?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. I, Dr. Roman, will guarantee that. There is a treasure\u2013for sure!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t take it. I&#39;m fired up, I&#39;m fired up as hell! All right scumbags, let&#39;s drink up a storm first!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Our voyage tomorrow is going to be one unlike any other! No guarantee we&#39;ll return alive, so drink your hearts out!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Treasures! Riches! Spices! Tasty booze and uncharted adventures await us!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> CHEERS!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, we&#39;re drinking again!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> After all, we&#39;re pirates! \u266ABoth you and I are pirates! \u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, please! No more singing!</p><h2 id="section-3-ghost-ship-and-new-island" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-ghost-ship-and-new-island" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Ghost Ship and New Island</h2><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;re setting sail!

Let&#39;s liven things up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sigh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not used to the sea?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. We saw never-ending land last time, but I&#39;ve never experienced an ocean as far as the eye can see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry. I haven&#39;t let my guard down.... Senpai, you seem to be having fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unfortunately, this is not the time for that. I&#39;m afraid things will be slightly different this\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Senpai! Seagulls! Seagulls over there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And look,I see more pirates there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahem. Now, here I go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Have fuuuuun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-Is it just me,or are you sort of out of it, Master?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whew...I&#39;m all sticky from the seawater.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey, hey, Fujimaru and Mash. Got a second?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, what is it?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Those people we took out have vanished. In your eyes, is that possible?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...True, they have disappeared. Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, just as I thought. Seems like it&#39;s the concept of pirates that exist in these waters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Concept, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A type of spiritual body etched in the memories of the&quot;Age of Exploration. &quot; They can only act to fulfill their roles.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They have their own will, but are models of an idea. Call them an infinite copy of the &quot;average pirate. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They do little damage, but unless the world is corrected,these &quot;bugs&quot; will keep spawning forever.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I had to sum it up in a single word,those pirates are like...Ghosts.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...But, they took damage from bullets, you know? Not just mine either, from the scallywags as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry, let me rephrase that. Think of them as ghosts with physical bodies.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> S-So they have physical bodies. Then we&#39;re okay! There&#39;s no problem!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s correct. Now, let us be on our way!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> By the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What do you think are in these waters, anyway?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If what the doctor says is true,there might be a treasure here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...That means these waters are basically the same as those in the Age of Exploration.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Which means Drake isn&#39;t the only pirate going after the treasure.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahah! That gets me all fired up! First come, first served. How simple is that?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> But Boss,we don&#39;t have any leads on that treasure.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Fool. We&#39;re going to start by finding those leads.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> ...Boss! An island in sight! East-northeast of here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It is indeed an island. Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m detecting Servants on that island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain Drake. That island has those superhumans you mentioned before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please have all the pirates retreat. The only ones who can fight them are myself, Senpai, and you.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Already? Well, you guys are with me this time. Hey scumbags, protect the ship!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Fujimaru and I are gonna go check things out!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Roger that, Boss! We look forward to your return!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We need to proceed with caution, Master. We still don&#39;t know if the Servant is a friend or foe...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm...Over there, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ack! Drake? Is that an enemy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahhh! Fou, stop running around!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> No. But I felt a vague presence, so I took a shot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> &quot;Vague? &quot; &quot;Took a shot!? &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you get a bad feeling, fire first, ask later. That&#39;s the key to survival, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How violent...That&#39;s how an outlaw thinks!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, did it hit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you get it?</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hah! You won&#39;t know until you look for yourself! I&#39;ll go see if it&#39;s dead or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Captain Drake is unlike Jeanne or Nero. She&#39;s a type of person we&#39;ve never encountered before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, there goes our plan to proceed with caution. Senpai, what should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s calm down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s play it by ear.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. I will calm down and play it by ear.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey! Mash, Fujimaru! Come over here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...Stone tablet?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Can you read what&#39;s written on it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It\u2013appears to be runes of some sort. Doctor, can you decode it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see, I see, these are relatively new runes. I&#39;d say they were carved within the last week.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, Da Vinci? That&#39;s my job, yes? Don&#39;t take my job, okay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> &quot;Bloodaxe King, once laid to rest, shall awaken once more. &quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s the general gist of it. But, Bloodaxe King? Why does that sound familiar\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Th-The Bloodaxe King is the name of the Viking king that ruled Norway in the 9th century!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Be careful. I&#39;m picking up readings similar to those copied pirates from that stone tablet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemies?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Yeah, it appears so. I&#39;m getting a very bad vibe here. Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Get ready for a fight...We&#39;re goin&#39; in! The first to strike is the winner!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Here they come!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> For King Eric,our great and glorious leader!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger. Master...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. The battle has ended, Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Searching surroundings...Nothing detected. The nearby Servant signals are not moving.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They haven&#39;t noticed us? Anyway, you need to get out of there fast.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that. Let&#39;s move on.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mmm...Sniff, sniff. Treasure, will I get a whiff of that treasure?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain Drake, treasure has no scent.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahaha! You think so, Mash? Treasure does indeed have a scent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ah, that look says you don&#39;t believe me! All right, let&#39;s make a bet.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If there&#39;s treasure up ahead, like I said...Hmm, what should we do?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I know, how about coming with me on a trip around the world?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Around the world you say?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> When I flee these waters and return to England\u2013I&#39;m going to sail around the world on the Golden Hind.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What do you say? If you help me out,I bet I&#39;ll be the luckiest pirate ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Around the world...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Of course Fujimaru will come along, too. You&#39;re Mash&#39;s Master, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll think about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, and if I lose\u2013If I lose...Hmm, is there anything else you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have enough already.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There is nothing I want. If I had to choose,having your assistance like this is enough.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Really? That&#39;s really greedy, you got me there! That&#39;s gonna cost you dearly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-Excuse me? Senpai and I both answered that we&#39;ve been repaid already. Actually, Senpai, we have a good deal.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What&#39;s gotten into you? You said you have no wishes. That&#39;s the most troublesome wish.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Because, you can&#39;t buy items that &quot;don&#39;t exist. &quot;I am, after all, a merchant!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If I can&#39;t keep my customers happy, then I&#39;ll be a third-rate one. And THAT, I will not have.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s why first,I need to get whatever it is you want.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But, you said you couldn&#39;t think of anything. Now, this is going to be a problem. How can I deliver something you don&#39;t want?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. I&#39;m beginning to understand why this crude outlaw of a woman has THAT skill.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2013Here they come! Servants are on the move.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like they sensed you guys. They&#39;re coming in fast!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hopefully we can talk it out with them\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Gagagagaga! Gigigigi\u2014giiiiiiii!!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> M-My! My name! Eric! The Grand...Eric!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Gah-go! Kill! Kill anyone in the way! Kill. KILL! Gigigiiii\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s not getting it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Mash Kyrielight\u2013going in! Captain Drake!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sure thing! Vikings from Norway! They&#39;re like our ancestors, you know\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pay my respects, but also give him a dose of reality! Fujimaru, this is how we say it in the pirate world!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &quot;Shut up, you bearded freak! The old need to retire! &quot;</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Eric Bloodaxe:</strong><br> Gi, gi, gi...Ga, ga, ga...Not giving it to you! It&#39;s mine!</p><p><strong>Eric Bloodaxe:</strong><br> It is...mine...but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Eric Bloodaxe has been eliminated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, that&#39;s odd. He vanished, but there&#39;s still a Servant response...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? It&#39;s gone. Hmm, since coming to this era, I&#39;ve been off my game.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, the equipment&#39;s not in the best shape. It&#39;s going to be a little hard to track you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are no more Servants on that island,and those pirates from before are all gone.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I see. Then how about we go on a treasure hunt?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you think there&#39;s treasure, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? ...It would be interesting if there was one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you consider it rationally, there shouldn&#39;t be.... Though it would be fun if there were.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey! Over here! I found something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? You did? Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> See this ship? It&#39;s probably the one that king was on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, can you find out?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need. It&#39;s a larger version of the ships the Vikings used.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Therefore, it should look like something out of the 9th century...but it&#39;s good as new.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It does not appear to be...a treasure.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sure it is. You guys wait right here. If this is a Viking ship, I&#39;m sure it has one\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Found it. Treasure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A book?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> When sailing, Vikings record everything from starting point to destination using pictures and glyphs.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Coast shapes, shoal spots, current traits, and paths\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If they appeared here out of the blue that&#39;s one thing,but if they sailed here...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yes, I smell fresh ink! This must be the chart for this island and it&#39;s surroundings.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There&#39;s no better treasure for us since we&#39;re about to set sail into the seas, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You have a good point. Captain Drake, well...You seem violent, but you&#39;re actually pretty pragmatic.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Impressed? Now, how about that trip around the world?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll think about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> After this battle is over.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I see, I see! With you guys, our strength would be a hundredfold! We&#39;ll depart after restocking food and water.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now, time to return to the ship!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, are you sure about this? By correcting this era, the memories of us\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not a problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...As her memories disappear,I suppose the problem itself will be gone, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I forgot about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, Senpai...Were you really planning on sailing around the world?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh, please stop teasing me!</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now, according to the Viking map\u2013there&#39;s an island to the northwest.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Considering our speed, it&#39;ll take about 10 hours. If we can catch wind, maybe even less.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can have the glyphs analyzed. Doctor, I&#39;m transferring the data.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Very well. One book shouldn&#39;t be an issue over here. That said, I&#39;d like a summoning point established soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hope there&#39;s a Leyline on the next island.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, you scallywags! Time to set sail!</p><h2 id="section-4-lightning-and-goddess" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-lightning-and-goddess" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Lightning and Goddess</h2><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> (Pant, pant, pant...)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ugh, no good.

Perhaps Miss Drake can detect changes in the wind due to differences in temperature and currents?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What&#39;s this &quot;Miss Drake&quot; business? You sound creepy when you put it that way, Mister Scholar!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> S-Sorry. Please excuse me, Drake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru. What Drake says may be correct.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your current location has obvious different temperatures and currents than the previous island.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With a little more time, I&#39;m sure we can determine exactly where you are.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! There&#39;s a ship to the northwest!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, what flag?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> A pirate&#39;s flag I&#39;ve never seen!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So, an enemy! Mash, Fujimaru, get ready! Time to get to work!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Captain Drake! Here we go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, this side&#39;s taken care of.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This side as well. They were below average in combat power.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss, here&#39;s their Jolly Roger.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm, it doesn&#39;t look familiar. Mash, do you have any ideas?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a famous flag, it might be in our records. Doctor, can you look into this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay. You&#39;ll have the results right away.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, then I&#39;m advancing this ship. If this chart is right, the island should be in sight soon!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. This island is way bigger than the other one. That&#39;s why we were able to locate a Leyline.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sending you the coordinates, just follow them for now. But be careful...I&#39;m detecting multiple life-forms.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that. Drake, we&#39;d like to head this way. Would that be all right with you?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I was thinking of going in the same direction as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll depart. Let&#39;s go, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This place is huge...Hard to imagine it&#39;s an island. This wind is amazing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...All true. Master, doesn&#39;t this feel like the time we were in\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rome?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I think it&#39;s a bit like when we were in Rome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> France?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe it&#39;s closer to Rome than France.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master,we&#39;re almost at the designated coordinates.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...What the heck is that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That\u2013appears to be a skeleton,but something is slightly off.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Dragon Tooth Warriors. Soldiers forged from dragon fangs. Fujimaru, dispose of them.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle has ended, Master. Creating terminal point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Huh? Something just...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, just my imagination. You can start setting up as usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Very well. Now, then\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> \u2013All right, everyone. Time for a little history lesson,courtesy of yours truly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right now, you&#39;re in the middle of the Age of Exploration.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Many things were imported from the East, and Europe started advancing into the new land, fighting to gain a foothold.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of many things imported from the East were spices. Nutmeg, cloves, and peppercorns...or pepper.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pepper was necessary to help eat decomposing meat. In this era, it was more precious than gold.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Case in point. I just transferred a pepper shaker to you. What do you think would happen when you hand that to Captain Drake.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Try it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Seeeeeeeeriously?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She collapsed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She passed out.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Amusing, right? Oh, and be sure to retrieve it. We shouldn&#39;t aimlessly disrupt their economy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In the meanwhile, the summoning circle is up. Use it to your heart&#39;s content.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Summoning circle confirmed. Terminal point established.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, and yes...I got a hit on that pirate flag from earlier\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s the flag of the legendary \u25A0ate, \u25A0\u25A0 of the &quot;\u25A0\u25A0. &quot;In other words, those pirates are \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0 called \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor? Doctor, the communications are acting up\u2013Doctor!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve lost contact. What on earth could have...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eek! An earthquake?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Get down. It&#39;s a big one!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It settled down. Master, are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No injuries.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seems that way. Thank goodness. How about you, Drake?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That was a breeze compared to a raging ocean. But I&#39;m worried about my ship and crew. Can we go back for a bit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do that.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The summoning circle has been established,but communications are still cut off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should move away from here, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? Hey, what&#39;s wrong? Something up?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss...The ship won&#39;t move.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> The ship, Boss! The ship won&#39;t budge, not an inch!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Sorry,but could you guys wait a second?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> No good, it won&#39;t move. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the ship itself.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s stuck like something&#39;s anchoring it real tight.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What on earth is happening? Fujimaru, this is your specialty, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A type of Magecraft?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A type of Bounded Field?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I believe that is correct. It looks like a Bounded Field has been drawn all around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Its rank is low enough for Demi-Servants like me to escape...But I can&#39;t say the same for the ship.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unless we take down whoever is creating this field,I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll be stuck here forever.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What are we gonna do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Search and destroy. There is no other means of escape.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, if you say so then it must be true. Men! Stand your ground!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Behave and stay put. The real fight&#39;s gonna be above sea. Don&#39;t be wasting stuff!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Boss!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This is rather dull. That fortress earlier was completely empty, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To begin with, it&#39;s mysterious that artificial structures are on this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But that pattern...Could it be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmmm? Is there a hole in that mountain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go inside.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Is this what you call a dungeon? Oh boy, the pirate blood in me is heating up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait! We have no idea what the scope of this place is. I suggest we retreat at once and\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The way I see it, retreating&#39;s not gonna change a thing. That&#39;s what it means to stay on my ship.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Leave behind that goodie-goodie old self, Mash! Now, onwards! Treasure awaits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think we&#39;re rushing it too much...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> See, they&#39;re here. Let&#39;s clean this up quickly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean...Seriously!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Right or left...My gut says left!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Should we trust her instincts?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so...But Captain Drake is a first-rate pirate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She must also have keen intuition.... P-Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Remember where the entrance is?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve recorded everything just in case. Not that I&#39;d ever forget...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a matter of going back the way we came. Getting separated along the way would be a bigger problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh I know. Master, let&#39;s hold hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a disaster if we got separated here. Holding hands would prevent that from happening.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s embarrassing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have to...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm...I understand how you feel,but this is no time to be embarrassed, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we get separated,we might be wandering in this maze until we die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may be a bit awkward at first,but better safe than sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you embarrassed too, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...N-No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s fine. I feel...Slightly embarrassed...I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, we have now just proven that holding hands is necessary.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you&#39;ll excuse me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That reminds me, back then\u2013You held my hand like this, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, it feels nostalgic. Even though not much time has passed.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmmm? Hang on a moment.... I smell something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Blood.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Well, with my job I&#39;m used to smelling stuff like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look, the drops form a trail.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Looks like the wound itself wasn&#39;t that bad. A flesh wound.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s our only clue. We should follow it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The blood trail stops here. I guess we&#39;ll have to give up tracking it further?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not necessarily. Master, please stand back.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This is great. I was getting bored of dungeon-crawling anyway.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take a break and light our guns up! All right, bring it on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Well, fighting these non-humans, including the bones back there, means I now got some more great tales to tell.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, even these things die when you shoot a lead bullet through them. I learned something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, normally that wouldn&#39;t have any effect. It&#39;s because you possess the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think it continuously grants your wish of,&quot;Whatever it is, gunfire is effective. &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh, is that what it is? So, I guess I shouldn&#39;t wonder about when the Wild Hunt is happening then.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hey, it looks like they&#39;re here again. I thought you wiped them out...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh dear, isn&#39;t this just troublesome. What do you wanna do?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Hmmm. If you want to rampage, then be my guest?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Let me warn you...I don&#39;t like breaking a sweat. So, I&#39;m not helping you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmmm...It&#39;s not like we&#39;re lost in here,but I&#39;m still getting all kinds of bad vibes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bad vibes? What about you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting bad vibes, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. If both you and the captain say so,perhaps we should be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I sense an encounter!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Encounter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hmm...What on earth could we encounter inside this dungeon, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re expecting to run into[\u2642 a cute girl /\u2640 a cute boy]...</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> !!! Stop right there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Seems my hunch was right. Something&#39;s headed our way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...a Servant!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Die.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s huge! What on earth is this thing?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Me...Asterios...Kill...All...You!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Another Berserker, like Eric the Bloodaxe King! Guess there&#39;s no use arguing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, please be careful. Asterios is his lesser-known, original name\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> People more commonly know him as the &quot;Minotaur. &quot;He&#39;s one of the monsters from Greek mythology!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This labyrinth is his territory. Retreat is not an option.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That was close! Wait...No way!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...gi! Uh...uhh!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You&#39;re still alive after eating all those bullets? Talk about gluttony!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Pro...tect!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s time to bring out the culverin cannons! If we blow his head off, he&#39;s sure to go down!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now\u2013give Davy Jones my regards!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Hold up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no...Two Servants?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All right! All right! I guess I just have to go with you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Do whatever you want with me! Just hurry up!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Asterios is near death. He wouldn&#39;t be much use to you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Besides, if we take too long, he&#39;ll die and then the labyrinth will collapse on you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013We should hurry back. Leave the navigation to me.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Umm,I&#39;m sorry. Do you have a moment?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What is it, Miss Lame-Shield? Let&#39;s hurry up and go where &quot;he&quot; is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> L-Lame!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey brat, don&#39;t talk to us like that. You&#39;re the one getting rescued.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a way to talk to a grown woman.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> \u2013Some nerve. Wanna sub in for the goddess statue at the ship&#39;s bow?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Goddess statue? ...I&#39;m not really sure what you mean,but I AM the goddess, Euryale.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Wait, you chased after me not even knowing that?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Obviously, you wouldn&#39;t have anything like me,a full super idol, on board your ship.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You should at least remember my name, sheesh. Where are you from anyway, third-rate pirate?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Y-You little brat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want to clear something up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve misunderstood.</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Huh? What? Wait...Why, you&#39;re a human.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Hm? Hmmm? Are you the Master of &quot;that thing? &quot;What brings you here?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> No, before all else, if you&#39;re the Master you must discipline your Servants!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that perverted Servant anyway? You can&#39;t find something that disgusting, even in Greece!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Umm, excuse me\u2013It&#39;s not like we were chasing you!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Huh? Then what on earth were you doing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We are\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Are. You. Serious\u2013! You guys are so misleading!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look who&#39;s talking!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You trapped us inside a Bounded Field. Wouldn&#39;t it be natural for us to assume you&#39;re our enemy?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Guh...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Ahh, Asterios! You don&#39;t have to move.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You&#39;re tough. If you just stay still, you won&#39;t die.... You won&#39;t die, right?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Urm.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to worry. These guys aren&#39;t associated with &quot;him. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Pardon me. We were a bit shaken up as well. Asterios over there is the one who put up the Bounded Field?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. But it wasn&#39;t to trap you guys in. It was to prevent the enemies outside from entering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. But, unless you remove this field,we&#39;ll be stuck in here...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Mmm, fine.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Well, that didn&#39;t take a lot of convincing.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s a simple numbers game.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> There are only two ways out of here. Either Asterios dies, or we remove the field.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;d rather remove the field.... It&#39;s much better than being alone.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...I see. Yes, I like you.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But, you&#39;re so cornered that you had to put up this &quot;Bounded Field&quot; thing, right?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> \u2013It has nothing to do with you.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It does! See, I love interesting things.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> A trip around the world. Adventure. Dungeons. Monsters. This world has so many interesting things to offer!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Interesting things tend to be more valuable. That&#39;s how this world works. That&#39;s why I became a pirate. But that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, you smell like money. That&#39;s why I&#39;m bringing you aboard my ship.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> H-Hey! You can&#39;t just decide that on your own! Board your ship? You must be insane!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I already decided! I&#39;m not leaving Asterios behind!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Who said anything like that? Asterios over there is coming with us, too.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So much guts and power...And, quite a hunk if you look at him long enough!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;d be the laughingstock of pirates if I let this talent slip by! Hey, would you like to be a bodyguard on my ship?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you refuse, there&#39;s nothing I can do. Hey you, will you die unless you&#39;re cooped up inside a labyrinth?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s not really the case.... Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Of course I am. I&#39;ll pay you well, too. Oh, but don&#39;t expect any benefits from us.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s not the issue. I mean...As long as you are okay with it.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Asterios. What do you want to do?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Go.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> If...you...go...me...follow. Alone...lonely.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I see. Very well, then...We&#39;ll board your ship.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Ah! But I&#39;ll need you to prepare my own room. I have no intent of showing my face to common pirates.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Of course, your ship has a bath, right? Oh, and also\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai! ...It seems things went quite well without us interjecting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Happily ever after.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All&#39;s well that ends well.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Good point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, a Minotaur was supposedly a monster. One that devoured children offered up as sacrifice, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale :</strong><br> Put me on your shoulders, Asterios. Oh my, you&#39;re even taller than my &quot;loser sister. &quot;</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uh...Uh...Uh...</p><p><strong>Euryale :</strong><br> Ouch! Crouch down a little more! My head&#39;s gonna hit the ceiling!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uuu...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahahaha!

That ship looks familiar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That flag...I know! Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash? Thank goodness, I finally got through!

Communications broke down and we couldn&#39;t hear you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, yeah. That flag is\u2013a legendary Jolly Roger. Belonging to the most infamous pirate in history!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Most infamous...In history...It can&#39;t be!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right! Blackbeard! His True Name is Edward Teach! Be careful, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Unfortunately, Doctor, it&#39;s too late.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ah! It&#39;s him! It&#39;s him! The pirate who was chasing my ship!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I found him at last. I&#39;ll blast him beyond the horizon!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> (...Sneak sneak...)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey, are you listening you hairy oaf?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Huh? Sorry, my ears don&#39;t pick up old-hag noises!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> \u2014Say that again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What. Did. You. Just. Say?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I- just- said! I didn&#39;t ask for old hags! What&#39;s with them useless huge knockers? Is that a joke?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Guess scars are okay? Blade scars are great,they turn me on. But, the age, that&#39;s a slight problem.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If it were only half that, you&#39;d be in my strike zone. Du&#39;huhuhuhu!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss? Boss? She&#39;s dead...(Inside. )</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s hopeless. She&#39;s all frozen up. I was the same during my first encounter, too.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m surprised I survived it.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Mm-hooooooooo!

There was a turbulence in the magical energies that shape the Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Could it be...teleportation? Then, he&#39;s a Servant that Blackbeard summoned to begin with!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant summoning another Servant...Is that even possible? By BLACKBEARD!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Perhaps he has a Holy Grail, or something similar in nature in his possession?</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong><br> Kiiiiiiiillll!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Kyaaa!?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Di...e!</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong><br> Yooouuuuuuuuu!!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What are you doing, Asterios?

LOLOLOL</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Eric Bloodaxe was the lowest rank among us Blackbeard Pirates!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Plus he smelled bloody all over, his armpits reeked, and his feet were greasy.

What kind of Servant are you?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Well, if you&#39;re defeated by something of this caliber,then it&#39;s not worth &quot;letting you live. &quot;</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Do your best, young girl.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right!

Looks like they&#39;re trying to flee.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Hum. She shoots as well as I do.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> As expected from Francis Drake,the first person to survive a trip around the world.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> \u2013Though, doing nothing does make me feel bad. I guess I&#39;ll help a little bit.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Anne, you&#39;re so earnest.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Huhuhu. In the end, it&#39;s only a show, Mary.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> My bullet. My pride. Our name is Freedom. Catch the prey like a falcon...Just kidding.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh...What happened?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Seems like an explosion in the bilge!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Impossible!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Dammit, they&#39;ll catch up. No, at this rate, we&#39;ll sink before that!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go fix the hole in the bilge! You guys keep the ship balanced!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> That&#39;s unreasonable, Boss! Everybody, stop the boss!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hey, let me go, idiots! If I don&#39;t go, who will\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The ship...He&#39;s lifting it up!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We recovered!

I don&#39;t care about the old hag,but please leave Missy Euryale and the Holy Grail behind!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want the old hag&#39;s body at all,so at least give me Missy Euryaleeeeeee!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Our main objective is the Holy Grail, Captain. Euryale is just a bonus.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Huhuhu, this captain isn&#39;t listening at all.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You said you&#39;re Blackbeard, right? Someday! For sure! No matter what! At all costs!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take your head and tie it on my bow! Remember it, idiot! Dumbass! You...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oooh, I can&#39;t think of any more insults!

But the wound he got during the battle against us opened up.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s for being reckless before making a full recovery!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What kind of moron keeps swimming while carrying a galleon! You dummy!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...This kind...of...moron.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something to brag about!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Did you forget your role of carrying me on your shoulders?

Nothing can make it budge.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Although I think we&#39;ll be able to fix the ship,thanks to Asterios bringing it to the coast.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t have enough materials. Looks like this island has a forest, so I guess we can make some lumber out of those trees.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s better to slay the forest monsters first? See, over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. I&#39;d like to reassess the situation.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh boy, when we&#39;re done, I want to ask you something...How to sink that huge fool of a pirate!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There wasn&#39;t much difference in the ships&#39; performance. The issue was the thickness of their armor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Our cannons had no effect.... Doctor, please tell us about Blackbeard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have some knowledge,but I&#39;m sure that Chaldea has more accurate data.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, Blackbeard was a pirate born 100 years after Francis Drake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His real name was Edward Teach. He was one of the pirates who ruled over the Caribbean.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His policy was simple. He would kill anyone who showed resistance but spared the rest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Based in Nassau, he rampaged through these waters on his beloved ship, from Virginia to Honduras.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His beloved ship...It had a name, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. It was called &quot;Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge. &quot;He had 300 men on board.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He built up a large fleet centered around his flagship,and reigned as one of the strongest and worst pirates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, he ended up losing his head.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Even a pirate as fearsome as him...Unbelievable...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t say any more. He&#39;s a Servant I&#39;d rather not remember.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I erased the image of that thing from my brain. What? Has something happened?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yeah, pirates are all trashy, but he is the trashiest of them all. The King of Trash. That&#39;s what he is.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Sorry, everybody. I apologize on behalf of all pirates.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re also a victim, Drake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know how you feel.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Fujimaru...You&#39;re a good [\u2642 guy /\u2640 girl]...You&#39;d be a great pirate!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> As a pirate, I can guarantee it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, are there any stories that could give us hints on his Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are a few...Among them, I think his ship has the highest possibility of being a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I was monitoring the magical energy levels during the battle, and his ship gave off the strongest readings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Captain Drake&#39;s &quot;Golden Hind&quot; too. Maybe it&#39;s the Holy Grail, but it showed magical energy similar to a Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even then, that ship was superior...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm...I don&#39;t quite understand,but are you saying that my ship is no match for his?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems that way...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a second...Nothing happened before you blasted the ropes and made your escape?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did you inflict any damage to their side\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, at that time...I believe we defeated Eric Bloodaxe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right! Yes, we confirmed that he vanished completely on our end as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Ah, so that&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Simply put, Blackbeard&#39;s Noble Phantasm\u2013is that ship, &quot;Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s a Noble Phantasm that powers up as&quot;his subordinates get stronger and stronger. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The moment you guys defeated Eric, the magical energy surrounding the ship clearly weakened.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After that, it stayed in that state until they lost sight of us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words\u2013the more Servants it carries,the stronger it becomes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There were five Servants including Blackbeard on that ship. With Eric defeated, it&#39;s now four.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Maybe the reason he sought Euryale...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...is because he gets stronger with her on board. His personal interests also play a part, of course...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If only we could pull those Servants away somehow...But I&#39;m sure it will be hard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;ve never encountered a hindrance like him before. He knows nothing and still disturbs our Holy Grail search!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Well, we pirates are all like that. We take treasures from people, no matter how good they may be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...If it&#39;s hard to pull them away, we&#39;ll have to slay them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And we better do it fast, before Blackbeard becomes even more powerful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Offense is the best form of defense. Hmm? I&#39;m picking up couple life signatures on that island.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like they&#39;re wyverns, be careful!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh, so this is a dragon? It really looks like a lizard!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> More precisely, a wyvern. We fought many during our battles in France.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Something the matter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no, I just thought of something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Use the dragons as materials.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fix the ship with the dragons.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s it, Master!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re going to fix my ship with dragons?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Oh, that&#39;s brilliant. If you process it,dragon scales are even harder than steel.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> We need someone really strong to process it,but...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uuugh...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re here. Can you handle it?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like it won&#39;t be a problem for Asterios. I&#39;ll try to strip their scales immediately!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Yeah, I feel reassured with this guy! But don&#39;t overdo it like before!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Hey, let&#39;s eat first! After that I&#39;ll let you meet our blacksmith!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Y\u2014Ye-ah...We...eat food...together.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmm...These scales are tough, but we still need more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Technical Director Leonardo. How many more wyverns do we need to slay to fix the ship?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Considering the size of the scale and how it shrinks while processing...I think 30 more wyverns should be enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In that case, we should be able to do it in a day once we found a nest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go hunting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then it is a quest.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We make pretty good adventurers, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hmmm, maybe I should change the ship&#39;s name to the &quot;Golden Dragon&quot;...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...All right. Uh, chop that up...and add some spices, and saut\xE9...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh no,we need to add some vegetables too, right?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Will that grass there do? There!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Okay, now put it in that box...And stir...Done!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Darling, I made you a boxed lunch!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait. Do you even know how you made that?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s just grilled meat with some plucked weeds sprinkled on top, you can&#39;t call it a boxed lunch.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say that. Please try some? It&#39;s tasty, you know?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> How are you so confident in a boxed lunch with that kind of quality?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You&#39;re asking so much, darling...What?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm...Something&#39;s coming. Looks like a Servant.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Is it friend or foe?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If she&#39;s cute, I don&#39;t care which side she&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s nothing. Don&#39;t scrape me on this tree trunk! Owww!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Actually, this is perfect. I&#39;m getting bored of this island already.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even know why we were summoned here<br> in the first place!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. Friend or foe, we need information.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s not like I want to leave or anything, though...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Speak for yourself. These last two islands are way too boring.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> And there weren&#39;t any cute girls?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, there weren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m really sorry.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I forgot that I rely completely on you,and that I leech off you for everything.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, please don&#39;t swing me arouuu\u2013</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ah...(slip)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wha\u2014at\u2014!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Eek! Darling, I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You think apologizing is enough?! You moron!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Be careful. I am picking up multiple wyverns. And...What is this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s tiny. Maybe like a familiar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a familiar on an island like this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm...Something different about it, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Looks like it doesn&#39;t have that much magical energy,so I don&#39;t think we need to be too concerned.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing. I just had a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> And, with your height, I&#39;ll be hitting my head on the tree branches.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Please, duck a little, or hold me in your arms.... Yes, that&#39;s way better.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Geez...Comfy enough there, Princess?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Princess? I&#39;m a goddess.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Please, stop. Stop! Don&#39;t chew, don&#39;t chew please! Not food! Not food!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just now! I think I heard a voice...Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s rescue them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wyverns!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Good timing, I&#39;ll turn you into materials!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the last one. But, I thought I heard someone&#39;s voice earlier...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I am not seeing the usual mess wyverns left behind,maybe they ran away?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? That weak magic response I mentioned...Seems like it&#39;s right near you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well? Can you find it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, not really...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hrrrnngh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think you stepped on something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I heard a strange voice.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? I stepped on something? Let&#39;s see...Could it be this?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What is it? A plush toy? It sure is ugly. Even I can sew something better.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s it. The magical energy I mentioned is coming from that thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this the familiar you mentioned? ...Hmmm, it doesn&#39;t look like anything but a plush toy.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Kyun kyun\u266A</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...I can feel a really creepy gaze.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Me too.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What? You too? So I&#39;m not the only one...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Stare...)</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> (Stare...)</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> (Stare...)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Wah!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hyoo? What are you doing?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai. The unknown object is talking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Talking plushies are rare.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see, it does look pretty rare.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a plush toy, okay? Though I do look like one. I&#39;ll admit that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s dissect it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dissect...You&#39;re right. That&#39;s a pretty good idea.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It really talks. Are you friend or foe?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013Huh? That&#39;s my line!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I think we can be friends. We have no intention of harming you.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ah\u2014!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A Servant?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait! They&#39;re not enemies...Pugyuru?!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Did you cheat on me again, darling?! Despite! Having! ME!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m at the limit of my patience! Come on, it is time to punish you!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What? How am I the first to get hit? Wait! Wait! There&#39;s a misunderstanding!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I really was staring at their breasts and legs, but...I&#39;m sorr...Pugyuru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What? Don&#39;t interfere in a lover&#39;s spat! It is a civil matter! Civil court!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, what do we do? This is the first time I feel at a loss.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, no...When we met that Black-whatever earlier,I felt like this too. One bad feeling after another.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In this era,everyone has a few loose screws!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s your True Name?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm? ...Wait, you&#39;re human? Are you a Master?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Fujimaru...Right. Okay, finally we meet a respectable Servant.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see...This summon is for a Holy Grail War, right? Are we friend or foe? Is the busty girl single?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t casually mix questions up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re here to fix this era.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re here to repair the world.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...I see. Now I get what&#39;s going on, more or less.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh...So this world is endless? Eternal?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if this era is,I believe it will still vanish if its outer frame is gone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if that happens, we&#39;ll be defeated,and human history will come to an end.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Poo...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, you were thinking that you wanted to live in this world forever and stuff, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh! Guessing what&#39;s on my mind...It&#39;s like we&#39;re in love...How lovely...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> If I have to live in an eternal world,I&#39;d prefer to die in the hell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Those two people...Or one person and one thing? There&#39;s something weird about their relationship...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What is it? No matter how you look at it,Darling and I are the best couple of the Servant world.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hmm, from a third party viewpoint, it must look strange for a woman to be talking to a plush toy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see, each person has their own tastes. That aside, could you help us?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm, what do you think, Darling?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> You ask what I think, but with humanity about to be exterminated. We have no choice but to help, idiot!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not an idiot! I&#39;m a goddess!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Quiet you useless goddess! (Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap! )</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ah, it&#39;s DV! This is what you call domestic violence, right?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> This is just too much, I can&#39;t see the end of it...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...By the way...Lady Goddess. What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> What? I&#39;m Artemis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What?!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> A super famous one just appeared...She doesn&#39;t seem to be faking it...What do we do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How about that plush toy right there?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> He is my love, Orion.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...I knew that he was going to be summoned, and got worried so I came as his substitute!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I, I see...By lowering her divinity, it allows her to be summoned as a substitute Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t previous cases...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m Orion. When I was summoned into this Holy Grail War, I got turned into a strange creature.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Strange creature...Strange...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I am crying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Live strong.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;m infinitely close to useless. I can&#39;t live unless I totally depend on her for everything.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hehe. You can depend on me even more, Darling.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I want to be independent...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s fight together. Artemis, Orion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, we need dragon&#39;s scales to fix our ship. Let&#39;s pool our strengths and gather them!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Okay, this way...Dragon nests are usually hidden in bleak places like this.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling, so smart\u266A</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s just like Orion said. I am picking up multiple dragons nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay Servants. Let&#39;s go hunting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Finally, we&#39;re halfway.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So hot, so tired, so exhausted, need booze...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> The captain is such a slacker.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Well, you&#39;ve been leaving everything to Asterios for a while now...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. I give orders, and he acts.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hey, hey, Darling.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Are there male and female wyverns?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> They have parents, but I&#39;ve never heard about gender.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Parents?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yes. Their parents are not of the wyvern subspecies. Wyverns are born from their superior species, dragons.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I guess they&#39;re more like minions than children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So...For example...They are way bigger than wyverns?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Indeed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And if we keep slaying their wyvern minions,they will become excited or angry?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Well, they probably won&#39;t forgive us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A boss battle is a given.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know nothing about such givens!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s apologize.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we apologize, will they forgive us?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> The dragons basically think we declared war against them when we entered their territory in the first place.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s useless. Go, fight now. Like a hero, do your best\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Understood. Mash Kyrielight\u2013heading in!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve fought dragons before,but it never gets easier.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Why do I have to take part in this?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh well, you have enough scales now, don&#39;t you? That was quite fun.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s easy to sit back and see how things pan out,but it&#39;s also fun to see people struggle up close.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Thanks for the god-like opinion. You sure got noticed by someone bizarre huh, big guy?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><h2 id="section-7-queen-anne-s-revenge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-queen-anne-s-revenge" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge</h2><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Improvements and repairs complete! We fixed the hole in the bilge. No leaks found.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We also equipped the ram with the leftover scales. Things are going to get interesting.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Now...Asterios! Time for your unrivaled strength and dauntless courage to step up!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uh...Uhhh!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Looks like your wound has healed. You really are durable.

Incredible!</p><p><strong>Pirates:</strong><br> Damn, Asterios! There anything you can&#39;t do!? We all admire you...Uh, as men...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...Huh.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, men! Time to take our revenge on Blackbeard! Don&#39;t worry, this time we&#39;ll be fine!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Believe in me and follow me!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hey Darling. Let&#39;s do that. The you-know-what.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That thing where I stand at the bow and extend both arms.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yep, you can do it. By yourself. Be careful of seagulls.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You won&#39;t hug me from behind? So cruel!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask a plush toy for the impossible!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Hey Boss, what is that thing?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s a harmless creature. Just let it be. Fou is way cuter anyway.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou said, &quot;Don&#39;t compare me to that. &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh my...I&#39;m sorry, Fou. Indeed, you have more class and flair.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...All right, we&#39;re setting sail! Ring the bell!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! I&#39;ve already found a pirate ship!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take them down to liven things up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be entering unknown territory soon. We won&#39;t be able to use the Vikings&#39; map anymore.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be an adventure, so that&#39;s fine! The problem is Blackbeard&#39;s ship.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even with just four Servants,it&#39;s still a formidable amount of enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we make a bad approach,their guns and cannons will destroy our ship.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;re way faster though. Should we use the ram to charge in?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These seas don&#39;t seem to have many obstacles...We&#39;ll probably encounter them from afar like last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we were to have any chance, it would have to be during a Wild Hunt...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They don&#39;t notice us, we notice them, and then a storm hits at the perfect time\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s wishing for too much, really.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...How about we shoot arrows before they notice us,to confuse them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;ll certainly be confused,but there are still Servants on their side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That woman with the musket is especially problematic. If it turns into a gunfight, I don&#39;t think the confusion tactic will work.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Why doesn&#39;t someone board their ship and cause a riot before the ships collide?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Are you stupid? How would someone board their ship before our ship...Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Heheh. I am a goddess. But...I was technically summoned as Orion.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> So I have control over Orion&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, now I remember. Orion can walk on water.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You&#39;re the son of Lord Poseidon so you can walk on water...Wait, that&#39;s it?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Look, even I wish I had slightly cooler powers!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I mean, walk on water? What am I, a water strider or something?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Aww, you&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re sad and gloomy! I just want to squeeze you tight! Squeeeeeeze...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Mash, comfort me in your bosom!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I refuse.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Ngyuu...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, we&#39;ve been dealt a new card. Now, I have something to ask you guys...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Great. I&#39;m excited but have a bad feeling...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Woo-hoo-hoo! Heh, heh, heh...Hohohohoho...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Gasp! Awww, once I wake up,my harem is nothing but a distant dream.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The only ones here are our teacher and the yuri couple in their own little world.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Well, I happen to like yuri myself. Since sleeping alone is so lonely (glance)</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> \u2013Incredible, Anne. This captain wants to sleep with us.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> For someone with zero popularity,or rather, negative popularity, that&#39;s rich.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Actually, we didn&#39;t appear in your dreams, did we? If so, I&#39;ll just have to hit you with my gunstock till you forget.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Heh heh. So many heroines populate my dreams, I just don&#39;t remember.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> \u2013Incredible, Anne. The captain has lumped us together as mob heroines.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yes\u266A Let&#39;s kill him, after all\u266A</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Huh? Hey Captain, your enemies are here. That Francis Drake.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Euryale-chan is here? And the Holy Grail, too!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Most likely. I have to say,they&#39;re out for revenge a lot earlier than expected.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yahoo! Prepare to receive them!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Well, I guess we don&#39;t have a choice. Let&#39;s get to work.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Yeah, you&#39;re right. But I&#39;m pretty sure I opened a big hole in their bilge...What did they do?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013What&#39;s more important is how they&#39;re coming back after such a severe beating.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...They have something up their sleeve. But I have nothing to do with it.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Mmm? Are they planning to charge straight in without a plan?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> A reckless and self-destructive assault! Pretty unusual for that old hag.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Not exactly, Captain. Isn&#39;t the one at the bow the Servant you&#39;re infatuated with?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Euryale-chan? What&#39;s this about my Euryale-chan? Bow! Is she at the bow?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Yay! Euryale-chan! Come spread your arms at the bow with me\u2014</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Tch, I missed. No, I feel like I missed on purpose.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I felt like my arrow would be soiled...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but can you try to aim and shoot him down? Your arrows are disposable. Deal with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t get him now, Captain Drake and I have to fight that Servant in close combat.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I know. But instead of hitting Blackbeard directly\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s better if I hit someone else. That&#39;s how my &quot;arrow&quot; works.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Some of them are boarding our ship.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t many, so let&#39;s defeat them quickly.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey comrades! If you get hit by Euryale-chan&#39;s arrows I&#39;ll kill you off immediately, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> ...Huh? Captain, what on earth are you saying...</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Ow?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> ...Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...Ohhhhh!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> You scum...You scum! For Lady Euryale&#39;s sake...Die!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Huh? Captain, why did you...Ugh...Ah\u2014</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> See, now your blood got my shirt all dirty. Remember,DEATH is what happens when you&#39;re careless!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> A-Aye, aye, sir!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Missy Anne! Missy Anne!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t call to me in that creepy voice. What is it, Captain?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Gigigi. Say, why don&#39;t you go pew pew at them!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t for the disruption, I would have done so.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Countin&#39; on ya\u266A</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see...Don&#39;t tell me this is all you got, old hag-chan?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> \u2013Of course not, pervert captain.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Above!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hi\u266A</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> An angel...There is an angel here...There is an angel...But who are you?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> A Servant!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> I am Orion! I&#39;ll kill all of you\u2606</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Gyah!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go! You keep shooting there, Anne!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Gotcha!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Geez. They sure work their plush toys really hard. One, two. One, two. One, two.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost in cannon range! Grab all reserve ammo from the arsenal!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Sure, sure, show me where it is, please...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hai, yaa! Take that!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Gyah!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Dammit! Missy Mary! I&#39;m counting on you!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to say it!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh human, I&#39;d be troubled if you get too close to me.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Figures. Since you&#39;re probably an Archer from the looks of it!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Exactly! Bye-bye now!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> Hey, wait!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Artemis! Tell them we&#39;re ready!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling! Understood, Captain!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right! Helmsman, hard to starboard! Get a good angle! We&#39;ll rip through its belly with the ram!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Gotcha, Boss! Hard to starboard!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What is that small thing.... That small thing...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Oh...My...God! Everyone, hold on!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> It&#39;s gonna explooooooooooode!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Explode?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ah, so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on! Dammit!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> E-Explosions! In the ammo hold!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That went well, Darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I-I thought I&#39;d die down there! I lit the fuse and ran! Ran at full speed!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong><br> You bastards\u2013!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> How rude. Fine, I&#39;ll play with you for a while.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Don&#39;t play, shoot her down! ...Though, what a waste it will be.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Okay\u266A Oh, and Darling, I&#39;ll punish you later\u2606</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> C-Captain! What should we do?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> C-C-C-Calm down! Everybody calm down! Extinguish the fire first! Now everybody strip down\u2013</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Regain your sanity, Captain.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> W-W-W-W-What? I&#39;m super sane, you know? More importantly, Missy Anne, take off your pants too\u2013</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong><br> Next time you say that, I&#39;ll shoot.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;m sane again!

The Holy Grail...is mine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...the Holy Grail!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Edward Teach was...the Singularity for this era?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I screwed up...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now all that&#39;s left is...you. Francis Drake.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Sheesh. The plan was to let the Holy Grail fall into an idiot&#39;s hands, causing this era to fall apart.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe that a voyager who exists only to stop that would appear. The Naval Chart of Mankind sure walks on a tightrope.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stop him, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Defeat him, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I won&#39;t allow it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Just kidding.

I guess you can call me a Trojan Horse?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Granted, I&#39;ve never seen the real thing.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Let her goooo!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Whoa! You&#39;re a dangerous one!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Minotaur\u2013huh? A combination that is truly beauty and the beast.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Still...This old man hasn&#39;t fallen so far as to be defeated by an incompetent Berserker!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Tch! ...Hey now Captain, are you still alive?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hee hee hee. It&#39;s the power of love! ...Just kidding. That was my final blow.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Tch! But, I&#39;ve achieved my goal. Too bad, pirates.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Dammit, he had a ship ready! Cheeky bastard!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Should we go after him, Darling? I&#39;m sure we could</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> We can&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> ...Why not?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Because right now,both you and I are Servants.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hmph. So you think that I&#39;d lose, Darling?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That&#39;s a Lancer. On top of that, if he&#39;s Hektor then he&#39;s also, you know...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> The great hero of the Trojan War. The greatest conflict in which the gods of Olympus intervened.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Even the omnipotent, invincible hero Achilles took many years to defeat him.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> If you were in your &quot;true body&quot; sure,but with my power as your base it&#39;s a bit much.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hmph. Surprisingly calm.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Not really. Everybody&#39;s mad right now. One of us has to be calm, or it&#39;s hopeless.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re so cool! Darling! Embrace me! Do what you want with me!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Like I said, don&#39;t ask the impossible from a plush toy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Blackbeard&#39;s subordinates...vanished.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They were created by Blackbeard&#39;s magical energy. Now that the Holy Grail is gone, they can&#39;t be maintained.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Even though he himself still looks full of energy.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hey everybody, it&#39;s almost time to say goodbye! Don&#39;t you dare think you won, old hag, got that?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. The more you talk, the more you sound like a sore loser.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hurry up and begone, Blackbeard. It must be hard for you to even breathe right now.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Damn you. You&#39;re being nice to me...Makes my heart flutter.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I&#39;d say, &quot;Marry me, I&#39;ll make you happy&quot;...I mean, you&#39;ve been single ever since you were born, no?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had enough of you nitwit! Hurry up and kick the bucket!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Hahaha, what a nice insult!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;m satisfied, it&#39;s time to die! But this time I won&#39;t be beheaded.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Because I am the greatest pirate after all! I am a merry pirate, and I will die as one!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I regret that I wasn&#39;t able to create my harem,but I still had fun. I approve!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Oh, old hag. Don&#39;t you need a story route where I revive as a rival?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be great if I revived with a line like&quot;It&#39;s been decided, I&#39;m the one who defeats you! &quot; or something?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Not needed, useless. Come on, snuff it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mash told me about your final moments. Make sure to take that head with you!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Okay, well that&#39;s all fine! Hah, that&#39;s all dandy and fine! Fandy and dine!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> The woman who Blackbeard respected most! The pirate who he yearned for most!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> She is present at Blackbeard&#39;s deathbed,and he keeps his head intact!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Then, farewell humanity! Farewell pirates!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And so Blackbeard draws his last breath! Haha! Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hurry up and die, Edward. In the end, both you and I are headed to hell.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we pay for our misdeeds with disgrace and shame like true pirates?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The ship will collapse. Let&#39;s go back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come, Asterios. Hold onto me.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...Eu...ry...ale...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><h2 id="section-9-tracks-down-the-dandies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-tracks-down-the-dandies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Tracks Down the Dandies</h2><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Excuse me. I&#39;m coming in, Master.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hey, what&#39;s going on? My beloved!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Lord Hektor contacted us. It seems he caught Euryale.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I see! I see, I see, I see! All right!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We were told, if we offer up Euryale,we can obtain even more power.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Me! I&#39;ll be more powerful than anyone. I&#39;ll be invincible! Wouldn&#39;t that be amazing?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, very. I think that would be extremely amazing, Master.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I like your smile. Your smile is like the sun. It never fails to enrich my heart.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, but you seem a little tired. Are you all right?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been the ship&#39;s power source for so long. I want you to tell me when it gets too hard.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> See. Just a bit. If it is just a bit,I can think about letting you rest.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> T-Thank you very much! But it&#39;s fine. Your words alone are enough for me to go on.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Perfect\u2014yes. That&#39;s how you should be. The woman who will become my lovely wife.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> As soon as Hektor returns,let&#39;s go search for &quot;you-know-what. &quot;</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I mean, where the hell is it? You still haven&#39;t received any oracle?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Correct. I assume that as soon as Lord Hektor returns,I will receive an oracle showing where we must go.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What&#39;s with all these problems...They always keep dragging me down...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;m really sorry. I don&#39;t mean to blame them.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But, I have the right to receive these oracles too. Why is it only you\u2013?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...? What is it, Master?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Nothing. Haste makes waste I guess.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, that must be it. For now, I&#39;ll believe in your oracles, and do my best as the captain.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, that is what we hope. Let&#39;s go welcome Lord Hektor.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We members of Argonautai are undefeatable heroes. There is no way a random group like theirs can win.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right! We are the strongest! There is no mistake. Our strength is unparalleled!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We have the world&#39;s greatest, strongest hero, and witch on our side! Oh, and there&#39;s one useless woman, too.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmph, to think someone would vow chastity to someone like Artemis and reject my invitation like that.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Should be a shark&#39;s meal by now. Serves her right.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now, everybody! Prepare to depart!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We shall obtain the &quot;Ark. &quot; Even the golden ram pales in comparison to this treasure.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> With the Holy Grail and the &quot;Ark,&quot;I will reign as the king of Okeanos!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Full speed ahead! Hey, lookout! Pay close attention to what&#39;s ahead!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Once you see that ship, call out!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Boss!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...That tiny ship is faster than it looks.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> With their head start, unless they stop,we might not catch up...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uh, uuh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, she won&#39;t die.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Eu...ryale...I...will...save you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I understand how you feel. But for now, concentrate on healing your wounds.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> No!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll save her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help too.</p><hr><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Do...You...Promise?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. Drake is sailing the ship at top speed with that very same thought.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Uh.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! A pirate ship&#39;s headed our way!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Damn, at a time like this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s take them out quickly.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Crush!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...I&#39;m sure Blackbeard said &quot;Hektor. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, then that spear is the sword &quot;Durandal,&quot; later inherited by Roland, one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or rather, the base for that sword.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a miracle that Asterios didn&#39;t die. That&#39;s how powerful that spear was.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I wonder what Hektor plans to do,with Euryale.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Human trafficking...No, it can&#39;t be.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...But he sounded like he had a clear goal in his mind from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. From the start, Servant Hektor had his eye on Mistah Blackbeard&#39;s Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Blackbeard seemed wary of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, why &quot;Mistah&quot;...</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I can understand the Holy Grail,but why Euryale?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not about bolstering forces. Euryale herself isn&#39;t that powerful of a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think what makes her special is the fact that she IS a Servant.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, in the past, we met &quot;another&quot; her...No, maybe her...Big sister, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, we met a girl summoned as a Servant despite being a goddess.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Euryale is not a hero,nor is she someone whose name is engraved into history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She was treated as a goddess in Greek mythology. &quot;The one who flies far&quot;\u2013that is Euryale.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or she was a monster. The middle sister of\u2013the three Gorgons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The youngest is the famous Medusa,I can see her being summoned into a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, not Euryale. She is just a goddess,an idol of ideals, and undoubtedly weak.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For her to be summoned as a Servant is a strange phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Though some other Servants are just as peculiar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Usually it&#39;s hard for Divine Spirits to become Servants. Unless there is a really special case.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In addition, a pure god becoming a Servant is something that isn&#39;t supposed to happen in the world of Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Really? Who&#39;s like that?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Us, take the hint.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Basically what you&#39;re saying is, Euryale isn&#39;t good enough to be kidnapped for her fighting prowess?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s not a reason for us not to save her. Plus, she&#39;s a great singer.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I like great singers. It is a very important role for sailors, right men?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye! It heals our rotten heart!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There ya go. . Don&#39;t worry, big guy. Nobody on this ship wants to abandon that girl.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is something the matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No. Captain Drake&#39;s personality is just very complicated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s hard to explain, but she reminds me of you. Facing difficulties. Helping those around her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is an advantage, a merit, that humans possess. But why\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is Francis Drake a villain? As she is now, and back in history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She is such a good person, but her actions are that of an outlaw.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t understand this contradiction well\u2014</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ah, dammit. It had to happen in a time like this!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Everybody tie yourself to the ship! There&#39;s a storm coming!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> What should we do, Boss?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Shut up, I&#39;m thinking! Um...The distance between us and that ship is about this much...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This storm has a small range...Perhaps...Depending on distance, it&#39;ll be a tailwind for them...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...The ship&#39;s armor is...Oh, that&#39;s right. Since we used THAT for repairs...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You guys! Good news and bad news, which do you want first?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see. Bad news first...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This Hektor guy who kidnapped Euryale probably won&#39;t be affected by this storm!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If we sit tight, he&#39;ll probably pull so far away that we&#39;ll never catch up!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> ...Um. So what&#39;s the good news?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Rejoice, guys! We&#39;re gonna raise all sails to and cruise at top speed in this storm!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have another exciting ride through the seas!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> How is that good news!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Shut up or you&#39;ll get the boot! Anyways, get moving!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mash, Asterios, and Lady Artemis,please help us too!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Of course Fujimaru, too. Okay, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...L-Let&#39;s do our best!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Come on, keep going!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! Our ship won&#39;t last much more!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Really? But it is pretty stable, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> What? ...Now that you mention it, indeed...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Did you forget? We used a bunch of dragon scales when we repaired this ship.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;ll take more than this to sink us! This is no sailboat!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Got that? Now, charge forth!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss, there&#39;s a ship up ahead!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Did we catch up!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> It&#39;s not them. That ship is bigger than ours!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s similar to Blackbeard&#39;s ship!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Yes, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> It looks pretty beat up. That&#39;s all I can tell in this storm!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Give me the telescope!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mm-hmm.... What is that, a ghost ship?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A ghost ship?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow, it&#39;s even more like an ocean adventure novel now! So much excitement, I want to turn this into a book!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hah, ghost ships are usually just vessels that were abandoned for things like mutiny and starvation.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Hmm? Some light...is headed this way...Eek!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Drake made a really strange sound just now!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Her voice was like a maiden&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh, what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nothing, I just was shocked by Drake&#39;s voice. What happened, Drake?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> F-Forget about my scream, look to the bow! Enemy attack! Ghosts are attacking us!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh...Thank goodness we beat them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Drake, are you afraid of ghosts?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Can&#39;t a pirate be superstitious!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Sure. There&#39;s no problem. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, the storm is winding down. Hang on just a little more.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now, according to my calculations, it&#39;s almost time.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Why me? Does your Master have the same tastes as Blackbeard?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh no, my boss may be a worthless womanizer,but he&#39;s not brave enough to hit on a goddess like you.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say your very existence is important.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Even if you&#39;ve fallen to the level of a Servant,Divine Spirits normally don&#39;t appear in this world.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...So, now that you&#39;ve appeared,it&#39;d be a waste not to use you, right?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> As a Divine Spirit, I&#39;m low-tier, you know?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> They&#39;re probably not expecting any combat skills from a goddess like you.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> &quot;Offer a god as a sacrifice. &quot;This is the only thing we expect from you.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh? Offer to whom?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> To the world. We can&#39;t tolerate being part of an endless spiral.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Even if we take a little risk,we have to blow this world to pieces.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Who do you serve, exactly?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Mm...That&#39;s a good question. Who do you think this old man is serving!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...In any case, asserting principles of anarchy is sure to meet interference in the end.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Honestly, whether or not they&#39;ll come is like fifty-fifty.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Hmph, it must have been because Asterios was there.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> What? That is &quot;the Golden Hind! &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Okay, we caught up. Can&#39;t waste anymore time, let&#39;s ram into them!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Are you ready, guys!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Yup!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Good! Let&#39;s land a hard one on that guy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we are ready to fight too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, Asterios! Calm down, calm down! Relax, please!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Euryale!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Nope, no good. Can I let him go?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Letting him go now is like painting a target for that spear. Come, there there. Now, there there.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Uhhh!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Fine! I got it! Wait 10 more seconds. 10, 1, 0!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You cut corners, Darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Thinking rationally, there was no way a plush toy could stop a Berserker...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You should&#39;ve realized that sooner!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Asterios!? I-I will go with him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s rescue Euryale!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s help Asterios!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Geez, what a pain in the ass. Oh, brother\u2013But this old man...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Is really good at defense to the point even I hate it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> These pirates are way more tenacious than before!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Give...Baaaaaaaaaaack!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Geez, that damned Minotaur! Fine, I&#39;ll give her back!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Aughh!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Eu...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Nothing like the predictability of a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you\u2013!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Demi-Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hero Hektor\u2014who do you serve, and what are you after...I&#39;ll have you tell me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Huh. Pretty interesting, little girl. This old man would rather not take a young life...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> But the world is cruel like that. Let me show you what that truly means!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Tch, she&#39;s surprisingly tough! That&#39;s why I can&#39;t stand heroes with shields!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Haaa!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> \u2013Well, this old man won through persistence. Dear me, I&#39;m tired, so tired.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! A ship up ahead! I-It&#39;s a ship that I&#39;ve never seen before!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Did you say a ship that you&#39;ve never seen before?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Yes, thanks for that! My current &quot;superior&quot; is on that ship.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Oh...Uh!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now, time for the counterattack. This old man&#39;s gonna be serious about it now, yeah?</p><h2 id="section-10-world-s-oldest-pirate-ship" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-world-s-oldest-pirate-ship" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: World&#39;s Oldest Pirate Ship</h2><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! They&#39;re approaching!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Cannons ready! Fire!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Not good, it didn&#39;t do anything! They deflected every single cannonball!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh, each and every one! Hmm. You know what?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If we wanna burn down a ship, we should just ram our own burning ship into them, yeah?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013All right, found them. Okay, Heracles.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Let&#39;s send those scrappy masses gathered there a hearty greeting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? They threw a boulder?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Move...away!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Nuaaaah!!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hahaha! He managed to barely catch it! That barbarian over there...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What is that? Is it a werebeast?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s probably Lord Asterios. Otherwise known as the Minotaur.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The tragic child born from the union of a divine bull and a human.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So, a poorly created human! A comical creature fated to be defeated by a hero!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The&#39;re really short on talent aren&#39;t they? Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hektor! You seem to be in trouble. Need help?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Yes, Captain. I&#39;m so sorry. Could you help?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No problem, Hektor!

The problem we have here is more important.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s defeat the remaining enemies first. We have to hurry!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Ohhh. Is that the Argo, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Argo? Is it possible?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Orion, by the Argo,do you mean &quot;the&quot; Argo!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yeah, you got it right, dammit. Those are the real &quot;Argonauts! &quot;</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> The ship of adventurers who set sail seeking the Golden Fleece. Likely mankind&#39;s first and strongest pirates.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Though unlike our brabuster, generous, big-sisterly, tigbits Captain, their captain will make you think lice have better personalities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The leader of the Argonauts...Jason.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ja-so-n!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> So disrespectful, Minotaur. My name should be called with awe and worship!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> But, as you are an ugly monster fated for death,I shall grant you forgiveness.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Now, come at me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> What do we do, Captain? Should we crush them here and now?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Of course, just like heroes of justice. We will fight and win head-on!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Indeed, justice makes me feel so good!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I recommend you withdraw. It&#39;s impossible. Since we already have Euryale, it&#39;s better to retreat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Powerful heroes were gathered as Argonauts, but...There is one exceptional hero among them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I know. That Berserker, presumably...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. The greatest hero of Greek mythology. He who overcame the Twelve Labors. \u2013Heracles.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You can&#39;t win! As if you could! Heracles traveled everywhere, fought every monster.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> He was undefeated, and ultimately rose to become a god!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> He&#39;s not like you second and third-raters. You trash mobs are fated to be ripped to shreds!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Of course, as a summoned Servant,he does lack two things.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Intelligence and dignity. He&#39;s just a vicious stray dog now. Serves him right, I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Now...Hand over Euryale.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...If you do, I&#39;ll stop sending Heracles to attack you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What do you say, you Master-ish entity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I refuse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Shut up.</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Haha! I see, I see!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You are very courageous! I really, really, really like you!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> And you have such a cute Servant, too! Good, very good! You&#39;re just like a hero!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Wooo! So cool!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> \u2013Geez, so cocky for the likes of trash. Can you perish now, Servants and all?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Medea! My beloved Medea!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Are you calling me, Master?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You know what I want, right? I want you to kill them and break them into tiny pieces!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Just like you did to your little brother! Ah, it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I already repented! I will never betray you again!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Little brother, in pieces? Sometimes you say strange things, Master.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But that&#39;s right, Lord Jason was like this. Now, you are like this.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s why details don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m the first disciple of Hekate, goddess of Magecraft\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Princess Medea will make your desires come true.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, I know this. It is called DV.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It&#39;s worse than DV. Neither of the two are looking at their partner!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> And Heracles! You shall go too! I&#39;ll be looking after you two from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He sends his wife to the front line, but doesn&#39;t fight himself. Um, Master. Maybe he is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The scum of mankind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A trivial boss.</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hah, that&#39;s a funny joke.... Kill them all, Heracles!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> To think there&#39;s someone even scummier than me. This world is so big, and Greece is so tiny.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Look at their numbers with just the Dragon Tooth Warriors...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Familiars created from dragon fangs...That&#39;s Hekate&#39;s specialty, all right!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That sparkly kid,is that really Medea?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird...I thought Medea would look more, like...Ill-fated, or maybe gloomy...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I still have a lot of materials. Will your ship sink from the Dragon Tooth Soldiers&#39; weight before you are defeated?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Take that! You&#39;re so damn annoying! Get lost!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Euryale! It&#39;s you they&#39;re after! Stay with Asterios!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Rest...assured...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do that! Stand back...Wait, are you getting in my way!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The second wave is coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So they have strong bodies and minds. All right, I&#39;ll go too, Master.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m counting on you, my Medea. Although Heracles alone is enough, with you victory is assured.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Here she comes. Princess Medea, a mage known as a&quot;witch&quot; even in Greece, where Magecraft was mainstream!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Witch of Colchis, whose skills rank among the top five in the world!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I will offer everything, dispose of everything,and sacrifice everything.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Even without reward, even gaining nothing. That is the reason I left the island.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Prepare yourselves, everyone!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m not the best at fighting,so please forgive me if I make you suffer...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Impressive. Just what you&#39;d expect of someone who&#39;s already crushed two &quot;eras. &quot;</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this rate, we&#39;ll make it somehow!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank goodness she really is a lousy fighter! But the problem is the other one!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t take them down by myself. Heracles\u2013it&#39;s your turn, brave one.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Don&#39;t...Leave...My...Side!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What are you saying? Of course I&#39;d flee without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s Heracles, the strongest hero in the history of mankind. He&#39;s like a walking disaster.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> A man who walks into an avalanche is no hero. He&#39;s just a dimwit.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve seen many dimwits.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...I...know.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> In that case\u2013</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> But...if...somebody...needs...to. Then...I...will...Because.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I...am...monster. Killed...many...children. Many...Many...Many...Many!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> So...I...will...go! I...Fight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> You...Won&#39;t...Have...Her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...uh...aaaaaaaaaaargh!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did we defeat him?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s no good! I&#39;m still picking up a reaction!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh, effort, effort, so much effort! So, I&#39;ve got some news for you guys!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> \u2013About Heracles...He&#39;s immortal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Heracles&#39; most famous legend. The Twelve Labors given by the gods.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Since he&#39;s overcome them all,he&#39;s been granted that many lives as a reward.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> In other words, you have to defeat him eleven more times. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way...Eleven times...For real?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-Impossible. That is just cheating!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Retreat! Everyone, retreat! Come on, back to the ship!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Great! This is the best! Using overwhelming violence to oust enemies!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> This is the real pleasure behind &quot;justice! &quot;Don&#39;t you agree, Hektor?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hmm...well, at least Heracles makes it nice and easy. Ah, and here&#39;s the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh, so this is the Holy Grail. Well, I suppose this is sufficient to be king of this world.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I only regret that the previous owner was a lowly pirate. Now all I need is Euryale and\u2013&quot;the Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll have everything I need!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ark?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did he say &quot;the Ark&quot;!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Captain, you sure it&#39;s okay to disclose that?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, Hektor! They wouldn&#39;t have the slightest clue!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Not of this world! Not of this era! Not of our true intentions...Nothing!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Well, I think the lack of understanding is mutual.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Now, Heracles! Finish them off!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Augh!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Crap!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> \u2013Oh, this is not good.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> !?

Don&#39;t kill that woman!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...GRRRRRRRRRRR!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios...it&#39;s no good now. We&#39;re no match! We can&#39;t win against him!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s no good. It&#39;s no good, but why...Asterios!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> !!! ...Ugh!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Kill-ed. Killed...killed...killed! Killed...innocent...children!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Father...told me...to...do it. Father...called me...monster!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> But...it...was...my fault. I was sure...my heart was...monster.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> But...you...called my name. Everyone forgot...my...name!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Then...I need to...return. Even if I&#39;m not forgiven...Even if I&#39;m still ugly...</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I need to...return to human!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Ugh!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Quite considerate of you, Ox-head! Medea! Go retrieve Euryale!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Just what you&#39;d expect of the Minotaur. Though only once, he ultimately pushed Heracles back.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Come over here, Euryale!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ???Why go so far to protect her? You&#39;re a pirate knowing no love nor romance, only desire, so why?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hah! You don&#39;t understand? I may be inhuman, but this girl&#39;s beauty is true!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Her soul is especially beautiful. She&#39;s not blind like you. It&#39;s obvious we would protect her!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Euryale is our treasure! I won&#39;t let a guy like that get even a hair from her head!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Drake!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Euryale, please stand back! You&#39;re the one they&#39;re after!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What are you doing, Heracles? Medea?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh, dammit! Why is everyone else but me a hopeless imbecile?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Heracles, finish off that ox-man! But don&#39;t lay a hand on Euryale!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Ugh...uh!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You can&#39;t even obey me now, you piece of scum? U-Ugh\u2014Whew...Hektor!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Yessir.... Time to do it?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Yes. When things don&#39;t go exactly as I plan,it irritates me.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stand my own allies&#39; disorderly conduct. If you can&#39;t follow orders, you&#39;re worse than the enemy.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Gotcha. ThenReleasing Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, this doesn&#39;t look good. Asterios, dodge it!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...No. I can&#39;t...handle...that one.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> If you want to stop this, you should bring either Achilles&#39;or Aias&#39; shield! &quot;Durindana Pilum&quot;!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> No! Asterios!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Good job, Hektor! That damn ox-head is going to hell along with Heracles!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> But, Heracles will revive immediately. Now, quickly get up and grab Euryale!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You died once, and ox-head also died! You should have come to your senses a little bit!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh no.... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna happen, Captain.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> That bastard Asterios is still &quot;alive. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> W-What!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Amazing. He&#39;s the enemy, but I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> He clung onto Heracles,fully aware that the spear would pierce through his body.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> By doing so, my spear becomes a chain,and ties Heracles down.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> He really wants to let Euryale escape,even if it means receiving a fatal blow.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Mas-ter! Master! Master! MASTER!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re retreating!</p><hr><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Y-Yes! Thank...you!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Master...you too...called my name! Everyone...did not hate...monster!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> First time...For the first time! I was...happy!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I am happy...to be...born!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Take care of...Euryale! All...thanks to...Euryale\u2014</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> I...love...Euryale!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;re setting sail! Fire all the smoke bombs we have on hand!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> You can&#39;t. Asterios is\u2013</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Shut up, tiny goddess! Try to understand his feelings!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> No matter what anyone says,you&#39;re Asterios and nobody else.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> And so\u2013I beg of you. Don&#39;t regret not fully turning into a monster.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Because that&#39;s a very noble thing.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> ...Right. But...after all...a monster...need proper punishment.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> W-What the? Hektor, go after them!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I am very sorry, but that&#39;s impossible. They sunk into the ocean, with my spear and all.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Asterios likely won&#39;t let go of Heracles until he dies\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> By the time Heracles returns,they&#39;ll be long gone.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Dammit. Medea!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Y-Yes?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Can you track them?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes, I analyzed their Magical Circuits on contact. I can find them as long as they&#39;re somewhere in this world.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Can you find the location of the &quot;Ark? &quot;</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Even without searching for it\u2013They will find it for us.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That captain, Francis Drake, was a hero who greatly expanded this world at some point. She is a Pioneer of the Stars.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Since she pioneers this world,she is sure to work miracles.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If we nip that in the bud, this world will truly be whatever you desire, Lord Jason.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Master. We can capture Euryale at any time.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> As long as those two Servants exist,we will be invincible\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> We obtained a fragment of the Holy Grail. With it, we gained the right to rule over this naval world.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I see! I get it, we just have to use them! That&#39;s my Medea!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You indeed are not a treacherous witch, but the wise wife of a hero. That&#39;s what you should be called, my beloved Medea.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Treacherous witch...Who are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hey, Princess. When are you planning to tell him the truth?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Must I tell the truth? The world is going to end eventually.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> For just these seas to last forever...That&#39;s something HE would never allow.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If so, it&#39;s not a bad thing to let him bask in blissful thoughts until the end, is it?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...If you say so,then this old man will keep quiet.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, please warn Heracles. It seems he does have a brain after all.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> He probably knows that Euryale is the key. That&#39;s why he tried to kill her, to fend off destruction.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to believe he has &quot;a brain&quot; in that state...Fine, I&#39;ll give him ample warning.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh, brother. This old man wishes he was summoned to a proper Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> The Hand of the End has ticked forward again. One more push, and &quot;the order&quot; will crumble and fall.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> My beloved. Before then, would you please awaken me from my dream?</p><h2 id="section-11-lost-ark-of-the-covenant" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-lost-ark-of-the-covenant" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Lost Ark of the Covenant</h2><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> No sign of any approaching ships.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master. What do you think we should do from now on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> About that &quot;Ark&quot; they mentioned?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Steal the item they want.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So what exactly is this &quot;Ark? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, please explain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...The &quot;Ark&quot; contains the Ten Commandments that Moses, leader of ancient Israel, received from God.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> From a historical standpoint,it&#39;s a relic equivalent to that of the true Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Hmm. So it has no worth as treasure, then? What a pity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s what Jason and the Argonauts are searching for. I&#39;m certain that that&#39;s what he said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even with Mistah Blackbeard gone, the Singularity still stands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which means we should assume that Jason,captain of the Argonauts, is the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So should we steal the Ark first?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> The Ark, huh...How are they planning to use it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know. I have no idea whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Come on. You&#39;re not fighting on the front lines,at least make yourself useful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Oh, sorry, that&#39;s not what I meant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What I found incomprehensible was the actual concept of using the Ark.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The concept itself was incomprehensible?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way to use the Ark?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They say the Ten Commandments are sealed inside. Whoever opens it will be punished...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Basically it&#39;s one of those &quot;don&#39;t open it&quot; fables. Just like Pandora&#39;s Box in Greece.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which is why I can&#39;t even begin to imagine why they&#39;d want to find it and use it. It&#39;s just stupid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. Doctor, you&#39;re afraid of imagining the worst-case scenario.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> You&#39;re too cautious. Either that, or you&#39;re too smart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mm...I admit that I&#39;m too cautious...But you&#39;re all so carefree because you don&#39;t know about the legend of the Ark.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Okay, okay, no more fighting. In any case, it&#39;s better to find this Ark thing for sure, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry up and get it. If it comes to it, we can smash it out of spite.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Captain, have you been listening? &quot;The Ark&quot; activates when it&#39;s broken or opened.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And the effect is...well, it is divine punishment. At worst, the surrounding area will be reduced to nothingness.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> What the hell? Why did ancient kings possess something so dangerous!? Were they all idiots or what?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t look at me, I got nothing to do with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m for going after the&quot;the Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...I&#39;m just not sure how to fight the Argonauts. More specifically, how do we fight Heracles?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Heracles...Even as a Berserker,his powers as a great hero weren&#39;t diminished.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It was only because Asterios held him down that we were able to flee to safety.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Seems like he died.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, most likely.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> \u2013How foolish. We just called his name. That&#39;s all it took for him\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> With just that, he felt he could die for us. Just because we called him &quot;Asterios,&quot; not &quot;Minotaur. &quot;</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That&#39;s the reason he risked his life to protect us...It was just that pure and simple.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He had no regrets.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Without him we all would have died.</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Perhaps. But it might have been better if we were cleanly wiped out then and there.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Asterios died, and Heracles still lives. With just that, it makes it all seem so hopeless.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Sigh. Geez, this had to be the one time where my &quot;loser sister&quot; wasn&#39;t summoned.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That Heracles...He has to die like ten more times?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s eleven times. But perhaps he died once when he got pierced by the spear at the end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In that case, it&#39;s still ten...Not much difference.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss, sorry to bug you when you&#39;re thinking. But a ghost ship has appeared!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Huh? Oh fine, let&#39;s take our frustrations out and crush them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right. We&#39;ll get going soon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? But we have no strategy yet...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh please, we can just play it by ear! They say you can&#39;t deal with trouble till you run into it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Besides, if we waste more time here, they are just gonna come after Euryale again after they grab that &quot;Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Anyway, lay forward!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If what Jason said was correct,neither of us has any leads.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Though, we have a better chance because I&#39;m here instead of their incompetent captain!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s true that Jason&#39;s worthless. At least, you&#39;re probably a better captain.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> He&#39;s not a bad guy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> He&#39;s just utterly worthless with a horrible personality,and now he&#39;s getting cocky because he&#39;s gained some power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I don&#39;t understand which part of him is &quot;not a bad guy. &quot;</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Just because you say someone&#39;s not a bad guy,that doesn&#39;t excuse everything they&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Right. Okay, I take it back. He&#39;s not a good guy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> He&#39;s a scumbag with a terrible personality, but has power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing good about him whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> See, that&#39;s what I meant. In that case, I win.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Treasure always ends up in the pocket of the decisive one. That&#39;s how this world works!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If Heracles is unstoppable, then bring it on. Only humans can challenge the impossible.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;re greedy and shameless. We live by dreaming of achieving the impossible!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Since you&#39;ve come all the way to this era,that makes you just as big a fool as me, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not as much as you, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you think of me, it&#39;s promising.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Damn right you are! I&#39;m a merchant. I only go after the best goods!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Both in France and in Rome,that&#39;s how it was for us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Senpai. With you as my Master,I feel I can take on any opponent!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anchors aweigh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Set sail!</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Full speed ahead then! Get to it, men! Sound the bell!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The &quot;Ark&quot; will be ours! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Land ho, Boss!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, get us closer! ...So, what&#39;s your take, scholar man?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...This island&#39;s no good, either.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No magical energy detected. We have several weak responses, but based on recorded data it&#39;s probably just monsters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bust. On to the next.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You heard her! To starboard! Avoid that island!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye, aye!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...This island&#39;s also no good. That&#39;s three in a row.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m happy the charts are filling up,but nothing looks like a clue.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No Servants around, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Even if there were, we probably wouldn&#39;t find someone who could put up a fight against Heracles...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, to the next island!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...You know, something still bugs me...About that Medea, I mean.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medea...You mean the young girl standing next to Jason, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She looked too sweet to be called the Witch of Colchis...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yeah. If Medea transformed into a Servant,she&#39;d definitely be her grown up self, right?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Medea was betrayed terribly by Jason,so she massacred his wife and children for revenge.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...No matter how you look at it, they should&#39;ve started killing each other the moment she was summoned!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> That&#39;s awful!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> At least Orion only flirts and randomly messes around with goddesses and other people&#39;s wives, right?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yeah, it&#39;s better to break those off clean...Pugyuru!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Dammit, that was a loaded question!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. It could be that she&#39;s the young Medea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,but this is before she became a witch...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, when she was first learning Magecraft at Colchis Temple...Before she became &quot;Jason&#39;s wife. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That explains the way she looked and acted. She hasn&#39;t experienced Jason abandoning her yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder if we should pity her...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Impossible. Once you become a Heroic Spirit,a slight difference in age won&#39;t alter your memories.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sure she knows the outcome of her story with Jason. So why does she act like that...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious she&#39;s &quot;acting oblivious. &quot;It&#39;s a pity, but also horrifying.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Unlike you, she&#39;s not someone who can look a person in the eye and pick a fight.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> What does that mean? I ignore humans because they don&#39;t matter to me, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I know this! What they call that cold attitude of hers...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That explains Blackbeard&#39;s obsession...She&#39;s obviously a tsun\u2014</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Boss! A new island!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right! We&#39;re sure to hit the jackpot this time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru. Which side you betting on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Jackpot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Miss again.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I see. Well, I&#39;m for\u2013</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Eek!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> An arrow in your head, Darling? Jackpot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we&#39;re under attack!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh, an arrow, you should duck.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling, hey, hey, does it hurt? Does it actually hurt?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It hurts a ton, idiot! G-Gotta pull it out!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> D-Damn...Hey, I just realized...I can&#39;t touch the top of my head!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A shocking fact has just been discovered, Master!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Pull it out! Come on, hurry up!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> A-All right. Artemis will do her best! Ready, set, twirl...twirl!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Ouch ouch ouch! Just hurry up and pull it out! You&#39;re ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, this makes me so happy! It&#39;s not every day people think I&#39;m useful like this!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ugh...You&#39;re making me cry...What an admirable maiden&#39;s soul. (Tears)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Wish you&#39;d make expressions like that under different circumstances!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh...oh. I thought I was a goner...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Huh? There&#39;s something on it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s a message. Let me see...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Somebody open it, please.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> All right. Let&#39;s see...Oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Artemis?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hehehe, it&#39;s from someone I know. So stiff, as usual!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Perhaps because she&#39;s a pure girl who&#39;s never known love?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Someone you know...Um, who would that be?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Uh...This girl is\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All right, it&#39;s delivered.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Whew. They&#39;re sure to notice the letter on that arrow. It&#39;s not like they have any clues right now.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Now they&#39;ve got to come to this island...They should. But there is an off chance...Or not?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh no, I&#39;m getting anxious. If they don&#39;t figure out that arrow, we&#39;ll never get another chance!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s about time the Argonauts found us as well.... And if things don&#39;t play out, it&#39;s checkmate.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...This is bad. It&#39;s super bad. I&#39;m getting horribly anxious. I need some medicine.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Shut up.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> They have no will to fight? Impossible. We&#39;ve already confirmed\u2013They&#39;re determined to fight.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We&#39;re sure they&#39;re seeking the &quot;Ark,&quot; right? Otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t be going island-hopping.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> They&#39;ll surely come. The world will be destroyed if they don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Of course my calculations are correct. Oh, but...No, I just can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stand the anxiety, the feeling that everything is futile!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I know, my love...May I hold your hand?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;d like your soft hand to guide me to tranquility. Desperately.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> May you? You may not. So no.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;d like an explanation as to why I may not, but...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> They&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, hey, are you really going to meet HER?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Huh? Of course. She&#39;s a hunter who worships me.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> I have to give her my blessing.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hmm, well, okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Orion, is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I mean, well, Mash. Artemis is the goddess of virginity.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, Darling. Virginity? You&#39;re embarrassing me.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, but I do run simulations every day of the day I lose my virginity, you see?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What&#39;s that now?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Um, um. Orion first slams his hand against the wall. Like, SLAM.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And then he whispers in my ear, &quot;Am I not good enough? &quot; In a husky voice! And then, and then\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but Fou&#39;s gaze makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! I could just cry!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Her head is just way too romantic...If &quot;she&quot; saw that, I think she&#39;d faint from shock.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Um, Artemis?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And then, and then? ...Wait, what&#39;s with that look?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Enemies are here and I&#39;d like you to defeat them...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Oh, dear me! I&#39;m so clumsy! Tee-hee\u2606</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Okay, we&#39;ll defeat them quickly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Combat complete. Let&#39;s keep going, Master.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Wait!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Are you the one who sent that arrow?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Are you foes of the Argonauts? Or have you already given up and submitted?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Foes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t given up.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Very well! Then I shall show myself!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Forgive my questioning. I already knew the answer, but I still had to ask.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We are, after all, the last hope in these seas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Atalante, I presume?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Indeed. My True Name is Atalante. A hunter in service to the goddess Artemis.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Oh, come to think of it, we ran into each other a bit in France, didn&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I was affected by Madness Enhancement back then...But this time I&#39;ve been summoned as a normal Archer.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> For now, I perceive to be on your side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much. My name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is my Master, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And the ship&#39;s captain, Francis Drake,and this is Euryale.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Yes, good to meet you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This harmless-looking plush toy is Orion,and the animal is Fou.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> A pleasure...By the way, Mash, why did you introduce me with Fou? Are we in the same category?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, this is Artemis.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Francis Drake, Euryale,Orion the plush toy, and Artemis, huh?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Artemis?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Yeees\u266A</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Mash, was it? You can stop joking.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Lady Artemis is the goddess of hunting and virginity. There&#39;s no way she could be summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Hey, Darling? Atalante doesn&#39;t believe me.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong with the goddess of virginity living for love? Right?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hah-hah-hah. No comment! No comment!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Huh? Really?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> It&#39;s true, Atalante. The hunter goddess who lives for love, that&#39;s me\u2013</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Artemis! Hehe!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...(Staggers)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m fine. The Holy Grail War on the great seas has strengthened my mind a bit...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> E-Even finding out the goddess I worship is hopelessly romantic won&#39;t be enough to break me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The wound&#39;s deep, be disappointed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hang in there, maiden.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> You don&#39;t sound like you mean it! ...Anyway, I would like to introduce you to another Servant.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> The Servant in possession of the &quot;Ark. &quot;In other words, the man the Argonauts seek.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The &quot;Ark&quot; is a Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Indeed. He was the first Servant summoned to these seas. His True Name is\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;ve been waiting a long time for you guys.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> David.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><h2 id="section-12-defeat-heracles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-defeat-heracles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Defeat Heracles</h2><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Normally I&#39;d hold a feast with food and drink,but first, let me explain about the &quot;Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Fine with me. I like men who get to the point.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Thank you. I am David, King of Israel. The &quot;Ark&quot; is my Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...King of Israel?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Israel? You mean...</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Yes, that King of Ancient Israel. Is there something on my face?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s nothing. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Psst! Senpai! I thought it was a perfectly valid question to ask. Let&#39;s hear him out for now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> ...Now, before I continue, it seems we&#39;ve been interrupted. While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s recover any edible meat we find.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Anyway, back to our discussion.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The &quot;Ark&quot; is a third-rate Noble Phantasm. If you make someone touch the box, they die\u2013That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Could it be used for evil? ...Yeah, probably. Strictly speaking, it doesn&#39;t belong to me.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a contract that God gave to humanity. It&#39;s not easy to steal, but it&#39;s bad news if stolen.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, you can&#39;t shift it into spirit form.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I&#39;m the Servant summoned to this world along with the actual physical &quot;Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Even if I die,it will remain as long as someone possesses it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It is said that inside the box lies the stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not all. That thing brings literal &quot;death,&quot; not just metaphorical.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Anyway...After I heard from Atalante that Jason was after the &quot;Ark&quot;...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I hid in the forest with her, and waited for an opportunity.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> We waited for properly summoned Servants,like you.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I was summoned as part of the Argonaut crew,but I didn&#39;t lose control of myself like Heracles.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Maybe because I never liked Jason in life, or because I was summoned as an Archer who can act freely.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Either way, once summoned,Jason immediately sought the &quot;Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> He kept saying that if he had it,he could be the king of these seas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is the &quot;Ark&quot; a representation of kingship?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hardly. It&#39;s just a relic I offered to God when I was a king.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a sign of kingship. It&#39;s simply something owned by a king.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...David, may I ask something?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Of course. Ask me anything.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> If I were to be sacrificed to this &quot;Ark,&quot;what would happen?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> If nothing else,that seems to be their goal...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Euryale, right? You were originally a Divine Spirit. If you were sacrificed to the &quot;Ark&quot;\u2013</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Yeah, this whole era would &quot;die. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sigh. I thought so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Details\u2014After the fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Like I said before, the &quot;Ark&quot;brings death to all things\u2013</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Sacrificing a soul that exists as a god, regardless of rank, would cause the box to lose control.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> The death of a god means the death of the world. The Ark is a disaster from that kind of era.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> If this was a normal world, it would only destroy the surrounding area, but, hmm...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> This is an unstable place that normally wouldn&#39;t exist,right? I doubt such a groundless world like this can survive.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Um, a Singularity, was it? The thing blurring the foundation of human history.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> This whole era will disappear without having to wait for its collapse.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> There&#39;d be no need to use a weird Holy Grail...or even steal mine, for that matter.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> They can use that box to sacrifice a goddess,and at that point it will all be over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Why does Jason want to destroy the world so badly?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Who knows? ...He may not even know himself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Somebody may have convinced him that all he has to do is offer Euryale to the &quot;Ark. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Either way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We know why they&#39;re after this Noble Phantasm,and why we absolutely must stop them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The question is how do we defeat them...By the way, David, is your class Archer?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Atalante is an Archer as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Talk about unbalanced. Four Archers, a Shielder,and one Pirate...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> We&#39;re up against Heracles, Medea, and Hektor. We don&#39;t have to count Jason, I suppose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is he that weak?</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> He&#39;s weak. Rather, he&#39;s never actually fought.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> He&#39;s a monster who formed the Argonauts with just charisma and eloquence, but he&#39;s no fighter.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> But I doubt having one useless member in their party poses any problems for them.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...They have Heracles, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple resurrections from the Twelve Labors. And above all else, his prominent combat techniques.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see how we can beat him.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> We, on the other hand, are full of fighters who specialize in long-distance combat.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> If we can get him to touch the &quot;Ark,&quot;we might be able to instantly obliterate him.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Would he touch it that easily?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It&#39;s a what-if. Even a Berserker can sense the magical energy around Noble Phantasms. You&#39;d never walk up to a bomb, right?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> If he had no choice but to touch it, then maybe...But how could we force that situation?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not just Heracles. Medea and Hektor also possess terrifying power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If all three attack at once,it&#39;ll be impossible for us to hold out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we could at least lure Heracles away from the others\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...How about we flee with the &quot;Ark&quot; in tow,and wait for an opportunity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, just go choke on an expired sesame bun or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> How about we hole up? Anywhere like that near here?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Nope. Some cramped pagan catacombs are all this island has.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Even if there were some kind of stronghold here,it wouldn&#39;t be enough to hold off Heracles.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hmm, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Fou, fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Fou? Huh, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have an idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh good, nice, great idea! You&#39;re just as reliable a [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman] as I thought!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That&#39;s a reasonable strategy. But, besides the Servants,Fujimaru would also be at risk.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Well, I guess that&#39;s life. The odds of winning usually go up with your life on the line.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite a gamble. If you fail, you&#39;re done. No turning back. A one-shot deal.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> So I guess the question is how the enemy will act.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Will Heracles head straight for Euryale?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Out of countless Heroic Spirits, Heracles is likely in the top tier.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Even though he&#39;s Berserker, I doubt he&#39;s completely devoid of intelligence.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> When he was fighting Asterios,he was dead set on going after Euryale.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s the reason Asterios somehow managed to keep up.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Berserkers are easy to lure. The one I can&#39;t get a read on is Jason.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> He impaled the enemy along with his own ally. Who knows what other cowardly tricks he&#39;ll pull off?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> No, don&#39;t worry about Jason. Trust me. I&#39;m sure he will act this way.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s true he&#39;s a coward, but, more than that,he places absolute trust in Heracles.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I like Fujimaru&#39;s plan. Count me in.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Count me in, too. Since everyone&#39;s betting equally,it&#39;s fine as long as one of us survives and wins it all.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...What destructive thoughts this guy has. Or is it irresponsibility?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> And you, Darling?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Are you expecting something from me, a plush toy?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It&#39;s Mash who has it toughest here. She&#39;s risking her life on the front line.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t Mash decide whether we go through with this plan or not?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll make sure that the plan Master devised succeeds.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s contingent on the Doctor&#39;s cooperation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor? You&#39;ve been silent for a while now. Are you listening?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;m listening. It&#39;s risky, but we don&#39;t have any time left. Count me in.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know when or if King David will fall into enemy hands. I&#39;ll provide all the backup I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s win.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><h2 id="section-13-betting-it-all" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13-betting-it-all" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 13: Betting It All</h2><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s the island.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Ah, I see.

Hear my song of love! &quot;Tri-Star Amore Mio! &quot;</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> It might be a waste to use my Noble Phantasm on such a disgusting idiot.

Well, gotta follow the captain&#39;s orders.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So you ARE thinking of running. Just as I thought. Men, are you all ready?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> &quot;Golden Hind! &quot;This is our last voyage, our final task as pirates!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The target is the Argo! The treasure they hold captive is the freedom of the seas!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have them pay us back in full! Ring the bells, brothers!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Aye, aye, Boss!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hard to port! Make a steady approach and fire the cannons and guns!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What&#39;re you doing? Hurry up and cut us loose!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> With so many Archers on their side, their attacks are that much more fierce.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Never mind the cannonballs...It&#39;s Atalante&#39;s arrows. We&#39;re the only ones who can block them.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Damn, how are they catching up! This is the legendary ship, Argo!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> It&#39;s in a different class from their mundane sailboat!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> The difference is in the helmsman, I guess. Those are the skills of one who has lived with the sea.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> They&#39;re fundamentally different from someone who just takes his boat out casually.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Damn...We have no choice. O Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;ve caught up with you, pretty boy! Let&#39;s see what you got!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You lowly scum! Go! Kill them!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s a Shadow Servant! Be careful, everyone!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh boy. What a rotten thing.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> ...But, I guess since you&#39;re relying on tricks like this,it means you&#39;re pretty much cornered, right?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> How dare you, you piece of...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Now, now, Jason was it? No need for such a scary face...Guess I really hit the mark, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s board! ...Then again, we&#39;re just all Archers.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> I&#39;m going. Being an Archer doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t handle close-range combat.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> In that case, I guess I&#39;ll go, too. If I die, I&#39;ll trust you&#39;ll take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight, here I go!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hektor!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Yes, yes, I know. All right, Medea.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> If the need arises, I&#39;ll be counting on you.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. It is my duty to protect our Master. I will look after him until the very end.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oooh, scary...Is this what they mean by &quot;naturally insane&quot;...Hm?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Hi, future [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl]. Your name was Fujimaru, right?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you&#39;ve come this far. It&#39;s truly amazing. France, Rome, and now &quot;here. &quot;</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I appreciate you coming all this way. I value that kind of perseverance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This guy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you know about Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Oh, my hunch was right, that&#39;s all. I&#39;m just a warrior who couldn&#39;t pick a Master to serve.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s see who can hold out longer. This old man is pretty confident in defensive battles.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> So\u2014Come at me with everything you&#39;ve got, brat. I&#39;ll show you how experience trumps youth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...This is Hektor, the hero of the Trojan War. We can&#39;t let our guard down. Let&#39;s take him down, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Dammit, this is it for me. Well, I did what I could.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> But at least I&#39;ll leave a parting gift. Euryale, offer your life\u2013to the &quot;Ark! &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> \u2013Yes, that is what I expected you would do.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> &quot;Eye of the Euryale. &quot;</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> Urgh...This old man&#39;s scheme...How did you see through it?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh, I didn&#39;t see through anything. But you killed Asterios.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> That alone was reason enough for me to pay close attention to you, old man.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> ...Pfft. I guess I&#39;m just not cut out to be a villain.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong><br> I thought I&#39;d at least go out big at the end of the world. But your hands are tied when the &quot;top&quot; is terrible.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Wha...Hektor!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Hektor has passed on, too. Lord Jason, what shall we do now?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Impossible to surrender or retreat. I&#39;m a mage who can only heal and defend.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Now, what shall we do?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Silence, woman! If you&#39;re my wife,act like one and think about protecting your husband!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Of course I am thinking, Master. After all, that&#39;s what a Servant does.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that look? Why are you still smiling!? Don&#39;t you understand what this situation means?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Wait! Before that, I have a question for Jason.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> ...Who gave you such an idiotic idea as sacrificing Euryale to the &quot;Ark? &quot;</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> That&#39;s none of your business!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh, I think it is. After all, if you had sacrificed her, the world would have been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> \u2014What?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Of course. That box brings death.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> To offer it a Divine Spirit is completely insane.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> This era is unstable to begin with. It would have killed the era itself.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> \u2014Ridiculous. Lies. That can&#39;t be\u2014</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> &quot;Sacrificing a Divine Spirit will grant infinite power. &quot;Who tempted you with that promise?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Was it Hektor? Medea?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Medea? He&#39;s lying...isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Sacrificing a Divine Spirit to the &quot;Ark&quot;would&#39;ve grant me powers and invincibility, right?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s what HE told me...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> It is no lie. After all, the death of an era brings complete destruction.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If the world is destroyed, your enemies will cease to exist. See\u2013? That makes you invincible, no?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Y-you. You people lied to me?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t serve my purpose at all! I was finally going to create an ideal nation!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> One where everyone respects me! A true utopia, where all are content, and there is no war!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Was this trial not for that purpose!? Was it not to give me a second chance!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...That is a dream that can never come true, Lord Jason. It is beyond you.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You&#39;ll never be an ideal king. Even if your heart truly wished for peace, your soul is hopelessly twisted.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You cannot make your dream come true. Not in the manner that you desire.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You will only realize your fate the moment you obtain what you truly desire, then crush it with your own hands.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What...What are you talking about, witch!? What does a woman who was holed up in a rural shrine know!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I was born the son of a king, but my uncle robbed me of my throne. I was forced into the care of a centaur!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Even while suffering that indignity, I became resourceful. I built the Argo and gathered a crew of heroes!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> So what part of me!? Where!? Where am I lacking the qualifications to be king!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I just wanted to take back my own land! I just wanted my own nation!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> How is that wrong, you traitor!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...Such a pity. Ever since I was summoned,I have told you nothing but the truth.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I am Princess Medea. Prior to being betrayed,I was a witch who blindly believed the one who summoned me.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That is why I have protected you all this time. You were chosen by &quot;that&quot; king.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Everything is real, everything is true.... Though there may have been some misunderstandings.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> For example, I just said I would protect you, yes? But how I will protect you\u2013</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> This, is how.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Wha-!? Y-You! Stop! What are you doing!? Aaah! No! My body is melting!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu! Fouuuu!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> O Holy Grail. O ultimate vessel granting my desires. Manifest. Remember. You are one of the 72 Demon Gods.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Arggh, ack, aieeeeeeee!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> \u2013I shall give you the strength to fight. I shall give you the strength to rise up.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Let us fight together for the sake of destruction.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Now then, rank number 30. Sea Fiend Forneus. Use that power to put an end to your journey!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Demon God! This is the second one of those things, I mean deities, we&#39;ve seen! Something like that really exists?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> This is a surprise...What did she just say?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Rank number 30, &quot;Forneus!? &quot;She&#39;s talking about Solomon&#39;s Demon Gods!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Will we\u2013Be able to defeat it?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I hit it! All right, if it can be hit, it can be defeated!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mash, this is truly the final battle! Come, get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You came all this way to slay that thing, didn&#39;t you? So hold your head up high!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This is it! The final battle! Be brave and laugh your fears away!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Say, &quot;I have no use for a monster! Just give me a pretty crown! &quot;</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Whoaaaa!? We...We just heard somethin&#39; awfully rare, yeah!?</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Did Boss just say a seriously feminine line!?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Shut up you fools, go hide in your cabins! This isn&#39;t something you can handle!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> A-Anyway, Mash, just do it! And forget what I just said!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> If you keep hesitating, I am going to take that second Holy Grail for myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Captain Drake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, understood! Master, visual confirmation of the final enemy of this era!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Commencing correction\u2013!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna win, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We got it, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Oh...ah...ugh...Medea, Medea, Medea...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> \u2013Yes, Jason. Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Fix me, my Medea. It hurts, it hurts, it really hurts!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What are you doing you slowpoke? I said, fix me.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> \u2013I can&#39;t do that, Jason. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I will be falling soon myself. It&#39;s such a pity. Originally, the world would&#39;ve sunk with you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Why you, just as I thought...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Although it has nothing to do with me,but it&#39;s true that I did know you.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Even as we speak,the memories of Princess Medea are coming back to me.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Even if she was betrayed, even if she was cursed at,even if she&#39;d been deceived from the very start.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> She truly, truly adored her Lord Jason. You had been given divine power, yet\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You were endlessly innocent. Like a child excited over receiving a paltry treasure.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You were hopelessly cruel, and completely innocent. Despite being weak, you attracted others and inspired loyalty.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s who you were, Jason. That was her first love.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But you were quick to betray everything. That&#39;s the only way you knew how to live.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> If so\u2014isn&#39;t it easier to sink along with the world,so that you won&#39;t be betrayed?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You were never\u2014supposed to return to your land.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Damn...witch! ...You treacherous...damned witch!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Die! Die! Go to hell! Dammit, dammit, DAMMIT\u2013!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Lord Jason.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I wanted to protect you from him,but I had no way of doing so.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have much time left...I only wish I could have dreamed a beautiful dream in my final moments...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Medea&#39;s about to vanish...No, before she does! Fujimaru, you have to ask her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who&#39;s behind all this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Were you allies with Lev, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m no longer at liberty to tell you that,since I have lost to him as a mage.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Princess Medea the mage,not the Servant, was defeated?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Yes. Please be sure to prepare yourselves,newest and last mages from a distant era.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> You don&#39;t stand a chance against him. As mages, you have no prayer of defeating him.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> So\u2014go gather stars. Numerous dazzling stars.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Stars that can rise against the greed and beast hidden within man&#39;s heart. Stars that can remain bright even within a storm and light up the sky\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Elimination confirmed. Holy Grail collection complete.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No enemies left. End combat actions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Era correction\u2013complete.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The wind has stopped blowing...Ah, this is the end. There is nothing that can be done.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This sea will end soon. But not anything like the giant whirlpool earlier.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> This is a good ending. It&#39;s a new birth\u2014Our sea is coming back to us!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Heee\u2014eey! It&#39;s goodbye to this damn weird sea\u2013!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We did it, men! Can&#39;s say I won&#39;t miss it, though! After all, these waters were full of adventure!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Hey, we&#39;re vanishin&#39;, one after another! Guess that&#39;s how life works, the rank and file exit first!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> Mash and Fujimaru, see ya! Thanks for helpin&#39; the captain!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong><br> We&#39;ll get hanged sooner or later, but you&#39;re good folk! Let this be a lesson! Never keep the company of pirates!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Haaaa! We can finally go home!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Come on, Orion! A new journey of love awaits!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> This is supposed to be a nice goodbye scene. Don&#39;t you want to look cool?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, forget it. I&#39;m tired.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, I hope we can meet again with me in a different form! Farewell!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oh, and Mash. How about a kiss goodbye for good measure?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> No? Oh, okay.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Darling, how about a &quot;goodbye&quot; from me?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> And so our roles are played out now. Oh, what a terrible time.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Without &quot;me&quot; or my &quot;loser sister&quot; around,it&#39;s dreadfully boring.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> ...Although I would like to meet HIM again someday.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have to call him by name, and make fun of that embarrassing confession of love.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. Fujimaru, you did well, too. As a final reward, I&#39;ll give you a little kiss.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Get down on your knees. Here\u2013(smooch. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Well, safe travels. Make your next struggle as merry as this one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> ...Whew. I&#39;m happy I was of service this time. I didn&#39;t want to be defeated like last time.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> That said, I haven&#39;t really shown what I can do yet. So please call on me again sometime.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Still...From now on, how should I go about honoring Lady Artemis?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s about that time.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It seems you have various struggles ahead,but do your best without being discouraged.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> With two humans, a quarrel ensues. 100 will create competition, 1000 will cause confrontation.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> That holds true no matter what era. You should fight your own battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please, wait. You knew about the 72 Demon Gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Was that...Um, really a Demon God? The doctor claims they don&#39;t exist...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh? Did I say as much? Why would you think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Well, naturally. You&#39;re King David of Israel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are the father of King Solomon,who is said to have summoned the 72 Demon Gods.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hmm. It&#39;s true Solomon is my son...But summoning spells are beyond my capabilities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...How utterly useless...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Ah, how rude. But what about yourself?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> It seems you said that Demon God was no Demon God. On what grounds?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-Well, that&#39;s\u2014That wasn&#39;t exactly my image of one, or...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahahaha. Roman is a fan of King Solomon. I hear he&#39;s been an admirer for a long time?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, Leonardo! That was a secret! A secret!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you don&#39;t accept the Demon Gods, isn&#39;t it? You don&#39;t want to believe your idol messed with such disgusting things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh...Right, you&#39;re correct! The 72 Demon Gods signify both the beginning and the pinnacle of summoning spells!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They couldn&#39;t be foul creatures like that! I mean, he&#39;s King Solomon, you know!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s the king who held the omnipotent Ten Rings, built the First Temple in Jerusalem, and made Israel prosperous!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How could someone like that command such monsters, or even worse, plot...plot the destruction of humanity!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There you go. As his father, what do you think, King David? Does King Solomon have a connection to that Demon God?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Mm, Solomon would do things like that, you know? Basically, he&#39;s a cruel, vulgar good-for-nothing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? How terrible! I can&#39;t believe anything anymore!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Hahaha. My apologies. It&#39;s my fault for not having much to do with Solomon. I was never interested in child-rearing.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> But certainly\u2014though he was a fool, he was honest.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> As for destroying human history, well...</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think he&#39;d consider it unless he was betrayed by all ten of his secret lovers?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In its own way, that makes his image even worse.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just how bad is the public&#39;s image of King Solomon!?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Well, I must be going. I leave the rest to you,but if anything happens, don&#39;t hesitate to call on me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Right. So we still don&#39;t have any definite information about the Demon Gods yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But\u2014King Solomon is involved,and that&#39;s the ugly truth...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh no, never mind. Now, Captain Francis Drake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you very much. With so many special cases this time, I wasn&#39;t really much help.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Lucky we had a dependable voyager like you on site. Thanks to that, history has been successfully corrected.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Oh, it was nothing. I couldn&#39;t do much in the end.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Ahhh...If I could become one of those Servants too,I&#39;d be a little flashier.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But I suppose that&#39;s an impossible request. A pirate like me could never be treated like a hero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re already a fine hero, Captain.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Really? Since that&#39;s coming from you, I&#39;ll believe half of it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So if history is corrected, will I really lose my memories of all of you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s what happens.</p><hr><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Hahaha. Well, you don&#39;t have to say a word. That look on your face says everything.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I see. Guess I can&#39;t sail around the world with you folks. A pity.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> But that&#39;s fine. Our time together was short, but it was a merry journey.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So go. For seafarers, parting is always abrupt.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Blown up by a cannonball, washed away by a wave,and ultimately lose sight of our destination and die.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we take those fears\u2013and always &quot;brush them off&quot; with a laugh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, goodbye,Captain who navigates across the seas of freedom.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s too bad. During this journey, I wanted to discover my wish and report it to you, Captain.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Mm? What we talked about before? How you&#39;re troublesome because you have no wishes?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It bothered you that much? Don&#39;t be silly. Or rather\u2014</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You already have a wish, Mash. You know very well what you want to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain Drake, what do you mean...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Saying you have no wish is wrong. In the first place, nobody is without greed.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> All humans have some kind of wish. You can&#39;t live without one.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The only difference is living while knowing what it is,or spending your whole life not realizing it.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> ...Same with that Jason guy. Even he had a dream of &quot;creating a utopia. &quot;</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> His homeland banished him, and didn&#39;t save him. I don&#39;t know if he did all this to prove them wrong.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Still,he wanted his nation to be a peaceful one.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The man was obsessed with the desire to rule,and at the very end, he arrived at his true wish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Jason&#39;s actions and behaviors were reprehensible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But\u2014surprisingly, he was thinking of the people. Though selfish, he was trying to protect others.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Aye. Sometimes sinners do saintly deeds, while saints sin. That&#39;s humans for you. That&#39;s us.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> That&#39;s why everyone&#39;s got a wish.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that some go their whole lives without realizing what their true wishes are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Captain Drake. Which type am I?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You...You&#39;re the type that&#39;s better off not realizing. You should stay just the way you are.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll know in the end.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> You&#39;ll realize what you want to do, and why you continue to raise that shield to defend others.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m the opposite, I already know. The sooner you know,the uglier the punchline ends up being...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Captain Drake. Are you, um...From now on, your life...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. You needn&#39;t state the obvious. I know how it ends for me. I die, right?</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Life is interesting once you know you&#39;re going to die. No, because you will die, you want to live in the moment.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;m not really a fiend for treasure. What I want is money, and pleasure.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna die eventually! So I want to enjoy every single moment while I can.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Thanks to you, I now know how vast the world is. It&#39;s a never-ending journey, even if I go all out.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> I&#39;d be satisfied to take just a little of that,and blaze one of the many trails available.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> How blessed, how inconvenient, and how it would be just like what I wished an ending to be.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> So never mind. Don&#39;t worry yourself over my dying days.</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> Farewell, Mash and Fujimaru. You too, cowardly scholar guy!</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> The reward for saving an era...Let&#39;s see\u2014</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong><br> When your journey ends, just remember how much fun you had with me! That&#39;ll be enough!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Will do. Farewell, Captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bon voyage!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Welcome home. Good job, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This makes three eliminated Singularities. Protecting human history...That mission is no longer just a pipe dream.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll look into that Demon God on my end. For the time being, I&#39;ll focus on King Solomon&#39;s era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use Chaldeas and Sheba to observe the Earth of 1000 BC.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sheba&#39;s range is the Christian Era. Go back further than that and you lose accuracy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Plus, it would require vast amounts of magical energy and electricity. Chaldea&#39;s current reserves aren&#39;t that\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With my pride on the line, I&#39;ll take care of that somehow. As for magical energy, I might know someone who can help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? I thought chances for outside help were nonexistent?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Oh yeah, sorry. I had the wrong idea. I&#39;ll get by somehow with Da Vinci&#39;s stash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, you two need to unwind. Next up is the fourth Singularity\u2014the turnaround point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> France, Rome, and the sea. Each time, the number of irregularities has been increasing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe with the next Singularity,the real target will come.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I want you to rest up. We&#39;ve got some time until the next Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good job, Senpai. You did your best too, Fou.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Ky, kyuuuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...By the way, Senpai. Did you want to sail around the world with Drake?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A little.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Me too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The captain was larger than life,but overflowed with charm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go after this is over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After our battle is over?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Not a trip via Rayshift, but a journey in this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I want to enjoy a world in which the future isn&#39;t decided yet, just like Captain Drake.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai. I think this recent search for the Holy Grail was the most special case so far.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The process solely was to head somewhere. It was a battle on a seemingly endless sea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Along the way, I think I learned something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good and bad people alike contribute to human history. Human diversity and contradictions. Expectations, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Humans are brutal creatures. They use wisdom and gain power for their own desires and objectives.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is a truly brutal trait. You could say that they are the most powerful and barbaric organisms on the planet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But there&#39;s hope in that brutality...The hope of realizing what couldn&#39;t be realized.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The power not to let the impossible remain impossible. This power, this hope, she taught us that is what makes us human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know if I have such a power. But, I&#39;d like to get as close as I can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I can keep fighting by your side, Senpai. To become a Servant that you can be proud of someday.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, then, Senpai, Fou, sweet dreams. We&#39;re on dry land for the first time in a long while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have to worry about getting seasick anymore. Please have nice and long rest.</p>', 3402);
