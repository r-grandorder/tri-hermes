Even with the numbers that they have currently, they still don\u2019t know how many of them are in total. Trung Nhi notices that we\u2019re just standing here talking, so she invites us to talk at another place.

The Trung Sisters don&#39;t mind it all with Trung Nhi being a bit embarrassed. Trung Trac asks about the identity of Wu Zetian and Wu Zetian confirms her identity and tells them that the Sisters died 600 years before Wu Zetian was born.</p><p>Ereshkigal assumed that the Trung Sisters hated the other side because of their past, but the Sisters don\u2019t seem to care and Trung Trac explains that the Sisters had to do what had to be done and they don\u2019t seem to mind if an empress was standing in front of them. Trung Nhi threatens Wu Zetian that if she hurts Trung Trac one bit, she\u2019ll cut down everyone here. Trung Trac knows that this is cold, but it\u2019s nice to confirm your values and stances.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/rr9utldtd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67c6aeeacedcce71b43204ded9ade82f550f0f15" alt="image"></p><p>You arrive at a village built on water which is where the Trung Sisters live. The sisters say that they were the ones that taught the Cons how to do things like build and were very skilled at it. They introduce you to the \u201CElder\u201D of this village. Ereshkigal does not find the talking turtle to be very surprising as she refers to how talkative sheep may be. The elder says that Ereshkigal is a bit much for his age and that he prefers someone who is blunt and black haired, while Ereshkigal is jealous that he prefers someone like Ishtar than her.</p><p>Da Vinci asks who this Elder really is and Trung Trac responds that he is this very island. The Elder says that he enjoys talking with youngsters and he jokes with them by ending his sentences with \u201Cgame\u201D. Trung Trac tells the Elder to take it seriously.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>I am sorry.</p><p>I suppose you\u2019re right.

The Trung Sisters want to talk inside a hut instead of the entrance. The Elder says that he\u2019s sorry if it doesn\u2019t really feel like the islands are floating, but he just kept swimming and swimming which became a habit. Da Vinci confirms that it\u2019s true. The Elder reassures that the main body never moves and in a deep state of sleep from which it\u2019ll never awake or it could be dead, but the Elder isn\u2019t sure since he\u2019s here in a very small form separated from the main body. Lambda thinks that he\u2019s a bunrei and the Elder can\u2019t confirm since it&#39;s been too long and now he just wants to bask in the sun along with the Cons. Wu Zetian asks his relationship to the Cons and the Elder has no affiliation with them and that they were harmful.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>However, I do remember this. Not to long ago\u2014</p><p>Frightening creatures from beyond the sea, beyond the fog, started appearing.</p><p>Mashu is puzzled and Lambda wonders if it was the mermen.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8pcqi9mvd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4df49d1e4485bc708685426b44b2a09fa48dd9" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>No, it\u2019s just not them.</p><p>There were things that possessed hoofs, things that looked like humans. There were a variety of them.</p><p>The thing they had in common was that they were all dwelling sea demons\u2026. They were sea monsters.</p><p>And before I knew it, more and more of these sea monsters showed up and started stealing from the land, living here and devouring the Cons.</p><p>However, when everything was about to be stolen, these sisters had appeared.</p><p>They fought them off, nearly avoiding everything here from being stolen.</p><p>A good way to put this\u2026 is that only this area of the region remains.</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Even if it was the last thing standing, I\u2019m glad that we made it in time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible for just the two of us to go on the offensive alone like that.</p><p>But with this, we bought enough time for allies to come forth.</p><p>Da Vinci grasps the situation. Trung Truc says that they believe they were summoned here to save the Cons and can\u2019t think of another reason why they were summoned here. Da Vinci states that this is a microsingularity because there is an anomaly and we need to fix it.

Trung Trac compliments her beauty and Cleopatra starts talking about her beautiful aura. She senses that Trung Trac is a married wife and Trac starts talking about her husband and his death. Cleopatra apologizes for bringing up something horrific. To make up for that, she gives them coupon tickets to her beauty store.

This is new technology made by Mecha Eli who doesn\u2019t share the details. She says that it is fully compatible with their strength and speed. Trung Trac is amazed by their advancements in technology. Mecha Eli is sad that she couldn\u2019t make more upgrades to the armor like lasers and missiles.

A particular Con with a red ribbon sticks out which you question. Lambda says that it is her number one fan.

In the end it\u2019s still a mystery since we don\u2019t see them all hours of the day and they could have some telepathic ability.

Trung Nhi proposes a tall watchtower that can see everything on this island. Lakshmi takes this as an opportunity to suggest that Cons assist with taking shifts and if anything happens, they can immediately report it to us. The Cons happily accept, but Trung Nhi wants them to know how to get to safety when something happens. Da Vinci says that they\u2019ll do easy check-ups.</p><p>Now the question becomes, what kind of watchtower they want to build. Da Vinci suggests the Leaning Tower of Pisa. She wants to see it emerge since her older self said that it was complete and that the leaning wasn\u2019t intentional and her artistic soul is tingling.

However, if they manage to build it up to the very finest detail, then he\u2019ll allow it and tell Nitocris to not cut corners if they decide to build it.

Da Vinci praises Semiramis\u2019s skills and explains that it was due to special circumstances concerning the ground it was built on. Semiramis compares this to a baby sand castle.</p><p>Trung Trac arrives to be stunned by its magnificence and worries that it\u2019ll tip over and fall. Mashu reassures her that it was perfectly calculated so that it won\u2019t fall over. Trung Nhi has a worrisome expression just like her sister. Da Vinci says that it is designed to be climbable as well. Trung Trac says that it\u2019s better to jump off if they\u2019re trying to run away.

Da Vinci is slightly disappointed that she doesn\u2019t get to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but doesn\u2019t mind it in the end. The Sisters wonder who it is despite it being Nitocris, but they pet her anyway. Nitocris tells them to stop and says it\u2019s disrespectful. You ask why she\u2019s wearing that and she explains it is to get into the mood of building the Pyramid. She has heard that this building will serve as a watchtower and they are meant to be tall. Nitocris complains and Mashu gets worried, but the Cons don\u2019t mind it and Nitocris allows it. Ereshkigal teases the color of their clothes.

The Sisters are fascinated and impressed by such a mode of transportation while the Cons are having fun exploring the train itself. You talk about how eating tangerine is a must on a train, but you don\u2019t know the reason for it which Trung Nhi finds a bit weird. Edison says that it\u2019s unfortunate that while the train\u2019s role is to transport people quickly to their destination, that would also mean being able to relax for just a short while, which Edison is trying to solve right now.

You guys head to the area and Ereshkigal is surprised that there\u2019s no metaphor or tricks to it. It is actually a sea monster horse. Da Vinci and Mashu state that it is a Kelpie, a water monster within the Scottish region and takes on the form of a horse and a bird. Mashu closes it off with the horse eating anyone that dares comes close to it.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bjh4lchaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7033c9406a32d08ac573c7435c71038070221496" alt="image"></p><p>The Cons are going towards the horse wanting to ride it, but in actuality they\u2019re being eaten by the horse.

According to legend, if you get onto a Kelpie, you\u2019ll never be able to get off of it. You retreat back to the village to think of a strategy to defeat this sea monster.</p><p>Back at the village, Da Vinci says that Cons like to ride something and assume this is something that they were born with. Nhi says that they enjoy using stilts and the Elder mentions that they loved riding on the back of his shell. Da Vinci proposes that they should build a cooler ride so that they won\u2019t be persuaded to think that riding a horse is better than what they\u2019re going to make for the Cons, so they decide to build transportation for the Cons.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/obfwdqzaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36275dc164d5f926b541eeb4dedae1532b908b38" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/fmsac6rbass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfacf2f6c02e119abd7593099fa492f9848b881a" alt="image"></p><p>Carmilla emerges and says that it doesn\u2019t matter what you guys build as long as it mimics the horse.

If it were her driving her own car, she\u2019d knock down all the trees, but says that she should\u2019ve made it more aquatic.

Trung Nhi suggests another neighborhood that\u2019s above the water, but you have to consider that Semiramis is doing all the work, so we\u2019re open to suggestions.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2h6jvpn0gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b252d5035d7dd3cfd14da987a084b8e6dfe1184b" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/cnuvb5j1gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d76609014113e933a86a381d1fe9484b2fc4eb3f" alt="image"></p><p>Marie Antoinette emerges and proposes a massive ship like a luxury cruise for everyone to live on. Nobunaga pops up and tells us to hold and says that we should, of course, build a houseboat. She continues that it\u2019ll have all the Japanese formal rooms and dishes and if there\u2019s a fire, just jump into the water since there\u2019s exits already available. MHX can\u2019t think of aquatic building, but proposes a colony ship since space is better than water. She adds that there\u2019ll be functions for life in the case the planet dies. Da Vinci is slightly annoyed that they\u2019re coming in and suggesting what they want, but reminds you that you\u2019re the one who\u2019ll decide in the end.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/xgml3qy2gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=730e4e897639644b1231447bd018ce60a80d932c" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 7 Choice A: Let\u2019s Live on a Luxury Cruise Ship</p><p>Overall, everyone seems to be impressed with the ship since it comes with a lot of rooms for different purposes. Robin Hood is there and Da Vinci compliments that it\u2019s like a hotel with a great deck. Marie Antoinette wants to do a Titanic reference where the man supports the woman from behind while the woman stands at the edge of the deck with both looking at the horizon. However, Kiyohime Summer does not approve of that. A Con jumps off the ship since it seems fun, so they rescue them and Lambda scolds them.</p><p>**Construction 7 Choice B: Let\u2019s Live on a Houseboat</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/uykz2ww7gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90c42455c49f46272cfc4a62f65765bebfc7e96b" alt="image"></p><p>Every GUDAGUDA character is there on the houseboat having a big party. Beniemna is the main cook for the houseboat. Saito Hajime states that the houseboat should\u2019ve had a bit more charm to it and asks why Okita is in swimsuits. She responds that \u201Cwe\u2019re in a southern country (?)\u201D. The Cons enjoy their time in the houseboat since it has a very fun environment. The Sisters ask if it\u2019s ok to sit down and lie down and you say it is ok. They sit down and start sleeping, which you let them do without interrupting them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2br4wlg8gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=300ad75d745e897c5c01a3cb9b1ca0f604cb72ec" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 7 Choice C: Let\u2019s Live on a Colony Ship</p><p>The Trung Sisters are impressed by this unknown technology. Mysterious Heroine X shows the Sisters around and shows them a cockpit and it doesn\u2019t function, it\u2019s just a replica, but she wants to expand it when the time comes which will be next season. The window is just a wallpaper. She sees Cons and puts them out of the way and makes the excuse that she couldn\u2019t afford a weightless machine since it was too expensive. Mysterious Heroine X is curious about the Cons comparing them to aliens. As long as they are not sabers, it is fine. Trung Trac seems to be impressed that the Cons like it and that the ship is wind and water resistant.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bugfdi89gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04cb49325a97221cd8a6c2a3d12c33a3d4ada488" alt="image"></p><h2 id="chapter-13-a-waterside-song-is-an-invitation-to-eternity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-13-a-waterside-song-is-an-invitation-to-eternity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 13 - A Waterside Song is an Invitation to Eternity</h2><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/b0b3s3z6m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271e1b0d3b2775f45ca840d7134fa2b4168128c1" alt="image"></p><p>Mashu states that after we gave the Cons mounts, weapons and armor, we began to raid the next area. There were new sea monsters in the next area but they had confidence that they could pull through. However, in the end, we retreated back to the village since the new monsters do mental attacks to the Cons. A flashback to the battle, a female spirit sings a song which makes the Cons approach them. Vritra who came to help already succumbed to the attack. Da Vinci managed to tell them to retreat.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/u8lvnnp7m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c31e85e4a44a955b0776f1396885dc5d0ac871b" alt="image"></p><p>Anastasia tells you that the sea monster this time around is called a Rusalka. It&#39;s a legend that they lure people in with songs and drag them into the water. She continues to say that they\u2019re like the Vodyanoy\u2019s wife, but she doesn\u2019t know how true it is, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Lambda\u2019s number one fan comes in and says that while her number one fan was in danger, it managed by knowing that Lambda was more beautiful than her. Lambda is very excited to hear that, but also indicates that if the Cons get to know fun cultures that are better than the Rusalka, then they won\u2019t be succumbed by them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/moar0df8m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2cc9bc64e011c9e62274ba639416d011fa3193" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/gn224mx8m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c8694b1f096b77a8335bb31fbe68f328b5995bb" alt="image"></p><p>Nero comes in and says that entertainment was very popular in Rome that she proposes a theater. Tomoe Gozen emerges and proposes a Game Center since a house of electronic entertainment suited for our era which Hinako and Osakabehime agree to. Murasaki Shikibu appears and suggests that there is some fun in reading books so she suggests a Library. Trung Nhi that this is neat and that the decision is up to you.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/z3cylay9m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17efc138716f814f44c884022ac44eab69beb676" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice A: Let\u2019s Build a Theater</p><p>Nero\u2019s theater is complete and says that she would have put on a one man show for everything and says that it is not adequate. So Nero puts on a very spectacular show by making Scheherazade put on an exciting story for the Cons. Everyone seems to enjoy the story that Scheherazade puts on which is just horror and exciting stories. After that, Mata Hari puts on a dance show for everyone. Charlotte Corday is next to put on a magic show for everyone. For the end, Nero concludes everything and Elizabeth puts on a musical which the scene ends with a To Be Continued.</p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice B: Let\u2019s Build a Game Center</p><p>Hinako, Osakabehime and Tomoe Gozen state that there are a variety of games in different genres. Tomoe is shocked that she didn\u2019t account for the size which Hinako demonstrates that the Cons are playing together with one using the levers and one using the buttons. Tomoe will make adjustments later to fit the Con\u2019s size. The Trung Sisters try to play some games, but are more suited with physical games like air hockey. Trung Nhi makes a new record in shooting the goal but she mistakenly tossed a Con which she is extremely sorry for.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/0eb7m5bcm5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26602c12e2e2bb2c16ed915edae7a9ee66cfe2d3" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice C: Let\u2019s Build a Library</p><p>Murasaki Shikibu states that she would have helped with the construction if she had time. The Trung Sisters and the Cons are having fun reading. Jeanne Lily, Jack the Ripper, Paul Bunyan and Nursery Rhyme are also there and having fun with the Cons. Murasaki Shikibu has done some research on the Trung Sisters and is surprised by how much there is about them. The Cons asks Murasaki Shikibu if she has a book for them and says that she has a picture book for them. She is surprised that the book is upside down and is surprised that they\u2019re improvising a new story and doing a read aloud. With this, she\u2019ll be at the counter if you need anything and she is inspired to create something new.</p><h2 id="chapter-14-fourth-area-recapture-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-14-fourth-area-recapture-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 14 - Fourth Area Recapture Battle</h2><p>You return back to the area and fight off the Rusalka, but the Cons seem to can\u2019t get the things they\u2019ve enjoyed out of their head which means that they\u2019re resisting the Rusalka\u2019s mental attacks. Lambda states that Cons can\u2019t distinguish between reality and games and tells her number one fan not to be like them since her Con. Lambda continues to tell them to be careful when doing the finishing blow. Trung Trac tells them to give it their all since this is the last area.</p><p><strong>==BATTLE==</strong></p><p>Benkai and Mashu praise them for winning and that this is natural. Da Vinci states that while they\u2019re relaxing and resting, she wants to take this time to review their information. Da Vinci states that this would have been easier if Sherlock Holmes didn\u2019t take a day off from work, but Anastasia says that it\u2019s normal to take a day off. Da Vinci goes over the characteristics and features of the enemies we\u2019ve encountered so far which are the Merman, Hermit Crabs, Bunyips, Vodyanoys and Rusalkas. They conclude that none of them are clues on narrowing down the region. Da Vinci tries to find some significant commonality and outlier between them. Da Vinci shares her opinions, but it is not shared with the reader.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, we can\u2019t draw any conclusions just yet.</p><p>However, there\u2019s a possibility that it was the beginning of everything.</p><p>That\u2019s right\u2026this anomaly has appeared before us from the very beginning and why I feel like the place is the \u201CUnknown Coordinate Singularity\u201D...</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/gyuoiv4nm5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900c23bd6ce72cff0fa1b6e68be3e5419a303a4" alt="image"></p><h2 id="chapter-15-preparation-for-a-sea-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-15-preparation-for-a-sea-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 15: Preparation for a Sea Battle</h2><p>The Sisters begin the meeting to explain that there are isolated areas within the region that have pulled in more water than anywhere in the region. The monsters within these secluded areas are a multitude of fishmen, which isn\u2019t anything special, but they are high in numbers. However, in order to get to these areas, you\u2019ll need a boat with navigation and combat.</p><p>Drake, Blackbeard and Bartholomew recommend a pirate ship since it has combat. However the three of them have differing opinions on what kind of ship it\u2019ll be. Mordred wants a hovercraft. Hokusai proposes a utsuro-bune which she was inspired by old books. Trung Trac was dozing off during suggestion time, but it\u2019s always up to you to decide.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice A: Let\u2019s Embark on a Pirate Ship</strong></p><p>Drake is amazed by how smart the Cons are with how they built this ship. Mashu asks what the ship\u2019s name will be and they want to mash up all the names, thus, The Queen Anne\u2019s Golden Royal. Drake says it should be the Golden Royal\u2019s Revenge. Bartholomew says it should be the Royal Anne Hind Mekakure Fortune which Drake cannot believe that there\u2019s someone stupider than Blackbeard himself.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice B: Let\u2019s Embark on a Hovercraft</strong></p><p>Mordred is impressed and says that it\u2019s smoother than surfing. Gareth and Mashu try to calm her down by saying that this is a test run. The Trung Sisters are worried in the end since Artoria Alter (Maid) shot her Noble Phantasm at the Hovercraft and the Hovercraft successfully evaded it.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice C: Let\u2019s Embark on a Utsuro-bune</strong></p><p>Hokusai tells the story of the Utsuro-bune which was a boat that was shaped like a box, with glass overhead and many layers of steel at the very bottom. Da Vinci likes the mystery since Hokusai states that a exotic woman held the mysterious box and that the ship was found in the Edo period. They speculate that the box could be something sentient and Da Vinci ends it off with that the woman never let go of the box and let anybody near or touch it.</p><p>People never tried to understand the woman and she was exiled back into the sea. Da Vinci tells Jeanne Alter Lily that mysteries should stay mysteries and Hokusai doesn\u2019t care as long as it appears good for her.</p><h2 id="chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 16: Night Before the Decisive Battle</h2><p>You wake up in the middle of the night to take a walk in the village when you encounter Trung Trac. She says that she couldn\u2019t sleep when she remembers that Servant don\u2019t really need such things, but says that she\u2019s nervous or even scared.</p><p>Trung Trac says that she\u2019s constantly remembering her rebellion and the failing result. Everyone who followed her was killed and she feels heavily guilty and compares it to as if she killed her sister. She thought that the Cons were an attempt to redeem herself, but it is not a guarantee that it won\u2019t happen once more so she tried to stay brave in front of everyone despite not being able to convince herself as she questions the throne and how she became one. She calls herself a poor ruler and just a naive girl, but you say that she\u2019s a good leader. You comfort her that she\u2019ll win since she has her sister, the Cons and us. Trung Trac is motivated by your words and will protect them.
