But since she is an intuitive-type man-slayer, the whole thing can be kind of a hindrance sometimes.</p><p><strong>M-Drive: [EX]</strong></p><p>A mysterious engine included in the operating system that simulates all types of battles against various outlaw ronin and anti-shogunate space rebels.

Extreme jet acceleration beyond the physical limitations of any person causes the three-stage thrust to execute at sublight speed, which results in its velocity consuming the surrounding air and induces an outrageous power output that swallows up and annihilates the target&#39;s surroundings, despite it being a single target attack. Due to the over-the-limit load it puts on the user, it can cause incapacitation at random.</p><p>By the way, sometimes when serious, she yells out &quot;Blue Sky Sandanzuki&quot;, but she herself isn&#39;t really sure what &quot;blue sky&quot; is supposed to mean.</p><h1 id="makoto-in-summer-flag" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#makoto-in-summer-flag" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Makoto in Summer Flag</h1><ul><li>Rank: C-</li><li>Type: Anti-Army</li><li>Range: 1~50</li><li>Maximum Targets: 1~200 people</li></ul><p>A festive punch-like version of the Noble Phantasm similar to the one Saber Okita Souji has.<br> For the purpose of exterminating the outlaw ronin rampaging the summer&#39;s sea, various misunderstood Shinsengumi soldiers are summoned.

Poor Ms. Okita then died...(but not really).</p><p>Oh no! An accident with an indigenous local...and even death!? This is definitely going to affect my approval for a bonus!!! In a panic, Ms. XX hastily built a life support device (really a jetpack) using parts she had on-hand, and as a result, a mysterious Shinsengumi girl was born. But in actuality, Okita was just unconscious, and inadvertently had the Servant Universe&#39;s mysterious technology installed to be reborn as a futuristic Shinsengumi warrior, all because XX goofed up.</p><p>Thanks to the life support device, her Weak Constitution skill was removed for a limited time, and as the device theoretically runs for over eight hundred years it enables her to have a super healthy body. However, Okita erroneously believed she had only three days left to live.</p><p>The sight of her running freely under the bright blue sky is, to a girl who was welcomed by the soft warm sun to disappear within the tumultuous age in which she lived, but a precious summer dream.</p><p>Of course, the turmoil and rift in space and time XX caused is only an enchantment that lasts but the duration of summer, and everything goes back to normal as soon as summer ends.

The pressure was unlike anything before when it came to this design. As such, I was extremely nervous about living up to expectations, but I couldn&#39;t believe me FRICKIN&#39; mind, and was overjoyed, when I received a compliment from pako-san after the implementation. The first and second ascensions are jets, and the third is a cute swimsuit. That&#39;s how it was laid out, but the design of the third ascension was actually the one I was most worried about. There were some changes made at the very last minute, which caused some trouble for the battle character team... But, thanks to all that, the third ascension turned out really well. The jets and blades were designed by Hirai Yukio-san. I would like to thank them very much for helping out with all our unreasonable requests.
