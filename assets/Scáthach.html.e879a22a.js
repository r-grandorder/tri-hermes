Are you ready, C\xFA Chulainn?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ready or not. You haven&#39;t told me why I was summoned, but... Well, I have some idea.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hmm, being summoned like this must be fate. First off, I&#39;d like you to try and finish me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Uh, right. I just need to pierce through your heart or head with impeccable technique and coordination, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No! Wouldn&#39;t that just kill her?<br> Um, we&#39;d like you to not try and kill each other!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible, little girl.<br> At this point, nothing&#39;s going to stop her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai, what should we do...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d like the two of you to stop.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No, please don&#39;t stop me, Master.<br> This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why do you want to die?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s because living makes me long for death... A satisfactory death from the ultimate thrust.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s too much too ask for and an annoyance. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I have a body which seeks but is denied death, a mere ghost who&#39;s burned onto the world.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> However, with this world incinerated, the Land of Shadows is no more. That&#39;s why I can be summoned as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> To fight as a warrior, to lose my life if defeated\u2014<br> A chance to live like a proper person.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s only natural wanting to try it, no?<br> Assuming there&#39;s a warrior greater than me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well, C\xFA Chulainn?<br> Have you improved a bit since that time?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Since I couldn&#39;t leave the Land of Shadows, my only way to make sure was through my messengers.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yes, a bit. Stand back, Fujimaru.<br> A spear tip is more suitable for her than words.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Dammit. Sending clueless kids as messengers.<br> What kind of bad joke is that?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You are immortal physically, but your soul is dead. You&#39;re wise, but what you are is no different than a hellish fiend.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Now that very soul has materialized in this world, then I guess it&#39;s the pupil&#39;s job to finish his mentor off.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes. Now then, Child of Light.<br> Try to kill me for good this time.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Leave it to me. My spear can reverse causality, and it never misses its prey.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u2014Here we go, Sc\xE1thach.<br> That heart will be mine\u2014!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Well said! My pupil, the moment that red spear pierces my chest\u2013</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oh, I have longed for such a moment...<br> as I was frozen in the depths of eternity!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sorry. I messed up.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Foolish pupil\u2014!<br> Why did your spear have to miss, now of all times!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Amazing... G\xE1e Bolg&#39;s tip flew way off into the horizon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it even seems to have left a contrail. It must have hit Mach speed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. Because it couldn&#39;t see Sc\xE1thach being dead in her fate, so it turned into a wild throw like that.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Ah. Is that what it is?<br> So my foolish pupil did not go easy on me then.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Still! Come on, S\xE9tanta! What&#39;s with you!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You&#39;ve gotten worse since your time in the Land of Shadows! You&#39;re like a squirrel! Been slacking off on your training?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah yeah, I know, I know... I am weaker than before.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I mean, half of my strength is missing.<br> I don&#39;t really know why, but I am just not in my prime.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> What did you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh! Maybe... So when C\xFA Chulainn appeared as a Caster to help us that one time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His powers got distributed to every C\xFA Chulainn that existed in each Servant class.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Ew. I was a Caster somewhere?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. Come to think of it, despite being a natural warrior, his skill with runes was needlessly high...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Still, you told me something useful, Mash. There&#39;s still a chance.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn. You will start your training over in that body. Train with a clear mind and you&#39;ll regain what you&#39;ve lost.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A clear mind... So basically not to think about anything?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Wait, start over my training?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Did you hear it any other way, fool? You have the basics. Now you just need combat experience.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Right, it&#39;s decided.<br> Now then, let&#39;s start our journey of training.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Huh, like right now? Ow! Don&#39;t pull the hair on the back of my head! Hey, Pink Hair! Quit laughing and do something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Th-There they go.<br> What do we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s follow them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s join them.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.<br> It&#39;s our only option. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Okay, we&#39;ll start by killing a chimera. Work hard.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> All right, I get it! Quit pulling my hair! ...Dammit. What a pain... But I guess I have to go along with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, please!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;ve decided to join our training?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The more of us, the better our chances.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> You&#39;re right, we are Servants.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> They say a Servant&#39;s power increases more with backup from a Master.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ll allow you to participate.<br> Try to kill the chimera along with C\xFA Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood!<br> Let&#39;s do our best, C\xFA Chulainn!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You sure love to stick your nose into other people&#39;s problems, but thanks. I can&#39;t shame myself in front of my mentor a second time.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> A life-or-death situation suits you, C\xFA Chulainn. Both your eyes are burning brightly, aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That battle was intense, how can I not get excited? My love for a good fight has always been a bad habit of mine since childhood.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yes. However, your spear lacks precision.<br> Did you hold back and rely on strength alone because the enemy was weak?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I teach you not to swing your spear with strength alone? Your habit of skipping out on lessons was one thing I couldn&#39;t fix...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> All right then, we&#39;re facing dragons next.<br> Let&#39;s go earn you the title of Dragon Slayer... By killing a hundred of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s as unreasonable as he is!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn, are you alive?<br> ...Which is to say, should we continue?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Of course we continue. My shoulder is all nice and warmed up. All right, bring on the dragon or whatever you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Very well.<br> Let us have at it, my prize pupil!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Last one.<br> Here we go\u2013 G\xE1e Bolg!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Got &#39;em!<br> Well? Can&#39;t complain about that!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hello?<br> Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...No, sorry.<br> I was remembering you from the past.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Stop right there before you embarrass me. So, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hm... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s perfect, but it&#39;s close. At the very least, not that much different when you were alive.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Good, now we&#39;re talking.<br> Well, shall we do this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.<br> To think that kid would be standing before me like this.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Human life is nothing but wonders. Rather than becoming a god, I would have preferred to associate with you as a human\u2013</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Heh, heh, that too is merely a luxury.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Something like \u201CHe who hunts two hares loses both.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Exactly.<br> Are you ready, C\xFA Chulainn?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u2013Yeah.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Mash, you two should join, too.<br> Then we&#39;ll be even.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gotta do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Brace yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.<br> ...Here we go, Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> \u2013Come at me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u2013Gotcha!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Take this as my parting gift!<br> G\xE1e Bolg!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> \u2013Ugh!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That was your last strike, huh?<br> Then here goes... G\xE1e Bolg Alternative!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Say, Sc\xE1thach.<br> Looks like you, too...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. Looks like...I also have gotten stronger than before.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...Well, I had a hunch, but it was so fun... At times, killing dragons and giants and monsters...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Are you even more reckless than me!? Don&#39;t you want to die!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t help it! The stronger an enemy, the more I want to see the essence of its strength.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> The stronger they are, the more I respect them, the more I want to cross swords with them!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that I&#39;d end up getting stronger! It&#39;s not my fault!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...SIGH. Exactly how much does the Queen of the Land of Shadows love to fight?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t keep up with this inflation. She could at least slow the pace a little...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something that you can do in a short time.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You&#39;re right.<br> ...No need to rush, is there?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn and you, Fujimaru.<br> The day will surely come when you can kill me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Before you save the world,<br> kill me, if only once.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That is my wish.<br> To that abysmal probability, I devote this body.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah, I got it. We&#39;re stuck together &#39;till we both die... No, &#39;till we both kill each other.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> There&#39;s still a long way to go. Going along with a woman&#39;s selfishness is also a requirement to be a top-tier Master, Fujimaru.</p><h2 id="calls-from-the-land-of-shadows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#calls-from-the-land-of-shadows" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Calls from the Land of Shadows</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master. Master.<br> Please wake up. Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure myself. But we&#39;re not in Chaldea, nor any recognizable era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What I do know\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where are we...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure. What I do know\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m detecting a great deal of magical energy here. Besides you and me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Yo. You guys wandered in here too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C\xFA Chulainn!<br> Does that mean...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Must be Sc\xE1thach&#39;s doing. We&#39;ve finally been invited into the Land of Shadows. I apologize on behalf of my mentor, since I&#39;m kind of involved here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing for you to apologize for...<br> Oh, so this is the Land of Shadows?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s slightly different than the place I once visited.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s not the Isle of Skye. It&#39;s like a remnant of the Land of Shadows when it was still connected to the real world, but it&#39;s different somehow.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The part where the air is filled with frigid magical energy is about right, though.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Which means, we were dragged into my mentor&#39;s memory, or something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Memory?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if this was deliberate or not, though.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Either way, even if this is just a memory, the Land of Shadows isn&#39;t somewhere we should linger.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If things go badly, we&#39;ll all be swallowed up and die, including Master. The world will end, and we&#39;ll all end up in the gutter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Eh, don&#39;t worry. This is just carelessness on her part.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t have been an issue if it was just me, but I can&#39;t let the both of you get sucked into this.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Which means, we need to exterminate that nuisance of a woman. Let&#39;s go take her out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are dead spirits floating around everywhere...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> The real Land of Shadows was close to the realm of the dead. Don&#39;t let them see you. They won&#39;t be friendly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Fou, you&#39;re here too!?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh come on, don&#39;t shout!<br> ...Oh crap.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...They&#39;ve noticed us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...My bad.<br> Well, we&#39;ll just call this more training...or something. Yeah.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Missy, don&#39;t let them take you down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right!<br> Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Whew. You all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. ...But why would Sc\xE1thach lure Master to the Land of Shadows?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach is pretty well beyond rational understanding or anything like that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> From the looks of it, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything serious. She probably got a bit lonely.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> She&#39;s been stuck in this land for a few hundred years. There&#39;s nobody whom she could fight, let alone hate.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> A long time ago, ambitious fighters like me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Came over to challenge the famed Sc\xE1thach to gain fame and glory, but she beat the crap out of every single one of us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Aaand then we all ended up as her disciples...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, none of us could live forever.<br> So this situation might be partly our fault.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Our mentor trained the crap out of us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Every one of us loved women and booze more than anything. We were a bunch of barbarians.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach would kick us around for being so rowdy, but it must have been fun for her.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u201CThe spirits of the dead would miss no chance to infiltrate the real world, but your ruckus has managed to frighten them away.\u201D</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> That&#39;s what Sc\xE1thach would always lament.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But we all had a place to go home to.<br> The Land of Shadows was just a stop on our journey.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And so, Sc\xE1thach&#39;s disciples all died young.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...As for me, I turned up as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I guess there was the option where we could have fought Sc\xE1thach in the Land of Shadows for eternity.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But I chose not to. I think she may have resented me for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Maybe. I was just rambling. Ignore me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Whoa, whoa. That&#39;s a sight. The castle gates are completely different than I remember.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> There weren&#39;t any knights in plate armor standing as gatekeeper, either. Hey Master, give us your orders!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Got &#39;em!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> They&#39;re easy compared to the Dragonkin we faced last time. Missy, how&#39;re you doing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Okay, then.<br> Hey Sc\xE1thach! We&#39;re coming in!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> We know you&#39;re hiding in there!<br> Brace yourself, we&#39;re coming in!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no answer.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well, we ARE in a memory...<br> I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> And this might be late in the game, but in the Land of Shadows, the inside of the castle is far more dangerous than outside.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Mostly because fearless and clueless ghosts who want to challenge Sc\xE1thach are roaming around.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> We have to try to run. But, be prepared to fight.<br> Okay, run!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, you run so magnificently!<br> Fou, hold on tight!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A bunch of something are behind us!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There are three up ahead.

Is this bloodlust?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> No. At least it&#39;s not her bloodlust.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Then what\u2014</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...So it&#39;s you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Hey, what the heck? Gathering all these spirits in one place, are you planning on forming an army or something?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> That&#39;s not a bad idea. I wouldn&#39;t have to keep my air of being aloof and reckless.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Stand down. Lifeless one.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What the hell? It&#39;s not really like you to respond to my heckling, Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Is that so? Many months and years have passed while I presided over the gates of this demonic land. I&#39;ve seen many lives and deaths here.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I thought... I might as well rot.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> But this body never decayed. My soul was forever frozen, unchanged.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yet, my soul was always too...decent...to allow me to plunge into the morass of true evil.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> My desires faded, and my senses told only of silence and eternity.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...And then...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Humanity was incinerated. And with its absence, I gained the chance to end my eternity of monotony...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...the one in a million chance to finally be embraced by true death.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Yet, I still do not know where my soul goes after death.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Is it to the Throne of Heroes? To the incinerated Land of Shadows? Or\u2014</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Either way, I...desire. Through this body of ether, I have flesh and bones. Even a heart.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> And though it is temporary, I have \u201Clife\u201D as a Servant.<br> So, I find myself wanting to test it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> No matter how much I try to hold back, I cannot contain it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> As a result, I have involved Master and my foolish disciples in this debacle.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I apologize. Though, I know that may not be enough.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> What a roundabout way of doing things.<br> ...Fine. Let&#39;s give Sc\xE1thach her last rites.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Missy, Master. You ready?<br> Sc\xE1thach is serious now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s a sight rarely seen! Prepare yourself!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Then I shall die. Or perhaps, I shall kill.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do this. I will try not to hold back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...That is some fight you put up.<br> You have grown, all of you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It&#39;s over, Sc\xE1thach.<br> If you&#39;ve lost your wits, snap out of it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I&#39;m still not dead. You all are still alive.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Why do you stop? This fight is not yet over.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in this, Sc\xE1thy-teach.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Killing you in a memory wouldn&#39;t make it real. That&#39;s just death within a fantasy. It&#39;ll only leave a bitter aftertaste.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If you&#39;re going to die, do it in the real world.<br> It should be an honorable death in battle, too, right?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Besides, why would you say you would TRY not to hold back!? That&#39;s not going all-out at all!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If you really went all-out, you&#39;d bring out a gate or two, not just your spear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A gate...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> \u201CGate of Skye.\u201D Have you seen it? It&#39;s a move where her enemies are dragged down into the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> At the bottom of the Land of Shadows, they&#39;re as good as dead. All living things simply perish.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But then you don&#39;t even use it! If that&#39;s not holding back, what is, Sc\xE1thach!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> H-hmmmmm...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Looks like I got you there.<br> That&#39;s a once in a lifetime sight.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> ...Is it because you&#39;re summoned as a Servant now? You&#39;re showing off a human side of yourself.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> But I guess that&#39;s partly due to Master&#39;s influence.<br> After all, Master&#39;s the most human of all humans I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that a thing? That doesn&#39;t sound like a thing.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> It means you always try your best, as much as you&#39;re able. And anything you can&#39;t do, you still try to find a way.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> You borrow wisdom from those came before you, and dream of a future. No matter how dire the situation, and fight as humanly as possible.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> At times you may be discouraged. You may look back to the past. But stopping and looking back is only for a moment.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Right? Does that ring a bell?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...I suppose you have me there. I must have been affected by Master without realizing it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> If not, you wouldn&#39;t be so feeble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach...feeble?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s her way of life. Her desires aside, it&#39;s not like Sc\xE1thach to look back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think...I understand that logic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not only were her mannerisms different from the normal Sc\xE1thach, but her way of fighting...and everything else.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Oh, Missy is starting to understand the way of the Celts. So there you have it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach. For you to desire death is just your way of trying to escape. And that isn&#39;t you at all.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it more like you to dream of a swift yet beautiful death as the reward of a glorious battle?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> You really didn&#39;t hold back there, C\xFA Chulainn.<br> But you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> For me to renounce everything and seek death at a time like this is nothing more than running from the truth.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sheesh. Took you long enough.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> My apologies. And forget it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) I cannot believe it...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> To allow you, of all people, to see my doubts.<br> As a mentor, there is no greater disgrace.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Hrm. In order to offset this disgrace, I may need you to die three times.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re just taking it out on us!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Idiot. It&#39;s to clear my name. But since I wasn&#39;t falsely accused of anything, I simply need to overwrite my disgrace by doing something even more heinous.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Terrible. She really hasn&#39;t changed.<br> But then again\u2014</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Thanks to Master, I got to see a more human side of her. Let&#39;s just say that I had a valuable experience.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> \u2014Hmph. You&#39;ve grown bold, Child of Light.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> I&#39;ve had my fair share of turmoil.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> I see. Then you may be the one who will eventually stand before me in battle.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong><br> Farewell, C\xFA Chulainn. It seems it&#39;ll be a while before your G\xE1e Bolg becomes the instrument of my grand end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh look. The dead spirits have disappeared.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sheesh. She left me with a hell of a demand.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> In order to end that woman&#39;s life, one would need the skills capable of killing even the gods.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Well anyway, why don&#39;t we go ahead and wake up, Master?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong><br> Sc\xE1thach and my desires aside, you&#39;ve got a more crucial task up ahead of you.</p>', 308);
