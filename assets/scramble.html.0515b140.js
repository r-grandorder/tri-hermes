Far, far. That&#39;s all I thought on my way here.<br> I&#39;m at the inner side of the <em>target</em> world.</p><p>Unobservable territory. Its deepest and most shallow pitfall.<br> Its closest and most distant semidarkness.</p><p>But my duty, my mission isn&#39;t to <em>infiltrate the target world</em>, nor to <em>start a war through observation convergence</em>.</p><p>My only mission is <em>to call</em>.<br> And to <em>be me</em>.<br> The conditions are already cleared.<br> I&#39;ll shut down my consciousness and transfer full jurisdiction to <em>me</em>.<br> Goodbye.</p><p>[Static noise]</p><p>I&#39;m floating. I&#39;ve been floating here for the longest time. Kinda lonely... So I call.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_<br> I call that name. Deep, deep... Far, far... I&#39;m waiting... <em>in the unknowable sea, inside the rainbow-colored dream</em>... Ehehe.</p><p>Note: Scene Change</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, senpai.</p><p>[Fujimaru wakes up in a hallway]</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What happened? You were spacing out in the middle of the hallway.<br> Are you... having stomach problems?!<br> Did you get an ulcer from anxiety for tomorrow&#39;s special mission?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I was daydreaming... nah, it&#39;s nothing)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re fine?<br> I sure hope so...<br> After his power up in India, Nemo can now keep his Noble Phantasm constantly activated.<br> Captain Nemo&#39;s Noble Phantasm, the almighty submarine Nautilus is now real.<br> The vessel we cross the ocean with will be the most key element in our next operation: conquering the Atlantic Lostbelt.</p><p>While it&#39;s necessary to check if the captain and the ship are functioning, we don&#39;t have all the equipment we need for the operation.<br> Therefore, it was decided that all the Chaldea staff should be contributing to this last stage of development, while only you, me, the Captain and few Servants perform the test sail.</p><p>We&#39;re calling it just a test, but it&#39;s actually quite the intense training program, with many more exercise besides just sailing into Imaginary Space.<br> So I thought it would make for you to be nervous, considering we wouldn&#39;t be hearing from our usual bridge team in there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m more excited than nervous, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looking forward to sailing with you, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Great. I&#39;m also excited, to be honest.<br> Still nervous, since we&#39;re going to the sea of Imaginary Numbers, but looking forward to board Captain Nemo&#39;s famed Nautilus!</p><p>Oh, that reminds me, we finished selecting our boarding Servants.<br> Have you heard who they are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I just heard we&#39;d have 4.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The last 3 they selected were Osakabehime, Scathach-Skadi, and Xiang Yu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t find any patterns.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How do they choose these teams...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have relatively new Servants on our team, so I&#39;m a bit worried if you can handle them well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, it&#39;s just 3?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So I guess that...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes... We were going for a 4 Servant team with Abby, but Sion ultimately decided to take her out. The Trismegistus II provided with complicated suggestions today, so she struggled to interpret its content. Upon consulting all data, da Vinci decided that this was too intense for her, not to mention she&#39;s not compatible with the rest of the team. Sion had to agree and acknowledge that removing her from the team would also contribute to saving resources. I feel really sorry for Abby...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t make da Vinci change her mind.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I give her some pancakes later)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sion is planning to pull an all-nighter, apparently to check the Trismegistus II&#39;s entropy. You should go to sleep early, if you plan to sleep today.</p><p>[Mash walks away]</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, whose glare is this?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> (staring)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m feeling glared by someone</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We were just talking about.</p><hr><p>[Abbigail is on the corner of the screen]</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> (staring)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, little lady.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Master... I&#39;m a bad girl... I&#39;d be a burden for tomorrow&#39;s mission. I understand that... but... I just wanted to ride that iron nautilus ship with you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m just as sad as you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I promise I&#39;ll take you next time.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Really? You mean it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad... but I won&#39;t be seeing you for a while. That&#39;s I&#39;m sad about now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I was weak...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s really worried about me)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yoo, Masutaa and Abigeiru. Not sleepin&#39; tonight?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oei? Why are you here this late?</p><p><strong>Hokusai:</strong><br> Ye know Masutaa is sailing on the iron <em>whale</em> tomorrow, right? I was just thinkin&#39; of drawin&#39; them a <strong>treasure</strong> for good luck. On my way, i found a fellow <em>Foorinaa</em> being cranky. So now&#39;s yer chance. Wanna draw with me, Abigeiru?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Oh dear!? No, I mustn&#39;t, this is too much for a child like me.</p><p><strong>Hokusai:</strong><br> It&#39;s all fine. Nothin&#39; matches the taste of a kiddie&#39;s art. Besides, collaborative paintin&#39; is real fun. Go pick yer <em>pastel</em> tools!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong><br> Sounds great! Can I? Do I have your permission, Master? A treasure ship... Master, I&#39;d love to give you a good luck charm!</p><p>[Abbigail walks away]</p><p><strong>Hokusai:</strong><br> Sorry for askin&#39; this favor in this schedule, but ye think you can spend some time with us and still wake up in time for yer briefin&#39;?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind, you just did me a big favor here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re really good with kids.</p><hr><p><strong>Hokusai:</strong><br> Ahahahahaha. I feel much better now ye said that. And of course we are, Poppa and I are still kiddies on the inside. Plus, we Foorinaas are sorta extraordinary, right? We got this criminal record as <strong>threats to humanity</strong> for whatever reason. Me and Abigeiru got our difference, but we put&#39;em aside to help each other out. Form a comradery with people hangin&#39; in the same boat. Ye said ye&#39;ll come, so whatcha ye&#39;re waitin&#39; for, Masutaa? If ye get bored along the way, I got ye some scrolls illustrated by yer&#39;s truly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oei&#39;s picture scrolls...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wanna see them!</p><hr><p>[The scene cuts to Fujimaru running all the way to the dock]</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Am I late...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good morning, Ritsuka. Oh wow, you arrive at the exact second! To be precise, you&#39;re 0.008 seconds late, but I won&#39;t hold it against you! You know what you have to do, hop in!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see you were in a hurry to get here, Fujimaru. Did you take your breakfast? Honestly, a good Master would have arrived 10 minutes before the schedule. It show you&#39;re still 7/10 as a Master. Devote yourself to your cause. Always be elegant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Just like you were already at the dock one hour early, Mr. Goredolf? I agree arriving too tight on time is a problem, but I think so is arriving too early.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ghh! Did you see me here, Sion?! N-no, I was just talking a walk. Just a walk, pal. I was most definitely not riddled with anxiety about the Nautilus test run. Listen, Fujimaru. The success of this test leads to us raid the Atlantic Lostbelt. I know you&#39;re thinking about fun times in the new Nautilus, and how cool submarines are and whatnot, but you must take this seriously. Stay alert, and leave while you&#39;re ahead! I hear that the Japanese are the most punctual and methodic population in the world! Prove it when it&#39;s time for you to return! That&#39;s all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sir, yes, sir!</p><hr><p>[Holmes applauds]</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What an honor it is to witness such a magnificent briefing. I like especially how brief it was. If it were a single word longer, I&#39;d have to intrude to say &quot;Excuse me sir, but your magnificent words of encouragement are delaying the operation&quot;. What a shame I didn&#39;t get my opportunity today.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Enough of your shoddy interjections. I may be an aristocrat but I&#39;m also a pacifist!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s our classic Chaldea party. Starting the day filled with wit and trust. I don&#39;t think I still need to give any more warnings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. Our times together weren&#39;t all that long, but we still overcame many challenges to be here today.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. Together through the joy and the pain. <strong>Even the most bitter of enemies can work together on the same crew</strong>, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I thought this test was necessary. Captain and I are still new to Chaldea. Our relationship is not solid enough for me joke around if you. This test is an important mission to measure the limits of the Nautilus&#39; mobility, but it also aims to deepen the relationship between Ritsuka and Captain. If possible, I want to make your relationship with him as solid as your relationship with da Vinci, if not more.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmpf. We already have one moron among us trusting the Captain more than we trust one of our own. He may be quiet, unsociable, and often handle guns, but for all his unsettling behavior, he&#39;s still one to trying cornering maneuvers while his tight submarine is on it&#39;s max acceleration. I can&#39;t not be his friend. I can say with confidence because I befriended a local kid on a safari for the exact same reasons... But, alas, our race was cancelled despite being the most important part of the test...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ritsuka already feels familiar to Captain for me. I don&#39;t see this going wrong.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Really? You like Captain, Ritsuka? That&#39;s a seasoned Master for you, I&#39;m getting jealous. Don&#39;t forget Captain is my Servant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> How unusual for you to be jealous, Miss Sion. Are you feeling tired from working all night long?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No, what&#39;s really getting to me is that I&#39;m unsure about the Servants we chose. I still can&#39;t understand why the Trismegistus II selected them specifically as &quot;the optimal combination&quot;...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Is that really safe to trust the machine&#39;s decision without interpreting it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yeah. You don&#39;t need to see all the maths inside a calculator to trust the anwer. Same concept here. It the Trismegistus II reports printed the &quot;reasons&quot; for everything, we would take half an year to decipher it. I&#39;m not worried about the Trismegistus II, worried about the kind of environment that would demand this three&#39;s abilities. What kind of environment would Abbigail Williams be recommended to? And was leaving her out the right idea? What I&#39;m unsure about is our personal decisions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup, the main problem was that we had to limit ourselves to 3 members, and it&#39;s was really hard to take out any of the other 3. In any case, let&#39;s get ready for our next operation. It&#39;s up to you to consider it a breather, or research, or whatever you feel like this is.</p><p>[Everyone nods. Scene cuts to Fujimaru inside the Nautilus]</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> And that&#39;s all I had to say. Our small talk time is over. Prepare to set off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I learned my lesson.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (It&#39;s so claustrophobic inside the submarine)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Caring for mentally young Servants is an important job for a Master, but that&#39;s no excuse for being late. Being punctual is our most important duty. I&#39;d never turn back for a sailor who was to late to board. Don&#39;t ever be late inside my ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, my captain!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> &quot;My captain&quot;... Ok, how are the arrangements, <em>deputy commander</em>?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A real representative arrives one hour before the scheduled time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br><strong>Now I&#39;m embarrassed, too...</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> An eye for an eye. And Mash, stop clinging to Fujimaru like a live sharksucker and get to work, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sharksu... No, I-I was just feeling sorry for Master for not getting enough sleep last night! Sorry, I mean, yes, my captain!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Are all passengers ready?</p><p>** Scathach-Skadi:**<br> Indeed. Due to lacking the Authority of a godess of ships, I shall obey the guidance of the sea god&#39;s son, looking very forward to our voyage.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I won&#39;t ever be ready! But per Maschan&#39;s request, I&#39;ll show you all that I can be a shut-in in a submarine just as well as I can be a shut-in in a bedroom!</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh, Xiang Yu is nervous?</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> Incorrect. All is moving according to my regular calculations. I was merely reminiscing on the lovely image of my wife rolling on the floor in frustration after her relentless requests to accompany us ended rejected.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She tried so hard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Xiang Yu&#39;s head is in the clouds...)</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong><br> This shall be no obstacle to <em>carrying out</em> thy orders. My bellwether, and captain, I recommend setting off posthaste.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Excellent answer. We will. [The engines start revving] Assault Landing Submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; speaking. Sion from dock, report the results of the final pressure hull check. Over.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sion from Novum Chaldea speaking. There&#39;s not a single scratch on the hull, of course. How are you feeling, Captain? When I summoned you I promise <strong>I&#39;d do everything to provide you with the ship you deserve</strong>. Did I fulfill my promise?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> You sure did. I can&#39;t thank you enough, Sion from Novum Chaldea. I don&#39;t have a single complaint about this vessel. It&#39;s as comfortably tense as the whiskers of a North Pacific right whale. So I&#39;ll waste no more words and set sail immediately. Over and out!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yaaaay, you really got into it, Captain! I&#39;m glad I could fulfill my promise. Have a nice maiden trip. The door to your room will stay locked tight while we wait for you. Count on me to not let anyone in! Fujimaru, take care of my Captain! You won&#39;t have any support from us, but I hope you take this as a rare, fresh experience!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Vents unlocked!
