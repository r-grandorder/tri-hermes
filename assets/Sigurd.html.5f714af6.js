He wears those glasses that shouldn\u2019t have existed naturally long ago. He\u2019s a man of logic fundamentally; he achieved in getting his father\u2019s revenge not out of love, but because he had an inexplicable sense of duty. He\u2019s blunt towards everyone without a trace of being\u300Caffectionate\u300Don the outside. But if he protected someone without any regard towards his own safety, then that is a sign that he trusted that \u300Csomebody\u300D.</p><p>He\u2019s a hero, but consequently, he was a strong man honing himself as a mere military man. He has a strict attitude, but he doesn\u2019t expect the same seriousness from others; he is generally \u201CFumu. There\u2019s that as well, huh.\u201D, which him being generously understanding.</p><p>While he does not hold back against formidable opponents, he shows restraint against the weak while being fully prepared to have that decision come back to haunt him in the future. He has no problems if his opponents resort to cowardly methods, but he cannot use it by any means. This sort of principle needs to be supported by strength or else it\u2019s just laughable, but for Sigurd, but it\u2019s no joke when his hidden strength and mystery ranks among the top even among many Servants.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>While remaining disinterested, his earnestness and steady outlook reveals his strength to Masters facing a Holy Grail War. While he trusts Gudrun0, he doesn\u2019t have any memories of dedicated love for her; Brynhildr alone is worthy of both his love and affection in the entire world as far as he is concerned when he is first summoned.</p><p>On the off chance that he is summoned by an ill-natured Master in a Holy Grail War, he sets certain limits upon himself. The likes of consuming souls or murder of innocents is rejected absolutely, demanding the use of Command Seals from the Master. In that case, he is fully prepared to be ordered to end himself.</p><p>A hero that\u2019s\u300Cnot obsessed with a second life\u300Dsimilarly with Cu Chulainn and others. The one thing he seeks from the Grail is a &#39;reunion&#39; that could probably never be granted, unless Brynhildr is summoned as well -- or rather, should she ever be summoned, it would be nigh impossible to restrain him even with Command Seals. However, he\u2019ll assist even if it means throwing his own life away if the Master approaches him with earnestness and goodwill.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300CServant, Saber.

The tragic ending has become widely known in the world as \u300CNibelungenlied\u300D[1] with several episodes modified.</p><p>Especially the famous anecdotes, which are Fafnir\u2019s extermination and the unfortunate love story with Brynhildr. The gruesome battle unfolded with the wicked dragon Fafnir wielding his father\u2019s broken sword that forged the demonic sword Gram. Or when he fell in love with Brynhildr, but married another person after losing his memories. Betrayed and in despair, Brynhildr murdered Sigurd and she even severed her own life in grief afterwards.</p><p>Yet, it\u2019s uncertain whether he is the very same person as Siegfried. Sure enough, it\u2019s unclear which one defeated the wicked dragon common in their myths, but it\u2019s possible that both of them defeated a \u300Cdifferent\u300Ddragon.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>While the magnificent warrior Sigmund and his second wife Hjordis gave birth to Sigurd, his father Sigmund was killed in battle when he was still an infant, so his mother and Hjalprek[2] took care of him in the country. And as for his mother\u2019s second marriage, Sigurd was raised by the blacksmith Regin[3]. However, Regin didn\u2019t have any love for him-------------instead, he used Sigurd, destined to be a hero and loved by Odin, in his plot to obtain the wicked dragon Fafnir\u2019s treasure.</p><p>Sigurd was well trained as a dragon killer since his birth, reforging Gram out of his father\u2019s broken sword, and exterminated Fafnir for the sake of avenging his father, as well as fulfilling his foretold destiny.</p><p>Of course, Sigurd didn\u2019t have any hesitation to kill Fafnir, the wicked dragon. Rather, unsophisticated or even stubborn, he was wondering if Regin his foster father would consider himself as family after he achieves the only thing Regin has ever wished for him to do. He cannot reject the possibility of such a desire, even if he was never aware of it himself.</p><p>However, the brutal truth was revealed when he had slain Fafnir and drank the dragon\u2019s blood. Regin was planning to grab the gold, so he ambushed Sigurd. It was a hopeless reality that Sigurd faced stoically.</p><p>-------Is that so. Nobody ever really loved me.</p><p>-------But, in the end, why? That I am even existing right now------</p><p>Not having his mother\u2019s love, not even having his father\u2019s love and not even having God\u2019s love. He killed Regin[4], and departed on a wandering journey, and he came across Brynhildr.</p><p>He received a prophecy in regards to his future by his uncle Girpir, a prophet. As he had already known that he\u2019d meet Brynhildr, he decided to never fall in love with her, no matter how beautiful she might be.</p><p>However, here, his alertness was overwhelmed by prophecy. A cold young man knew love for the first time in his life as he became indulged in love with this battle maiden, as if he forgot the tragedy awaiting thereafter.</p><p>...Eventually, he met a humiliating end, being killed with his own sword as a result of a plot from a woman who loved him. But, Sigurd felt love. It\u2019s said that she was passionately mad with love, but he remembers vaguely her flames of love that didn\u2019t allow betrayal.</p><p>The blow of his death wasn\u2019t out of hatred; therefore, it\u2019s love. He knew about that so he laughed in satisfaction. This man, who has laughed fewer times than he could count on both hands, laughed heartily</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Brynhildr:</strong></p><p>It goes without saying.

While I am concerned in the differences between us, I am instantly relieved to hear that Brynhildr treats him as a different person.

So I designed him with an image of a modernistic protective suit for military use in contrast with Brynhildr\u2019s divine-looking armor, and the motif of a school uniform was chosen to match Brynhildr with her sailor uniform. Just like with his ascensions, it\u2019s not exposing much skin except with the difference of the face. The scar is by being stabbed by Brynhildr in the heart, and the heart is still burning up with blue flames even now. In other words, he\u2019s even the same as Napoleon as he\u2019s been the \u300CNice Guy of the Extinguishable Flames\u300D. Even then he\u2019s healed the numerous scars he received in battle initiated by Brynhildr with a recovery rune, and thus most of his body is unscathed except the heart\u2019s scar. Servants appear as they were in their golden days during his lifetime, but I think that the moment he received her lance is in fact his \u2018peak\u2019. A man who received his lover\u2019s love is invincible. The thorny bits were an absolute pain to draw so I cursed the designer. What an idiot.

The dark blue colored armor that\u2019s piles up each ascension is whitening, showing a Valkyrie was gaining powers back in her time like hypothesis evolution. There\u2019s a condition that only applies to the original handle section (silver in her second ascension and a gold portion in her third ascension) for her spear and a hypothesis that she acquires a purple heart-shaped enormous blade (?) when she gets passionate for Sigurd. Since she wields it like a halberd, I was thinking, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit too heavy.... Her internal imbalance is revealed through the asymmetrical appearance of her left and right bangs and the wing tiara. I asked and they could repair the model and motion with the opportunity being Gotterdammerung\u2019s release. That being the case, I irresponsibly made them do a new design of the lance getting bigger when using her Noble Phantasm.
