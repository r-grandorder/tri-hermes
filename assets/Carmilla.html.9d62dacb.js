You really ought to relax and wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> At any rate, I know this castle and I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I am quite comfortable here, after all.<br> The smell of blood here is so, so dear to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh.<br> ...What should we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s move on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s escape.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Wait a moment, Master.<br> Did you not listen to a word I said?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I heard every word.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> In that case, surely you know that you won&#39;t find any lies or deception in my words.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Ask your companion, there. Have her tell you the blood-splattered legend of Elisabeth B\xE1thory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s exactly as Carmilla says.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The only person to ever to escape here was a one single maiden out of a thousand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do believe your safest choice is to wait here...patiently.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been imprisoned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s no help coming for us.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. After all...if this is Castle Csejte, we have been imprisoned...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The longer we wait, the more likely we&#39;ll be sacrificed...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Ugh. J-Just how foolish can this woman be?<br> Do you understand? This is MY castle.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> How could I be locked inside my own castle?<br> Such self-injurious action would never be...never be...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...ok, it&#39;s completely possible.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> To drain the blood from a beautiful maiden. To skewer a hateful rival. If it were for that purpose, it is a possibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s get out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Okay, we&#39;re escaping.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...As infuriating as it is, I&#39;d have to say that is the proper choice. For the moment, I think I shall follow your orders.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about traps...?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Do you think I would bother with such trivial matters?<br> All I did was give the order, &quot;Don&#39;t allow anyone to escape.&quot;</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> As to what manner of security measures were taken, do you think I would bother myself with that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Uh, well.<br> Do you have any advice on how to escape?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> None whatsoever. Why do you look at me that way?<br> You are a mere commoner\u2014Eek!?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> A hand extending from the wall?!<br> What is this? A haunted mansion?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Golem!<br> The wall has transformed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll destroy it!<br> Stand back, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll admit, I do regret my actions a little bit.<br> Not knowing anything can be quite a scary thing.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> But, I will say this. Master, if you ever make a mockery of my foolishness, it&#39;s the Iron Maiden for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ummm, I don&#39;t see an exit anywhere...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou?<br> Don&#39;t rush ahead like that...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, stay close by!<br> It&#39;s an enemy!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> But this is no Golem.<br> Yes...It appears we finally meet the true foe.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2013I hate you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2013I cannot stand you!<br> I will never, ever forgive you!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Mere phantom of this castle... You weakest of the weak,<br> lowest of the low! How dare you stand before me!</p><p><strong>Young Girl:</strong><br> What did you say? ...Just because you are a noble...<br> you killed me...How dare you...How dare you!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Being a noble is my way of life. I am afraid to say that I am not the type to be tormented by guilt.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I am evil. Utter and thorough evil. Void of salvation,<br> I am a ludicrous beast that died in sheer despair.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> However, I am not so foolish to have regretted my evil and lost sight of what lies before me.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> It was perfectly logical to curse me, but to invite these ones in as well was foolish.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> You will receive pity if you were to only curse me, to curse all of those living, then you&#39;re no better than me.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> In that case\u2014I shall crush you, without a shred of mercy.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Even if you are a phantom, I will wring every last drop of blood from you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Hmph! The hem of my dress has been torn.<br> That was somewhat of an inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Let us be on our way, Master.<br> The exit shouldn&#39;t be far.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter, Carmilla?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Nothing at all. Only a slight headache.<br> ...Master, let me ask you this.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> This is just an &quot;if.&quot; If the door does not open...<br> and we are truly locked in this castle, what will you do?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Would you give up in despair?<br> Or would you\u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I would find another exit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I would not give up.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> I figured you would say as much.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Even in such a desperate situation, you&#39;ll continue fighting without giving up.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Just because you&#39;ve been imprisoned,<br> you&#39;re not the type to lie down and give up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An enemy!<br> It&#39;s a\u2013Shadow Servant...!?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Oh, dear... I am imprisoned again.<br> Again, I am all alone.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again there is no one to rescue me...!!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> No! No! Stop...! I don&#39;t want to go back to that place! No! No! Noooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pull yourself together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I will rescue you this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...!<br> Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here it comes...!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> \u2013So it is.<br> Now, I am your Servant.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Even though it was my fate to become imprisoned, it is illogical that you should be imprisoned as well.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Master! Mash! Listen to me closely.<br> This is merely &quot;darkness!&quot;</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> It is a darkness that envelopes this castle, preventing escape. It is the final barrier, the absolute ruler.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> I cannot overcome this alone.<br> But now, I have you with me.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> To battle! Now is the time for me to make these ones pay for what has been done!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We destroyed them!<br> We can open the door...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Well done.<br> You have successfully escaped.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about you, Carmilla?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> Never mind me. You go on.<br> You should return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> This place is nothing more than a world of my own imagining.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> As long as my fate has been determined, there is no hope of my escaping this place.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> You see, for me to escape imprisonment would be a rejection of my life, my fate, my everything.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> However\u2013You are different. I must help you. Even if the chances are one in a thousand, I must help my Master.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Do not worry. This is a dream. Merely a nightmare. You will forget all of it when you awake.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> In matter of fact, what if...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> What if, I had met someone like you when I was &quot;Elisabeth.&quot;</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> What if, I had reached out to a beacon of light like you.<br> Then I\u2013</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> \u2013Oh!<br> You&#39;re awake! Master.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> ...Why, you look as if you were struck by a popgun.<br> Did you have a strange dream?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It was just a dream. Put it out of your mind. More importantly, it is still night time.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> There is still time before morning comes.<br> Go back to sleep once more.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong><br> And this time\u2013have a pleasant dream.<br> Good night, Master.</p>', 139);
