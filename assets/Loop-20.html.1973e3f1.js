But I sure didn&#39;t think there would be this many stores offering help.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because this is a newly developed district. The way I see it, they are using the cultural festival to establish closer connections to the local area, and we are benefiting from it. I see nothing wrong with that, however...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut what about the shopping district that used to help us out in the past?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is not a problem, either. Many of the favors we receive fall outside the scope of the shopping district.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Indeed, there&#39;s a lot.\u201D</p><hr><p>With that, despite being brought along under the title of an advisor, I&#39;m starting to wonder just how useful I&#39;m going to be.</p><p>As we are all done and about to go back, we come across someone quite unexpected in front of a menswear shop.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, isn&#39;t that Caster?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIndeed, that is her.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh my, the boys are here.\u201D</p><p>For some reason, Issei frowns a bit. Caster, on the other hand, looks to be in a particularly good mood.</p><hr><p>\u201CBoy, is it really alright to go out with a male friend of yours and leave dear Saber all alone?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Is this what you&#39;re supposed to say when you bump into someone?</p><p>No matter what mood she is in, Caster is still difficult to handle.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Speaking of which, is it okay for you to leave Kuzuki-sensei like that?\u201D</p><p>An attempt to keep this rubbernecker&#39;s long nose out of the others&#39; business.</p><p>\u201CSure it is. Because I&#39;m going shopping for Souichirou-sama today.\u201D</p><p>Ugh... a completely futile one.</p><p>Wait, so that&#39;s the reason for being in good humor.</p><hr><p>\u201CShopping... for brother Souichirou, I see.\u201D</p><p>Issei is clearly relieved.</p><p>\u201CIssei, does the fact that she is shopping for Kuzuki-sensei really make you that glad?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm, no, nothing of the sort. Please don&#39;t ask.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I nod.</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way, Caster. Are you still buying clothes like the ones before?</p><p>I mean, the stuff that won&#39;t even be worn, are you just keeping it at the temple?\u201D</p><p>\u201CGah, Emiya, you knew!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. She did say she wanted to dress Saber up and all that.\u201D</p><hr><p>The stuff with lots of frills and whatnot.</p><p>At this rate, even Illya may be in danger. Better not let Caster near her.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Ah, no. Well, it is her hobby, after all, it&#39;s not like I should be interfering.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-Is that right?\u201D</p><hr><p>There is a delicate atmosphere between the two of them.</p><p>Same as Fuji-Nee back when Rider came to live with us... Living under the same roof, yet not quite getting along?</p><hr><p>Speaking of that, didn&#39;t she bring up her marriage with Kuzuki-sensei at some point?</p><p>Er, but before that\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C...Say, Caster. Did you really marry Kuzuki-sensei, officially?\u201D</p><p>Ah. Caught off guard, she is.</p><p>\u201C...Boy. Just what could you possibly mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHold on! Hold your horses, no need to kill me just yet.</p><p>...I meant no sarcasm. I thought, well, it&#39;s been a while now, aren&#39;t those two going to marry soon? Just a bit of encouragement from the sidelines, you know.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015O... Oh.</p><p>I d-did not expect such support from you, boy. A-Anyway, my thanks to you.\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s shy. Definitely just shy.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou should reserve your gratitude until the happy end.</p><p>So, how was it? Did you have a wedding ceremony and all that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is not what I want. We officially became husband and wife on paper, but there won&#39;t be a ceremony.</p><p>......Reikan-san did recommend it, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s all rosy, yet an air of unhappiness is looming over it.</p><p>Due to Caster&#39;s past, she now fears wishing for too great of a fortune.</p><p>...Well, at any rate.</p><hr><p>\u201C...On paper... Hold on, you don&#39;t have any documents, do you?\u201D</p><p>I lower my voice. Things might get difficult if Issei overhears the question.</p><hr><p>\u201CDo not worry, boy. Rest assured, there are no problems.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s good to hear, but... you didn&#39;t just brainwash somebody at the office?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI did not. It is an issue easily settled with money.</p><p>...If it bothers you, ask the supervising lady. About the sudden increase in her savings account, for example.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Okay, pretend I never asked.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat would be wise. I admire your sense of danger.\u201D</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>...Ugh. Somehow, the two of us are now able to just talk casually... Despite being pretty much incompatible with each other...</p><hr><p>\u201C...Emiya. I&#39;ve been wondering for a while now, is Caster-san an acquaintance of yours?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Well, yeah, a lot has happened...\u201D</p><p>And a lot of which I can&#39;t let him hear about.</p><p>Quickly exchanging glances, it seems that Caster feels that way, too.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm, shall we get going, Issei?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh... Right. In that case, we will see you later, Caster-san.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p><p>Leaving her at the storefront, we depart.</p><p>How shall I put it... Life at Ryuudou temple sure is tough, in its own way.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat is it, Emiya?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no, it&#39;s nothing.\u201D</p><p>I should pay them a visit one of these days\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h2 id="day-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3</h2><h3 id="ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-a-samurai-and-a-wild-flower" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ryuudou-temple\u30FBday-3-a-samurai-and-a-wild-flower" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ryuudou Temple\u30FBDay 3 A samurai and a wild flower</h3><hr><p>At the top of a long flight of stone steps stands the Ryuudou temple gate.</p><p>The gate guard here is rather stubborn and difficult to deal with. Not quite lion-dogs or Niou statues, though...</p><p>\u201CGuess he&#39;s here today.\u201D</p><p>The figure of Sasaki Kojirou, Assassin, comes into view. Having never gone into town, he&#39;s literally disappeared within the gate.</p><hr><p>An imposing character like that in broad daylight, with temple visitors around, would be rather odd.</p><p>Fortunately, no one but espers should be able to see him. Or so you&#39;d think.</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Out for a casual stroll, I ended up coming all the way here. I wonder why. Despite having the day off, I bet Issei still went to school.</p><p>Even if I go out of the way to offer him a cheerful greeting, the chances of being able to get a conversation going with Kojiro are slim.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Kojiro himself only glances towards me\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Finding no ill intent, he shifts his gaze elsewhere.</p><p>But, you know... after standing guard all day long, you can&#39;t help but be bored.</p><hr><p>A job where you don&#39;t do anything\u2015\u2015\u2015even exaggerating, I can&#39;t fathom how tiresome that must be. I feel sorry for him.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Maybe I ought to bring a present or something next time...\u201D</p><p>He doesn&#39;t look like the kind of guy that dislikes drinking. Shall I borrow some from the main building?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Suddenly, Kojiro stands up.</p><p>Behind me, I hear somebody going up the stone steps. Out of breath, they make frequent stops along the way.</p><p>Wondering who that might be, I hide behind the gate and take a peek.</p><p>Huh? Kojiro aside, there was no need for me to hide. I just followed along.</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>huff</em>, <em>huff</em>, <em>huff</em>...\u201D</p><p>As she&#39;s having a rest just a few steps before the top, I see a familiar face. Saegusa? Is she alone?</p><p>Once recovered, she slowly conquers the last bit.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The guard in question, Kojiro, gazes at Saegusa silently.</p><p>Her epic ascent finally over, she looks at him uneasily, not noticing me yet.</p><p>...But, she sees Kojiro.</p><p>And I do recall hearing about this somewhere.</p><hr><p>\u201C...U-Umm...\u201D</p><p>She speaks up, a hint of fear in her voice.</p><p>Well, can&#39;t blame her. Not when this anachronism of a swordsman stands in front of her, and not a single TV crew or signboard in sight.</p><hr><p>\u201CExcuse me... W-Would you happen to be from the temple?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That is correct.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CU-Uh... Um, I&#39;m not sure if it would be impolite of me to ask, but... is there a festival going on?\u201D</p><p>A very Saegusa-like straight pitch.</p><p>She must be inquiring about Kojiro&#39;s antique-looking clothes.</p><hr><p>\u201CA festival\u2015\u2015\u2015It seems this temple does have a history behind it. I recall Caster talking about it, but sadly, I do not know when.\u201D</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;What kind of history, I wonder?&quot; Saegusa ponders, tilting her head to the side.</p><hr><p>\u201COhh.</p><p>Caster-san... Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s wife... right?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s correct. Unfortunately.\u201D</p><p>She seems a little offput by his blunt manner of speech.</p><p>Perhaps it&#39;s about time to interrupt them. Just as I&#39;m about to make an appearance, Saegusa&#39;s unexpectedly persistent stance stops me in my tracks. The way things are now, this is not a good time to come out.</p><hr><p>\u201CCaster-san and Kuzuki-sensei are a really good match for each other, I think... Um, could I have your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTsushida Kojiro.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo, Kojiro-san, don&#39;t you think they are a good match?\u201D</p><p>Tsushida? Stop making up weird names.</p><p>Did he think she might get suspicious if he called himself Sasaki Kojiro while wearing that outfit?</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd what&#39;s your name?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, my name is Saegusa Yukika.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMiss Yukika, watching her antics as she chases after her dear husband - with not a hint of recognition from him - used to be one of the few sources of amusement I had. Recently, not quite as much.\u201D</p><p>...You are a wicked man, Kojirou.</p><p>However, I can sympathize. Being perpetually assigned to guard duty while Caster strolls freely around town would put anyone in foul mood.</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? That&#39;s just my perverted taste. Finding out that she&#39;s been blessed by an innocent child like you ought to make her happy, too.\u201D</p><p>Muttering thus, he sits down on the stone steps.</p><hr><p>\u201CInnocent, am I...?\u201D</p><p>Indeed, she wouldn&#39;t see it herself\u2015\u2015\u2015but despite her nervousness, she still sits down beside him.</p><hr><p>\u201C............?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm... Kojiro-san, i-it really isn&#39;t just my imagination, is it?\u201D</p><p>While saying that, Saegusa runs her hand all over Kojiro&#39;s costume. While his face may remain stone-still, he is definitely troubled.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaki-chan and Kane-chan both say that there isn&#39;t a samurai at the temple gate. But there really is one, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015They probably just came at the wrong time.\u201D</p><p>He mutters in bewilderment, staying beside her.</p><p>Befriended by a cute little puppy, even Kojiro finds it hard to be unkind.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally? When did you come to the temple?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh no... just the temple gate. Watching from above, seeking out imprudent fellows amongst the visiting pilgrims, that is the duty of this gate guard you see.\u201D</p><p>He isn&#39;t exactly lying, but he isn&#39;t quite telling the truth, either.</p><p>Of course, he&#39;d be reluctant to talk about Servants and so forth in the first place.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, so that&#39;s why you are dressed like a samurai? And here I thought maybe you were practicing for the fall festival performance.\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>I see. While Kojiro sits there dumbfounded, Saegusa&#39;s face is sparkling with an innocent smile.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s great, you really are like a samurai, Kojiro-san. Um... That big katana behind your back, is it real?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s a Bicchu-aoe blade, over <ruby>five shaku<rt>150 cm</rt></ruby> long.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEek... Eeeeek...\u201D</p><hr><p>Hearing that it is a real sword, Saegusa leaps back.</p><p>...No wonder, when you think about it. Seeing a real guy with a real sword in front of you is a bit of a shock. Even my thickheaded self would be perturbed in that situation.</p><hr><p>\u201CHaha, don&#39;t be scared. I would not dare attack defenseless women and children.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut is it really alright with the police?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTemples and shrines have always had the right to protect the people. Do not worry.\u201D</p><p>What century is that from?</p><p>Gathering her resolve once again, Saegusa timidly goes back to sitting by his side.</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The flow of the conversation is interrupted, and silence sets in. Yet there is definitely a friendly air between the two of them.</p><p>As I watch from behind the gate... I suddenly feel rather embarrassed by this act of voyeurism.</p><hr><p>\u201CKojiro-san... Um...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat now?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf that&#39;s alright... Uh, umm...\u201D</p><p>Listening to this makes me nervous.</p><p>I mean, Saegusa is talking to a guy out of her own will!</p><p>Just what is it that attracts her to Kojiro? Is it his slightly greater than average audacity? Had Makidera been here, there&#39;d be more than a little violent uproar, no doubt.</p><hr><p>\u201CNext time, I thought maybe you could meet with Maki-chan and Kane-chan...\u201D</p><p>\u201CAre those your friends? Yeah, Kane\u2015\u2015\u2015I recall seeing someone by that name.\u201D</p><p>Kojiro&#39;s nodding, but his face remains stern.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally? So it turns out you already know Kane-chan?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe would not have seen me, however. I was up above at that time.</p><p>But what&#39;s with all that? What has a hermit like me done to deserve this interview?\u201D</p><hr><p>He lets out a light sigh.</p><p>His dramatic attitude looks nothing more than an attempt to relieve some boredom at the expense of Saegusa&#39;s naivet\xE9.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh.... I-I&#39;m sorry. That wasn&#39;t my intention... I see.\u201D</p><p>She seems dejected.</p><p>It would take someone like Makidera or Tohsaka to extract a promise as overbearing as that.</p><hr><p>\u201CUmmm!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMiss Yukika?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIn that case, how about my younger brothers... would you meet them?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhy them?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf they find out that there is a real samurai here, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be astonished. And so, if you&#39;d promise, um...\u201D</p><p>Having said that much, she stays silent.</p><p>Not that it makes it any less forceful.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Hearing &quot;promise,&quot; the word causing her anxiety, a faint smile appears on Kojiro&#39;s face. There is no way Saegusa would know the weight of the promise that binds his body here.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you have little brothers, Yukika-dono?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, I am the eldest sibling.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see... They ought to be kind and loving brothers, just like their big sister.\u201D</p><p>The praise causes Saegusa&#39;s cheeks to light up bright red in an instant.</p><p>She&#39;s flustered once again.</p><hr><p>\u201CT-That&#39;s not it at all! They&#39;re troublemakers that never listen to what they&#39;re told, gluttons, all they ever do is embarrass me, and had I brought them along, I&#39;m sure they would say something bad to you, too, Kojiro-san!\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere&#39;s no need to be anxious, Miss Yukika. I believe there&#39;s nothing wrong with recollecting the days long gone, once in a while\u2015\u2015\u2015right?\u201D</p><hr><p>Nodding like that, Kojiro is getting dramatic again.</p><p>Twisted as he is, he can still weave in a glamorous quote\u2015\u2015\u2015or did he actually mean it? If that&#39;s the case, I have greatly underestimated Saegusa&#39;s skill.</p><hr><p>\u201CReally!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CLet us meet again, whenever you see fit. That said, nighttime visits are dangerous. Daytime, as the chance comes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CW-Well then, I will come visit again, this time with my brothers, sorry for imposing.\u201D</p><p>She bows deeply.</p><p>In the end, despite wanting to leave... well, I guess it&#39;s alright. So I really did end up just watching them. Kojiro knew it, but it&#39;s rather rude for me to be peeking on Saegusa.</p><hr><p>As quietly as possible, I take my leave.</p><p>\u201CWell then... How about I go have a look around the main grounds...\u201D</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest-arriving-at-the-castle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-arriving-at-the-castle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Arriving at the Castle</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest\u30FBheaven-s-dress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest\u30FBheaven-s-dress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest\u30FBHeaven&#39;s dress</h3><hr><p>I head towards the castle&#39;s parlor.</p><p>The ceiling here is very high.

Well, that&#39;s kind of vague, but if that&#39;s alright...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>Go sit over there, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>Totally outmatched, I accept my defeat and do as I&#39;m told.</p><hr><p>\u201CI made a little promise with Sakura.</p><p>One day, we&#39;d dress up and eat dinner someplace extravagant. Thinking about it, you know, this place qualifies better than anywhere else...\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? This is only a villa, so it&#39;s fairly modest.\u201D</p><p>...Guh.</p><p>If this is modest, I wonder what my house would rank.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, this is plenty extravagant. In fact, I bet this is the most extravagant castle in Japan, much less Fuyuki.\u201D</p><p>I say that without flattery.</p><p>Indifferent towards my praise of her castle, Illya starts pondering something.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see, Sakura, huh... The place is fine, but what are you going to do about the clothes?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh. I have no idea, actually.\u201D</p><p>As long as the place is set up, it&#39;s okay if I just consult with Sakura over what to wear, right?</p><hr><p>\u201C......In other words, you just thought of that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI hate to admit it, but yeah. Sorry to trouble you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, that&#39;s definitely Shirou-like. Hmm, dressing up Sakura, huh?\u201D</p><hr><p>Her arms folded behind her back, she&#39;s lost in thought.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, you two I&#39;d have to do that for.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Meaning?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIf this was a date with Rin, it&#39;d be out of the question.</p><p>Well, if it&#39;s Sakura, I&#39;ll go along with it.</p><p>Alsoo...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAfter all, Sakura&#39;s the one I have to support, and you are the one I need to look after, Shirou.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Onii-chan?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Uugh, what a useless brother I am.</p><p>Still, there&#39;s no one else I can ask.</p><p>Having stoically endured the &quot;worthless older brother&quot; branding, I&#39;m now expected to ask the splendid little sister for the favor.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, is that an &quot;OK&quot;?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, so let&#39;s have a dinner party tonight.</p><p>We should have lots of fancy clothing stored somewhere, I&#39;ll let you borrow them.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally!?\u201D</p><hr><p>Suddenly, everything&#39;s looking up.</p><p>Indeed, why wouldn&#39;t they have dresses in a castle? Meaning, the clothes part is taken care of.</p><hr><p>Thank you, Illya\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;m so happy I want to give you a big hug, right now.</p><p>...For some reason, Illya seems to be suppressing a strange giggle.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Did I do anything weird?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe. What, you haven&#39;t noticed yet?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p><p>Illya circles around while surveying me.</p><p>...I have a bad feeling about that smile.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou? Do you plan on coming to the dinner party at our castle wearing that?\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>These clothes will be fine for dinner\u2015\u2015no, I better check and make sure.</p><p>Sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers...</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, wouldn&#39;t it be bad if I don&#39;t change?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s too late to act surprised. There&#39;s no point in Sakura dressing up if you&#39;re wearing that, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI get it, but still...\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t have a suit in the first place.</p><p>Would it be better if I wore the Homurabara uniform? That&#39;s somewhat better as an outfit.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Shirou? Just like you were going to dress Sakura up, what I actually agreed to was seeing you try a few outfits on, you know?\u201D</p><hr><p>Illya giggles cheerfully.</p><p>I feel like she wants to put my consciousness into some strange doll for her to play with... did I dig my own grave, by chance?</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou? I won&#39;t ask you to come dressed for an imperial dinner, but it&#39;s not good to completely ignore manners.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is a dinner at a castle, after all, so I...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBesides, I&#39;m sure Sakura wants to see you dressed up, as well... Okay, it&#39;s decided. Sella! Liz!\u201D</p><hr><p>She only has to clap her hands once for the maids to appear.</p><p>Are they magical garden guards or something? That&#39;s how fast they came.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow may I be of service, Milady?\u201D</p><p>\u201CPrepare a tuxedo for Shirou. One with a black tie, white collared shirt and leather shoes.</p><p>When you finish, prepare a dress for Sakura, and make preparations for tonight&#39;s dinner.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAs you wish, Milady.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Isn&#39;t this too much, Illya...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight, Shirou may resist, but dress him forcibly, if necessary.\u201D</p><hr><p>Right in front of my eyes, the preparations proceed without a hitch.</p><p>To think I&#39;d get stuck wearing a tuxedo...</p><p>Not only do they have fancy dresses on hand, but even tuxedos for men... that&#39;s the Einzberns for you. Wait, this isn&#39;t the time to be impressed.</p><hr><p>\u201C...First, we need to take Emiya-sama&#39;s measurements. Leysritt!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Got it, Sella.\u201D</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know where in that dress Liz was carrying the measuring tape she just produced.</p><p>Tape in hand, Sella measures me like I&#39;m an eyesore of an obstacle to be overcome.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Are you sure I&#39;m fit for this, Illya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CJust surrender and accept it. You want to see Sakura in a dress, don&#39;t you? This is the Law of Equivalent Exchange.\u201D</p><hr><p>That was quite a magus-like statement.</p><p>...Though thinking about it, wearing the tuxedo is pretty cheap in comparison...</p><hr><p>\u201CRight, I need to go tell Sakura about this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t need to worry, I&#39;ll send Sakura a written invitation. You&#39;ll get one too, of course.\u201D</p><hr><p>A written invitation...this is the real deal.</p><p>A real dinner party would involve delivering these invites in advance, but I could never imagine getting involved in something like that.</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry for all the trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine, it&#39;s for the sake of you two, after all. Hehehe.\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s really enjoying planning this.</p><p>Liz and Sella seem to be wasting no time preparing the outfit, so I have to get ready for the worst.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-sama, the clothing has been prepared. Please come this way.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah... Illya, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll laugh after seeing me in these fancy clothes.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wonder about that. I&#39;m looking forward to it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>sigh</em>...\u201D</p><p>It&#39;s tiring to wear something you&#39;re not used to.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m constantly being strangled in this collared shirt and bow tie.</p><hr><p>I look into the mirror in front of me.</p><p>Seeing myself in a black tuxedo is really uncomfortable. I&#39;ve never even worn a suit, and this ceremonial outfit is way past that.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Besides, there&#39;s the problem of Sakura&#39;s dress.</p><p>I haven&#39;t even had a peek at it.</p><p>When I went to Sakura&#39;s room, Illya stopped me and just said &quot;look forward to when you see her.&quot;</p><hr><p>With that, I&#39;m waiting in the lobby for Sakura to finish getting ready\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>Soon, the promised time comes.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015Ehehe, it suits you well, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...!? Oh, it&#39;s just you, Illya.</p><p>Are you not dressing up?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m not part of the high society yet, this is semi-formal.</p><p>But look at you, aren&#39;t you just perfect now?\u201D</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t have a clue.</p><p>I can&#39;t really judge whether or not this tuxedo looks any good.</p><hr><p>\u201CI have no idea. This is my first time doing something like this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CReally? This look isn&#39;t like the normal you, but it&#39;s interesting in its own way.</p><p>After that... It should be the princess&#39; debut.\u201D</p><hr><p>Princess\u2015\u2015\u2015Does she mean Sakura?</p><p>I turn my attention to the grand staircase. The preparations were being made on the upper floor, so I expect her to come down that way.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>I&#39;m holding my breath waiting, but Sakura&#39;s not coming.</p><p>Maybe she got lost... as if.</p><p>Apparently tired of waiting, Illya calls out.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura? What&#39;s wrong?\u201D</p><p>\u201CU-Um, Senpai&#39;s right there, isn&#39;t he?\u201D</p><p>Only her voice reaches me.</p><p>I&#39;m glad she&#39;s actually there, but I do wonder why she won&#39;t show herself.</p><hr><p>\u201CHe&#39;s here. And in a tuxedo too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... I-Is that right?</p><p>B-But I... I don&#39;t look good in this, so, that is...\u201D</p><p>\u201CH\uFF5Em... could it be that you are embarrassed even after coming this far, Sakura?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Look at that, Sakura&#39;s embarrassed, too.</p><p>Getting invited to a fancy dress up dinner party out of the blue, I bet she&#39;d be just as shy as I am, if not more.</p><hr><p>\u201CHehe\uFF5E. And you were so into it just a little while ago, saying how glad Senpai would be to see you in that dress, weren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI-Illya-san! B-But Senpai...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell, that outfit doesn&#39;t really suit me either, so it&#39;s all good. Besides, you wouldn&#39;t look bad in anything.\u201D</p><p>Certainly not any worse than me in a tuxedo.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Senpai, um, could you please not laugh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou too, don&#39;t laugh when you see me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGeez, you two are making me mad... don&#39;t worry, Sakura. That&#39;s the best evening dress in the house. If Shirou laughs, I&#39;ll make sure to give him an appropriate punishment.\u201D</p><hr><p>She whispers to me that the reverse is also true.</p><p>...It can&#39;t be helped if I&#39;m laughed at, so I whisper to her to be gentle.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Right. Then, Senpai...\u201D</p><p>I hear the rustling of a dress.</p><p>Sakura appears above the hall.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Like the picture of a lady straight out of a movie.</p><p>A dress with a large amount of exposure around the shoulders.</p><p>Pearls and hair ornaments to accentuate her white skin.</p><p>Lips made up with rouge.</p><p>And above all, the very fact of witnessing Sakura&#39;s first dress appearance is blinding.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>We both look over each other and have no words to say.</p><p>Sakura&#39;s just standing still.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey, Shirou. Get it together and escort her, or do you plan on making a girl feel embarrassed?\u201D</p><p>An elbow pokes me in the back.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, I&#39;ll do that.\u201D</p><p>Thus prompted, I move forward.</p><p>Calming my breathing a little, I ascend the stairs.</p><p>Seeing Sakura like that, what should I say?</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, it... suits you well, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUm, you too, Senpai... It&#39;s my first time seeing you dressed so sharply.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI-Is that so...? Yeah, I guess it is.</p><p>I don&#39;t even own a suit, after all.\u201D</p><p>Having never cared about it until now, I do feel a tinge of regret.</p><p>It&#39;s not just her outfit, but Sakura even smells different.</p><p>Taking a breath\u2015\u2015I notice that it isn&#39;t the usual perfume she&#39;s wearing.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis doesn&#39;t suit me at all. If Tohsaka sees me, she&#39;ll laugh.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not true. The way Nee-san is, because this is your best, she&#39;d freeze up rather than laugh, even if you tell her to.</p><p>...Um. I-I also feel the same.</p><p>Senpai, looking at you makes me feel immensely happy.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura looks down as her cheeks turn red.</p><p>\u201C? Why would it make you happy?\u201D</p><p>That is, if someone&#39;s happy, that&#39;s got to be me.</p><hr><p>\u201CBecause... um, you look like you became a prince on a white horse, Senpai.</p><p>I always yearned for a dashing man to come for me.\u201D</p><hr><p>Still anxious, Sakura extends her hand timidly.</p><p>Her fingers, covered in a silk glove, touch my arm.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... Your arm... May I, Senpai?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course... But I still can&#39;t believe we&#39;re really doing this.\u201D</p><p>Sakura is next to me, her arm entwined with mine.</p><p>We&#39;re in the main hall of the Einzbern castle, with Sakura in a dress, it&#39;s just like a\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CThere&#39;s just no way that this is happening in Japan.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know... It&#39;s as if we&#39;re in a fairy tale.</p><p>Ever since I was a little girl, I thought it&#39;d be so lovely to go to a ball in a beautiful castle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd like a fairy tale, we even have a real witch here.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHehe\uFF5E, the evil witch you two are teasing is Rin. I&#39;m helping you out, so I&#39;m the good witch.\u201D</p><p>Illya speaks with pride.</p><p>With Sakura one step ahead of me, I escort her down the stairs.</p><p>The hem of Sakura&#39;s dress is quite long, and just brushes up against the floor.</p><hr><p>\u201CMm... I was getting a little worried, but you two look pretty good. Sweet and innocent, not bad at all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTha... Thank you, Illya-san.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry about all the trouble.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes yes, you can tell me all that later.</p><p>Dinner is ready, so come this way.\u201D</p><hr><p>Playing the hostess&#39; role, Illya bows and leads us on.</p><p>My arm is linked with Sakura&#39;s the entire time.</p><p>I may be anxious, but I can also feel Sakura&#39;s racing heartbeat within my hand. This isn&#39;t the time to be flustered.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s silverware already on the table.</p><p>Illya&#39;s seat, as the castle mistress&#39;, is at the head of the table, while Sakura and I are facing each other on opposite sides of the middle. If there were more guests lined up here, this would be quite a sight.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Aah.\u201D</p><p>And then, gallantly serving us are Sella and Liz.</p><p>The moment I realize that this marks the beginning of a formal dinner, I&#39;m unable to calm down.</p><hr><p>Looking at her, Sakura&#39;s just as awkward.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha. Senpai, I really can&#39;t calm down.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Neither can I. It&#39;d be easier if someone had taught me table manners.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s fine, I won&#39;t tell you to put green peas on your fork, or to peel an orange with a knife and fork.\u201D</p><p>Illya giggles while picking up a glass.</p><p>In our glasses as well, Sella and Liz pour us an aperitif. This really is a genuine dinner.</p><hr><p>\u201CNow then, I&#39;d like to thank you for coming to my dinner party. Shirou and Sakura.</p><p>Moreover, it&#39;s great that the clothes I picked out for you two suited you so well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s very kind of you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI can&#39;t extend proper hospitality to you today, but do make yourselves feel at home.</p><p>Okay, next is Shirou&#39;s turn.\u201D</p><hr><p>These turns are like a card game.</p><p>...Eh? I have to prepare a speech before a dinner like this? Isn&#39;t that usually for the guest of honor?</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Well...\u201D</p><p>My head is totally blank.</p><p>For the time being I take my glass in my hand, meaninglessly swirling the white liquid inside.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is\u2015\u2015Thank you for granting my entirely unreasonable request and letting us use this splendid place.</p><p>I&#39;d like to return this favor someday, Illya; and Sakura... um, well, are you enjoying it?\u201D</p><p>This is about all I can think of.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... I&#39;m happy! Very happy! This dress is beautiful, Senpai looks great, and having dinner in this splendid castle is, to me... ooh......\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Mm, ah, I shouldn&#39;t cry, but I&#39;m so happy... Thank you, Senpai, Illya-san.</p><p>I&#39;m just happy to be here, that&#39;s all.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThank you, Sakura. There isn&#39;t much else I can help you with, but I am glad that you enjoy it.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015cheers.\u201D</p><hr><p>The dinner begins.</p><p>One refined dish comes after another, accompanied by flavorful wine.</p><p>Illya looks on in a satisfied way while Sella and Liz respectfully serve the table.</p><p>Sakura is shy and reserved.</p><p>On the verge of tears, she looks to be modestly soaking in plain happiness.</p><hr><p>\u201CPhew... That was delicious, that&#39;s the cooking in Illya-san&#39;s house for you.\u201D</p><p>After dinner.</p><p>After eating dessert, I end up escorting Sakura back here.</p><hr><p>\u201CI was surprised, too. To think Liz and Sella were that good at cooking.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSella did it? Isn&#39;t there a chef? I wonder if there&#39;s any way I could learn the traditional French cuisine here... hmm.\u201D</p><hr><p>Suddenly, the topic switches to cooking.</p><p>...How pathetic.</p><p>Once in a lifetime, Sakura is dressed up and alone with me in this garden, yet I can&#39;t find anything better for us to talk about.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSenpai? Today, you granted my wish, right?\u201D</p><p>Just as I was about to open my mouth, she says that.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I suppose so. For some reason, I just remembered it, and Illya agreed to help me.</p><p>The result was much more than I expected, though.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight. Back then, I was just speaking my mind without thinking about it, but you really remembered.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s the talk we had on the way home one day.</p><p>Walking home with Sakura after eating some sweets, holding onto that secret, I wanted to grant her that little wish.</p><hr><p>\u201CThey really caught me by surprise.</p><p>Illya-san and her maids coming, preparing the dress while I was still recovering, and then inviting me to a dinner party.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... that would definitely be surprising. Sorry, I should have given some warning.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe. At first, I wondered what was going on, but when I found out I&#39;d be together with Senpai... that&#39;s when I knew what this is all about.\u201D</p><hr><p>A very sudden turn of events.</p><p>Were it not for Illya&#39;s decisiveness, I doubt it would have happened, though.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, but I had a pretty hard time, too. It didn&#39;t occur to me that I&#39;d have to dress up, as well.</p><p>Ah geez, this too\u2015\u2015well, whatever.\u201D</p><p>During the dinner, I had to restrain myself from loosening that tie.</p><p>If Sakura&#39;s still dressed up, then the wish isn&#39;t over yet.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s a good thing I asked Illya. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to keep that promise by myself.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...That&#39;s true. I couldn&#39;t dream of being able to wear a dress like this, either.\u201D</p><hr><p>Holding the hem of her dress, Sakura spins around.</p><p>Cherry blossoms dancing in the moonlit garden.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt really is just like a fairy tale.</p><p>Wearing this dress, being invited to a dinner party at a castle, Senpai coming for me, and then having a midnight talk in this garden.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yeah. It&#39;s a little much.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHehe. Maybe Illya-san really is a great witch, using some kind of wonderful sorcery.\u201D</p><hr><p>That&#39;s a good way of putting it.</p><p>However, the way a fairy tale like this usually goes, everything needs to go back to normal.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo if it was sorcery... it would have to end sometime, wouldn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. The clock hits twelve and it disappears.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen I&#39;ll leave a glass slipper on the staircase, and Senpai will take it and search for me.</p><p>But no matter what, the dressed up me won&#39;t come back.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, why is that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat way\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;ll be a beautiful memory.</p><p>Besides, more than dressing up and being with you... I want to be together with you, Senpai, as my normal self, all the time.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...That wish, no matter how small, was the real one.</p><p>There&#39;s no fairy tale princess.</p><p>How short-sighted of me. There was never anything that simple from the start.</p><hr><p>Without choosing to, our bodies touch.</p><p>Feeling her slender body against mine, I smell the fragrance of Sakura&#39;s hair. Our fingers entwine, all by themselves.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Senpai.</p><p>I&#39;m the me you&#39;ve always known, even now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s true. Sakura is Sakura.</p><p>...Sorry. I got distracted by your dress and had a stupid misunderstanding because of that.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes...!\u201D</p><p>She raises her voice in agreement.</p><p>There is no princess Sakura.</p><p>She may look like a princess before my eyes, but it&#39;s the same Sakura as always.</p><p>She had avoided making that mistake from the very start.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Senpai, is it okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo always be close to you\u2015\u2015\u2015Will you let me do that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe Matou Sakura who wants to be near you isn&#39;t a princess.</p><p>She&#39;s a plain, shy, clumsy, girl who doesn&#39;t say what&#39;s on her mind.</p><p>Is that still fine with you, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>Of course.</p><p>For as long as it is fresh in your mind, as long as the wish is there, these days will not end.</p><hr><p>\u201CShe&#39;s also jealous of Saber-san&#39;s beauty, and a bit sad seeing how well Nee-san and Rider get along with you. Is that still alright?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;m fine with that.</p><p>You&#39;re human, so you&#39;ve got a lot on your mind.</p><p>That&#39;s the Sakura I like, the one I want you to be.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Senpai.\u201D</p><p>With an intoxicating whisper, her eyes become moist.</p><p>\u201CAh, what is it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>My chest hurts.</p><p>If you look at me with those eyes, my face will burn up.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Well, that&#39;s how it is, so let&#39;s take care of each other from now on... crap, that&#39;s not like me at all.</p><p>That aperitif is making me saying some pretty embarrassing stuff. Aren&#39;t I acting strange?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, definitely not!</p><p>Yes, I think you are fine the way you are, Senpai!\u201D</p><p>An energetic response.</p><p>...Well, that&#39;s a relief.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlso, there&#39;s another good thing, I&#39;ll keep that a secret.</p><p>What you just said so clearly, will be my very own secret.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura is bashful.</p><p>That secret probably has no value to anyone else.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright. Then, from here on I&#39;ll be in your debt.\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, no, I&#39;m in debt to you.</p><p>Really, thank you for today.\u201D</p><p>She bows timidly.</p><p>Always the same no matter what, that&#39;s what gives us peace of mind more than anything else.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo. I really need to thank Illya after this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShall we have a feast for Illya-san at our place? We can have her wear a long-sleeved kimono, she&#39;ll definitely look cute.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere should be some children&#39;s <ruby>furisode<rt>formal kimono</rt></ruby> at Fuji-Nee&#39;s house... that&#39;s a good idea. This time, it&#39;ll be Illya&#39;s turn to be surprised.\u201D</p><hr><p>We leave the garden as we talk.</p><p>Our fingers are intertwined the whole time.</p><p>We maintain that gentle connection even as we pass through the door to the lobby.</p><hr><p>\u201CNow then, let&#39;s stay here tonight. I&#39;ll see you to your room.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh... it&#39;s fine. As I thought, it was Illya-san&#39;s sorcery that let us meet here. We&#39;ll part here, and come morning, I&#39;ll turn back to the normal Matou Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. Indeed, that&#39;s for the best.</p><p>In the morning, I&#39;ll revert to my normal self.</p><p>Good night, Sakura.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGood night, Senpai.\u201D</p><hr><p>We separate with a light bow to each other.</p><p>The night as dazzling as her dress comes to an end.</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Carving the burning feeling into my heart, I head towards my room to face the coming morning.</p><p>Blinking a few times, the image of the beautiful cherry blossom stays engraved into my mind.</p><hr><h3 id="demonic-nest-twilight-castle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-twilight-castle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Twilight Castle</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest-hotel-einzbern" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-hotel-einzbern" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Hotel Einzbern</h3><h3 id="demonic-nest-good-night-illya" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demonic-nest-good-night-illya" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Demonic Nest Good night - Illya</h3><hr><p>\u201C.........\u201D</p><p>Now that I&#39;m alone in here, the first thing I&#39;ll do is check out the room.</p><p>It&#39;s not all that bad being shut up in here this way... but the fact that Sella seemed to enjoy it so much is another story.</p><hr><p>\u201C...This room&#39;s not booby-trapped, is it?\u201D</p><p>No ceiling that will descend and crush me, or briars that will grow out of the floor, or walls that will close in on me, or water that will flood in... right?</p><p>\u201C..................Well, it seems safe enough.\u201D</p><p>After investigating the room and finding it free of any traps either modern or antiquated, I felt safe for the time being.</p><hr><p>\u201CEven you are not evil enough to do something like that, eh, Sella?</p><p>...Well, that&#39;s good. I&#39;m tired, so I&#39;ll turn in for the night...\u201D</p><p>I&#39;ll just fall asleep in here.</p><p>Man is the kind of animal that, if he really puts his mind to it, can sleep just about anywhere.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou? Are you in there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIllya...?\u201D</p><p>I sit up from the floor at the arrival of a sudden visitor.</p><p>In through the door comes Illya.</p><p>After a glance at my surroundings\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you doing in the storeroom?</p><p>Shirou, can you not relax unless the room looks like your storehouse?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, this is my room for the night.\u201D</p><p>Looking what must be somewhat desperate, I hold in a yawn as I answer her.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Ooh, she&#39;s definitely shocked now.</p><hr><p>\u201CThere are plenty of guest rooms you could have used.</p><p>Did you ask to stay here because you didn&#39;t want to impose, by chance?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not it. Sella just went, &quot;This is your bedroom, Emiya-sama,&quot; and shut me up in here before I could do anything.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh... Oh, Sella! What have you done this time!?</p><p>Having Shirou stay in a storeroom like this!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou said it. I thought she&#39;d at least let me sleep in a bed.\u201D</p><p>&quot;You must not, Milady. A doghouse is more than appropriate for an underfed dog that may bite you any moment. Albeit lacking in taste as he is, I am sure he will voice no objections to it, hahaha.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CHonestly. This is an embarrassment to me as your hostess.</p><p>...Shirou, I can&#39;t allow you to stay in here.\u201D</p><p>Burning with righteous indignation, Illya pulls me toward the door by the hand.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>\u201CYou must not, Milady.\u201D</p><p>The black maid appears without a sound.</p><p>Can these maids just appear at will anywhere in the castle or something?</p><p>And though her uniform is mostly white, it&#39;s certainly appropriate to call her black.</p><hr><p>\u201CSella!\u201D</p><p>\u201CMilady&#39;s most gracious hospitality is entirely wasted on a commoner of such suspicious breeding as this one. Still, though I had originally planned to place him in the kennel outside, I not only made ready this room for him, but went to great pains securing the sleeping bag for his use as well.</p><p>By my judgment, this warm demonstration of our Einzbern hospitality is well beyond what he deserves.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................Um.\u201D</p><p>Uh-oh. I don&#39;t like where this is going.</p><hr><p>\u201CSella. Prepare a guest room at once.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMilady-\u201D</p><p>\u201CI cannot let Shirou sleep in such a place. He is my guest.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut is it not forbidden for the mistress of the household to allow outsiders to stay so indiscriminately at the castle\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Not good. This is turning into a quarrel between Sella and Illya.</p><p>\u201CPardon me, you two.\u201D</p><p>After clearing my throat to draw their attention, I speak up.</p><hr><p>\u201CPersonally, I&#39;m fine with this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI have a roof over my head and windows that don&#39;t let the draft in. This sleeping bag doesn&#39;t even seem to have any holes in it. This is more than enough to tide me over for one night. It&#39;s a big step up from sleeping in the forest ruins out there, that&#39;s for sure.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You have my admiration. It seems that you possess an unusually discerning eye for quality, Emiya-sama.\u201D</p><p>Sella slowly nods.</p><p>She seems almost sincere... the key word being &quot;almost.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201CSo as I was saying, I&#39;ll stay here for the night. I got to eat such an amazing feast at dinner, I feel like I can handle anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015All right.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI am very glad to see that we are in agreement, Emiya-sama.</p><p>Now then, Milady, the time has come for lights out. Let us return to your chambers.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGoodnight, Illya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, see you tomorrow.\u201D</p><p>...I notice that neither of them said &quot;goodnight.&quot;</p><p>You&#39;ve got to admit, as a bedroom, this place is severely lacking in creature comforts.</p><p>But all I have to do for it to stop bothering me is fall asleep.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................Hm?\u201D</p><p>The creaking of a hinge reaches my ears.</p><p>Just as I was finally starting to fall asleep, too... the moment I thought that, I realized someone else had come into the room.</p><hr><p>\u201COnii-chan... are you awake?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIllya?\u201D</p><p>She came here alone this late at night?</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, I am. It&#39;s not about what happened, is it...?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is. Even Sella&#39;s not up this late.</p><p>I know you were trying to put on a brave front before, but there&#39;s just no way I can leave you in here all night.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Illya.\u201D</p><p>She came all this way, alone through the dark of the castle night, just for me?</p><p>Refusing her after all that would be more impolite than anything.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhh... What an idiot I am. I should have just said yes the first time you asked me.</p><p>So where do you want to put me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSomewhere really close. Why don&#39;t we sleep together in my room, Onii-chan?\u201D</p><p>Illya&#39;s room, huh? Sounds good to m\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>W-What did she say\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><p>Sleeping in her room... and together, at that!?</p><p>You idiot! She&#39;s like your little sister! No, wait, if that&#39;s the case, then what&#39;s the problem? I mean, Illya may be small, but she&#39;s still a lady! There&#39;s definitely a problem with just jumping into bed with her there, though really, this whole situation is nothing but one big problem\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat&#39;s wrong, Shirou? You look restless.\u201D</p><p>Nothing&#39;s wrong, and yet an incredibly ominous feeling is clinging to me.</p><p>I can&#39;t go, and yet I can&#39;t tell her that I won&#39;t.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph... Shirou, do you hate the thought of going to my room that much? Is it because I held you prisoner in there before?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s really not it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph. If you won&#39;t come to my room, I&#39;ll just have to sleep in here.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Fwoomp,&quot; she flops onto the cheap air mattress beside me.</p><p>...I&#39;ve decided. I can&#39;t allow Illya to sleep in a place like this.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. Well then, Illya, do you really mind if I take you up on your offer?\u201D</p><p>\u201COf course not!</p><p>Hurray! I get to be with Shirou all night!\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s in a good mood.</p><p>If that&#39;s all it takes to make her happy, then this must have been the right choice... right?</p><hr><p>That prison cell\u2015\u2015\u2015er, I mean, temporary guest room, can&#39;t even be compared to the gorgeous bedroom I find myself in.</p><p>Sleeping here with Illya will be much more relaxing than spending the night alone in that room... or so I thought, anyway.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou? Would you turn that way for a second?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CObviously, I can&#39;t go to bed wearing this, can I?</p><p>I&#39;ll be done in a minute...\u201D</p><p>Ah... that&#39;s right, it&#39;s different for her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ehehehe.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat is it, Illya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CCould it be that you want to watch me? I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s you, Onii-chan.\u201D</p><p>Hey now, what the hell do you think you&#39;re saying?</p><p>Illya may not be quite old enough to feel it, but there ought to be some natural shyness between a boy and a girl.</p><hr><p>\u201CAll right, all right. You&#39;re no fun to tease at all, you know that, Shirou? Go ahead and look the other way for a minute.\u201D</p><p>I do as she tells me.</p><p>...True, a part of me does regret the missed opportunity.</p><hr><p>With that, silence returns to envelop the room.</p><p>I hear the rustling of clothes.</p><p>And after that, I feel her slipping under the covers with my back.</p><p>\u201COkay, Onii-chan, all done\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Illya and I lie in bed side by side.</p><p>Even if we both stretch out our arms and legs, there&#39;s room to spare.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, can I move in closer?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFine by me. Actually, since the bed is so wide, we ought to get as close together as we can to keep out the draft. I wouldn&#39;t be able to look Sella and Liz in the eye if you end up catching a cold because of me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CY-Yeah, you&#39;re right... Well then, excuse me.\u201D</p><p>Her body snuggles close to mine.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Ehehe.\u201D</p><p>Her laughter, though colored with a slight shyness, is happy.</p><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>Coming here was the right thing to do.</p><p>This bed is too big and cold for such a small girl to sleep in alone.</p><hr><p>\u201CMmm... Shirou, you&#39;re so warm. It&#39;s like sleeping with a hot water bottle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CA hot water bottle? You sure do things the old-fashioned way around here, don&#39;t you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. It reminds me of something that Mother told me while Kiritsugu was away.</p><p>She said it was even colder here than she&#39;d thought it would be, and she missed her hot water bottle. I think I finally understand what she meant now.\u201D</p><hr><p>Illya nestles closer, rubbing her cheek against my chest.</p><p>The way she&#39;s holding on to me, I almost feel like a big teddy bear... speaking of which, this room sure has a lot of them.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Do you always sleep with a stuffed animal?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, like Bonifacius and Otto? Yeah, sometimes.\u201D</p><p>I see she&#39;s still thinking up some pretty unique names for them.</p><p>The thought of Illya dressed in her pajamas, cuddling up to a teddy bear, is a lovely image, but also a very lonely one.</p><hr><p>\u201CTonight&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve seen me in my pajamas, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>What do you think? Do they suit me?\u201D</p><p>I pat her suddenly inquisitive head.</p><p>Her hair is as smooth and fine as any silk. She smiles under my hand and snuggles up against it.</p><hr><p>\u201CThey&#39;re adorable. You&#39;re like a princess in a fairy tale.\u201D</p><p>\u201CEhe. Until now, nobody ever told me that... mm.\u201D</p><p>Gentle warmth has begun to permeate Illya&#39;s little body.</p><p>She should be able to drift off into a comfortable sleep now.</p><hr><p>\u201COnii-chan?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm... what is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDid you ever sleep together with anyone when you were little?\u201D</p><p>Long ago\u2015\u2015\u2015Kiritsugu had the tendency to take off on long journeys at a moment&#39;s notice, so he wasn&#39;t around much. And Fuji-Nee didn&#39;t stay over much back then. So I don&#39;t really have any memories like that.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow about you? Did you sleep together with your mom, maybe?\u201D</p><p>It seemed like a normal response to her question.</p><p>But as the words left my mouth, I felt her tighten her hold on my chest.</p><p>Her body went rigid, as though out of fear. I gently stroke her back to comfort her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have brought that up. I never had anyone to sleep with, either, so I&#39;m a little nervous.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMmm... mm, hehehehe.\u201D</p><p>At last, the tension fades from Illya&#39;s body.</p><p>Her faint warmth and gentle sleepy breaths resume.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ve always slept alone in this bed, and it gets so cold. But now that you&#39;re here with me, Onii-chan, it&#39;s so warm ...and nice...\u201D</p><p>A yawn follows on the heels of her drowsy proclamation.</p><p>\u201CToday was just like a dream.</p><p>It would be wonderful if I could sleep together with Shirou every night from now on... I&#39;d be so happy.\u201D</p><hr><p>Half of what she&#39;s saying at this point must be sleep-talk, but I know she means it.</p><p>Through her drowsiness, Illya speaks almost as if to someone who&#39;s no longer here.</p><hr><p>\u201C...It sure would. Although every night might be kind of a stretch.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I toss and turn in my sleep, too. You&#39;ll probably feel pretty disillusioned after tonight.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I already knew all that. I&#39;ll make sure to fix you so you don&#39;t, so you have nothing to worry about.\u201D</p><hr><p>I feel her wrap me tighter into her embrace.</p><p>The warmth has permeated my body, too, and I can feel my eyelids growing heavy.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m hearing my own voice from somewhere far away, as though it belongs to another person.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hehe. You really are hopeless without me, Shirou\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>The words of the half-asleep Illya tickle my ears.</p><p>Her body is faintly warm, and soft like a kitten&#39;s.</p><hr><p>\u201C<em>yawn</em>... We should go to sleep now, Illya.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou&#39;re right. You have another busy day ahead of you tomorrow.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, Onii-chan.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Sounding well satisfied, her voice fades to a murmur before gentle sleeping breaths replace it.</p><p>Feeling her body temperature against me, my consciousness drifts from reality into a happy dream.</p><hr><p>The night of the fourth day wears on.</p><p>I lie submerged in a happiness gentle enough to bring tears to my eyes.</p><p>In the midst of the many ends now approaching, this slumber remains the only point of pure, unclouded bliss.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Which is why it&#39;s a little sad.</p><p>It has to be as perfect as it can be.</p><p>The next time I open my eyes in the midst of many beginnings and forfeit this go around, this will be what I treasure the most.</p><hr>', 1018);
