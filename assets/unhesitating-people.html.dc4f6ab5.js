Kirei goes to look for her.</p><p><strong>Track 1</strong></p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Is it this time already? Rin\u2019s out playing too late. She can\u2019t have been caught up in some sort of accident or incident, can she\u2026 No, no, I must be overthinking this\u2026</p><p>[Tokiomi enters]</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Ah, honey\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> What\u2019s wrong?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026It\u2019s nothing. Ah, Kotomine-san is here as well?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Yes. There are a few things to report.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Has something happened?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> No\u2026 Please don\u2019t mind me.</p><p>Narrator: Sound Drama Fate/Zero Anthology Drama 2, Unhesitating People</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Yesterday night, children\u2019s corpses were found in an apartment in the city. They were found two days after death and there were no signs of struggle in the room, so we may determine that the culprit is again the thrill-seeking murderer who commits crime for fun from several days ago. The criminal currently remains on the run, and there are no trails to follow, so the investigation is not progressing smoothly.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> A thrill-seeking murderer\u2026 There is a chance that he is hiding in the city\u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Is it necessary to have Assassin expand the search and eliminate him?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> If the police are truly powerless, this can be considered. It is after all the police\u2019s duty, originally, so we have no need to interfere. Is there anything else?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Regarding the Citizen\u2019s Hall being built on the leyline, there do not appear to be any particular abnormal circumstances and the construction is progressing smoothly. As a precaution, should we assign Assassin to monitor it?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> There is no need, so it will be fine to keep them on their usual patrols. That location will not be needed, because the place where the Grail is to be summoned is in the Tohsaka residence.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Understood. (This judgement means that he thinks the one who will win the Grail will definitely be himself\u2026 Considering that other Masters may use that location, it would be better to completely clear the place of any uncertain elements. Nevermind, it will be fine if I just pay some more attention to this.)</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Just what has happened to Rin\u2026 If I had known this would happen, perhaps we would have moved back to our old home sooner, or even had her quit school\u2026 That person seems so tired from preparing for the Grail War, and we\u2019ve dismissed all our servants, too\u2026 Hmm, I suppose I will have to be the one to search for her\u2026</p><p>[Exits]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> My wife seems to have gone out, making the boundary field react.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Does she require protection from Assassin?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> No need. I expect that she will only be walking around nearby. There are other missions for Assassin.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Speaking which, your daughter does not seem to have returned home\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Rin, you mean? Is that something you should worry this much about?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> If times were normal, this would not require much concern. However, for the young lady who perseveres in magecraft training every day not to return at the usual time without saying a word to her mother, I cannot help but catch the scent of gunpowder in this situation\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Do you mean to say that something unfortunate may have happened?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> So, this was what my wife was concerned about\u2026!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> As reported previously, considering that the police have been unable to capture the serial killer, walking on the street without any defenses seems too careless\u2026 Considering the other possible sudden incidents, it is not only your daughter but also your wife who may find themselves under threat.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Not all the enemies are mages\u2026? I understand, I will go out to pick up my wife. Sorry to trouble you, Kirei, but may I assign you the mission of searching for Rin?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Don\u2019t forget, you and I appear on the surface to have severed all ties with one another. Pay constant attention to your surroundings when acting. Report to me immediately after you find Rin.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Track 2</strong></p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> According to Assassin\u2019s report, she should be in this park\u2026 Hmm?</p><p>[Goes closer]</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Rin!</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> \u2026Hmm? Who are you?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> It is me. After changing my attire, you could not recognise me?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Ki-Kirei?! You\u2026! No, why are you here?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Shh! Remember! We met here by coincidence, because Tokiomi-shi and I currently appear to be in opposition.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> I know. But this outfit of yours\u2026 So you actually have clothes other than your clerical clothes! \u2026They look pretty fashionable, too~ It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you wear earrings~</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I do not often wear casual clothes, but this is for avoiding attention, since my usual attire is too noticeable in a crowd. Then, Rin, what has happened to make you this dirty? You look as though you have been in a fight.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Wha\u2026!?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Your hair is also messy.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> \u2026Aahhh!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> If Tokiomi-shi found out, he would likely be disappointed in you. For the Tohsaka daughter, who should become a fine lady, to fall to this state\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Do you plan to tell Father?!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> That depends on your reason.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> I have a good reason!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Really, what kind of reason is it?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Kotone\u2026 My friend was being bullied, so I\u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026Heheh.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> D-don\u2019t laugh!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Ah, sorry.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Those people don\u2019t listen to reason at all! Even though I warned them several times not to try anything on my friends! \u2026Wait, so you\u2019re here to look for me?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> The one who wishes to find you is the madam. She should be with Tokiomi-shi right now.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> I-I see. Anyway, even if you didn\u2019t pick me up, I can get home by myself!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> That may be so.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> In any case, we should go back now, here\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> As I said! I can get home by myself!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026Heheh. \u2026I seem to be disliked.</p><p>[Laugh]</p><p>[Walking]</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Speaking which, Rin, can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Your friend called Kotone and those who bullied her are in what condition now?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Kotone ran away first, and as for that bunch of bad children\u2026 I paid them back several times more, so they should be running back home crying for their mommies now!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026I see.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Of course, that was without magecraft~</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Don\u2019t take these things too seriously.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> It\u2019s a matter of course! As a daughter of the Tohsaka family, I have to rescue the weak and not pick on them~</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> [Laugh]</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> According to the familiar\u2019s report, she should be near here\u2026 There she is.</p><p>[Walks closer]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Aoi, what are you doing in a place like this?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Honey\u2026? \u2026Why\u2026?! Ah, no\u2026 Sorry, I left the house on my own\u2026 (TL: Because looking for your daughter instead of staying in the kitchen is a crime of the highest order.)</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> I\u2019m not blaming you. I have heard from Kirei that Rin has not yet returned. Is your outing linked with this?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Uh, mhm. That child didn\u2019t come home at the usual time, so I\u2019m a little worried\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Kirei has gone to find Rin. He should contact me before long.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> I am truly sorry\u2026honey\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> It\u2019s nothing. You didn\u2019t want to bother us, so you went out on your own, I can understand this much.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Mhm.</p><p><strong>Track 3</strong></p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Oh dear\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> What? What is it?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I cannot contact Tokiomi-shi.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> What?! Exactly what\u2019s going on?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Most likely because he is highly on guard against enemies, he is using a very powerful concealment spell.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> As expected of Father!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Now is not the time for such remarks.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Isn\u2019t it just that you\u2019re incompetent?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Hmph. In order to make him become alert sooner, I reported the murder to him, but it seems like he has overdone it. There is no other way. Assassin, spare no effort in searching for Tokiomi\u2019s location.</p><p>[Assassin exits]</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Heh! Let me go and find Father and Mother!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Rin! Where are you going?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> If it\u2019s them, then they must be in this direction~ This way~</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> What does she base this on\u2026</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> What\u2019s wrong, honey?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> It seems like a suspicious person passed just now. I\u2019ll enhance the presence concealment.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Sorry, it\u2019s all because I\u2019m here\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Don\u2019t worry, this level was within my expectations.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Alright.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> [Casting] \u2026Good\u2026But\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Is there\u2026something else?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> If I don\u2019t want people to know the connection between Kirei and I, I can\u2019t easily have contact with him.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> I never thought that he would hide his tracks so well that even Assassin could not detect them\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> What are you doing, Kirei? Hurry up and come here!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> [Sigh] (TL: And Kirei turns into Kyon.)</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Will you try to contact Kirei-san using the radio or telephone?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Kirei, too, said to prepare these\u2026but\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> You can\u2019t get used to them, after all\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> He will find some way to contact me. Before that, spending some time talking a walk is not bad.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026But\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> You have no need to worry, I\u2019m here.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Yes, honey.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Rin, where is this place?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> This, this is strange, I thought that if it\u2019s Mother, she\u2019d definitely come here\u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> These are truly brilliant searching skills\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Y-you\u2019re annoying. I\u2019m going on to the next spot! Kirei!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> \u2026Mm.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> The buildings around here are not elegant enough no matter how one looks at them\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> According to the advertising on the development plan, they seem to be stressing convenience\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> At the same time as emphasising convenience, they should also aim for overall relaxation. If you look over there now, the buildings here are too tidy and uniform, making people feel tense just by looking at them. They should use a broader, looser distribution of space, and take into consideration the views and enjoyment of the passers-by right from the planning stage\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> [Laugh]</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Sorry, this isn\u2019t really a topic suited to the moment.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> No problem, it matches your personality well.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Honestly! Where have Father and Mother gone?!</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Rin\u2026 I suppose you did not plan to just wander randomly with me\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Don\u2019t say such ridiculous things!</p><p>[Pause]</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Honey\u2026 Look at that\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> \u2026Oh, it certainly isn\u2019t a bad scene.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Yes\u2026 Such a beautiful sunset\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> In this city, there still are some things to take pride in\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> That\u2019s right, I never knew we were able to see such a beautiful setting sun at this place, this time.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> When will it be the next time\u2026we can see this again\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Honey\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Ah, I said something disheartening, just forget about it.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026Next time\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Next time, let\u2019s bring Rin along and come here together.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> \u2026That will be fine.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p>[Door opens]</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Ah\u2026so tired\u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> In the end you just came back home. Where could tokiomi-shi have gone\u2026</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> \u2026?!</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Aahhh\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Rin!</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Mother! Father! [Runs]</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Rin! Rin! This child really\u2026makes people worry\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Mother! Ow, ouch\u2026 Uh, sorry that I\u2019m late\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Kirei, where were you and what were you two doing?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Ah, yes. I was bringing your daughter\u2026 How about you, Tokiomi-shi?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Ah\u2026 I felt that I was watched when I was on the street, so I hid my tracks. I thought that there would be nothing to worry about after getting here, so I released the spell.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> So that\u2019s how it is.</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> What is this about?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Nothing, it is not important.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re safe\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Mhm! You too, Mother!</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Then, Kirei, there is something we must continue, let\u2019s go.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> \u2026Father!</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Uh\u2026 I\u2019m extremely sorry! I\u2026</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> Rin!</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> \u2026Next time, together, we\u2026</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Tokiomi:</strong> No, nothing. Aoi, I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> Yes, honey.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Mother? What did Father want to say?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong> [Laugh] We\u2019ll tell you next time, after everything is over\u2026</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> [Laugh]</p>', 194);
