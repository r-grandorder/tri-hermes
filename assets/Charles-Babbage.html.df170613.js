There was more than enough of it.<br> However. The second component was insufficient. As in, time and equipment. To finance these, he needed funds.<br> With the Royal Society of the British Empire&#39;s authorization as the foundation, the British government acknowledged his theory and \u300CDifference Engine\u300D and provided him with fund at first, but eventually stopped supporting the projects.<br> However, instead of giving up, he started to work on a machine capable of even more advanced calculations, the \u300CAnalytical Engine\u300D.<br> This was a machine that could run the world&#39;s first program and it could make complete calculations (Turing completeness) a reality.</p><p>Halfway through his ambition, he died.<br> The Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine were both unfinished.<br> He died, leaving behind to the world the dream of an envisioned future that vanished into the \u300Cthreshold of the eras\u300D.<br> Eventually, advanced computing machines intended for the same function were invented as electronical devices and the world flourished.

It&#39;s assumed that the arms are controlled from there.</p><p>Instead of the walking stick of a gentleman, the weapon was changed into a drill.<br> To be accurate it&#39;s not a drill, but a cross between a group of gears extracted from the Difference Engine and a tunnel boring machine.<br> The official stance on why a gentlemen is wielding something like a weapon of a savage tribe, is that a gentleman does not use uncivilized tools like blades or guns, and you can&#39;t beat others up with a calculator.
