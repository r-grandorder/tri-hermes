This is beyond comprehension.</p><p>She is a heap of a Servant*, admiring the culture of idol while also having the attribute of a princess dreaming in her castle. Completely cutting off her anecdote of piercing torture Iron Maiden by treating it as \u201Ctotally have nothing to do with me\u201D, she changes her weapon from a spear to a fork. Due to her overflowing magic energy, she is able to perform magic even if she had never really learn it. She herself totally doesn\u2019t get how it works.

It\u2019s not a lance, it\u2019s a fork, so please forgive me...! Her clothing is pretty showy, and I\u2019m pleased with that. I don\u2019t have a 5 star Caster other than Tamamo, so everytime I need some firepower for a Caster assault it\u2019s always HalloEli. Due to that, I\u2019m seeing her a lot., so I\u2019m glad I got her clothes good. Please give more event Servants!!!!
