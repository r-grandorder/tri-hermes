It contains major spoilers, so for anime-only fans I recommend listening/reading after you see the second movie (and I do recommend it). I also recommend listening to the CD itself if you can obtain it since Kamiya Hiroshi does a fantastic job as always.</p><p>Many thanks to Milbunk for buying the CD and letting me listen!</p><hr><hr><p>(A door creaks open and shuts. A clock is ticking in the background throughout)</p><p>Hey there. Thanks for coming, whoever you are. What\u2019s that? You want to hear what I have to say? Oh, if you insist. Well then, make sure to write it all down. It\u2019s a magus\u2019s responsibility to keep everything well documented, after all.</p><p>This is the fifth Holy Grail War, and Caster and Lancer are already gone. Why? Well, either they were just plain weak, or someone was just really bad at using Servants. Obviously, my Rider will be the last one standing. Things have finally gotten interesting, so I was just thinking that wanted to talk about it. I\u2019ve got a pretty good picture of what\u2019s going to happen in this fifth Holy Grail War from here on out, and I\u2019ve looked into the other Masters.</p><p>Tohsaka\u2019s Servant is Archer. Being that he\u2019s an Archer, I figured he\u2019d be attacking from a long range, but he uses swords, apparently. Anyone who can\u2019t get their tactics straight is most likely weak. Why\u2019d she even make a contract with someone like that? I need Tohsaka to at least make a good showing or the three families are going to look bad. Oh well, if she loses, I guess it just means she didn\u2019t have what it takes.</p><p>Emiya\u2019s Saber\u2026 got me with a surprise attack a little while ago, but I\u2019m not going to lose next time. Last time Rider just screwed up.</p><p>I think the Berserker this time will be a tough fight. After all, he\u2019s Heracles. Just knowing his true name doesn\u2019t make him any easier to go up against. If possible\u2026 I\u2019d like for him and someone else to take each other out. If not, these guys will be the last ones remaining. Well, I do have a countermeasure in place, though. If we do end up fighting, then\u2026 I\u2019ve got something good set up at school. Look forward to it.</p><p>It seems Assassin showed up at Ryuudou Temple\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure where he is now. Well, I\u2019ve never heard of an Assassin being powerful, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth worrying about.</p><p>You want to know how I\u2019m planning to fight from here on out? To answer that question, I\u2019ll need to talk about the magecraft that\u2019s passed down in my family. Yes \u2014 the Makiri magecraft.</p><p>When I first learned about it, I was still just a kid.</p><p><strong>Young Shinji:</strong> (gasp)</p><p>There were mountains of books. Magecraft materials, samples and experiments, too. To my young mind they felt like things that I shouldn\u2019t readily touch.</p><p><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CAmazing\u2026\u201D<br><strong>Zouken:</strong>: \u201CWho goes there?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> (gasps and runs)</p><p>As I sprinted down the hallway, I was filled with excitement. No surprise there \u2014 I\u2019d just learned that magic was real. I think you\u2019d feel the same, wouldn\u2019t you?</p><p>And after that\u2026 Sakura came to our home.</p><p><strong>Young Shinji:</strong> \u201CWhat was your name, again?\u201D<br><strong>Young Sakura:</strong> \u201CI\u2019m\u2026 Sakura.\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CHmm. Just try not to get in my way. I\u2019m your Nii-san, after all.\u201D<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u201CYes\u2026 Nii-san.\u201D</p><p><strong>Shinji:</strong> (quietly) \u201C\u2026Sakura\u2026 my\u2026 little sister.\u201D</p><p><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CHey, Sakura. My family has a secret. Bet you wanna know what it is, huh?\u201D<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u201CA secret\u2026?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CIf you keep doing as I say, I might just tell you sooner or later.\u201D<br><strong>Byakuya:</strong> \u201CShinji. That\u2019s not something you should be saying to Sakura. You\u2019re the only son of the Matou family. Understand?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CHuh\u2026?\u201D</p><p>The Matous were a special family that passed secrets down through the generations. I learned that from my father later on. I use the past tense because there are no Matous that can use magecraft anymore. Magic circuits have been lost from the Matou line, and neither my father nor I were born with circuits.</p><p>(sound of paper rustling)<br><strong>Young Shinji:</strong> \u201CNo, but\u2026 I\u2019m going to make myself understand it! I\u2019m going to inherit this power! After all, all this accumulated knowledge and craft is the real thing!\u201D</p><p>From then on, I spent long hours in the library, immersing myself in books. The more I studied magecraft, the more I understood that a magus doesn\u2019t only need knowledge of magecraft, but to excel in other fields as well. One could become a first-rate magus only by honing various other skills.</p><p><strong>Teacher:</strong> \u201CA student in our class has placed within the top three of our school: Matou-kun.\u201D<br> (sounds of admiration from the students)</p><p><strong>Boy:</strong> \u201CMatou-kun, could I ask you to be the anchor leg in the relay on track and field day?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CSure.\u201D<br><strong>Boy:</strong> \u201CAll right, now we\u2019ve got this in the bag!\u201D</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong> \u201CMatou-kun, aren\u2019t you going to run for student council?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CI\u2019m not so good at taking center stage. There\u2019s still ways to offer support even if I\u2019m not on the council, right? If you\u2019re going to do it, I\u2019ll help you.\u201D<br><strong>Girl:</strong> \u201CAh\u2026 thank you!\u201D</p><p><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CYou done your homework yet?\u201D<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u201C\u2026Not yet.\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CYou still haven\u2019t done it? You sure are slow in the head. Don\u2019t go leaving it undone just because there\u2019s parts you don\u2019t know how to do. If you really don\u2019t understand it, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201D<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u201C\u2026Okay.\u201D</p><p>I finished reading all the books in the house. Most of the magecraft books ended abruptly midway through. I ran magecraft experiments myself to the best of my ability. It wasn\u2019t a straightforward process, obviously. I guess the Makiri blood really had died out, since I couldn\u2019t get the magic circuits in my body to activate no matter what I did. But still, even still \u2014 there must have been something I would be able to do.</p><p>The Matou magecraft specialty is absorption. It\u2019s heavily dependent on the individual\u2019s talent, so it really wasn\u2019t suited for someone without magic circuits like myself. But even so, this world of magi was really something special to me. I repeated the experiments, making adjustments bit by bit. It never went right. That\u2019s around the time I met him \u2014 Emiya Shirou.</p><p>(crickets in background, door opening)<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CAre you planning on doing this all yourself? Why are you even doing this?\u201D<br><strong>Shirou:</strong> \u201CWhat do you mean \u2018why\u2019? I was asked to.\u201D</p><p>Based on the reasoning that he \u201Cwas asked to\u201D \u2014 if you can even call that a reason \u2014 he\u2019d taken on a workload that he was unlikely to be able to handle even if he took all day.</p><p><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CAs if you\u2019re going to be able to finish this by yourself! Are you stupid?\u201D<br><strong>Shirou:</strong> \u201CNah, it\u2019ll take some time, but if I keep at it, I\u2019ll finish it. Hmm\u2026 guess I\u2019ll start here.\u201D</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> \u201C\u2026Aren\u2019t you going home?\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CWill me answering that get your work done?\u201D<br><strong>Shirou:</strong> \u201CNo, I guess not.\u201D</p><p>(birds tweeting)<br><strong>Shirou:</strong> \u201CThat oughta do it.\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CHmm. So you did finish it. \u2026Hmmm\u2026 not bad, I guess?\u201D<br> (Shirou laughs)</p><p>I\u2019ve known Emiya for four years since then. We did a lot together. When he told me that he made the boxed lunches that he brought to track and field day himself, it surprised me, and\u2026 I gave cooking a try. That helped with my magecraft, I guess.</p><p>\u2026Ah? Friends? As if he\u2019d ever have friends. Emiya himself doesn\u2019t even possess the concept of having friends. I looked after him because it wasn\u2019t like anyone else was going to do it. He was more trustworthy than the people who crowded around me trying to hang out, anyway. \u2026So when I found out he was a magus, I guess there was a part of me that felt like it made sense. Magi have to be independent and self-reliant, right? I\u2019m the same, obviously. Magecraft is recorded and passed on, but at the same time, it has to be kept secret. I can\u2019t just get all friendly with normal people.</p><p>That reminds me\u2026 Tohsaka Rin. I might be willing to do her the favour of going out with her. (giggle) Tohsaka\u2019s so shy, you see. I try to start up conversation with her myself when I can, but\u2013 huh? Oh. You want to know about Sakura.</p><p>\u2026It was three years ago when I found that room.</p><p>(sounds of worms crawling)<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201C\u2026Huh?\u201D<br><strong>Byakuya:</strong> \u201CWhat do you want, Shinji?\u201D</p><p>A room I had never been told about. Knowledge that hadn\u2019t been taught to be. And talents that I hadn\u2019t been given. I wasn\u2019t the one who was special. My sister wasn\u2019t the one who was isolated. The one who was pathetic was\u2013</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Nii-san.\u201D<br><strong>Shinji:</strong> \u201CDon\u2019t fucking apologize!\u201D</p><p>From then on, whenever Sakura and I crossed paths, she didn\u2019t even look at me. Even as she acted all timid and apologized, I could see in her eyes that she was mocking me. But, hey. That\u2019s not how things should be, right? It\u2019s wrong. If Sakura\u2019s more suited to be the heir than me \u2014 me, the one who\u2019s blood related, the one who studied the Matou magecraft this hard \u2014 then I should get some sort of compensation too! Which means \u2014 I should be able to do whatever I want with her, right? That\u2019s why Sakura apologizes to me, right?!</p><p>Huh?! \u201CWhat\u2019s Sakura doing now\u201D?! Ugh\u2026 what the hell. Even you\u2019re all about Sakura in the end. \u2026Sakura hasn\u2019t been back here for a few days now. Ha! She\u2019s probably still with Emiya. Ever since she got to know him, she\u2019s started talking back like she\u2019s a normal fucking person. So, y\u2019see, that\u2019s why I used Sakura to call Emiya to the school\u2026!<br> Aaah, shit. I can\u2019t remember too well. But\u2026 I\u2019m here, so that must mean I won, right? Haha, that\u2019s right. I can\u2019t lose, that\u2019s impossible!</p><p>\u2026I guess the sun\u2019s gone down. It\u2019s gotten dark in here. I can\u2019t see you anymore.</p><p>(clock ticking faster)</p><p>Hey\u2026 would you mind turning on the lights? You can\u2019t write like this either\u2026 right?</p><p>Ah\u2026 You see\u2026?</p><p>\u2026It\u2019s pitch black in here.</p><p>(ticking stops)</p>', 51);
