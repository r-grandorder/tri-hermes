You know, even now, that country is very sensitive to other cultures.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah, that\u2019s how it is.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Even if it would not affect the other Servants or Masters, just for the sake of avoiding unnecessary trouble, some degree of disguise is needed.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Don\u2019t worry, dear, in the 200 years since the Grail War began, us Einzbern have headed to Fuyuki City to take part in it. We know all the rules set in the shadows like the backs of our hands, and this time, too, we\u2019ll abide by them.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> That\u2019s true.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You\u2019re trying to teach an expert here.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> [Laugh]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Anyway, we haven\u2019t spared any effort in studying Japanese culture, and we\u2019ve prepared everything.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Hmm? What\u2019s this?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What do you mean, \u201Cwhat\u201D, it\u2019s traditional Japanese clothing. If I wear this, I won\u2019t look strange in a crowd.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Uh\u2026 Where did you get this?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I don\u2019t know\u2026 I think the family head a few generations ago obtained it and hid it in the castle\u2026</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> I\u2019m sorry, Iri, but nowadays Japanese people don\u2019t usually wear kimono.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah? Really?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Mhm. Some older women might. Anyway, one with such an extravagant and eye-catching pattern would only be worn for New Year or coming-of-age celebrations.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That\u2019s really\u2026disappointing. Since the structure of this piece of clothing is new to me, I wanted to try it on.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> In modern Japan, there are more people who wear Western clothes, and you don\u2019t have to be too original with this kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Hmm\u2026 Never mind, then. But\u2026 What should we do about this?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Next time I go out, I\u2019ll buy you some clothes.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You can\u2019t do that!</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Hmm? Why not?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It\u2019s no fun that way.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> You want to choose your clothes yourself?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> \u2026Can\u2019t I?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> At least, I want to take a look myself and then choose my clothes. Um\u2026isn\u2019t that\u2026OK?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Understood. I\u2019ll go and find some catalogues.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Thank you, Kiritsugu!</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> [Laugh]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Also\u2026 we have to think about her.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Um\u2026</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have Maiya start preparing.</p><p>[Opens door, leaves]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I\u2019m sorry, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Don\u2019t worry. From the start, I had no plans to cut into your conversation. Still, I think that Master is suppressing his annoyance when he sees me.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> \u2026Ah\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Irisviel, to have vented my discontentment like this, I am very sorry.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s precisely because he is showing you respect in his own way that he\u2019s treating you with this attitude. Please try to understand him.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> A magus like Kiritsugu and a knight who values purity and nobility could not possibly accept each other\u2019s tactics\u2026right?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Anyway, let\u2019s forget about this for now!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You heard just now, right? When we go to Fuyuki City, we have to dress according to the local culture.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Uh, ah, that.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I originally wanted to deal with it using the clothes we already have in the castle, but Kiritsugu said that the kimono wouldn\u2019t do\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026So you actually wanted to wear that just now.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Of course! Saber, you\u2019re a girl too, so you should understand, right?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026No, I apologise. Much of my life was spent riding over the plains, and the only times I dressed up were when I had an audience with visitors or when I attended ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> So that\u2019s how it is\u2026 Alright!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Then we should really use this opportunity to try on lots of different clothes.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Huh?!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You finally managed to get a body again in the present day, since your past was like that, we should really enjoy some dressing up while we can.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah\u2026 Uh, I am extremely sorry for not being able to turn into a spirit form\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I wasn\u2019t talking about that.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I do not require any bother in dressing up. As long as the clothing is not too conspicuous and is fitting\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That won\u2019t do! You\u2019ll be protecting me our entire time in Japan, right? Then you have to dress accordingly.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah\u2026 Yes.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> The~n, I wonder if there are any other clothes in the storage room~</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Irisviel, you are far closer to a human than I am.</p><p><strong>Track 2</strong></p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I wonder how this one will look.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No, no\u2026this one is\u2026 Isn\u2019t it a little too extravagant for me?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> No, it really suits you~ Right, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> I\u2019ll leave it up to you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026 (TL: How does she say that in a CD?)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Then\u2026how about this dress?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is\u2026also\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Does it not reveal a little too much of the upper body?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Is that so\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Such an attire will prove an obstacle in times of emergency\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Don\u2019t you change into armour for those occasions?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Uh\u2026That is not incorrect. \u2026If I had a well-proportioned body like yours, then I may be able to wear such a dress in a dignified manner\u2026 Um, also\u2026 My body has stopped growing, so\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You look cute enough like this\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026I am very sorry.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It\u2019s too bad~ Ah, how about this one? This colour should match your hair really well!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This, this has so many ruffles!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> If you\u2019re a girl, having this many ruffles is perfectly normal.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Perfectly normal\u2026is it.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes! \u2026Probably.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Right, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Maiya seems to have arrived, I\u2019ll go and pick her up first.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah-</p><p>[Kiritsugu exits]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Honestly\u2026 He\u2019s so uncooperative. Still, I always knew he was that kind of person.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Irisviel, has Kiritsugu ever shopped for clothing with you?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It\u2019s a little disappointing, but he hasn\u2019t.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That\u2019s why I really look forward to this trip to Fuyuki. Even though we\u2019re acting separately, I can still walk on the streets of another country with Kiritsugu and with you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I\u2019m sure everything I see will be new and interesting, but more than that\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> More than that\u2026?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That place is\u2026Kiritsugu\u2019s hometown.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> The kind of place he was born in, the kind of air he breathed as he grew up, I can know and experience for the first time. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s great?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Because of love\u2026is it.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That\u2019s right! [Laugh] Then, Saber! How about you change into this one this time?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Is, is there more to try?</p><p><strong>Track 3</strong></p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Hmm\u2026 The closet in our Einzbern castle is unexpectedly not satisfying enough\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No, I think that a storage room of that size is already incomparable.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> But there isn\u2019t anything in it that suits you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I really do not mind, anything will be fine.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> But all the clothes that I brought didn\u2019t work, in the end.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah\u2026 No, how should I say this\u2026 Uh\u2026 Irisviel, the clothes you brought were a little, uh\u2026 I am not good enough for such clothes.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That isn\u2019t true at all.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> (It is absolutely true! Those girlish items cannot possibly suit me!)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> How troubling~ In that case\u2026all that\u2019s left is\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Is?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> If a men\u2019s-style suit is fine with you, I know a good tailor. If we take the measurements now, we can have it made as quickly as possible and then collect it near Frankfurt.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> M-men\u2019s style?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You don\u2019t like it?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> No, I am used to it.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I tried recommending it to Kiritsugu before, but he always avoided wearing it. Even though if he just wore it, he could practically perform an opera without looking out of place\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Irisviel\u2026 Just what kind of clothes did you prepare?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It was a suit, do you know what a suit is?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> If you mean the kind Kiritsugu wears, I do know.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Just that is too plain, there should be\u2026 Lots of decorations on the collar and cuffs, embellished with some scattered embroidery on the shirt\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Please do not embellish it!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Saber, do you object to it, too?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I object.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You two are so boring. Honestly.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I truly do not mind plain and simple clothing at all!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> As for me\u2026 I want to try more different combinations of outfits.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Iri.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What is it, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> This is the information you asked me to find a few days ago, is this alright?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Wow~ Mhm, I really look forward to these! Thank you, Kiritsugu, I\u2019ll refer to them closely.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Saber, here, look at this.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> What are these colourful booklets?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Japanese fashion magazines. Right, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Mhm.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Fashion\u2026 Ah, are you referring to the books about apparel, targeted towards young women?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Is this also the modern-day knowledge given by the Grail? It saved us a lot of trouble, how convenient.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This can all be considered miscellany\u2026 Still, why did you take these items?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Of course, it\u2019s for choosing clothes that suit you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ?! B-but\u2026this is also\u2026 These are of a style distinct from the dresses in the castle\u2026or rather, they look completely different.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> These are the ordinary clothes currently fashionable in Japan, the battleground of the Grail War. Right, Kiritsugu?</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> According to Maiya\u2019s information, that appears to be the case.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Like this, it\u2019s \u201Cwhen in Rome, do as the Romans do\u201D.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> But\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Or is it that even though they\u2019re old-fashioned, you prefer the kimono that I showed you before?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Although that can also be considered to fit in with Japanese society, I still think that they are rather breezy. That sort of overly good ventilation can cause unease.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah~ That\u2019s true.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> You made her wear it?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Then let\u2019s look at the magazines together, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Yes.</p><p>[Turns pages]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Eh~ The skirts fashionable in Japan are so short.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is really\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Aren\u2019t you going to adjust to this too?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> One cannot work properly with legs bared in such a way.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I thought it would make movement easier.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> In this situation, shame is more important!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Aww\u2026 That\u2019s a pity. [Turns pages] Ah, this is cute, too, just like a doll!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Please spare me!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Saber, don\u2019t you like ribbons?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is not a question of like or dislike!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> How about ruffles?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> That includes ruffles!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> There are so many, too\u2026 With decorations not only on the sleeves, but all over the entire piece, it must have taken a lot of effort, right? If you don\u2019t wear it, it\u2019s disrespectful to the tailor.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Since when was our conversation based on making me wear these clothes!?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> How disappointing~</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Irisviel, I implore you, please do not continue to tease me.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah, but I\u2019m serious!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Irisviel.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Really. When I was just born, I had no preferences in clothing, just like you. In other words, at the time, I had no need for human thoughts and feelings.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Hmm.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026Iri.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> This is not self-deprecation. To be born as an Einzbern homunculus, I feel very honoured. Then again, similarly\u2026 Kiritsugu, I also treasure what you taught me, my emotions as a human and as a woman.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> (As a human and as a woman, and then\u2026as a mother\u2026is it. I have heard that ever since she bore Kiritsugu\u2019s child, this person had changed.)</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I\u2019m not denying that I was born with a way of life that involves a mission I must complete. I only want to pass my brief time meaningfully, like I am now.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Irisviel\u2026</p><p>[Turns pages]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah~</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> This is\u2026 A dress used in weddings?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes. \u201CWedding special, the longed-for pure white dress\u201D\u2026 That\u2019s what it says. [Laugh] It seems like whatever the era, to become a bride is a girl\u2019s dream.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Dream\u2026is it.</p><p>[Turns pages]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Hmm\u2026 This kind isn\u2019t bad, either. Don\u2019t you think so, Saber?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah\u2026but\u2026sorry.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> There\u2019s no need to worry. I\u2019m bound to Kiritsugu and am his wife, body and soul, so even though I couldn\u2019t try attending a ceremony dressed in this kind of outfit, I\u2019m already happy enough.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Iri\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> These are my honest feelings. No matter how fierce the battle ahead of us is, this feeling won\u2019t change.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> (In the Grail War ahead of us, she will clearly undergo many harsh trials as Kiritsugu\u2019s partner. As a substitute Master\u2026 No, even if that was not the case, as the Grail Vessel, there will be people coveting her life.) \u2026But even so, how can you\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026It is nothing.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> \u2026a dream.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Because I have always had a dream.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> A dream\u2026is it?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> To be an ordinary wife, an ordinary woman, or a person who chases an ideal with Kiritsugu, a person who gave birth to Illya\u2026</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That includes being your substitute Master, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Ah, yes. My\u2026?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> In doing battle with you, one can also find a dream - two stunningly beautiful women, toying with other Servants in the palms of our hands, doesn\u2019t that sound great?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> \u2026Ah.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> This kind of thought isn\u2019t escapism. On the path to the realisation of an ideal, while persevering in unending battles, these dreams are like the lubricant in between.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Lubricant\u2026is it.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2026bad to have dreams. After all, the strength to realise an ideal is born from such dreams.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> \u2026Iri.</p><p>[Turns pages]</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ah! Look! There are men\u2019s clothes in the book, too! Kiritsugu! Come and see if there\u2019s anything that suits you.</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> Ah\u2026no, I\u2019ll just\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Come on, don\u2019t be shy~</p><p><strong>Kiritsugu:</strong> I\u2019m fine with what I\u2019m wearing\u2026</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Honestly, you always say that\u2026 Come on, choose seriously~</p>', 218);
