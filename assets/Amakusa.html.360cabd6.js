These coordinates mark the location where a Singularity is forming, correct?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, enemy readings are exceeding predictions and have been confirmed in several areas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t do anything about it, it might exacerbate the separation and collapse of the Seven Eras.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It seems that Servants are being summoned in opposition, so I want you to go and help correct the era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay. Well then, Master, let&#39;s look for those Servants for the time being.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This town is in ruins. There is not a single soul in sight...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting readings on a Servant near you. Do you not see it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...Servant? I can sense its presence, but I cannot see its form\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Boo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahhh!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hah hah hah! Did I startle you? Did I?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ah, sorry about that. I just got carried away in the moment!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To just suddenly appear like that out of the sky... That made me scream out loud. How unbefitting of a Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uhh, you are a Servant...correct?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Indeed! My name is Astolfo!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> My class is Rider, and I am one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> My hobbies are walking, eating, jousting, gambling, drinking, reading, chatting, and also...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s enough. My name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is Fujimaru, my Master.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What a cute little Servant... So you&#39;re the Master, huh! Nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? Have we met before?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm... I forgot, but whatever! So what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes. We are investigating a Singularity\u2013</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> A Singularity? I see. I think I&#39;ve heard of those.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t really know much myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see... In that case, do you know any of the remaining Servants?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-What!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! The reason why I called out to you! Now I remember!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh man, I was just about to forget about it, too! Heh heh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t forget...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> There are actually two other Servants here. One of them is a Ruler!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Ruler... A Ruler!? Like Jeanne d&#39;Arc?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, just like her! The other is an Archer.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Umm, I can&#39;t quite recall the name... Gira...Giri...Gil...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Perhaps \u201CGilgamesh\u201D?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh yes, that&#39;s right! Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The King of Heroes, Gilgamesh... The oldest Heroic Spirit who possesses an inexhaustible amount of treasures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The weapons from his treasury later became prototypes for weapons owned by other heroes in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or that&#39;s what Da Vinci said. I&#39;ve never actually met Gilgamesh, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;m not sure. I have this feeling...that maybe I have met him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Surely it was a dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A dream, huh. I see. Now that you mention it, I think you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really? Umm... Are you talking about Santa?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you talking about? I apologize for my ignorance...</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Indeed. He did seem like a child worthy of that name.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure in the future that child will be a great hero! But he&#39;ll also probably turn out to be a tyrant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, what happened to the two of them?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, um, you see... How do I explain...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That Ruler and Archer I met, you see... They&#39;re...waging.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Waging... What are they waging?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> A Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What... A Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Come, follow me! At any rate, I want you to stop the two of them!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Come on! Hurry, hurry!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey! Sorry to ruin the party, but it&#39;s time for battle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some Lamia-type enemies are heading in your direction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay. I have visual confirmation of the enemy. Preparing to engage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Uh, Astolfo!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Ahhhhhh! Snakes, there are snakes!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay! It&#39;s hunting time! I&#39;ll make sure that at least thirty of them enter Nirvana...or Heaven?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ll send them packing down the road to the afterlife!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> What a big haul! I&#39;ve got to say, snake hunting is so much fun!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> At this rate, I could go ahead and change the whole ecosystem!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t change the ecosystem...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I suppose Lamias have no influence over the ecosystem, so it&#39;s no problem, but still...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Anyway, it&#39;s more important that we stop the two who initiated a Holy Grail War!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh yes, I forgot!

So I would like to ask you to hand it over right away.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> This isn&#39;t something that a pretend holy man from the Far East should be playing with, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahaha. I can&#39;t deny that reputation of mine. But I have a dream of my own.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> \u201CI have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you stroll on my dreams.\u201D</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> \u2013So, unfortunately, I can&#39;t just do that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Looks like there&#39;s no choice, then. I&#39;m not sure when we&#39;ll settle this, but we&#39;ll have to fight\u2013</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes. ...Looks like we&#39;ll have to get down to it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh. There they are! I brought a Master here!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I see, we can tell Master why we need the Grail and then let Master decide in the end.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad plan. ...What do you think, King of Heroes?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Hmm... Well, I don&#39;t mind. But can you really do this without any grudges?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> You could say that about anything. Astolfo, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t need the Grail!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Once summoned, it&#39;s the Servant&#39;s job to completely be loyal to their Master!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Ouch, that stings.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> If one&#39;s Master is a proper Master, then that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Well, that makes it sound like you&#39;ve served an \u201Cimproper\u201D Master in the past, now doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> A lot happens when you&#39;ve been a Servant for a while.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well, if Astolfo isn&#39;t going to participate, then it&#39;s just between me and him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Then, I&#39;ll go first.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that I would desire the Holy Grail. It is in a king&#39;s nature to wish to amass fortune.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Also, when we&#39;re talking about a Holy Grail that will grant every...well, almost every wish, we have to be very careful.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> In that case, it should be a king&#39;s duty to store away such an object. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything I would wish at this time, anyway.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> No return here, but no risk involved.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Master, given the situation here, don&#39;t you think it would be best to let me handle the Grail?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not so sure about that.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> What Gilgamesh says is true. The Holy Grail is dangerous. However, as a neutral power, it should be used to maximum effect.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...This pseudo Holy Grail isn&#39;t enough to fulfill my wish, however.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wish?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> My wish is everlasting world peace. But with the current state of things, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll make it that far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t enough?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to wish for world peace, but unfortunately, this world is about to be incinerated.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Even if the world isn&#39;t incinerated, this Holy Grail will never be able to bring about perfect world peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...But it&#39;d be an extreme waste just to keep this Holy Grail locked away.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Fortunately, I know how the Holy Grail works. It would be best if you let me handle the Grail.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> What do you think, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-What should we do, Master? They both have good points, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re correct.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t decide myself!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm... This is hard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have data on the pseudo Holy Grail. It&#39;s growing, eating the magic energy around it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At this rate, it&#39;s going to stop being pseudo. You can&#39;t give that to a Servant you haven&#39;t contracted with...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I feel like it&#39;d be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So, it is dangerous then. Yeah, those two treat their Masters rather rudely.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> You can&#39;t go saying that, Astolfo. I am very considerate of my Masters.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Even if my Master is a tyrant, and orders me to do the most annoying work,</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I won&#39;t murder them. Nothing so immoral. Isn&#39;t that right, Amakusa Shirou?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Hahaha. You&#39;re acting like you want people to think that I killed one of my Masters, I see.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you, I have not.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I let one die before, but that was more like an unfortunate accident.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I do think what I did was wrong. I won&#39;t do it again.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Ahem. ...In any event, last Master in this world...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Who&#39;s the most worthy of the Grail?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Me or him. Who do you pick?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Yeah... I thought that might happen.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> The second Astolfo brought you here, I thought that things might turn out this way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Either is bad.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the way it goes. This is a Holy Grail War after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> In that case... There&#39;s only one thing left to do.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;ll work together and... ...keep Master away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What? That&#39;s how this is going to turn out?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Of course! This is a Holy Grail War, after all!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;m on Master&#39;s side! We&#39;ll just have to see who wins...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...That which rules, that which serves, or that which rebels.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Ow... Not very adult of you to do that to a kid.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You&#39;re not really a kid!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Not very adult of you to do that to a clergyman...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You, part of the clergy?! In any event, the Grail goes to my Master!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...This is not good. Looks like we took too much time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Time? What&#39;s going...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, this is bad!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It looks like the pseudo Holy Grail just summoned Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Too many variables. Approach with caution!</p><h2 id="chapter-iii-false-grail-untouched-by-heaven" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-iii-false-grail-untouched-by-heaven" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter III - False Grail, Untouched by Heaven</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Oh, well. I guess that&#39;s it for that Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> It was fake to begin with, so maybe it was easy to infect. Should have stored it immediately.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Should have put it under our control immediately. We should both think about what we did.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And you two still won&#39;t admit you should have given it up. That&#39;s so typical of you two!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Umm... Fujimaru? We&#39;d like to help, too.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I mean, no matter how you think about it, our fight was the cause of all of this.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> We need to take responsibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Got it. I&#39;ll be helping out then!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sure, thanks.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Understood. Then the two of us will back you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Looks like it&#39;s been completely infected. Destroying it immediately will prevent any more issues, I imagine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already confirmed several Shadow Servants. It&#39;s possible it will become a Singularity if we leave it like this.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I agree.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> It won&#39;t nearly be on the same level as the Greater Grail at Fuyuki, but it would be terrible if it was even a fraction of that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know about the Greater Grail at Fuyuki?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Yes. The one in a faraway, unrelated world, right? ...Well, that aside...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have one of us guard Fujimaru. The other two will intercept the enemy. How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> We&#39;ll take out the Shadow Servants first. After that we can destroy the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me!

But it&#39;s better than letting them continue to exist in that anguished state.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> \u2013Well then, let&#39;s get going, shall we, Master?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> With this, we&#39;ve finished clearing out all the Shadow Servants as well\u2013</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Now the problem is how to destroy this Holy Grail. Gil, do you have anything for that?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Hmm... For something like that, a sword from my treasury might do it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> \u2013Though the real problem is figuring out what this fake Grail is trying to give birth to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-What? It&#39;s trying to...give birth?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa, whoa, whoa... Huge amounts of magical energy are pouring out of that Grail! Something&#39;s coming out of it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? You&#39;re wondering what that something is?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a Demon God Pillar, but... I think it&#39;s probably something fairly equal in power to it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...This is a disaster!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Now then, we&#39;ll keep back this massive ghost\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> I&#39;ll summon swords as needed from my Gate of Babylon and destroy it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> So cover me out there.

Don&#39;t worry! I absolutely won&#39;t enter your line of fire!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Because I have no doubt that you&#39;d destroy me along with the target! That&#39;s what my gut&#39;s telling me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> You&#39;re absolutely correct!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;d expect nothing less from a future tyrant-king! But whatever. Okay...let&#39;s go, Hipp!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Well then, I&#39;ll also be heading out to keep that creature at bay.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> ...Master, stay between us.

I will destroy that false Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-We beat it somehow...

It&#39;s over. That didn&#39;t measure up to Heaven&#39;s Feel at all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Being shattered is perhaps the most fitting end for it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Hah, I didn&#39;t really want to own it, but just letting it break feels like a waste... Actually, no, it doesn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> After all, it was like wings made of wax. Inferior even to the black wings of a real crow.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, I guess that concludes this little pseudo Holy Grail War. And here I thought I&#39;d finally get my chance to punch Amakusa Shirou!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Well, you were close, anyway. But how lucky it was for us to run into a real Master in a place like this.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> If, someday, we are able to form a real contract between us, I hope I will be able to serve you well.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> I will gladly work with you to grant my own dream as well.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Though, in my opinion, it&#39;s a pretty worthless dream!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But, whatever.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Well, if it is in our fates to meet again, good tidings to you from Astolfo of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> If you&#39;ll kindly summon me, I&#39;ll give you a good, thumping shoulder rub! See you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well... I&#39;d like to be summoned back again too, but I suppose this isn&#39;t really my prime form, huh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> But I think, maybe, I could be more helpful than my adult form would be?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;d really like it if, next time, you could judge which of us is the better Servant, Master!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh (Child):</strong><br> Well, I hope it is in our fates to meet again! Goodbye, Master.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> Even among us Servants, there are those with dreams and ambitions of their own. Some will betray their Masters to achieve those dreams.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong><br> But the path walked by that \u201Cking\u201D was no dream.
