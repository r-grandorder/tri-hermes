I&#39;m really sorry.<br> But I&#39;m relieved to hear you say that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yep...that&#39;s right...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Ungh...that&#39;s right...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Sorrysorrysorry! I heard we were going to investigate a tiny Singularity...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So I thought this was going to be super easy even without Touta or Nitocris. But, well...um...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> We wandered...and wandered some more... Next thing we know, we&#39;re waaay beyond where we&#39;re supposed to be...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> And now we&#39;re camping out in the woods... I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Even though we have a clear destination, we took so many detours... Even I know that this is bad...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s just, from the moment I start a journey,<br> I can never take the straight path...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s not always like that when I&#39;m not alone.<br> The normal me does have proper disciples, after all.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But when I&#39;m alone, I just can&#39;t help myself...<br> I am beyond hopeless...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> C-camping out is wonder...ful.<br> The stars are so pretty!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> And now that we started a fire, all the bugs are out and attracted by it...it&#39;s like we&#39;re attracting attention because we&#39;re so popular!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> And eating under the night sky is so nice!<br> (Munch, munch...)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh, I have plenty of rice balls. It&#39;s a Sanzang rule to carry two days&#39; worth of food on a one-day trip.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Now come on. Don&#39;t hold back. Eat up.<br> I even have fresh water from that river over there!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re in a lush forest, we were able to forage up plenty of nuts and mysterious fruits!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try a taste...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mysterious fruit may not be a good idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh. Would you rather have fish or meat?<br> Yeah...you&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ugh! I&#39;m so sorry for being so inconsiderate.<br> But since I&#39;m a Buddhist monk, all killing is forbidden.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Oh, but I won&#39;t stop you from hunting. I won&#39;t go in and stop other hunters from doing their thing, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Rice balls and nuts are fine for tonight.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to force yourself.<br> But...thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna try the mysterious fruit!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Be my guest! Hee hee!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anyway...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re totally lost...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Ugh...I am beyond sorry...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It was because I kept powering forward.<br> I know...I get it...it&#39;s totally my fault!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s always been like this...Wukong, Bajie,<br> and Wujing have all scolded me about this.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> (Sigh) I just can&#39;t seem to break this habit.<br> Maybe I can&#39;t get better because I&#39;m not trying to fix it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who knows?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You definitely can&#39;t get better if you don&#39;t try!</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Absolutely right. Ungh.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> We&#39;ve lost communication with Chaldea,<br> and I&#39;m sure Mash is worried sick.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Ugh...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It&#39;s morning!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s head on!<br> GO! WEST!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not to the west!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We need to go north, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s...<br> That is what Da Vinci&#39;s instructions said.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But trust me. Listen.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You and I...and humans in general don&#39;t journey on rationality alone.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yesterday, I forced you to walk so much that your legs got all sore.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Aaand yes, I forced you to stay outdoors overnight, with all those bugs around.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I apologize for that.<br> I shouldn&#39;t mix exploration with training.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to cause trouble for Master.<br> I don&#39;t want you to think of me as a stubborn teacher.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But...even so...I just can&#39;t ignore my instincts!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So, once this is all done,<br> I&#39;m going to apologize to you SO much!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But right now, I want you to just follow me!<br> I&#39;m going west!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I need to go.<br> Because...I hear a voice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A voice...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What does that mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> No need to explain...cuz I don&#39;t get it either!<br> Anyway, let&#39;s GO! GO WEST!</p><p><strong>Village Man:</strong><br> Aaahhh!!! A monster...!<br> It&#39;s the monster that&#39;s said to come from the north!</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong><br> Help! Help! My child is still in the house...oh no...the monster&#39;s coming...!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Hold it right there!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> We made it! Just in time!<br> No...we might actually be too late.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But this village hasn&#39;t been destroyed yet! Good!<br> All that&#39;s left is for someone to get rid of this monster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sanzang!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you know about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Talk later!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Right now, we gotta stop this monster!<br> Hey, you four-legged beast! Don&#39;t eat the villagers!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> The Buddha once said:<br> if there were to\u2013</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...H-hey! It&#39;s a really inspirational quote!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I guess I have no choice since you&#39;re not gonna listen, and you&#39;re trying to eat a child!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> All living things feel hunger, yes... So eating isn&#39;t evil, but I can&#39;t just let this happen!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> If its actions are beastly desires that surpass natural desires, I&#39;ll just have to teach it a lesson!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> My palm is an impregnable wall...<br> I will never forsake those in pain...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> People who seek my help, the children who shed their tears... Now come on, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that, my teacher!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about magical energy! Just fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> GOGO! Enforcing Buddhist law...I mean,<br> let&#39;s kick its butt!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Swift Divine Retribution!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Phew...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> As there are laws in Buddhist teachings, so too are there laws in this world, and passions may lead to enlightenment!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Now is probably not your time to stop hurting others and gain salvation, but I believe that time will one day come for you.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So for now, goodbye. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Village Man:</strong><br> Oh! Oh...!<br> The monster has fallen! Are we saved!?</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong><br> Oh my son! My baby! I&#39;m so relieved!<br> Come here, my son!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> It was strong!<br> But we managed to beat it!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Villagers, listen!<br> Please let those who got hurt or weakened rest!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Take them to an open area, like a temple or church! Give them water and blankets! Also medicine if you have any!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Go find them all! Right now, it doesn&#39;t matter if they are rich or poor!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Do all you can to aid the wounded! With your help,<br> I will get as many people back in shape as I can!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have healing skills or Noble Phantasms,<br> but I do have some knowledge in making medicinal soup.</p><p><strong>Village Woman:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t quite grasped the situation, but if you are a traveling monk, and got rid of this monster for us...</p><p><strong>Village Man:</strong><br> You must have come from a distant land, yet you still saved us.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Of course I did! I demonstrated the protection of the Buddha to everyone!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> So save those in need! I will continue to wander around to do so myself as well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a relief!<br> We&#39;ve restored communication!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The location of the abnormality&#39;s source has changed. Unbelievably, it moved to a different place at high speed right after you Rayshifted...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And when I tried to contact you...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We had trouble getting a connection. We panicked on our end, but maybe that worry was for naught.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad we didn&#39;t completely lose you guys. Anyway...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You guys never cease to amaze. I was watching as you beat the crap out of the source of the abnormality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Was it a coincidence? Or is it Sanzang&#39;s special ability? Did she manage to detect where the abnormality was located?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh? What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Hm? Is it a special Servant ability of mine?<br> No way. Nope, that&#39;s not it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you were really just lost?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Heh...hee hee...um...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s right. I always get myself lost...even when I don&#39;t intend to...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Whether that be in a Singularity or when I&#39;m wandering around in the simulator...it&#39;s all the same.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;m always in search of something.<br> Especially when I&#39;m traveling alone.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> There is always someone who needs help.<br> Definitely. After all, the world is BEYOND big.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to help as many people as possible, as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Though I can&#39;t do it while I&#39;m sleeping or eating, but while I&#39;m still up and running, I&#39;d like to help everyone I meet!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I walk, and I&#39;ll keep walking!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sanzang...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I roped you into this...I&#39;m sorry to have made you worry when we were alone in the woods at night.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> You have many roles, and you are a busy person. You&#39;re the last person I should drag into my whimsical stuff.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> This time around...yep!<br> I&#39;m reflecting back on my actions!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> I won&#39;t do it again. Next time, it&#39;s not going to be the two of us. I&#39;ve learned my lesson!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we should go with everyone next time!<br> I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t get lost then!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just the two of us camping out can be nice, too.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Eh, eh??? Really?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> But...didn&#39;t you have a hard time sleeping because we were infested with bugs?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t mind sleeping in uncomfortable, outdoorsy places?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> If Master insists, I don&#39;t mind, either.<br> ...Really? Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re serious?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go camping together again!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Yes! Let&#39;s bring more people along so we can assign them to be the lookout or make them do the cooking.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Fufufu! How exciting! Now that that&#39;s decided,<br> I need to prepare for the next Rayshift!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AVillage Child:</strong><br> Miss?<br> We gathered all the injured people in the church.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Thank you. I&#39;ll be right there!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> Come on, Fujimaru. We&#39;ll discuss what we&#39;ll do later. But first, let&#39;s save the village!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> GO! WEST!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um...the church is actually to the south, Sanzang!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong><br> ...Waah...</p>', 181);
