But since she is restricted to a form that is \u201CHumanoid\u201D, even if her supply of Magical Energy is infinite, there is a limit to her output, so the quantity of Magical Energy she can practically use is being stopped within the domain of a Humanoid Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Feathered Person of the Immortal Realm: [A]</strong></p><p>Consort Yu is a Xian (Immortal) who were spoken of in Taoist ideology; one who has immortality. Because interferences from the natural world are required in order for her to maintain her body, it is possible to say that she is restricted to a humanoid form as a result.</p><p><strong>Bloodsucking: [C]</strong></p><p>It is feasible for Consort Yu to deprive a fixed amount of energy from any lifeform \u2013 regardless if it is a plant or an animal \u2013 and use it for herself. It is strictly different from the act of bloodsucking, but she is recognized as a Bloodsucking Kin because of this ability, so she has come to receive persecution from Executors throughout successive generations.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="eternal-lament-lamentation-in-the-release-from-the-cursed-blooded-corpse" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eternal-lament-lamentation-in-the-release-from-the-cursed-blooded-corpse" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Eternal Lament: Lamentation in the Release from the Cursed-Blooded Corpse</h1><ul><li>Rank: C+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~20</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people</li></ul><p>A drastic move where Consort Yu causes her Magical Energy to rampage by destroying her own body in order to go over its limits, and after causing an abnormal weather attack by means of a hex, she reconstructs her body over again.

However, she was touched by the fact that Xiang Yu \u2013 the only person who understood her \u2013 desired for \u201Ca repose to the world of humans\u201D until the very end, so she consented to being added to the Throne of Heroes, a place that houses the protectors of the Human Order.</p><p>Although she loathes human civilization, Consort Yu does not loathe humans as a lifeform. She possesses a peculiar sense of ethics that should even be said to be a \u201Cwild fundamentalism\u201D so to speak, generally affirming in a providence where the strong eats the weak and flourish. However, she exposes her anger towards the use of science and technology to the extent that it overturns the order of the natural world, as well as monotheistic values such as \u201CGod desired such a thing from humans.\u201D</p><p>Nonetheless, as far as Consort Yu is concerned, the particulars behind her making her appearance in this world where she was a specimen who came from a colony are a trauma to her, albeit an unconscious one, and although the person in question firmly denies it, her true character is that of someone who easily succumbs to loneliness. Towards those who have the intention in becoming a person who can understand her, she reaches the point where she can embrace a fairly deep compassion for them (without making a distinction of them as a plant, an animal, an android, etc.).</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>It must be remembered that Consort Yu denies the stance of \u201Cprotecting humanity\u201D, defining herself instead as a Heroic Spirit in the position of an arbitrator who monitors the humanity that does not grasp what mess they are going to make in this future. But if \u201Csomeone who can lead the people very well\u201D appears to her among the many humans, then she is willing to support them.</p><p>Consort Yu will cooperate with the Master with the justification of \u201CBecause I firmly detest getting myself involved with the world of humans.\u201D Although she quibbles with them for various reasons and flames them with abusive language, she feels a repose that will never be over, for she had wished for \u201Ca place where someone considers her necessary and where her existence is allowed\u201D, so if it is for the sake of maintaining that environment, she will not spare herself in desperately exhausting her efforts to maintain it.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CRecently\u2026 everything is like a fleeting dream.

In folklore, Consort Yu committed suicide after Xiang Yu\u2019s death, and that anecdote has given another name to the red poppy flower: Yu Meiren Cao (the field poppy).</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A Bloodsucking Kind that acquire nourishment through energy drains. They are not a kind of Demonic Beast or Phantasmal Beast, but terminals that originated from the Earth\u2019s inner sea for the sake of managing its surface\u2026 They are Elementals. In the Magic World, this species of Elementals are close to a category of being called a \u201CTrue Ancestor\u201D, but although the process of how they originated resembles that of a True Ancestor\u2019s, they are another species of the Bloodsucking Kind where their purpose as an existence differs from theirs.</p><p>Consort Yu is a Xiannu (female Immortal) \u2013 a Zhenren (True Human) \u2013 who were spoken of in ancient Chinese traditions, and since she acquired a reason and a self-consciousness much later after she made her appearance in this world, she herself does not even know what her origins are or how she came to be.</p><p>With her circumstances of complete isolation, with neither a family nor a group she can belong to, and while being weary and fearful of humans, single-mindedly running away and hiding from human society that continues to expand, Consort Yu refused to commit suicide and fulfilled her duty to Xiang Yu \u2013 who was the only person who understood her \u2013 and she continued to live for a time that lasts for eternity. While in the middle of her destiny towards a long, long road of wandering, she saved up all the exhaustion of wandering she had built, and if she can get to a place where she can feel at ease, even for just a brief moment, then she will embrace a desperate desire where it does not matter if that place is connected to her own ruin so long as she gets there.</p><p>On the other hand, Consort Yu laments for her own future after Xiang Yu\u2019s death, someone who she mourns for even now, and she is caught in a self-contradiction where she cannot even make a bold start on a quick suicide. As far as she is concerned, the place called Chaldea \u2013 a place where inhuman Heroic Spirits gather and where equilibrium is preserved among the various purposes of the various people there \u2013 possesses a special meaning to her as \u201Ca place where people are not even frightened by what kind of person she is\u201D, a place that she did not reach for the very long time of 2000 years, until now.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Xiang Yu</strong></p><p>\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661</p><p><strong>Shi Huangdi</strong></p><p>\u201CWhat are you laughing at?!

There was a suggestion of \u201CHer design should be more modernistic!\u201D; that is the Second Stage of Yu Meiren\u2019s design. After that, I did things such as adding glasses and adding fabric to her, and those became the designs of her First Stage and Third Stage respectively.
