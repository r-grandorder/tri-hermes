I have arrived upon your summoning. From here on, my sword will act as your own. Our fates have become one. I await your orders, Master. We must defeat the other six pairs of Masters and Servants in order to attain the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> Fight against the other Masters... Is that what the Holy Grail War is all about? What&#39;s the point of getting the Holy Grail, anyway? Nothing I want is worth killing for.</p><p>There&#39;s something messed up about being willing to sacrifice yourself and others: about being willing to throw away all that has been up until now just to make a wish come true.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> You do not have a single wish that you do want to come true? Then why did you ever become a Master? You are a magus. You should be familiar many things, such as rituals that require blood to perform miracles.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> ... The only reason I became a Master was to stop the others. I couldn&#39;t care less about the Holy Grail. But I guess the result is the same either way. I&#39;m going to fight to the very end, but that&#39;s it. You can do what you want with the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ... If that is truly what you desire, then I can offer no objection.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> Then it&#39;s settled. But first I want to ask you one thing. What are you going to do with the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ... I am going to redo things differently. For the sake of the country that I ruled, I will select an individual to replace me. That shall be my final act as king, as she who took up the sword.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> So you don&#39;t care what will happen to you if you do that? Saber... ... There&#39;s something not right about that. I can&#39;t really put it into words right now, but that can&#39;t be the right thing to do.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> It is not your responsibility to decide that. This Holy Grail War shall decide if my wish is worthy or not. As a Servant, my only duty is to fight my way to the end.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Halfway through the story:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Berserker, the most powerful of Servants. Defeating him shall bring me one step closer to the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> You&#39;re a pretty brave one, aren&#39;t you, Saber? It&#39;s not really bad per se to cling on to such impossible wishes... But is yours actually just?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ... As my enemy, you have no right to question me. The results shall decide for us what is just and what is not.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> What is just... Isn&#39;t it the very justness that you have protected all along that has made the world the way it is? Your goals are purely selfish in nature. How many times has Shirou told you that? There is nothing for you to feel ashamed of in your past. So doesn&#39;t that mean that you lived your life the best you -</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> I did not come here to listen to this nonsense! Lift up your blade, Master von Einzbern!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> I guess I have no choice. But I do feel for Shirou. It&#39;s a shame that he puts his trust into someone to win who doesn&#39;t truly understand what the Holy Grail is. Well then... I&#39;ll end this quickly for you. Berserker, get her!</p><p><em>Berserker Roars</em></p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ... I lived my life the best I could... Shirou has told me that so many times now.</p><p>... I do not know anymore. Is what I seek truly just?</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Last battle:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It&#39;s been such a long wait, Saber. I see that you&#39;ve decided to give in to me. It was only a matter of time. The Holy Grail is already in my hands. Become my queen and the miracle that you desire so badly can be yours!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> You are sorely mistaken, oh King of Heroes. For I have come here to defeat you. My sword is the sword of my Master. My wish has nothing to do with the Grail.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I think I must have misheard you. Or did you really just object to my wishes?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> That is correct, oh King of Heroes. I shall not do as you please. I have no need of the Holy Grail. My Master risked everything to teach me that I did the best I possibly could with my life. He also taught me that I should destroy the Holy Grail. Because people don&#39;t need magic to make their dreams come true!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Ha! Pathetic! How hard it is for myself to forgive a knight king who has lowered herself to such buffoonery! If that&#39;s how it must be, Saber... Then I do believe it is time that I cleansed you of such simple views!</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Saber defeat Gilgamesh final scene:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ... This is how it should be. Now that I have destroyed the Grail with my own hands, I shall be a Heroic Spirit no more.</p><p>... There was no reason for me to be one in the first place.</p><p>The king stood by her country. But her countrymen did not stand by her.</p><p>... Why? Why, Shirou, could I not see something so clear?</p><p>... My body is fading. The blessing of the Grail is no more. Finally, I am able to return to that hill.</p><p>But before I go... Know that I am so very grateful. And that I care for you deeply.</p><p>You told me that what I built was far from a Utopia, and that even though I can&#39;t save everyone...</p><p>... I should be proud of my accomplishments.</p><p>Thank you. I will move on from that hill with those words in my heart.</p><p>Goodbye, my Master.

Hey, Bazett!? What the heck happened!?</p><p>W-What...!?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> So, Lancer, I see that you have raced back to protect your precious Master. Too bad, you just missed her.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ... Who the hell are you?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> My name is Kirei Kotomine. I am your new Master.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Huh...!? Those Command Spells... Are those...!?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> That is correct. I took them from your former Master, Bazett Fraga McRemitz. Lancer, no, Heroic Spirit Cu Chulainn... You&#39;ve lost your contract holder, which means you will soon run out of odo. All you can do is wait to fade from this world.</p><p>That must be very difficult for a Heroic Spirit who seeks the Holy Grail to deal with. Instead of fading away, I propose that you re-contract with me. If you do as I say, you will have your chance at attaining the Grail.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ... You want me to just bow down to you? To the man who killed Bazett!?</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Come now, there is no need to bear a grudge. A careless Master like her had no hope of winning this Grail War. She would have met the same fate sooner or later, anyway.</p><p>I am the Master you need if you are truly serious about winning. Well, Lancer, what do you say?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ... Fine. I&#39;ll never forgive myself if I just give up. But mark my words, Kirei Kotomine. You&#39;ll have to use one of those Command Spells if you plan on ordering me around. ... Always watching your back and never sleeping could get tiresome.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Halfway through the story:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Caster... so you&#39;re up next, huh?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, Lancer... I&#39;ve been watching you. And you&#39;re not very happy with your new Master, are you?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Huh? You&#39;ve been watching me? For what purpose?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> I have a proposition for you. I can cancel your contract with my Noble Phantasm, Rule Breaker. You are bound by those Command Spells. But I can free you from them... How would you like to get rid of that Master of yours and join me?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You make me sick. Do you really believe the loyalty of a knight to be so fickle? Switching camps all the time is hardly the way to maintain the respect of others.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I suppose I was foolish to believe I could tame the &quot;Hound of Culann&quot; in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You did well in calling me out. ... I was thinking along the same lines. My work just never seems to end.</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You can&#39;t hold out much longer with that wound. Accept it. Hey, Caster. If you&#39;re willing to do something for me, I might just be willing to let your Master go. What do you think?</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Last battle:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You&#39;re late, Kotomine. I thought you&#39;d get here much quicker.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> Lancer... I only have one question for you. Why won&#39;t my Command Spells work on you?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Well you see... Caster had a very interesting Noble Phantasm on her. And right before I killed her we made a deal. She used her Noble Phantasm to cancel the contract between us.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> ... I don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re continuing to fight in this Holy Grail war even without a Master? Why?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Because there was a woman who summoned me because she believed in me and my abilities. And if I&#39;m going to live up to her beliefs, then I have to stand strong with my spear in hand. Not only that, but I have to win.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> How absurd. You&#39;re doing it for a dead woman? With the amount of odo you have left, just sticking around in this world is difficulty enough, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You said it. This body will probably be gone within a few minutes. But that&#39;s all the time that I need. The debt I owe my summoner will be paid by avenging her death. Kirei Kotomine, you&#39;re going down.</p><p><strong>Kirei:</strong> You insolent... You don&#39;t care about the Grail at all? There is nothing you want to ask the Wish Maker for?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Not really. The only thing I want at the moment is to take your head before I&#39;m gone. You&#39;re going to pay for taking a Red Branch Knight so lightly!</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Master or whatever... Did you really think you could keep this Heroic Spirit held down with Command Spells? I was never loyal to you.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Lancer defeat Kotomine final scene:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Oh well... It looks like my time is up.</p><p>I have to admit that was pretty close though. That jerk was pretty strong for a human.</p><p>But at least he got what he deserved. Did you see me, Bazett? The Servant you summoned is really strong, isn&#39;t he?</p><p>You made a good decision when you picked me! I still wish I could have helped you get the Holy Grail though...</p><p>I don&#39;t have any need for the Wish Maker. I&#39;m happy enough to have had the chance to live again and fight to my heart&#39;s content.</p><p>It&#39;s a shame that we didn&#39;t get to fight alongside each other, but it was nice all the same.

The gleam in Gilgamesh&#39;s eyes tells the hero that Gilgamesh wants to kill the little one by his side. He carries an air of victory already. He knows this is no normal enemy. He must prove his worth as a hero, and rise above the man in gold.</p><p>But even so... In order to protect the little one, he must not yield his position. He absolutely must not yeild his position.

Thanks for everything, Berserker.</p><p><em>Command Seal Flashes</em></p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> As his time with the little one that he loved so deeply ends... The hero uses his burly fingers to pry open his chest, and crush the heart that resides inside. This final order came with her words of parting. The hero has no way to resist.

I knew that you were still fighting, but I had no idea that it was without a Servant. It appears that Tokiomi-sensei had a powerful book of thaumaturgy hidden away.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Dad was such a genuine magus that he probably didn&#39;t care for such a book of such uncivilized thaumaturgy. I guess I don&#39;t need to say this, but the reason I&#39;ve made it this far is because of my apprentice training.

Have you already conceived Avenger?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> I have taken both of your Servants inside myself. There is no one left to protect you anymore. I think I&#39;ll take back the life energy that you&#39;ve been borrowing to keep yourself alive until today.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> I see you have been completely contaminated. Not only the body, but the mind must also align with that &quot;curse&quot; in order to complete the process. So you have accepted it? You&#39;ve resolved yourself to becoming a &quot;man-eating Monster&quot;.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m very different now. I&#39;m not the Sakura Matou that you knew. That weak child is no more. I was... I was put through so much by everyone. I&#39;m going to pay them back by making them suffer. I&#39;ll never be that person who just puts up with things ever again.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> What are you saying? You are still Sakura Matou even if you are drunk with violence after bathing in the mud. You do not have to pretend that you are a different person in order to protect Sakura Matou as a person.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> What are you...? After it was... After it was you who did this to me!</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> I do not deny it. The reason I used you was to maintain my status as Master of &quot;that&quot;. And you are doing a wonderful job of bringing Avenger back to me. You are doing something I was not able to do. And with such ease I might add.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Shut up! Running has always been your specialty. Your ability to disappear in the brink of an eye is infuriating. But whatever... I can still kill you.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Now that my Servants are gone, I suppose I have no choice but to fight on my own. So many consider you, the Black Holy Grail, as their enemy. Sakura Matou... What you carry inside of you will answer my long-asked questions.

I am in quite the hurry at the moment, so I do not have time to chat.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> Kotomine, I have something I need to ask you. And I need you to answer it right now.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Fine. As your teacher and guardian, it would not be right to turn my back on you now.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> I met the Archer from the last Holy Grail War. He told me about how my dad died. Did he speak the truth?</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Hmm... It is unfortunate that he told you that. I had planned to tell you myself. You certainly did it this time, Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> So... Then you&#39;re the one who killed him.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Wasn&#39;t it obvious? As his apprentice, I was in the best position to attack him by surprise.</p><p><strong>Rin:</strong> That&#39;s enough. This conversation is over. I can&#39;t let you get away with this. Kirei Kotomine... As the sixth head of the Tohsaka family. I will strike down the enemy of my father.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> I can see you are not going to change your mind.

And that is that I did not get to see your face when you first heard the truth.</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> I bet you never thought that I would send both parent and child of your family to their death.

That thing, Avenger, that&#39;s inside of her is the embodiment of all that&#39;s evil in the world!</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> I will not accuse one that is not even born yet of crimes. Nothing is born evil, and nothing is useless to the world. No one has the right to punish a creature until it is given a chance to live.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> Do you truly believe what you are saying? You know that thing only exists to kill. It would be the very definition of evil for us to do nothing even though we know that it will kill many people when it gets out!</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> While that act may be evil in and of itself, we do not know what the person himself believes.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Does the actual &quot;All the World&#39;s Evil&quot; lament over the &quot;evil&quot; he commits, or does he smile from the &quot;good&quot;... After he has lost everything... After he has destroyed everything... Can that final person in the world forgive himself? I want to know that answer to that question. One who is born with nothing... One who is born unwanted by all... The meaning of life... The value of something existing that has no value... It will teach us these things.</p><p><strong>Shirou:</strong> Sakura... So you used Sakura just for that?</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Yes. I have killed many for this very cause. Therefore, I will not let my hard work be ruined. Let us begin.

All seven Servants are finally assembled. The Fifth Holy Grail War has begun.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Saber? Nice. So it filled up in just ten years, huh? That was much quicker than I expected. The seven Heroic Spirits gather once again... I guess it was inevitable that she would be summoned again once another Grail War started. What a fool. She doesn&#39;t even know what the Grail holds inside.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> Ah, I forgot. You know what the Holy Grail really is since you bathed in the mud the last time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Surviving is proof of my greatness. Those other half-assed mongrels would go completely insane from the power. They&#39;re such fools for seeking out what they believe to be a Wish Maker. They&#39;re already fallen for that farce four times now.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> What will you do, Gilgamesh? There&#39;s no need for you to take part as a Servant this time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to leave the Grail to them. The Grail is mine, and mine alone.</p><p><strong>Kotomine:</strong> ... I see. If that is how you feel, then I think it&#39;s best that you use the Grail.

Not after Sempai has finally started to pay attention to me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I was hoping the Holy Grail wouldn&#39;t form properly, so I&#39;m really disappointed to see that it has gotten this far.

You aren&#39;t going to kill me! I&#39;m... I&#39;m not a bad person!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> You&#39;re such a pain in the ass.

Do you remember the decision I made ten years ago?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Why are you here, Archer? You were summoned in the Last Holy Grail War. How can you be here this time, too?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It&#39;s not very complicated. I stayed in this world after the last Grail War ended.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> But that is... Servants are supposed to lose their connection to this world the moment the Grail disappears. Which means there is no way you could have stayed here for ten years.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I am the only Servant to ever bathe in the Grail. This incarnation became stable in this age ten years ago. ... Hm. You don&#39;t look like you are willing to listen. Why must you hurt me so? You do realize what it means for me to select a Heroic Spirit of your status, right?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> Shall your nonsense ever end? More than a Heroic Spirit, I am a king. I will never bow down and give in to you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Are you sure? You may be a king, but you&#39;re still a woman. And a woman is most happy when she is serving a man. So why do you keep refusing? Do you feel you are just not worthy of being my woman?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> You bastard...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Relax. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ll only take, take, take. I&#39;ll make you feel joy like you never thought possible. I will give you the world if you become mine. You should revel in the delight of knowing that I have decided you to be of such value.</p><p>So I&#39;ll say it one more time, Saber. Be mine. And let us spend our second chance at life together, enjoying all the world has to offer.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ...No. I&#39;d rather lose my first life than spend a second one with you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Your stubborness is one reason I like you so much! I suppose there had to be at least one person to deny me in this world! Whatever... I&#39;ll forgive you this once. And in deference to that sword I will show you all that I am.</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> How pathetic. You&#39;ve bored me, Saber.

You will be gifted with countless shames for surviving the torture.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> What a sight. I&#39;ve always believed a flower to be most beautiful as its petals fall. But even so...

Come back, Berserker!</p><p><em>Berserker Roars</em></p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Stay calm, Illya.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Huh, is that all? The Einzbern Holy Grail is really disappointing. Just touching it with some of my mana contaminated it.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Makiri Holy Grail. It you come closer. I will not. Show you mercy.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah, are you going to play with me? You&#39;re pretty brave for a fake human. Actually... You&#39;re so cute it makes me angry.</p><p>But please don&#39;t worry. It looks like Illya is going to die soon. We didn&#39;t plan to kill her though, did we, Saber?</p><p><strong>Alter:</strong> ...No we did not. What shall we do with Berserker&#39;s corpse? Shall we mourn him, or shall we feed him to the hounds?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Take care of it yourself. Send him back to the wind. Goodbye, descendant of saints. I hope your suffering continues until I am complete.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> ...I can&#39;t let you do that. I don&#39;t care about the Holy Grail. But I will not. Let you harm Illya. Anymore.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Ah... It&#39;s no good, Leys... Forget about me, and run away with Sella. You&#39;re no match for Sakura.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> True, but... I&#39;m so happy you. Said that. Wait for me, Illya. I will to my best. To fight in place. Of Berserker.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Halfway through the story:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Hmm... I&#39;m so happy. For many reasons. <em>clap, clap, clap</em> Anyway. Nice to see you. Guten Tag.</p><p><strong>Luvia:</strong> Oh, what manners you have. But the clapping was not necessary.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> So sad. I even did it louder than. Usual this time.</p><p><strong>Luvia:</strong> You are an Einzbern homunculus, right? I hear there was a new rising star who has been defeating all who oppose her... How amazing it is that there is a homunculus that can match a Servant.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Is that unusual? Are you. Sad?</p><p><strong>Luvia:</strong> I never imagined that I would ever meet such a beautiful and strong humonculus. How lucky! My name is Luviagelita Edelfelt. What is your name? What are you called?</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Leysritt. Illya calls me Leys. Thank you for your kind. Words, Fraeulein Luviagelita.</p><p><strong>Luvia:</strong> Your thanks is not necessary. We are going to be enemies very shortly, are we not? I have heard that homunculi that are made for fighting do not live very long. But before your fire burns out, let me try one of my amazing professional wrestling moves out on you!</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Danke. That was. A fun match. But... I&#39;ll never beat you until I become. More skilled at lucha libre.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Second to last battle:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> I caught up to you. Move away form there. Illya is. Almost completely gone.</p><p><strong>Alter:</strong> Interesting. So you tuned Illyasviel&#39;s life force to your body, I see. The Einzbern Grail will soon break down thanks to Sakura&#39;s poison. However... There&#39;s still a bit of the Grail&#39;s mana left. So why don&#39;t you put it to good use before it is gone.</p><p><em>After The Fight</em></p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> ... Just. A bit more. Wait, Illya. We&#39;re. Going home. Soon.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Last battle:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> I can&#39;t believe that you were able to defeat Saber. Maybe I should have taken you in too.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> ... Stop and think. Sakura. Shiro would be so sad to. See you like this.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Don&#39;t you dare talk to me like you know me! Did you come to try and kill me? I cannot be killed! Once the Holy Grail is full, I won&#39;t feel this pain any longer!</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> That cannot. Happen. Sakura and Illya will not be happy. The truth is. It&#39;s best that. Heaven&#39;s Feel is not made. At all.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Huh? This wavelength. Are you... The Holy Grail&#39;s shell?</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> I will remove. The evil that clings to the Primary Grail. I. Do not understand emotions. But getting along. Is best. After all.</p><p><em>Scene Ends</em></p><hr><p><strong>Leysritt defeat Sakura final scene:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ahhh...</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> Now Sakura. Is safe. The Primary Grail stopped. And. Illya is going to be OK. OK.</p><p>All that is left. Is to go back. To the castle.</p><p>... What? My body. Won&#39;t move. ...Oh. I over did it. I see. My life. Is over.</p><p>But it&#39;s fine. At least Illya. Is safe. I&#39;m sad I can&#39;t check on her. But I&#39;m. So. Happy.</p><p>...Hehehe. I. Did. It. Good girl. Good girl. Well. Good night. Illya.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> (And then I was activated.)</p><p>(It was one month after the other model lost functionality.)</p><p>(I had an audience with my owner once my soul was fused to my new body and I was able to confirm my identity.)</p><p>I call on you for the first time, Miss. I am able to protect you. As the previous model did.</p><p>(My spirit commanded that I pay her every courtesy. But she offered me an expression that I did not expect.)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Call me &quot;Illya&quot;. Leys used to call me that.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> I am. Different. Than her. I apologize. But I am not the same version that. You remember.</p><p>(I told her the truth as gently as possible. Though my vocabulary and way of speaking were embarrassing.)</p><p>(She laughed as dearly as if she already knew me.)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> I know that you&#39;re not her. It&#39;s very nice to meet the same you. I&#39;m so happy to have the chance to get to know someone like that again.</p><p><strong>Leysritt:</strong> ...</p><p>(A shockwave rushed through me. As I combed her silvery hair with my hardened hands, it was as it I had done it many times before.)</p><p>Ah...</p><p>(I didn&#39;t understand the words that left my mouth. But the came out so naturally and felt so good to say.)</p><p>I&#39;m happy when you smile. Illya.</p><p>(And that is how I was born. Leysritt fought so bravely. Now I take her name as my own.)</p>', 897);
