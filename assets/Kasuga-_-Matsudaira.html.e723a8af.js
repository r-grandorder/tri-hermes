Her real name is said to be Fuku.<br> Her father is the chief vassal of Akechi Mitsuhide, who defeated Oda Nobunaga at the Honn\u014D-ji Incident, Sait\u014D Toshimitsu.<br> Her mother is the daughter of Inaba Ittetsu, a commander who achieved many military exploits and was one of the Mino Triumvirate, Oan.<br> Toshimitsu was later defeated in battle and executed, but Fuku was accepted into the kuge[1]: Sanj\u014Du Nishike, which had a blood relationship with her mother, and was raised receiving a high-level education in song and calligraphy.<br> Later, Fuku married Inaba Masanari. Masanari is a commander that serves Toyotomi Hideoyshi, and that would later become Kobayakawa Hideaki\u2019s chief vassal.<br> Kobayakawa Hideaki betrayed the Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara and joined Tokugawa Ieyasu\u2019s side, and led the Eastern Army to victory, but Hideaki passed away in the year 1602 and Masanari became a r\u014Dnin.<br> At that time, hearing the Bakufu was looking for a nursing mother for the second sh\u014Dgun Hidetada\u2019s legitimate son, Takechiyo, Fuku volunteered for it.<br> As a result, she won social status as the Tokugawa\u2019s nursing mother.<br> It is said that Masanari\u2019s merit of war and Fuku\u2019s education, as well as the fact that she had delivered many healthy children and had a good production of milk, were the reasons for her being accepted.</p><p>Fuku brought up Takechiyo pouring all her love to make him a great sh\u014Dgun, the heir of the Tokugawa, and Takechiyo became emotionally attached to Fuku.<br> However because of that, the relationship with his real mother, Oeyo no Kata, didn\u2019t go well.<br> It is said that later, when Eyo no Kata gave birth to his little brother Kunimatsu, and tried to make Kunimatsu the successor,<br> Fuku directly appealed to the retired leading figure Tokugawa Ieyasu and took the pledge of \u300CTakechiyo is the heir\u300D (in posterior fiction).</p><p>But no matter what Fuku raised Takechiyo to become the great sh\u014Dgun Tokugawa Iemitsu.<br> Fuku, who had come to seize power as the sh\u014Dgun\u2019s Court lady with a private chamber, developed the world of\u300C\u014Coku\u300D, whose system hadn\u2019t been established that much despite having existed until then, and laid the foundations of \u014Coku as \u300Ca firm place (system) for the birth and protection of the heir of the Tokugawa\u300D.</p><p>In 1629, as the relationship between the Bakufu and the Imperial Court deteriorated, the Bakufu dispatched Fuku, who had a connection with the Kuge \xB7 Sanj\u014D Nishike.<br> That time, the title that was bestowed to Fuku, who achieved an audience with Emperor Go-mizu-no-O, was \u300CKasuga no Tsubone\u300D.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Always absurdly cheerful and vivid, Japan\u2019s proud super-wet nurse.<br> Cleaning, washing, cooking and sewing, housework, childcare, and anything.<br> Since she raised the child of a military family, of course martial arts and horsemanship are her strong point!<br> She feels proud to have splendidly raised the heir of the Tokugawa,<br> and she wishes for the continuance of a proper \u014Coku, in other words that the Tokugawa lineage can continue legitimately.<br> Of course, there is the natural reasoning that it must happen so peace and tranquility can continue.<br> As the woman of a military family that lost her family and was tossed about by a multitude of wars \u2014\u2014\u2014<br> She only wishes for a peaceful world.</p><h2 id="role-in-the-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-in-the-game" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role in the Game</h2><p>Appears in \u300CTokugawa Kaiten Meiky\u016B: \u014Coku\u300D.<br> At the beginning of the incident, she was already on the verge of existing only as a soul and disappearing.<br> She was saved by Parvati, who found her, and guided the protagonist and company renting her Saint Graph.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>At first I started drawing her thinking on making a form with a round and cute feeling.
