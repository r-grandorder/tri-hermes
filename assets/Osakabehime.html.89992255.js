There&#39;s nothing better than tangerines. Fresh or frozen, they&#39;re always tasty.<br> Talk about the fruit of the gods!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, wait, I&#39;m the god here, aren&#39;t I! Between the tangerines and the kotatsu, I thought I was turning Japanese! I really thought so!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Does Japan not have its own share of gods, Jaguar Warrior? Could you not be both a god and Japanese?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm? (Casual whistling)</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, never mind!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yo, let me get in on this!<br> Turns out it&#39;s still kinda early for surfing!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Not that the seasons ever change &#39;round here!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m surrounded by so many strangers that I&#39;m not quite sure what to do...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Well, I guess I&#39;ve met Murasaki Shikibu before, but that writerly aura is still a lot for me to take.)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Chotto a minute! Why are all you Servants hanging out in my room again!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Where else&#39;re we s&#39;posed to go?<br> You&#39;ve got the only kotatsu in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Honestly though, I have to wonder if leaving it out all year is really the best course of action, meow.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Then again, I guess I used to do the same thing. There&#39;s something to be said for leaving your kotatsu out even in the summer. Something dark, I mean.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry.

It&#39;s a terrible habit of hers, isn&#39;t it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess Batty isn&#39;t home...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Batty? Not home? That is simply not possible.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> No, she&#39;s definitely in here somewhere.<br> I&#39;m sure of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s search the room for her.<br> Huh? How do I know she isn&#39;t actually out?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hehehe, oh Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You saw for yourself how eager Osakabehime was to use Musashi&#39;s absence as an excuse to shut herself in, right?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> She would ever leave!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We have been friends for a long time, so I know her well enough to say that with one-hundred-percent certainty\u2661</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now come on, let&#39;s look for her.<br> Baaatty! Where aaare yooou!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Come out now, while neither Master nor I is upseeet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Olly olly oxen free!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh? Did you just hear something, Master?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmm. Now where could that voice have come from...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Under the kotatsu, maybe?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Under the kotatsu?<br> ...Ah, yes, I see.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Go away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It came from over here...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So it did. Well done, Master\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Huh... It looks like this kotatsu is connected to an alternate dimension.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What do we do now, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Simple. We dive in headfirst!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Understood. Okay, Master, here I go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We go get her!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure Batty is waiting for us to retrieve her.<br> All right then, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nooooooooo!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master. Master! Please, get a hold of yourself!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Of all the places I thought the kotatsu could lead, Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle was not one I even considered!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard you go on about isekai before,<br> Batty, but this is ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Urushaddup! Just go away!<br> I&#39;m shutting myself in and working on my damn book!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Huh? That sounded like it came from...the castle keep?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is MY kotatsu now!<br> Nobody gets in or out unless I seiso!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You said that as if you&#39;re just calling dibs, but I&#39;m honestly impressed you made this place its own separate world. You&#39;re more skilled than I thought, Batty.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Right?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve gotten a lot more used to fighting as a Servant than you&#39;d think!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Heh heh heh, and on that note...byeanara,<br> Ma-chan and Kiyo-yo!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re back again...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I guess Batty must have complete control over that Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure what we can do if she can send us back here with just a flick of her finger...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Bye now! I&#39;ll come back once I&#39;m done with my final draft!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know about this, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Batty is lying. I don&#39;t think she really means to come back at all...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not it. I think that SHE thinks she can&#39;t possibly come back.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmm, now what are we going to do. I do feel bad that her kotatsu kept getting taken over...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...but that doesn&#39;t mean she can just run away from her responsibilities as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> And I think Batty knows that better than anyone.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Which would mean her lie about coming back after finishing her final draft is actually...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, Master? What are you going to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What else?</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...In short, I can live here in peace and tranquility.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Kotatsu, kotatsu, I&#39;m so into you, kotatsuuu\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Don&#39;t come to get me, &#39;cause I don&#39;t wanna leeeave\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Besides, who&#39;d even want to go out when it&#39;s raining? Everyone knows rainy days are the perfect excuse to stay in.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Exactly.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;m not cut out to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...No, no. No, no, no.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of course I know that&#39;s no excuse. I get it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But just like a Berserker can&#39;t help but go berserk,<br> I can&#39;t help the fact that I&#39;m a shut-in at heart.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So it shouldn&#39;t be a problem if I shut myself in for just a little bit now and then, right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... I think I should be okay for twenty...thirty...fifty years or so?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ll still be happy to serve Ma-chan even when [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s} an old [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F lady}.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That wouldn&#39;t bother me at all\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It might not bother you, but it sure as hell would bother me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t I get a say in this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Huh?<br> I... Wha...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-what are you doing here again, Ma-chan!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What do you think, Bats-for-Brains?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Where do YOU of all people get off insulting my intelligence, Kiyo-yo!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What do you mean &quot;of all people&quot;? I&#39;ll have you know I could demonstrate my own intelligence in any number of ways.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...But that is not what is important right now.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I guess the fact that you&#39;d casually consider shutting yourself in for fifty years just goes to show how ridiculous your innately inhuman sense of time is.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I, on the other hand, acquired my inhumanity later on, so my sense of time is so finely attuned I was able to match my breathing to Master&#39;s down to the second. I&#39;m keeping count, so there&#39;s no mistake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(World&#39;s longest awkward pause) Right!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;ll have to get to the bottom of what that long silence meant later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you now. Gee, what a coincidence.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> (Sniff) You can be so cold sometimes, Master...<br> But I won&#39;t let that bring me down!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Hey! What do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what we came here to ask.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> As if turning your room into a separate world wasn&#39;t bad enough, now you want to shut yourself in it for fifty years!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> From one hime to another, I refuse to let you get away with this!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Nooo! I don&#39;t wanna! I&#39;m too scaaared!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Forget it! If you think you can drag me out of here, go ahead and do your worst!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ugh. I&#39;m sorry you had to see my friend behave so disgracefully, Master...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Still, she was at least being truthful in what she said.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> She truly is frightened, and does really want to shut herself away.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But she&#39;s also determined to put up a fight to make that happen now. She never had that kind of confidence before.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> To put it simply, Master...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...she&#39;s just as proud to be your Servant as any of us.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes, that pride may have led her to be weirdly confident about all the wrong things, but that&#39;s just Batty for you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> All right, Master, let&#39;s make our way straight to the castle keep, shall we?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are those the monkeys we saw on the mountain?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> They must have taken a liking to this place.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll just have to move to the Enma-tei, whether they like it or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This place reminds me of Mecha Eli-chan...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh my! Talking about another woman when you&#39;re here with me!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well I never!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> At any rate, my nose is telling me we should keep heading up.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Unfortunately, there&#39;s a limit to what my Stalking Skill can track when I&#39;m not using them on you...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But, hehehe, the good news is, I don&#39;t need them to know where she&#39;s hiding.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s in her room again...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Agreed. Now come on, let&#39;s head straight up to the top of this castle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Haha, maybe the kotatsu in her room here leads to yet another alternate world.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So a world inside a world, like a set of Matryoshka dolls? That does sound like an interesting idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hehehe. All that aside, we haven&#39;t had many chances to be alone lately, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let this one go to waste!<br> Now come on, let&#39;s take it niiice and slow.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Like, three steps forward, three steps back slow\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not slow, that&#39;s literally going nowhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Chotto a minute! Are you just using me as an excuse to get your own fun in, Kiyo-yo!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I sure am\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Waaahhh! I thought we were besties!<br> Have you no kokoro!?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Me? Heartless? How rude.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have you know there is no Servant in this entire world whose heart burns hotter than mine.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Right, Master?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...All sorts of Servants have started visiting my room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s probably a good thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I used to be sad and mopey all the time.<br> Now I think I&#39;m leading a fuller life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Every day here is great. The work, the training, the small talk... It&#39;s all so refreshingly straightforward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have old friends here I can be myself around, and I&#39;ve made new ones, too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If someone asked whether or not I liked this,<br> my honest answer would be that I do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But every time I come to that conclusion, I can feel the gears in my heart creaking against the strain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, no, no.<br> This isn&#39;t who you are.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s when I start to feel bad again. Not at how wrongly I&#39;m behaving, but at how right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I want to be left alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s just as hard now as it was before. Being around people is tiring, all the smiling gives me a cramp, I can&#39;t get any work done on my book...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But at the same time, I can&#39;t pretend to be a proud lone wolf. I still get lonely.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unlike a certain king I could name, I can&#39;t really say I&#39;m okay just being all by myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It sucks. My feelings are all over the place, and I can&#39;t put them into words in any kind of way that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I half-ass everything... I can never choose a side...<br> I&#39;m a bat, a snake, a castle monster...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know WHAT I am.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Is something wrong, Master?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You looked as though you were dreaming even while you were walking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, I guess I spaced out.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmph. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d space out when you&#39;re here with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think...I just saw one of Osakabehime&#39;s dreams...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, this is Batty\u2013Osakabehime&#39;s domain. It&#39;s no surprise something like that could happen here.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing as strong as a Reality Marble, of course. It&#39;s just a big papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 delusion stretched as far as it&#39;ll go.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I could burn it all now and this would be over in an instant, but Batty really would shut herself away if I did that.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll need you to join me for at least a little while longer, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What is this writing?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ah! That&#39;s my\u2013!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...No, everything&#39;s fine. Now that its magical energy is gone, it&#39;s just a plain old bit of text.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just put it in this box over here and leave it by the wall.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Phew.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You owe me one, Batty.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll do my best to make it up to you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> This hall is very long...but my Stalking Skill is never wrong.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> And right now, it&#39;s telling me it won&#39;t be long until we see Batty in person.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Grr. So you finally made it, Kiyo-yo and Ma-chan...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But I&#39;m daijo... I&#39;m okay. You can leave now. I&#39;m essentially just hiding out in my kotatsu, anyway.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You need to go outside sometimes, Batty.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> No I don&#39;t. What&#39;s wrong with staying in?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You&#39;re only being halfway honest about this. You want to go out, but you also don&#39;t want to go out.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...It doesn&#39;t make any sense, does it?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I have been enjoying myself here,<br> thanks to Ma-chan giving me the push I needed.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But...it&#39;s also so exhausting!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I understand. Okay then, let&#39;s fight it out.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Uh, why?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master wants to help you,<br> and you want to turn [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} away.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> We could talk it out for days and never get anywhere. Violence, on the other hand, is a much faster solution.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I think you might be spending too much time with Tomoe these days, Kiyo-yo! You&#39;re starting to sound just like her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can we at least try talking this out first?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> N-no! There&#39;s nothing I want to talk about!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you hiding something, Hime?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> N-no! Not a damn thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now that was just an outright lie.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You have something you want to talk about,<br> and there&#39;s something you&#39;re hiding.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But you&#39;re too embarrassed to share.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gnnnh...! You big baka lie detector!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Fine then! If that&#39;s how you want to play this, then kakatte come on!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what I gotta do to maintain my hiko lifestyle for a while, I&#39;ll meet violence with violence!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yeooowch! Hot, hot, hot!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Mmm, roast bat\u266A</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I knew you were a dragon,<br> but I didn&#39;t think you were a demon too!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Ugh, fine! You win! I give up!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Good. All right, Batty, tell us what&#39;s really going on.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gnnn...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Here, Master, I&#39;ll give you two some space.<br> That&#39;s two you owe me now, Batty.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I know, I know.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...I felt us syncing up earlier.<br> You saw something, didn&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I saw what life in Chaldea has been like for you.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Then I shouldn&#39;t really need to say anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I saw the same you I always do.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...That isn&#39;t who I always am.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I could never live with myself if it was.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Basically, I guess...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been having a constant stream of visitors in my room lately.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> They&#39;re loud, and annoying, and exasperating...but I don&#39;t have the guts to tell them to leave.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> And even if I hole up on my own like this...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...it just doesn&#39;t feel like the amazing paradise it used to...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I can&#39;t make up my mind how I feel.<br> I don&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> When I&#39;m alone, I want company.<br> When I have company, I want to be alone.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Pretty selfish of me, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is it...?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Yes! It is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t really call that selfish.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Well it is!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...That said, this really isn&#39;t that big of a deal. Honestly.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I just need to try a little harder.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If I&#39;m alone, I can just go hang out with someone.<br> And if I&#39;m with someone, I can just go be by myself.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The only problem is, I can&#39;t find the courage to do that. I mean, how could I?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> The only one who inspires me to be brave like that is...well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> How can you be such a baka!?<br> I&#39;m talking about you, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait. You don&#39;t mean me, do you?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> You&#39;re really just starting to wakarunderstand!?</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Between last winter and this spring the frequency of you visiting me considerably dropped!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> This is a huge problem, Ma-chan!<br> Now look me in the eyes and tell me the truth!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Did you stop visiting because my kotatsu is too hot?<br> Have I been getting in your way somehow?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Gyaaaaaah! What am I even saying!?)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Yabe! I can barely believe what I&#39;m saying,<br> and I&#39;m the one saying it!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Still, there is no arguing [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} hasn&#39;t been coming to my room lately!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Whatever [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} tells me,<br> I have to be ready to handle it!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (At least this isn&#39;t a normal Holy Grail War,<br> so I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about getting fired!)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Although, I guess [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} could force me to go into my spirit form... Iyaaaaa!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to get in the way of your writing...</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;re you talking about?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is everything okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe you should take a little break...</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Sorry Ma-chan, but would you mind being shizuquiet for a bit!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Rrgh, none of this is working!<br> I can&#39;t seem to get my thoughts in order!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I, uh, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Done! It&#39;s all done!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Congratulations!</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Now to ride this high and get started on my next book!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m just gonna get going, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> (Humming happily)</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I... I... I...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> I was so focused on my books that I didn&#39;t even realize how much of a jerk I was being! I&#39;m so soooooorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Well? Is everything better now?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> If by \u201Cbetter\u201D you mean \u201Cdeeply hazukashii at how badly I treated Master and my completely dumb misreading of the situation\u201D...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> ...then yes, I guess you could say things are better now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I should have said something sooner.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ugh. You really need to stop coddling your Servants so much, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s obvious that you didn&#39;t do this out of malice, Batty.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> So if Master is willing to forgive you,<br> I&#39;ll at least hold off on calling in Musashi.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Okay, would you mind not just going from zero to nightmare scenario like it&#39;s no big deal!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Whenever Musashi shows up, she&#39;s always smiles and positive energy, and she absolutely destroys my entire gloomy shtick!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> But anyway...I&#39;ll go back now.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;re with me, Ma-chan,<br> I can deal with just about anything.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> So, um...do you think you might be willing to come visit me again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...And so, my selfish attempt at running away\u2013or running and hiding, in this case\u2013ended just like that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Once again, my room became a popular hangout spot...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but thanks to the little pipsque\u2013Ms. Beni-Enma&#39;s advice, I decided to make a \u201CDo Not Disturb\u201D sign.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It turns out people here can be surprisingly respectful of each other&#39;s privacy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now, when I need to focus on my books without interruption or intrusion, I just put up the sign.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And if I feel like having company again, I just take it down and the place becomes lively in no time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Of course, I told Ma-chan [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} can ignore that sign and come in whenever [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} likes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I don&#39;t usually notice [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} coming in when I&#39;m focused on my book...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but whenever I turn around and notice [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} sitting nearby, just cheerfully reading manga...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...it makes me feel both incredibly happy and incredibly apologetic all at once.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ll probably need to come up with a name for this feeling someday...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...but for now, I&#39;m content keeping it tucked away inside my kokoro...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> All right, time to put up the \u201CDo Not Disturb\u201D<br> sign and get to work on my\u2013</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Gyaaaaaah!<br> Did I just kick something soft!?</p><p><strong>Low Blood Pressure Kunoichi:</strong><br> Zee zee zee... Zee zee zee...</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong><br> Are you really asleep? &#39;Cause you&#39;re just saying the letters in \u201Czzz\u201D instead of actually snoring!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Oh well.
