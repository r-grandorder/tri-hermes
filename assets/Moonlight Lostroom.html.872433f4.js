But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is there something wrong with that warehouse?</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> Nothing, it&#39;s just weird to see people around there.</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> The Lost Room is there, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lost Room...?</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> It&#39;ll sound like a ghost story.</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> They say people disappear when they enter at midnight.</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> And this isn&#39;t an isolated incident, there are many reports about it.</p><p><strong>Duston:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s no more than a warehouse, a forgotten relic from the previous Director&#39;s era.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> You want to reorganize humanity based in the caste system?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I won&#39;t allow a society where my destiny is set in stone from the moment I was born!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Go, Berserker!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Director!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> What did you expect?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Who do you think I am?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I&#39;m Chaldea&#39;s Director and owner of the Celestial Body Department in Clock Tower!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I&#39;m Olga Marie Animusphere!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> If we talk about Master potential, you of all people shouldn&#39;t be that surprised!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Director, above!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Look above!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods aren&#39;t needed anymore.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> This planet now belongs to humanity.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It&#39;s too late for gods to claim ownership over it!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Archer!

Fujimaru...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Where did you go?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Perhaps I didn&#39;t do well as a Master?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Tell me! What does this mean!?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Was I asleep...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It feels like I had a weird dream.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Can we continue now, Olga?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Lev...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Y-Yeah... Go on.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s about the unknown location observed by CHALDEAS the other day, Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That was it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It&#39;s an alarming situation indeed.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> At this rate, it will become a Singularity disturbing human history.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I wonder if I should report this to the Association and the UN...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I believe it&#39;s too soon for that.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Maybe CHALDEAS isn&#39;t working properly.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s been eleven years since it began operations in 2004.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> How about trying a maintenance?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That won&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> CHALDEAS is a pseudo-celestial body copying the Earth&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Stopping CHALDEAS is the same as killing it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> To begin with, my CHALDEAS lacks any imperfection.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> If it has a problem, the reason must be an external factor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An external factor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, if CHALDEAS isn&#39;t at fault, the issue must be in the Observation Lens SHEBA.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh? It would be my fault if that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that my SHEBA has been working for 10 years.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Perhaps its theory isn&#39;t up to date.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I never said I had complaints towards you, Lev!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> There&#39;s the possibility of the staff in the Control Room overlooking something...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> ...due to the Association harassing them all the time.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> The staff is completely healthy.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> If you ask me, the one who should take a day off is you, Director.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I agree.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t been sleeping properly since we discovered this anomaly one week ago.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Let the doctors check your condition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aside from Leyshift experiment report, the report for the selection of Masters candidates is also finished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, please use the next twelve hours to rest as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have a replacemente for you, Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Alright, I&#39;ll take your advice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Speaking of rest, proffesor Lev must be sleeping well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard that going to bed and waking up early it&#39;s healthy.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That? Because my work was very exhausting before coming to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Once I completed SHEBA, I stopped seeing dreams.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I can sleep soundly at night now.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> What about you, Romani?</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> It&#39;s the opposite for me.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> Since I came here, all I see are dreams.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> But the dreams are always different.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> An organization established by my father in order to ensure the future.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The Animuspheres are a magi family that have studied the celestial bodies from long ago.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The mission of this family, of the Animuspheres, is to establish the thesis of the Grand Order.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That is, to guarantee the human history on this planet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> We see into the future to ensure that human history will continue beyond the present.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> We don&#39;t aim for something big like &quot;creating the future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Our mission is to guarantee that &quot;there is a future,&quot; and pass that onto other magi.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> For that reason, the Animusphere created this Mystic Code.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Pseudo-Celestial Body, CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Assuming the planet had a soul, we copied that soul and put it inside this model of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> But, we can&#39;t interfere with this second Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That&#39;s because its phase it&#39;s different.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s possible to analyze it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> My father configured CHALDEAS one hundred years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> As long as the light of civilization shines in CHALDEAS, we can assure the survival of humanity for the next one hundred years.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> At the same time, CHALDEAS works as a library of Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> We can&#39;t observe in detail the future one hundred years ahead.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Because the future is always changing.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> However, details of the confirmed past can be extracted.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It&#39;s a compass pointing towards the past of humanity, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The success rate of sending someone to the past via Leyshifting after quantum decomposition...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> ...raises dramatically thanks to CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> My father founded Chaldea in order to observe and operate CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> He was a great researcher and a great magus.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That was my father... he left me alone after passing away three years ago.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> His dead body was found in his office, back in 2012.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even know if he had an accidental death or if he had an illness.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I was just a little girl who took over Chaldea after his death.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> My father didn&#39;t leave me anything.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> But I did receive his conviction as a magus of Animusphere.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It has been two years since I became Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> And just when I thought I was finally starting to get things done...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, why one hundred years into the future?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> What do you mean, Mashu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, if the only thing that matters is to see that civilization continues, why not set it to one day or one year after?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s about response time, Mashu.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> If we set it to one day, there&#39;s nothing we can do if the light of civilization disappears.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> There&#39;s no solution.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> However, if the destruction comes one or ten years later, that&#39;s time enough to act.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I believe the previous Director set it in one hundred years to give humanity enough time to prepare.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The previous Director thought things through.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> B-But of course!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> My father was a very prudent and thoughtful person!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t act based on speculations nor wishful thinking.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System must be there for situations like that, too.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> If an abnormality emerged in the past, it would be impossible for us in the present to fix it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> At least not if you don&#39;t go directly to that era to solve it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if Leyshift succeeds, you can only send a magus by himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once in that location, there&#39;s no weapons to rely on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For that reason you need Heroic Spirits, the Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits exist as they&#39;re an extension of human history, in spite of how much it can change.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By borrowing their power, you can hold your ground in any era.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> So, that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits are spiritual phenomenons of higher order.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> The Throne of Heroes lies in a dimension above our own.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> They&#39;re beings that transcend time.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> Just like Chaldea, they&#39;re a security mechanism to protect The Human Order.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> Because, as long as you make a contract with them, they can be summoned into any era.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System isn&#39;t stable yet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> And first we must secure those Master candidates with high Leyshift aptitude.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I must make sure to verify that information...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I wish Da Vinci were more cooperative with our cause.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Olga, what about giving him...<br> I mean, her, a workshop?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Not yet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I can&#39;t trust a Masterless Servant.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Besides, I can&#39;t deal with that Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Once we accomplish another summoning,<br> I&#39;ll have her leave immediately.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> That&#39;s harsh.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard Da Vinci-chan sees you as her little sister.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> We should leave Da Vinci in charge of the Heroic Spirit Summoning.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> So we can focus in the Masters selection.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Olga, are you done choosing the A-Team?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> &quot;I recommend these seven magi if an emergency arises.&quot;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Those were the orders my father left.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Father ordered to call them Crypters instead of Master candidates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Director...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t seem like it was made here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> How weird... it was supposed to be under strict security measures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this something important?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t use it anymore.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of the presents from the Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Atlas Institute?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The ones who provided the blueprint for the TRISMEGISTUS....</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...resting at the core of Chaldea? Them?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The place where the definitive weapons of the world of magecraft are stored.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The Pit of Taboo... The Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> My father had a deal with Atlas, and based on it, they had to provide us with technology.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> That&#39;s how we got the Pseudo-Quantum Processor: TRISMEGISTUS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The other one was that...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> The Imaginary Numbers Observation System: PAPER MOON.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> PAPER MOON...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> A plane moon, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s my first time hearing of it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> So, what does it do?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It&#39;s a compass that allows you to demonstrate and observe the Imaginary Numbers realm.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> It was prepared as a means to exceed CHALDEAS&#39; phase contrast.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Although, it isn&#39;t need anymore.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Because SHEBA was completed and we could accomplish Leyshifting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There is another way to interfere with Singularities besides Leyshifting?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> By diving into the realm of Imaginary Numbers to later resurface in the appointed location.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> We called it Zero Sail.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong><br> And the ship that made that possible was the Shadow Border.<br> Keep the secret.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I get it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> There was a machine unused thanks to me finishing SHEBA.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You got me there.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but feel that I wasn&#39;t really needed.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Lev...?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a thought.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s a bit sudden, but that&#39;s how things are.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say it took me by surprise.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Olga, I completed the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA back in 1999.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s when I accepted Marisbilly&#39;s invitation.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> My destiny was determined at that moment.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> To save humanity...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> To make this planet a better place.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That became the goal of my life.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Before and after this incident.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The future that humans build is versatile and keeps changing.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s why there&#39;s no stability.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Humanity&#39;s existence is wonderful, but they carry a big burden.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t it be bad if it collapses like a mountain of pebbles?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly what I want to avoid.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do much by myself.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> But, at least I can stop one of those pebbles before crumbling.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> What about you?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Do you want to be part of that big burden?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Do you want to carry that burden?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Or maybe you want to keep away those pebbles from your feet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I&#39;m none of that.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> This big duty of preserving the Human Order only brings me anxiety.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I don&#39;t give a damn about the future and its importance.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> All I have is this obsession to demonstrate that I&#39;m capable of doing it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Everyday is painful...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Everyday, there&#39;s no future...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> What will I do once the end comes...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> Is there a way for me to be happy...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know at all what my purpose should be...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong><br> This is so...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh, look at the time.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Pardon my discourtesy, but I&#39;ll be very busy from now on.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Are you Olga Marie?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> My name is Lev Lainur, nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh?
