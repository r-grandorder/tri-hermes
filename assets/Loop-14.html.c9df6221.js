Never know where the next dead end might be waiting for you...!</p><hr><p>\u201CSay, all this shiny stuff... which ones still need sharpening?</p><p>I&#39;ve gotten the hang of it, but I&#39;ve never done ones this long, see. Still don&#39;t know if it&#39;s right.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShould be fine for regular use... Neko-san, what exactly are we shopping for?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you have to ask me, huh? Bet you&#39;ve no idea what I&#39;m thinking.</p><p>And you, Emiyan, don&#39;t you think I have worries, ambitions? I know I&#39;m just an average nobody, but doesn&#39;t it look like I just don&#39;t think ahead?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t mind. That&#39;s what I like about my boss, actually. You were the only one who would hire me right away when I was still a kid.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhh, that... Yep, I&#39;d hafta agree. Good choice, methinks.</p><p>Hmm, oh yeah. When ya think about it, there are good points too.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; nods Neko-san while examining the saw blade.</p><p>But eventually, her already narrow eyes narrow even further.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, but it&#39;s actually blood-related. I&#39;ve seen it myself many times in my student days. Fujimura is obviously like your sister-in-law.\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><p>I don&#39;t really understand the comparison, but I kind of get what she&#39;s trying to say.</p><p>In essence, she wants to say that it&#39;s like a parent having no other choice but to take care of their child.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Mm... Alright, I&#39;ve decided. The cleaver can be replaced by a kitchen knife, but the saw is a thing in itself.</p><p>What do you think, Emiya-n? Is the price right for this saw?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt isn&#39;t. However, this isn&#39;t the best one for the job, either. The other double-edged blade looks crude, but is much better. Even you should be able to finish it all in a day with that one, boss.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat? Don&#39;t say that you know what I was actually planning to do.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI can guess. Your rival just got hired, right?\u201D</p><p>...Best if I keep to the back of the shop, though.</p><p>Hanging around the shop unoccupied can be scary. Better pray the big game hunting season hasn&#39;t started, that&#39;s my boss.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah? That &quot;rival&quot; you speak of, distilling liquor even further, what&#39;s up with that? ...Speaking of which, wasn&#39;t there some weird protest about distilling Japanese sake?</p><p>Yeah, sake... Its taste is already beyond awesome, nothing compares to it. We&#39;ll be in real trouble if reaches perfection. Oh well, whatever.\u201D</p><hr><p>Don&#39;t let this inconsistent manner of speech overwhelm you.</p><p>It seems the style suits Neko-san rather well, actually.</p><p>That&#39;s the Copenhagen family. Blood is thicker than water.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, how about that one? You said we should get screws and not just nails or something like that, no?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes, we&#39;re a little over budget, but that is correct.</p><p>Now that...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat now, going for the luxury? Couldn&#39;t you get by with just one screwdriver?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDefinitely not. And we&#39;ll need them eventually anyway, so let&#39;s get the whole set. Tools are never useless.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so...? Hm, whatever you say, you&#39;re the expert. Fine, I&#39;ll cover the rest.\u201D</p><p>When it comes to various odd jobs, the word of Emiya Shirou seems to have gained a lot of trust.</p><p>...I don&#39;t recall doing any carpentry work around the shop, but, according to the boss, that aura stuck anyway.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd a receipt, please. That&#39;s for &quot;Copenhagen,&quot; and these tools for Hotaruzuka.\u201D</p><p><em>ka-ching</em> And Neko-san is done at the register.</p><p>Hotaruzuka is her family name.</p><p>The proper spelling of &quot;Neko&quot; is unclear. She wouldn&#39;t tell me when I asked, and since she just signs with &quot;Hotaruzuka,&quot; it remains a mystery.</p><hr><p>We pile up the bags onto her truck.</p><p>Originally, this truck was bought to transport alcohol, so carrying plywood and timber isn&#39;t a problem either.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood job. That&#39;s it for the day.</p><p>And might as well give ya a ride home.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThanks a lot. Can you drop me off just after the bridge?</p><p>I&#39;ve got to get some groceries for dinner at the shopping district.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh? Too bad, I was going to treat you for dinner today, but you already have plans. You&#39;re like the mother of a large family, after all.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...There&#39;s something wrong with that. I appreciate the concern, however.</p><p>And anyway, by &quot;dinner&quot; I assume you mean the Kitamura teahouse?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou read my mind. You shouldn&#39;t disregard the Kitamura like that though. Lately, the food is better and the prices are down, even though service is bad and a weird ghost story surrounds it.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ghost story? What&#39;s with that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI don&#39;t really know the details. In the version that Furumi heard, a girl beautiful beyond words appears at midnight. She then orders a meal for two, even though she&#39;s alone, and before you know it, eats it all up.</p><p>And then, as soon as the waitress taking the payment turns away, she disappears without a trace.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh... Well, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that scary.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHm? Why not?\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe&#39;s a beauty, right? A sight for sore eyes then, isn&#39;t it? And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a curse or something. She pays for the meal, and rather politely disappears right after.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hmm. I&#39;d be more scared of a paying ghost than a cursed one myself. Ghosts usually just wander around, right? So they aren&#39;t that scary by themselves. But if they pay, give you stuff... in other words, make direct contact, you might touch them wrong and die.</p><p>Then those aren&#39;t really ghosts, either. Well, whatever. That is, if the girl didn&#39;t just drink too much.\u201D</p><hr><p>...I see, I guess you could put it that way too.</p><p>Things like ghosts can&#39;t be seen by humans in the first place.</p><p>They&#39;re invisible, and it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re polite or not.</p><p>But, if one is actually following human rules, the situation changes.</p><p>That&#39;s not a ghost anymore.</p><p>It&#39;s a non-human being that exists to bring harm to all living things...</p><hr><p>...For example.</p><p>If a strange girl were to appear, wandering around at night...</p><hr><p>\u201C...Say, Neko-san. Couldn&#39;t we go talk to the waitress that saw the ghost\u2015\u2015\u2015?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? Isn&#39;t that Otoko with Shirou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYep, Otoko and Shirou.</p><p>What brings you here? Aren&#39;t you still at work? I thought Copenhagen is way down near the industrial district?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFujimura. Did you forget what we agreed on?\u201D</p><p>\u201CEh? Ugh, if you mean the last debt, didn&#39;t I pay that off already? What am I forgetting... Ah.</p><p>Right, totally slipped my mind. Sorry, sorry. Well, whatever. Can&#39;t you overlook it like always?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLike hell I&#39;m letting you off with just that.</p><p>And besides, the only reason it exists is because you said something stupid. Emiyan still doesn&#39;t know, so watch your mouth.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh? No way, Shirou still doesn&#39;t know? Don&#39;t you know each other for five years already?</p><p>...Wow, unbelievable. Hey, I&#39;ve kept quiet all this time, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because I didn&#39;t know he was your adopted brother until a year ago. You too, you only found out that Emiyan was working for me about a year ago, yeah?</p><p>Right, Emiyan?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. Fuji-Nee told me to go buy some sake. A regular store wouldn&#39;t sell me any, and I was going to pedal to Copenhagen. So she asked why the heck would I go all the way to Neko&#39;s place.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYep, yep. That&#39;s how it was.</p><p>And then I went straight to Neko&#39;s, didn&#39;t I?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWith a shinai on your back. I studied liberal arts, I thought there was no way I&#39;d win against the Tiger of Fuyuki.</p><p>Be thankful, Fujimura. Had Emiyan not interrupted, neither one of us would have stayed in this world.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Hehehe.</p><p>That is, whichever would have been the murderer, and whichever one stuck in a wall, or ended up on a hospital bed while the other&#39;s in a grave.</p><p>To protect a certain someone&#39;s reputation, I won&#39;t mention how the roles were about to get assigned. However, from that day on, anything less than absolute obedience to Neko-san was out of the question.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph, wasn&#39;t that entirely your fault, Neko?</p><p>When I heard that he actually worked there for four years already, I regretted not bringing a real sword.</p><p>And you, Shirou. Why on Earth would you go work for a liquor store? Doesn&#39;t Copenhagen turn into a pub at night? It&#39;s a gathering spot for Homurabara&#39;s &quot;old girls,&quot; an evil women&#39;s den, didn&#39;t you know?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI didn&#39;t. First of all, all the customers are decent people. And Homurabara&#39;s only hazardous former student is you, Fuji-Nee.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, you tell her, Emiyan! Just like I thought, Copenhagen&#39;s future star of hope! There, come to me when you graduate, I&#39;ll make one fine bartender out of you!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>I feel a quick tug on my left hand.</p><hr><p>\u201CDon&#39;t be ridiculous, Otoko. As the homeroom teacher and guardian, I won&#39;t allow it!</p><p>Shirou will go to university, and I won&#39;t let him get sucked into a lifestyle as stylish as that!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWha?\u201D</p><p>Now my right hand gets tugged.</p><hr><p>\u201CGuh, you just don&#39;t learn, do you, Fujimura!</p><p>Should Emiyan even enter college, it&#39;ll soon be over with this kind of academic background, don&#39;t you get it!?</p><p>You there are a good example of that!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s my line, you idiot!</p><p>Smartest kid in the house, yet you wasted everything because of alcohol addiction, you hopeless bum!</p><p>And we aaalll admired you, yet you, &quot;It&#39;s too much work, I quit, tee-hee\u2606,&quot; just simply drop out of school on us!! And to finish it off, you set up a dust bomb on my desk!!\u201D</p><hr><p>Danger, Will Robinson, danger...!</p><p>A Daniel come to judgment! This is a public place, please s-t-o-p...!</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, be thankful I set it up at just the residence!</p><p>Besides, thanks to you spreading my name with a weird pronunciation all over the net, there wasn&#39;t a single guy in my youth!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow come!? &quot;<ruby>Otoko<rt>man</rt></ruby>&quot; is a lovely name! Yet you made me promise to call you &quot;Neko&quot; in front of people! How about we exchange names, you...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHa, fat chance! If that&#39;s what it comes to, I&#39;d rather swap names with an American guy from 3-chome than you!\u201D</p><hr><p>Ouch.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is... well, I&#39;d say she&#39;s about to lose it.</p><p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen Neko-san this excited.</p><p>...I see, she really was well-taught in liberal arts.</p><hr><p>Ack, danger-danger-danger!</p><p>Do the two of them realize that at this rate, it&#39;ll be the three of us leaving this cruel world behind?</p><hr><p>\u201CHah, truly a girl that spent her teenage years with alcohol and dumbbells! I wonder if the saying that reference books are like lead has some truth to it!\u201D</p><p>\u201CBah, unfounded rumors certainly were your specialty!</p><p>My strength comes from helping around the shop since I was a child, as you know yourself, Fujimura!\u201D</p><hr><p>It&#39;s like a stand-off between a cat and a tiger.</p><p>Caught between two wild beasts, both of my shoulders come out with a tragic snap.</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Aah... I&#39;ve grown accustomed to pain, but having both limbs extracted simultaneously sends me into shock. My consciousness starts to fade...</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh? Shirou, why are your arms stretching? Rubber? Did you eat some strange fruit?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAck, aieee!!!?</p><p>Fujimura, call an ambulance, an ambulance...!</p><p>E-Emiyan&#39;s arms are falling out!!\u201D</p><p>\u201CStop exaggerating, you. It&#39;s just his shoulders joints that are dislocated, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>Ah... I got a bad feeling about this.</p><p>Stop. Someone stop that tiger, I beg you.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd it&#39;s not like they&#39;re broken.</p><p>Now, watch this, Otoko. This here, goes like so\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh?\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;Huh&quot; it is not!!!</p><p>Waaah, beer for Emiyan, no, wait, put his mouth under the beer tap...!\u201D</p><hr><p>Heh... hehe... Told you, you can never tell where a dead end might be lurking......
