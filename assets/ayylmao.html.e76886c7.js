It won&#39;t be long now before I arrive at my destination in southern Nevada.</p><p>Not that it&#39;ll change anything once I get there.</p><p>I certainly won&#39;t be getting a reward for my trouble.</p><p>Nor do I have a home to return to, or enough fuel to get me there even if I did.</p><p>The only point this journey ever had was to get where I was going.</p><p>...Well, no, that may be technically accurate, but it&#39;s still not quite right. Let me be clear, so I don&#39;t invite any misunderstandings.</p><p>When I say I don&#39;t have a home to return to, I don&#39;t mean that in the heartless, cold-blooded bastard sense.</p><p>My home may be gone now, but I still remember it clearly. And as long as I have those memories, I&#39;ll never feel the pain of its loss.</p><p>See, since I was born, I&#39;ve had the ability, for better or worse, to recall anything I&#39;ve ever seen in perfect detail.</p><p>It&#39;s called, \u201Chyperthymesia,\u201D though it&#39;s more commonly known as a superior autobiographical memory.</p><p>My friends considered it a disability, and sympathized with the drawbacks, but scientists considered it a gift.</p><p>It drove me insane when I was a kid. At some points, it caused me to hate cities and people in general.</p><p>When I grew up, I left the city behind and started living a much quieter life out in a village near the mountains.</p><p>As a result, I&#39;ve only spent about a third of my life in busy, urban areas, so I&#39;m not really overburdened with memories of those places.</p><p>Still, my memories are just as clear now as they ever were. I can see the friends I used to hang out with smiling and laughing as if they were right here with me.</p><p>Of course, that includes the beautiful scenery and the stars that used to twinkle bright all across the nighttime sky.</p><p>...Maybe that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t shake my doubts about why this happened the way it did.</p><p>Something just seemed...off.</p><p>I don&#39;t mean the Earth&#39;s surface being bleached white. I mean it feels like something even bigger has changed, but in a way I can&#39;t put my finger on it.</p><p>Whatever it is, I&#39;ve noticed it at different points during this journey.</p><p>There was something different about the skies above Russia, Scandinavia, China, India... Whatever it was, they weren&#39;t the same skies I&#39;d seen before.</p><p>There must be some other change occurring in places I&#39;m not privy to. Or maybe some other humans besides me are struggling to fight back.</p><p>Maybe they&#39;re doing their best to retake this world, this planet, this universe for humanity even as I speak.</p><p>...Unfortunately, as intriguing as that possibility is, those places are much too far away for me to make a detour, and I have precious little time left as it is.</p><p>I ran out of food yesterday, and my bike&#39;s not going to last much longer, either.</p><p>Again, once I reach my destination, my journey is over.</p><p>It would be nice if whoever&#39;s causing these changes taking place around the world were to stop by the States...</p><p>...but I doubt anyone who&#39;s lost as hard as me and the rest of humanity have anything close to that kind of good luck left.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WBhxuQc.png" alt=""></p><p>...What a strange feeling.</p><p>Even if this is the end for me, in multiple senses, it still feels good to achieve the goal I set for myself.</p><p>\u201CWhy did humanity die out?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy did these alien invaders show up?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy did they conquer us by bleaching the Earth white?\u201D</p><p>My heart is racing at the prospect of possibly uncovering the answers to these and all the other mysteries.</p><p>I&#39;ve arrived at the U.S. Air Force base once known as Area 51. It&#39;s the one place\u2013the only part of the texture\u2013on the entire planet that managed to evade the bleaching.</p><p>The sheer secrecy surrounding this place led to all sorts of rumors about high-tech experiments and training being conducted here, but you&#39;d never know that looking at it now.</p><p>Not only are there no survivors here, there&#39;s not so much as a single piece of cutting-edge equipment.</p><p>Any seaplanes and armored tanks that may have been here before are long gone.</p><p>And since there&#39;s no power, I doubt I&#39;ll be able to stock up on food or water, either.</p><p>On the plus side, the buildings are mostly untouched, so at least I shouldn&#39;t have to go sifting through rubble.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VbjPMrY.png" alt=""></p><p>...I can&#39;t believe it. Rain clouds cropped up here out of nowhere. I guess that means it still rains in the last area on Earth that hasn&#39;t been bleached away.</p><p>I pushed my excitement down to keep it from getting the better of me, and began carefully making my way through the base.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LIznRIf.png" alt=""></p><p>The rain clouds that cropped up in the skies overhead stuck around the whole time I was there.</p><p>I learned several things from my expedition into the inside of the base; the part completely cut off from the outside world.</p><p>I wish I could offer my own personal insights on what I found, but since I&#39;m running low on both time and energy, I&#39;ll have to stick to just the facts.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1i8T2ZR.png" alt=""></p><p>This base did in fact contain an alien life-form.</p><p>\u201C2016 - Subject E Relocation\u201D</p><p>\u201C2016 - Initiate Subject E Examination\u201D</p><p>According to the documents I found, this \u201Csubject\u201D had flown to New Mexico in the year 2016.</p><p>The craft it had been piloting either burned up when it entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere (or was possibly destroyed by the subject itself, according to a handwritten note)...</p><p>...leaving the subject completely exposed upon its discovery.</p><p>The injuries sustained during its emergency landing had left it critically wounded and near death...</p><p>...but by flash-freezing it, the Air Force managed to preserve its life functions. They then brought it to this base.</p><p>All the other records pertaining to the subject can be summed up in a single word: \u201Cgruesome.\u201D</p><p>The scientists performed all kinds of tests, experiments, and surgeries in order to keep this alien visitor alive.</p><p>They conducted clinical trials with different kinds of medicine. They tested every known substance on Earth to see how it would react.</p><p>They observed reactions that corresponded to pain.</p><p>They observed reactions that corresponded to joy.</p><p>To measure its endurance, they stopped supplying it with nutrients. Then they tried burning it. Freezing it. Melting it. Attaching things to it.</p><p>They stirred its intestines around. Cut off parts of its body. Measured signals from the organ they thought was its brain.</p><p>They performed all of this research, what could also be called the very crystallization of human history, on the subject while it was still living.</p><p>...It didn&#39;t take long for the surgical procedures meant to resuscitate the subject to morph into brutally exploitative experiments.</p><p>And since the cells taken from the subject&#39;s samples were made up of elements that didn&#39;t exist anywhere on the planet...</p><p>...it wasn&#39;t hard to imagine that further research could eventually lead to military and civilian applications.</p><p>Truth be told, that was where the top brass&#39;s true interests lied.</p><p>After all, ever since the turn of the twentieth century, the energy race between nations had only continued to pick up speed...</p><p>...and there was now an insurmountable gap between industrialized nations and developing ones.</p><p>I could tell from poring over the documents that they began with the best of intentions.</p><p>They wanted their research to result in a better life for every person on Earth. To help humanity move past its endless squabbling for wealth and forge ahead with new, loftier goals.</p><p>However...Area 51&#39;s researchers didn&#39;t see things the same way.</p><p>With every experiment they ran, they became more and more certain that the subject was emitting a constant, unknown signal. It was calling for help.</p><p>So they thought, if they kept running experiments on it, if they kept inflicting greater levels of pain on it...</p><p>...even more potential test subjects were bound to show up.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LIznRIf.png" alt=""></p><p>That&#39;s why this all happened.</p><p>This wasn&#39;t a natural disaster. It was a man-made one.</p><p>(But is that truly the reason?)</p><p>I finally know why those trees came here. Now...I just have to confirm one last thing.</p><p>Was this the true cause? Was there really a \u201CSubject E\u201D here, at this base? I have to see it for myself.</p><p>And I have to do it before I die of malnutrition.</p><p>It took me several days to discover that door.</p><p>\u201CE Reference Room.\u201D A secret area that had been built even further underneath the base&#39;s underground structure.</p><p>I manage to open the door and make my way inside the sealed-off passageway.</p><p>...I can already tell there&#39;s something here. This is it. This is where I&#39;ll find the answers I&#39;ve been seeking.</p><p>There&#39;s just something...different about the air in this passageway that makes that all too clear.</p><p>My instruments aren&#39;t picking up anything unusual, even though the passageway itself is like something from another world\u2013entirely removed from what we think of as reality.</p><p>I know this passageway is made out of iron and steel, but it feels like I&#39;m walking on pulsating jelly.</p><p>I make my way across the simultaneously hard, soft, warm, cold floor, one careful step at a time.</p><p>My body temperature is dropping like a stone. I can barely breathe. My consciousness is hanging by a thread.</p><p>...I can&#39;t even remember how many days it&#39;s been since I last had something to eat or drink.</p><p>Soon, I won&#39;t even have enough energy left to talk into this recorder.</p><p>But I can&#39;t stop now.

Quite the contradiction.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> Of course, while we can&#39;t make any definitive statements based on one king&#39;s single passing remark...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> ...I do feel confident enough to propose a hypothesis.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> I suspect that the blank period between when a Lostbelt was pruned, and when it was \u201Creplanted\u201D in the present day...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> ...may have actually taken place inside each Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> In Russia, that period would have been about five hundred years. In Scandinavia, it would be about three thousand.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> In China, it would be about twenty-two hundred, and so on and so forth.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> To further expound on my hypothesis...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> I suspect that the Trees of Emptiness take the point at which a Lostbelt&#39;s history is pruned...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> ...and then simulate what would happen if that history had continued on from that point.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> By doing so, the trees effectively prove that history&#39;s existence, and the result is projected onto the planet itself.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> If my hypothesis is correct, that would mean the trees are essentially creating history, not rewriting it.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> Not even a demiurge-class Divine Spirit that once ruled the entire planet could wield this kind of Authority on Earth in the present day.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong><br> Wodime.

If the Foreign God wanted to get rid of humanity, they wouldn&#39;t bother making Lostbelts in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If anything, it seems to me like the whole reason they want to see a bunch of different possible human histories is because they don&#39;t know anything about us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But then...why?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe the bleaching wasn&#39;t to wipe out humanity...<br> but to make an environment they could set foot in?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Maybe they only got rid of humanity<br> because they had no other choice?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Maybe a world covered in pure white, brand-new textures<br> is the only kind of world the Foreign God can visit?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But then, if that were the case, the Lostbelts would only get in the way. So what are they and the Trees of Emptiness for?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Dammit, I&#39;m just going around in circles. There&#39;s<br> still some crucial piece of information I&#39;m missing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Ugh, just my luck! There&#39;s too many files<br> on this terminal to find the data I need!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> And why are these folders scattered all over the place!? Is it some kind of anti-hacking measure or something?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Shit. I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to touch the big files, but at this rate, I&#39;ll have to copy everything.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (The Foreign God...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (There&#39;s no question that they&#39;re an aggressor,<br> and that they can&#39;t coexist with our history.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (As for the whole \u201Cgod\u201D thing, it&#39;s way more likely<br> they&#39;re a new kind of life-form we know nothing about...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> (...and \u201Cgod\u201D is just the best word we have for it.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> So why make the Lostbelts? Why use us at all?<br> Is it because they still don&#39;t know much about Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nah, that can&#39;t be it. We&#39;re talking about a being capable of wiping the whole planet clean in a second.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Come on, Kadoc, think. There&#39;s no way the Foreign God<br> doesn&#39;t know the first thing about Earth or humanity.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> They must&#39;ve done their homework, or they wouldn&#39;t have<br> known to attack us\u2013Chaldea, before making any other moves..</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...So from that, you can tell that the Foreign God is really, really cautious, which is why they&#39;re so careful about keeping their identity a secret.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Zeus is omnipotent and omniscient, so he doesn&#39;t bother to hide who he is. He&#39;s also had no problem crushing any form of dissent himself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> The Foreign God&#39;s not at that level yet, which is why they&#39;re still so careful about any information pertaining to them.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s it. The Foreign God&#39;s got one major, fatal<br> flaw: they don&#39;t have a physical body yet.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> If they did, even if it was just a Divided Spirit or<br> a terminal, they wouldn&#39;t have to rely on anyone else.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they enlisted the Alter Egos, and us Crypters, to be their hands in this world.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Rasputin.

What if the Foreign God can<br> only make use of things on Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not even that.

These coordinates...this place...</p><p>Uh, Moriarty? Are you really sure this is where we&#39;re headed?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Although this is completely out of the blue, you saw this coming from a mile away, no?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see...I&#39;d pegged this as a prank, and if that were the case, I thought I&#39;d let Mash have at you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I would do no such thing, not at this point.</p><p>Gentlemen, let us now speak the password as one.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Password?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Since time immemorial, there is but one phrase you say when you wish to open closed doors, correct?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Do I really have to say it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to sulk disappointedly if you won&#39;t say it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By all means, sulk away and be very disappointed, James Moriarty.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3HTagab.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, three two one\u2014</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Open Sesame!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Really? Did you really just say that? What&#39;s more, Moriarty is so surprised that he&#39;s been rendered speechless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s such a shame!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Umm, guys?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A-Apologies...now then, ahem.</p><p>&quot;Open Sesame&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An earthquake...?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4QVhmPd.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2i0vrps.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Hey, why are there stairs in a place like this...? Does this mean we&#39;re headed underground?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, I wonder about that. Are you stout-hearted enough to go?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF9bB1k.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> You&#39;re way too easy going!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Shall we go?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yes we shall...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/noCylz0.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s rather deep...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> I can hardly see anything...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> That&#39;s a problem too, but even more problems abound. This staircase isn&#39;t made of stone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right. From the feel of it...it&#39;s definitely man-made. It feels so very modern...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do be careful, if you happen to fall, you&#39;ll never stop falling.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Nonetheless, we have descended quite a fair bit. The third basement level...no, the fourth?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> A rough estimate of our destination would place it around the tenth basement level. In all likelihood, they were wary of deep penetration ordnance such as bunker busters.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...</p><p>...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bunker buster...?</p><p>Oh, I get that it&#39;s the name of the weapon and such...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Am65JkH.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But that&#39;s a modern military weapon, is it not? Is that relevant?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> More than you can imagine, let us move on.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well this is as far as the stairs go. Are you all right, the three of you?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m beat...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> It takes quite a mental toll to go down a staircase in pitch black darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your hand please. I believe it will help you be at ease a little\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i4jrH7C.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Zhang Jiaoo...!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No need to concern yourselves with him. He&#39;s already dead.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong><br> ...</p><p>...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m not too familiar with it myself. Let&#39;s see, umm...that&#39;s it.</p><p>I believe he&#39;s an existence referred to as a shijiexian. However, as long as he remains a corpse, his Master won&#39;t be supplying him with magical energy.</p><p>So Zhang Jiao had little choice but to create an alter ego of himself, while erasing its self-awareness as an alter ego at the same time. For it would lose its sense of self should it gain awareness of its status as an alter ego, putting it at risk of annihailation.</p><p>Even if the assassination plan should succeed, even if he should fall in the final battle...</p><p>As long as he, the real self, remains in existence here, he will create an alter ego and revive. The revived alter ego would have eventually restored this Singularity. And then invite the summoned servants in, incite conflict, and instigate a war between realms once more.</p><p>All for the sake of his Master.</p><p>That&#39;s over now though. The cost of creating an alter ego is that he systemized his own real self. Incapable of self-defense, incapable of self-growth, little more than\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6WDtck5.png" alt=""></p><p>Furniture.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Was...Zhang Jiaoo...protecting this place?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> No. It would be more accurate to say he had no choice but to do so. You could say that while his Master created this Singularity, it was Zhang Jiaoo who nurtured it. It was his dedication to it that made this Singularity so intricately bizarre.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;ll open the door. From this point onward, communication with Chaldea will likely be rendered impossible. It&#39;s already gotten erratic, has it not?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s got a point there, the signal&#39;s about to cut off. The three of you be careful now.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be right back.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f2T3XCp.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1jX3lnv.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No matter what may happen, make sure to prioritize your safe return, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Got it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It pains me to say this...but you&#39;re the only one we can count on. After all, the two of them there are the foolhardy type!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KtC8tfq.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m welllll aware of that.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> I-Is that so?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That. Is. So.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In any case, take care. I&#39;ll be waiting for your reports!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well then\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ccjhcJ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The trio were dumbfounded by the alienness of the passageway.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> A cosmic...corridor...?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JDe3E34.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That which I must show you lies ahead. Now, let us move on to ground zero of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ground...zero...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> But this is almost like\u2014</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong><br> No...it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How far will we be walking this time?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh, I assure you it&#39;ll be quite the short stroll.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The quartet walked wordlessly down the cosmic corridor.</p><p>They had no time to admire the beautiful yet horrifying sights before them, or perhaps there simply was no room for fear.</p><p>There was this oppressive feeling, as though the walls were closing in. As though they were driven by necessity.</p><p>Kadoc, Mash, and Fujimaru.</p><p>What swept across their minds was a truly distressing feeling. It was neither unpleasant nor uncomfortable.</p><p>It was like restlessly traversing a mountain in the dark of night.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m about to see something truly ominous.&quot;</p><p>A strange certainty of that nature.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The Master of this Singularity lies up ahead. Needless to say, its act is one of revenge and retribution against Pan-Human History.</p><p>He has that right\u2014I believe that is what you were told before, Kadoc?</p><p>But that&#39;s not quite accurate. He was not in a position to do otherwise. He was obligated to do so, as it was his duty to do so.</p><p>Even should the intent to retaliate be absent, as an entity, he was in a position where he could not do otherwise.</p><p>And the Servant, Zhang Jiaoo, established this extreme-scale Singularity to fulfill that wish.</p><p>Using Area 51, Nevada, USA in the year 2017\u2014as its point of origin.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived. This is the final door.
