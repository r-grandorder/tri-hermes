The Fourth Singularity has already started to correct itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s still a great deal of mist, but it&#39;s a normal mist. It&#39;s not the demonic fog, so it should be safe for the residents!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are there people around?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any carriages moving.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It should gradually go back to normal. The iconic scene of people and carriages on the streets should return soon enough.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s all thanks to you. Eventually, we will need to fix all the other Singularities like that, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, Rayshifting to the Singularities and corrections to the abnormalities are all unprecedented, so it&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t any concerns...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enough of that. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll learn more as we go.<br> For now, let&#39;s just keep moving forward!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foufou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Fou. You&#39;re with us again?<br> When did you...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Um, now that we&#39;ve finished the small talk, can I get down to business?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Can you hear me, Da Vinci? Do we need to prove our existence and adjust Sheba&#39;s elevation angle this time?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, are you sure you can leave all that to me and the staff? You can always come back, you know!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahahaha! So you caught me already.<br> I guess it was inevitable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry so much, Dr. Roman! We&#39;re in a Singularity that&#39;s already finished correcting itself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, this place is close to the modern age. It&#39;s the 19th century. With the abnormality corrected, proving our existence shouldn&#39;t be too hard, even for you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know, but...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I just wanted you to understand what was going through my mind when I turned around and realized you had disappeared. I was afraid! I was petrified!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hardly half a second had gone by when I thought, \u201CHuh? What the heck is that darn technical advisor doing?<br> Is she playing?\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Relax. Think of this as training in case of an emergency. In case there comes a time when I&#39;m not around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been in London.<br> Now that the pesky demonic fog is gone... Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, darn. Things have barely gone back to normal.<br> How disappointing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And where did we Rayshift to?<br> Soho? We can&#39;t have any fun here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Seriously? Is that supposed to be a critique?)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I wanted to go to Hyde Park.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I wanted to go to the department store to shop with all the wonderfully fashionable ladies, and then head over to a club to socialize with the gentlemen...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not asking to get to be a noblewoman, but I had at least hoped to cut loose a little.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see, to have fun as a lady...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I see, to have fun as a gentleman...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How expected, Senpai! This is so like Da Vinci! First, she Rayshifts just to take a break, and now she wants to enjoy herself by flouting the usual gender roles of the time!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, calm down, Fujimaru and Mash. Don&#39;t get swept up by that oddball&#39;s whimsical nonsense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. U-um, Da Vinci! The reason why we Rayshifted here this time was not so we could go sightseeing, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You do know, right, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course. There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure she knows.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed, Fujimaru.<br> You&#39;re starting to get me.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. Of course I know. I know that a small abnormality was found in this Fourth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And I have a general idea of what it is.<br> Our destination is the British Museum in Regent&#39;s Park!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A tourist destination!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Senpai.<br> But the British Museum is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But the British Museum is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First of all, I was the one who observed the abnormality. Well, there was also something else that bothered me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And I wanted to see it myself, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m accompanying you. Of course I wasn&#39;t here to sightsee.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I do not tell meaningless lies. Because such a lie would eventually point towards the truth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, whenever I make any nonsensical lies, it&#39;s to ride along with someone else&#39;s lie. Right, Romani?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh...um... If you say it that way, I...don&#39;t really have a response to that...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyu, fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Whoa. I sense some criticism coming from over there. Come on, Fou, don&#39;t suspect the pretty big sister like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ... (Sigh) The nerve on her to call herself<br> \u201Cpretty big sister\u201D is rather impressive...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, impressive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Impressive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep, yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She is the fair Mona Lisa, after all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe, that&#39;s the spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This version of me is the true Mona Lisa! Accept no substitutes! That makes my smile the world&#39;s greatest smile. Right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, kyuu...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Though to be honest... Yeah, I&#39;m in no mood to smile right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If only we were at least near Westminster, we could have swung by the National Gallery.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> National Gallery?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that...um...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, I believe it&#39;s an art museum in Trafalgar Square.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Correct. It seems some of my work is displayed there. And there&#39;s also a piece of work that I was the inspiration for.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You seem dazed. Everything all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...my apologies, Master.<br> I was just thinking about what Da Vinci meant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Things that she directly worked on or things that she was the inspiration for remain years after...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To have your work preserved in museums, and have it receive praise and admiration from those who see it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I assume many people have seen it and been affected by it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I just thought that must be a very wonderful thing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou, fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yep. It&#39;s one of the perks a cultural Servant like her can enjoy. Most heroes make a name for themselves through the legend of their battles and victories.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it&#39;s truly rare to leave a lasting imprint on the world through your work alone. In that sense...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Leonardo da Vinci has left an indelible mark on this world. She truly earned the title of \u201Cuniversal genius.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the absolute truth, and Da Vinci is still considered to be the personification of that genius.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heh heh. Keep praising me, Romani. Yes, I am not only a helpful and a beautiful big sister, but I am a true genius to boot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The \u201Cbeautiful big sister\u201D part is a bit much. By the way, the work of yours exhibited in the National Gallery is a painting, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. A laaarge painting.<br> Hehe, did you think it was some mysterious code?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, not really. That would have been interesting, but I only thought that for a second, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What about the piece that you were a model for?<br> Is that a painting too? A portrait?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Wrong. Verrocchio, my mentor in painting, used me as a model to paint a legendary being.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Legendary... What was the theme?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Something that was modeled after Da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, it was the archangel Raphael.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> !!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...! The archangel Raphael...!?<br> Isn&#39;t that angel almost always depicted as male?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The archangel Gabriel is usually the one who is frequently depicted as female.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, but wait. If the male Da Vinci was the model...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter which gender I was back then...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> My mentor Verrocchio modeled the angel after me. Besides, it&#39;s up to the artist to decide how to depict his subject...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words, the angel was not drawn to look like Da Vinci...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the angel was drawn based off of Da Vinci&#39;s way of life... Is that what you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even so, doesn&#39;t the angel look too handsome?His soul, at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha. Thanks for those interesting reactions,<br> Fujimaru, Mash, and Romani.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, however I looked, I was extremely beautiful. Archangel or not, bring it on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> When I think of Da Vinci&#39;s portait...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought he looked like an old man.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh I see. Are you thinking of my portrait as an old man?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, I won&#39;t deny that.<br> That was, after all, how I looked at one point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But, you know, changing one&#39;s appearance is like changing clothes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You say that so casually, but I can&#39;t really imagine that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe, you think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve managed to get to the basement.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Fou. That&#39;s right. The Mage&#39;s Association hasn&#39;t been completely fixed just yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Most of the British Museum itself has been restored, but this area is still the way it was before...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank goodness. If the correction of the Singularity had progressed much further, we wouldn&#39;t have been able to infiltrate the place so easily.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Especially for a place so labyrinthine.<br> This place is the Mage&#39;s Association&#39;s ultimate secret.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This place is like a type of armory. It stores a bunch of rare and extremely precious books.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And yet, we got in so easily...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s also made it easy for shady characters to sneak in. Do you feel it, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I sense some magical energy up ahead.<br> Senpai, please be careful.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suspect they are spellbook-type enemies!<br> I thought the effects of the demonic fog were no more!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Thick clouds of Mystics naturally lay dormant in Britain. Even without the demonic fog, if we are in the time when reality is correcting the age itself...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the fact that there are man-eating books around isn&#39;t surprising to me at all. Here they come!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That sounded completely crazy, but she said it like it was normal... Anyway, yeah, it&#39;s time to battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All enemies defeated.<br> Good work, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Da Vinci, are you pushing yourself?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not at all. Actually, this is fun! My job normally doesn&#39;t let me accompany you like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To freely walk around, huh...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since we are shorthanded at Chaldea, it somehow became my job to build up the anti-infiltration program.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a particularly taxing job, but day and night, it&#39;s just been work, work, work.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Buuut, ever since you formed a contract with me, I&#39;ve been able to get involved in battle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it... It is rare for you to be with us from investigation to battle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right? That&#39;s why I&#39;m really happy. I&#39;m excited!<br> If it was fieldwork, it would have been even better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fieldwork...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If I&#39;m outside, I can go all-out. Making a bonfire in a place like this is frowned upon, you know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (I didn&#39;t think it was true, but Leonardo really seems like she&#39;s out camping.)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I heard that, Romani.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, sorry... Wait, that wasn&#39;t all bad. Was it?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway. So, is this labyrinth the source of London&#39;s abnormality?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci seems to be convinced that it is, and the fact that we encountered demonic books is all the proof we need.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But the readings on my side aren&#39;t all that clear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Mage&#39;s Association bounded field that was originally there has reappeared, and it&#39;s interfering with our ability to gather information.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Who knows? Man-eating books hardly seem strange to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And besides, I might have made a mistake.<br> I was still human, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Da Vinci...making a mistake?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re kidding.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think Da Vinci made mistakes.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahahaha. You saw through me. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like you said, I probably don&#39;t make mistakes.<br> I&#39;m almighty! While many desire to be so, I truly am!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m a bit saddened.<br> I didn&#39;t want our reunion to be like this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> During my time, I had not a single equal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was a genius, after all. And not just any genius.<br> A universal genius.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The talents that I was born with were not limited to any single field. Painting, sculpting, architecture, carpentry, anatomy, natural science...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah yes, and magecraft.<br> All fields of human knowledge were my playground.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There was nobody who was equal to me.<br> Everyone trailed behind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Leonardo.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But still. There were a few who could match me in a handful of fields.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For example, yes... You.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Guuu... Uuuuuuuuu...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Magical energy detected! From what I&#39;m seeing, it looks like a ghost-type enemy!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Shall we do this? I came here to see you...Michelangelo.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ghost of Michelangelo:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Michelangelo:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Goodbye, Michelangelo.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> While it was only where the arts were concerned...my dear friend, you had a gift that was comparable to my own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But I wonder. Why were you hanging around the Mage&#39;s Association library?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or perhaps... Did the abnormality of the Singularity cause any lingering spirits lurking around the British Museum...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...to fall underground? Haha, perhaps the truth really is something silly like that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Either way... Michelangelo... I&#39;m a little relieved.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t end up in the Throne as a Heroic Spirit. At least your soul should rest in peace now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Rest in peace...the other uomo universale.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Da Vinci...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you have a special relationship with him?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Your lover, perhaps?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm? Well, it&#39;s hard to say...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He really was somebody truly special to me, but I&#39;m not sure how I can express our relationship.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m a genius. He was a genius.<br> I&#39;m sure you know the name Michelangelo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. Michelangelo is a widely known artist, also known as a Renaissance man.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Especially his sculpture, paintings, and designs were considered the work of a true genius.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep, yep. Right. I&#39;m a big fan of his \u201CDavid\u201D as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Well, yeah. I guess I did like him.<br> I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;d call it love, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> More than Mona Lisa?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Well, maybe not that much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo, fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That was a quick answer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm, I pity Michelangelo. Well, I don&#39;t know what he was thinking while he was wandering around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I died before him. Maybe it&#39;s this?<br> His feelings just...accumulating here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And a lot of things happened to get them all twisted and warped. Something like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-yeah. If you&#39;re satisfied with that, then I&#39;m fine with it too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The fact that you were acting different than usual...<br> Well, I&#39;ll just say that was my imagination.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, the minute abnormality in the Singularity seems to have stabilized now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s prepare to head back.<br> Good work everyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Doctor. Good work.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe. Okay Doctor.<br> Can you Rayshift us back without my help?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can. I can!<br> I&#39;ve always done it... Wait a minute, have I done it properly!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Usually I make adjustments in the background...<br> Ahem. I&#39;m joking. You&#39;ve always done it fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, wait. Wait, wait.<br> Have I never done adjustments on my own!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahaha, that&#39;s fine! You&#39;re not alone!<br> I&#39;m here, and so is the staff!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And of course, Fujimaru and Mash!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If I say it, there&#39;s no mistaking it!<br> It&#39;s lonely doing it all alone. Let&#39;s have some fun!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Uh, that&#39;s not what I mean!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, kyuuu!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...That happened a while ago.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was sometime after fixing the Fifth or Sixth Singularity. Yeah. It was right before going to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Sigh) ...That brings back some memories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was supposed to be a lesson for you, but that message came right back to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah...right. It hit me hard.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can understand Michelangelo&#39;s feelings now. I see.<br> I can see why he would turn into a troublesome ghost.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Sigh) It sure is painful having to continue to work even after being left all alone.</p><h2 id="a-gift-from-a-little-devil" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-gift-from-a-little-devil" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Gift From a Little Devil</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I was there for my mother when she died.<br> ...I suppose I should be grateful for that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And I am. Truly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...That all happened a long time ago.<br> A VERY long time ago.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> My family were notaries in the village of Vinci. Had been for generations. They were pretty well off, all things considered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> My parents were never married. My mother, Caterina, was beautiful, but she was also a peasant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Back then, there was no way she or my father, Messer Piero, could possibly have been permitted to make their love official.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In other&#39;s eyes, she just wasn&#39;t good enough. I don&#39;t want to say it because it&#39;s too crass. But...that is essentially what people thought of their love.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still, that didn&#39;t stop them from having a beautiful child together.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is me, Leonardo.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And boy was I cute! I think. But according to what I&#39;ve heard, and considering what I look like now, how could I not have been?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, what am I saying? Of course I was adorable.<br> Let&#39;s just leave it at that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Getting back to my mother, Caterina...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...she married another man after she gave birth to me. They had many children of their own. That&#39;s all well and good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was certainly better than continuing in a relationship that could never lead to marriage, and she didn&#39;t have to worry about me. My grandfather and uncle on the Da Vinci side took care of me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I grew up healthy and happy, and it wasn&#39;t long before my abundant talents started helping me accomplish amazing things...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but I never forgot about my mother. It wasn&#39;t an obsession, really. But I thought about her often.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I think it was Botticelli who said that \u201Cenough is plenty\u201D? It certainly sounds like something he&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, when I was about forty or so, my mother fell ill. She died shortly thereafter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I had a bit of money back then,<br> so I tended to her sometimes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That is why I was able to be there when she finally slipped off. Oh, I held her funeral as well. It was a rather nice funeral, at that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Strangely, I can&#39;t recall whether I cried at all.<br> Truly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I barely remember it at all.<br> Still...I think I probably did.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was still a strapping young lad of forty back then, after all, so I must have been more sensitive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Most importantly...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I wasn&#39;t the universal genius back then that I am now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It seems your repose last night was somewhat less than restful, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Did something unusual happen once again while you were asleep?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> My understanding is that this would hardly be the first time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I dreamed about Da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess you could say it was unusual...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Huh? Me? I wonder why that could have happened.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I must say, I don&#39;t recall it. Of course, there&#39;s no reason for me not to take you at your word.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It could be that our connection is much stronger now that we have a contract that allows me to accompany you in battle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m flattered! Sorta irritating that you&#39;re not able to control it, but that aside...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...we should be glad our Master is having new and interesting experiences!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So...uh, just what kind of dream are we talking here, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think...you were talking about someone...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. Perhaps it was something related to an experience of hers from her lifetime?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Huh, I wonder who it was.<br> I knew SOOO many interesting people in my lifetime!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Was it Botticelli? Mikey? Lorenzo the Magnificent?<br> Maybe Isabella d&#39;Este?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Ah, by the look on [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Fujimaru&#39;s face, I would say it was none of those. It may not, therefore, have been someone of great historical significance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> A question for you: In your dream conversation, how would you describe Ms. Da Vinci&#39;s emotional state?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I think she was smiling?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think she was crying?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pffft, good one. You know I&#39;m not really one to turn on the waterworks, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Did I wake you? Or were you still up?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Either way, sorry for bothering you so late.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve guessed why I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t get our conversation from earlier out of my head.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So...I&#39;m curious who I was talking to you about...you know, in that dream you had.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, though, I should apologize. I think I had it figured out as far as who it was once you dropped that little hint.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I just didn&#39;t want to get into it there in the Command Room with so many people around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if I&#39;m just filling in, I&#39;m still their boss. It&#39;s hard to talk about sentimental stuff around them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Holmes? Well, you know him. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got this whole thing figured out already.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway! Like I said,<br> I&#39;m pretty sure I know who it was.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was talking about my mother, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Caterina of Vinci village.<br> My beautiful mother.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She never did get a chance to raise me,<br> but she still brought me into this world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She&#39;s the woman who gave me life.<br> I loved her so much, and I&#39;m sure she loved me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your mother...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did she look like you do now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe. Who knows?<br> Though I AM pretty sure she had a lovely smile.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Things were...complicated. She was my mother,<br> yes, but she could never marry my father.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Maybe I&#39;ve already told you about this within that dream, so I&#39;ll be brief...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I spent the last years of my mother&#39;s life with her in Milan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was doing pretty well for myself back then, so I took steps to bring my birth mother to live with me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not long after, she got so sick she collapsed. I remember going a little out of my mind, not knowing what to do...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Looking back, I realize I may have foolishly been responsible for shortening her life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a lie to say I didn&#39;t regret that,<br> but still...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I wouldn&#39;t trade those two years in Milan with her for anything.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How familiar are you with my paintings?<br> Ever heard of one I did called \u201CVirgin of the Rocks\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really, sorry...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of my better ones. I&#39;ll show you sometime...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it displayed in London, or Paris?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Both. Although, my apprentice did one of them...I think? I&#39;m not sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I painted it in Milan, a few years before I had my mother come live with me. I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but I also went waaay past the deadline on it. Things happened, you know? And I ended up delayed so long all you could do was laugh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm? That&#39;s no laughing matter?<br> Well, yeah, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Boy was the priest who commissioned it pissed! Then again, I was pretty pissed too once I saw what he wanted to pay me for it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...As the name suggests, it&#39;s a painting of the Virgin Mary, the Madonna, sitting among some rocks.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I think...when I was making it, I must have been longing for some maternal presence myself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it seems to me now, anyway,<br> with the benefit of hindsight and all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> While I was painting the Madonna, I started to miss my own mother, so much so that I ended up having her move out to Milan to live with me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the saying,<br> \u201CNo use crying over spilled milk\u201D?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Me, I&#39;ve always had a different take on it: \u201CYou can&#39;t put spilled water back in the pot.\u201D I think that&#39;s about the perfect summary of human life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Although, if I&#39;m being really honest...I think I might like the way Sun Tzu put it the best:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Thus, prompted by [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Fujimaru&#39;s dream...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...the Heroic Spirit Leonardo da Vinci has a premonition, and decides she would like to take some manner of action...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...just as she did when she brought her mother to live with her. Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How long have you been there...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Holmes right?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I hate to admit it, but I suppose he is. I DO want to take action here, just like I did with my mother.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And if I&#39;m going to do that,<br> I&#39;ll need your help, just like last time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Last time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, with Michelangelo...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad you remembered! Yup, exactly like that.<br> I suppose I&#39;m being a bit nostalgic again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Coordinates set for Europe,<br> on the outskirts of Milan, 1524.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This appears to be a minute Singularity, most likely caused by a small Holy Grail or a Grail fragment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s just as you said, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you called it so accurately before the Command Room could observe it with Sheba...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I thought this might be a good time to try my hand at Freudian dream interpretation, but it seems that won&#39;t be necessary here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Most impressive, Da Vinci.<br> Just the sort of thing I would expect from you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Though I suppose something of that ease may be owed to the...precision of Master&#39;s dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Commencing Rayshift.<br> Please be careful out there, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahh, this is a sight for sore eyes!<br> I haven&#39;t seen the Duchy of Milan like this in ages!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, pastafooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, Fou. You snuck along too?<br> Are you sure you wouldn&#39;t rather be with Mash?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see, I see. So you like beautiful women, do you?<br> As it happens, I do too! What good taste you have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift successful. Readings show you should be in the eastern part of Milan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good. I must admit, though, that this is a different time period than when I lived here, so I don&#39;t know the place so well as it is now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was pretty peaceful back then,<br> but France and Venice always loomed large as threats.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As much as people went about their lives quietly,<br> there was a certain tension in the air.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I remember the local hotshot, Il Moro, took a liking to me. I used to play the lira for him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Lyre? As in the instrument?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sure is.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;re a musical genius too...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Have I not mentioned that?<br> My talents were never confined to a single field.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To name a few, there&#39;s painting, sculpture, architecture, weaponry, woodworking, autopsies, natural science...and of course, music.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s just go for a walk and see where we\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, never mind that. Looks like we Rayshifted to just about exactly where we need to be.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There they are, plain as the nose on your face.<br> They could&#39;ve at least waited till nightfall.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> See?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Faaau! Fau, kyaaau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hostiles detected! A lot of them!<br> It looks like they have the Holy Grail with them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s get this show on the road, shall we? I am, of course, a combat genius too, so just sit back and let Da Vinci handle this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Initiating battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Here they come!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just look at all these demons.<br> Man, they couldn&#39;t be more obvious if they tried.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That takes care of them, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Fou, fou fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s not over yet.<br> Still more of them here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The BBEG in particular. I can tell it&#39;s not a Servant,<br> but it&#39;s still got a lot of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It must have absorbed the Holy Grail fragment to get its magical energy levels up THIS high.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, Da Vinci! I can see those exceptional magical energy readings from here, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It must possess a small Holy Grail,<br> or a fragment of a larger one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I figured, yeah.<br> And don&#39;t you just look the part.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey there, Sala\xEC...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sala\xEC?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Gian Giacomo Caprotti. While she lived, Da Vinci took him under her wing when he was still a young boy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> He became Da Vinci&#39;s apprentice in Milan in 1490,<br> where they grew as close as family.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Family...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Now I see. Since he died in 1524, this minute Singularity must have occurred when the small Holy Grail turned him into a ghost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It would seem you were right on the mark, Ms. Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Sala\xEC I knew already had a fragment, so I figured he must have been the one affecting Master&#39;s dreams.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I had a hunch, really,<br> and it turned out to be dead-on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Though I wish it wasn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re the only person I ever knew who would think to pester me like this, Sala\xEC.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still...<br> Why is it a ghost this time around too?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, well. I guess you never did get to a point where you&#39;d be enshrined in the Throne.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, if you were, I&#39;m pretty sure all your bad habits would put you preeetty firmly on the Anti-Hero end of things anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was he really THAT bad?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He was just a kid, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He was a beautiful kid. Adorable, even!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, I loved his curly hair. He may not have quite been at my level, but he was still as lovely as an angel.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou, Da Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (She&#39;s leading off by extolling the virtues of pretty boys! Th-that&#39;s our Da Vinci, I guess...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Buuut, he was a freakin&#39; brat, too. He was easily four times as mischievous as the average person.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He used to sell my shoes just to buy candy...steal my silver brushes...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hell, he&#39;d steal anything that wasn&#39;t nailed down, really... Broke my pots while we ate...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Ugh, just thinking about it pisses me off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sala\xEC, I gotta say...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...a brat like you appearing before the maestro as a wandering ghost, just like what happened with Michelangelo...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...ticks me off even more than I thought it would!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Shut your damn hole!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hostiles eliminated. Automatically collecting Holy Grail fragments per the usual protocol.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Annnd collected.<br> That takes care of that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> (Sigh) Dammit, Sala\xEC...<br> I heard you died five years after I did.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Why&#39;d you have to go and do that while you were still so young? What a damned waste.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if it was just bad luck that led you to the Holy Grail and turned you into a ghost...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...you have no business dying while you&#39;re so young.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...You really were nothing but a pain in the ass till the end, weren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You probably wanted to have a real talk with him, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, I don&#39;t know about that. Sure, he ended up an evil, rampaging ghost...but I think that suited him, in an odd sort of way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What better way for a hellion like him to cause as much trouble as he wants, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In that sense, we were lucky to meet him like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, now! No getting all gloomy on me!<br> If Da Vinci says it&#39;s okay, then it&#39;s okay!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I do like that sensitive side of yours, though.<br> I hope that&#39;s something you can hold on to. Always.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then!<br> What do you say we get ourselves back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll sleep soundly tonight, Master.<br> Any dreams you may have will surely be sweet.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Hey, Maestro?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...You held a proper funeral for your mother, right?<br> So why aren&#39;t you doing anything this time around?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Ahahaha. Oh, Maestro.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...This is why you still have all those regrets, you big dummy!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. I get the feeling that&#39;s what Sala\xEC was telling me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I know he wasn&#39;t ACTUALLY saying anything,<br> of course. But that&#39;s still the impression I got.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This wasn&#39;t a prediction or anything like that.<br> Just a feeling.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I swear.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That little imp never did have any problem saying the sort of things no one else would dare to.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But you know, Sala\xEC...even if I couldn&#39;t give you a proper funeral, I still feel like I gave you a proper send-off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if I&#39;m the only one who feels that way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right...guess I&#39;d better start getting things ready.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, getting my spare ready, really.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No telling when my number could be up,<br> so I&#39;ve got to be sure I&#39;m ready for anything.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably part of the reason why Sala\xEC showed up now. Demons have long been harbingers of death.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...While I&#39;m at it, you know what,<br> I think I&#39;ll model it after my childhood appearance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Holmes probably already has an idea of what I&#39;m up to...but I don&#39;t see him having an issue.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He may always play it pretty close to the chest, but he had my back again with this, and he kept his mouth shut when he should have.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I wonder what you&#39;d think about this plan if you were here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;d probably have a big problem with it, wouldn&#39;t you? Well, sorry. I&#39;ve just got to go through with it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Lady Luck has been awfully kind to me in this life and in the last.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So to make up for that...even if my next death does turn out to suck pretty badly...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...I think...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll just have to roll with it.</p>', 529);
