Who am I?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the first thing on your mind,<br> then Senpai hasn&#39;t experienced SE.RA.PH yet!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> In which case, I&#39;m here to tell you that you&#39;re about to have a bad day! A bad trip, if you like!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> There&#39;s gonna be more crazy psychedelic stuff down here than you can shake the proverbial stick at!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But never mind that now; I&#39;m not gonna follow up on it later. Just write off any weird stuff you see here as \u201Cwell that just happened\u201D and you&#39;ll be A-OK!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m back at the bottom of SE.RA.PH...!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Huh!? You know this is SE.RA.PH!?<br> And here I thought I&#39;d erased those memories...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Hmm. You must be an even rarer Senpai than I thought if you&#39;re able to break the fourth wall...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Then again, maybe you just downloaded info about SE.RA.PH unconsciously when you formed your contract with Lip...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...and now you remember this place the same way you remember a bad dream.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Well, I can probably let that slide. I do love enforcing my rules, but I also love spunky Masters who go around breaking them!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s kind of like how a cat enjoys toying with a mouse whose struggles just make it more fun!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Aaanyway, that&#39;s enough setup!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Welcome, castaway on the digital sea,<br> to the Spiritron Virtual World!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;m BB, the High-Grade AI that keeps humanity healthy, here to serve as your guide.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Those of you who already know me will no doubt be thinking, \u201CYou again!? Now what&#39;ve you done!?\u201D</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Those of you who don&#39;t know me, I want you to gasp in surprise at this beautiful angelic kouhai swooping in to join you in the depths of hell. Okay? Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is a lot to take in all at once...</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Huh? You don&#39;t know how you got here? You thought this was supposed to be Lip&#39;s interlude, not mine?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, Master...<br> How could you?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> First you shamelessly pursue me, make me bring you all the way to this secluded spot where no one will bother us, and then you just...forget?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What happened to that monstrous libido? Here you have this sumptuous, gourmet banquet before you, and now you&#39;re telling me you&#39;d rather go eat some grass...?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well then, I guess we&#39;re just going to have to do something about that, my little idiot of a Master! This calls for drastic measures!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Get ready for my patented Awakening Beeeam!<br> Kazap! Flashback music, go!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You seem down lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You seem kind of worn out.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Buh!?<br> N-no I&#39;m not! Really!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Sure, my shoulders are a little stiff, and some of the more insensitive people have been annoying me...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...and I keep worrying about how much larger I might get if my Spirit Origin keeps growing...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But that&#39;s all! Just your basic,<br> ordinary, run-of-the-mill anxieties!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing you need concern yourself with, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If you need to talk, I&#39;m happy to listen.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Fujimaru.<br> I really appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But I promise, it&#39;s no big deal.<br> I&#39;ve just been wondering if I&#39;m really all that helpful.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m stronger than the other Servants,<br> but I&#39;m also a lot less mobile and agile...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> So I find myself thinking that if I could change that,<br> I could handle battles all on my own...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I know how much commanding so many Servants at once tires you out, so I&#39;d love to be able to help you with that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aw, Lip...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s so thoughtful...)</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Honestly, I don&#39;t even know what everyone else is doing here. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re any help.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I think they have a lot of nerve, using up your magical energy, as weak as they are.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Plus, they act all high and mighty just &#39;cause they happened to get here before me. Who do they think they are?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> The whole idea of seniority mattering is stupid! You&#39;d think they&#39;d be ashamed at us showing them up so badly even though we were just born recently...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, Lip...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...This is getting a little...heavy...)</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Not to mention...they&#39;ve been teasing me again lately...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been doing my best to learn from my mistakes and not go around breaking so many things, but...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Uh... I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s nothing.<br> Please, just forget about it.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> The point is, my problems are simple and boring!<br> I can do something about...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> No, I have to do something about them myself!<br> So I will, and I&#39;ll be my old self by tomorrow, I promise!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Huh.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Wh...what the...? That&#39;s weird...<br> I just got really dizzy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Look out...!</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Eek!<br> N-no, Fujimaru, don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I can&#39;t hold myself up anymore...<br> I-if you try to support me from the front...!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh...<br> Fujimaru just fell in!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> BB! BB! You&#39;re the last person I&#39;d want to ask,<br> but I need your heeelp!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> There, you&#39;re all caught up.<br> Now do you get what&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, that means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So I&#39;m inside Lip&#39;s Breast Valley...!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Bingo! You&#39;re trapped deep within Lip even as we speak!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It usually looks more like the dump where they toss royal family coffins, but I thought you&#39;d feel more at home if I gave it a SE.RA.PH-style makeover!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Still, what&#39;s with this place? I thought Breast Valley was just a term for cleavage, not an actual valley!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I know there are plenty of big boob lovers out there, but this is ridiculous! Hasn&#39;t her designer ever seen a real woman!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As an AI myself, I find it atrocious! What sort of demon came up with a skill in such poor taste!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You did.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> How could you say that...? Sure, I may have been personally responsible for Lip&#39;s creation...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...but I wasn&#39;t being malicious with her character design or anything. I just poured everything I disliked about myself into her...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...and added the fourth-dimensional pocket in her rack &#39;cause I thought it&#39;d be funny...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there a way out of here?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, right. Escaping should be the priority.<br> I knew that.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Bluntly, ending up in Lip&#39;s Breast Valley is a one-way ticket to the trash heap.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What gets thrown in here cannot return to reality. You&#39;re doomed to live out the rest of your days wandering around in here, without even the sweet embrace of death to bring you comfort.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Juuust kidding! That was the old Passionlip.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> After she was given that miraculous second chance, she took a hard look at her own monstrous nature, reflected on it, learned from it...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...and now, she can at least pull her contracted Master back out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s a relief... Okay, let&#39;s get on with it.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hehehe. Hehehehe. Hehehehehehehehe!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Not so fast! You didn&#39;t think I&#39;d let a juicy situation like this slide, did you?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I mean, now that you&#39;re here,<br> don&#39;t you want to see how deep this valley goes?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Every girl&#39;s got things she wants to keep hidden.<br> What she&#39;s really like...her weaknesses...her turn-ons...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well, here in our world,<br> we call those places our Secret Gardens.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Back on the far side of the moon, we were supposed to uncover each other&#39;s Secret Gardens, understand them, and accept each other. How embarrassing!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course, as the world&#39;s most perfect kouhai, I didn&#39;t have any such weaknesses myself, but that&#39;s a story for another time.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> In your case, learning about Lip&#39;s SG will make your bond as Master and Servant even stronger.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So what do you say? Don&#39;t you want to find out Lip&#39;s juiciest secrets? In particular, the ones in her second SG, Masochistic Nature.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The whole reason Lip hasn&#39;t been herself lately is &#39;cause this particular SG has been out of whack.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That whole bit about her having to do something about her problems herself was actually part of the problem.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I mean, why should she do that when she&#39;s got a perfectly capable Master here to lean on? I say you two should face what&#39;s in Lip&#39;s heart together.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Do that, and Passionlip the Alter Ego is bound to get even stronger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mmm, I don&#39;t like the idea of doing this without her permission...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Monotone) If it&#39;ll make her stronger, I guess I don&#39;t have a choice.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Great! Then let&#39;s get this crazy escape room started!<br> I already went and mapped out Lip&#39;s mind like a CPU!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I call it: the Sakura Labyrinth - Lite!<br> A completely digital EEG just for love and trauma!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, getting there will be a nice, gentle slope.<br> All you have to do is keep making your way up.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You might run into an obstacle or two on the way, but all you&#39;ll need to get past them is wisdom, bravery, and spunk, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got those in spades!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to go DOWN if you&#39;re delving into secrets? Going up should just bring you to the surface?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You sure are a detail-oriented ant, aren&#39;t you...<br> Look, this is just a skill, okay?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s way too soon for you to traipse into her mind&#39;s Realm of Innocence and start enhancing her Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Once you&#39;re at that level, you and Lip will need to have a good long talk before you even think about trying that.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> For now, I&#39;m going nice and easy on you, so this&#39;ll just be the Sakura Labyrinth&#39;s newbie zone!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Ready to enter a fleeting wonderland, little senpai?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Well that didn&#39;t take long! Look out, Master.<br> That&#39;s the ruthless Band Brigade!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean there are Servants here!?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course. We&#39;re inside Lip&#39;s boo\u2013er, mind, after all. It&#39;s chock full of all the mental trauma she experienced at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> In this guy&#39;s case, she probably asked him to teach her how to play an instrument and now resents him for holding her to his high standards.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Lip&#39;s not the type to forget a grudge, no matter how slight it might be. She&#39;s really good at repressing her feelings, too... (Sigh)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Still, at least these guys should be easy pickin\u2013I mean, easy to defeat!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And since we can&#39;t go any further until we beat them,<br> I&#39;ll do you a favor and step up to the challenge myself!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Just sit back and enjoy the show your adorable kouhai&#39;s going to put on for you, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m walking around her mind...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This feels wrong...</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s insensitive AND immoral, right?<br> That&#39;s what the far side of the moon is all about\u2661</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm, looks like we&#39;ve still got a little ways to go until the first real obstacle.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we take advantage of this time to go over the finer points of what an Alter Ego is?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> First off, when I say Alter Ego, I&#39;m talking about the Servants that were born from me...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The Sakura series, like Meltryllis and Passionlip.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> See, the original BB\u2013the one I was copied from\u2013went a little buggy once.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Even though she was an AI,<br> she tried to emulate humans.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> She attempted to remake the world to suit her own purposes, just like they do.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And to do that, she modified herself over and over...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...on the far side of the moon,<br> where there&#39;s no concept of time.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> One day, she tried leveling up again and again in Void Space before a certain Master finished their fifth battle.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Usually, that kind of growth should have been impossible. She was never designed to be expanded that way.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Imagine trying to slap a combustion engine on a manual scooter and you&#39;ll have some idea of what that was like.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But even though she wasn&#39;t designed for it,<br> BB kept adding engines to her tiny frame.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...She started with an engine for the same size scooter as her, then moved on to one for a motorcycle.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Next, she added a car engine. Then one for a pickup truck... A dump truck... A private jet... A battle cruiser...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It was like looking at the engineering equivalent of a dumpster fire. Or maybe like cancer cells spreading throughout a host.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But it still wasn&#39;t nearly enough to achieve her goal.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> She kept modifying herself more and more radically.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> A jet engine. An oil tanker. A power plant. A nuclear reactor. All sorts of engines her little frame was never built to support.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> She piled on one ill-fitting addition after another, and ended up turning into a Giga Structure.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> By that point, her insides were a hot mess. Her human thought processes were bound to get all screwed up!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And that is what led to the birth of the Sakura Five.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Somewhere along the way, BB got the idea to separate her expanding egos and functionalities from herself, and make them into her assistants.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> When all was said and done, five Alter Egos had been born. Five AIs created from BB&#39;s own emotions.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Emotions she cut off from herself because she decided they were unnecessary... Well, not quite. She feared them because she couldn&#39;t control them any longer.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure.<br> Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Violet, the Alter Ego of purity.<br> Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of desire.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And Kazuradrop, the Alter Ego of affection.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Every Ego was born from BB&#39;s emotions,<br> but Lip was one of the most dangerous.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> She refused to face her flaws, demanded unconditional love, and hated anyone who wouldn&#39;t give it to her.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Like they say, it&#39;s a thin line between love and hate. As an Ego, Lip blindly loved and loathed whomever she set her sights on.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Still, after a bunch of shit went down, she learned there&#39;s no such thing as unconditional love, and she&#39;s been working on accepting that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No such thing as unconditional love, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lip&#39;s a hard worker.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> True. It just goes to show that if you want to be loved, it doesn&#39;t matter how cute you are.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You still need the courage to put yourself out there, the sincerity to work on your flaws, and consideration for others!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;ve already got that sort of thing down pat. I&#39;m always thinking up new ways to trip up humanity!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s with the look? You don&#39;t believe I have that all down? I&#39;ll have you know I was being seriou\u2013</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Aha! That was a whip cracking against an innocent female body if ever I heard one! Sounds like we&#39;re finally reaching SG territory!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Come on, Senpai! I think we&#39;re about to see one of Lip&#39;s secrets for ourselves\u2606</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Ah...!<br> Please... Please stop...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t do anything wrong...<br> Why are you being so mean to me...?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Shut up! What&#39;s with all that flab!?<br> You&#39;re an embarrassment to the entire Shinsengumi!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Not even Okita would ever let herself go that much!<br> You&#39;re wasting your best weapon!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> A dumpling like you is all fat and no flavor! Only thing you&#39;re good for now is testing my new branding iron!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> It says \u201CIncorrigible/The full moon glows in autumn/A mirror of fire\u201D!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t make me into a roasted dumpling...! But if you have to, please at least spare me the awful haiku!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t a haiku! I was just thinking out loud!<br> I can do way better than that if I put my mind to it!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> W-well, this is horrible!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Why&#39;s he making Lip sit on the floor while he whacks her shoulder with a giant paper fan!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Vice-Commander!? What do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Putting your mind to it won&#39;t make you a poet!</p><hr><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Shut up! Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m in the middle of an interrogation!? ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you, Fujimaru.<br> What&#39;re you doing in the discipline room?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> A foot soldier like you doesn&#39;t belong here.<br> Get back to your quarters.</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> And don&#39;t tell anyone else what you saw here. As for the haiku, well...that sort of thing just slips out when the other soldiers aren&#39;t around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (So that was his best effort...)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...(Sigh). I&#39;m preeetty sure this isn&#39;t how this scene actually went down, but let me just make sure.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What are you doing here, Lip Traumatizer No. 2?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;re you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> What am I doing...?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Well, you know, I&#39;m...<br> Hm? Come to think of it, what AM I doing here...?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> I remember I came here because I heard there were huge\u2013I mean, premium dumplings to be had... So why am I holding a giant paper fan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I want to know.</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Yeah, that figures... It&#39;s weird. I got real pissed off for some reason, and before I knew it, I was back to my old tricks...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you like torturing people?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> What was that?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Eee...!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t. But I&#39;m good at it. If the Shinsengumi needed someone tortured, I was the guy who did it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You sure about that? &#39;Cause you&#39;re handling that paper fan like it&#39;s second nature.</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that...!<br> He...he took me prisoner out of nowhere...!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I thought he was nice at first, since he pointed out my bad posture and said it would make my shoulders stiff.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But after I talked a bit about how Berserkers are just glass cannons, and how I have all sorts of defenses...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...and he doesn&#39;t have any way to defend himself even though the battle only really begins once stamina starts running low, and couldn&#39;t you say he&#39;s just asking to get killed...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...he started going on about how slovenly I was...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Ah geez... Lip&#39;s tendency to rile people up without even trying to strikes again...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So what? As the oni of the battlefield, you couldn&#39;t stand to look at Lip and all her excess defense\u2013er, chest padding?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be stupid! What do you take me for,<br> girl with the cool black cape!?</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any problem with her chest!<br> On a scale of one to ten, I give it a hundred!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> The problem is her pitiful posture! She&#39;s got first-class goods, but she can&#39;t show them off properly!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> If she did, I&#39;d rank it two hundred out of ten!<br> It&#39;d be the greatest thing ever! That&#39;s what I can&#39;t stand!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Aaaaaah...! P-please don&#39;t hit my shoulders!<br> The stiffness is just melting away!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> At any rate! As long as I draw breath, I won&#39;t let anyone get away with not living up to their full potential!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> This woman&#39;s coming with the Shinsengumi! Your black cape may be cool, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll go easy on you if you get in our way.</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> While I&#39;m at it, I think I&#39;ll have Okita start copying her diet! Maybe then she&#39;ll finally start filling out herself! Bahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use... We&#39;ll just have to defeat him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Is this what Lip deals with every day...?)</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMysterious Okita X:</strong><br> You&#39;re through!</p><p><strong>Space Toshizo:</strong><br> Gaaaaaah!<br> Okita you, bastard! Damn you, Okitaaa!!!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMysterious Okita X:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble our breast fiend caused you.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMysterious Okita X:</strong><br> It&#39;s even hard for us to tell when he&#39;s joking, so it must have been bewildering for you. Again, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Nn...n...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Huh? What am I doing here...<br> Is that you, Master?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Is this a dream I&#39;m having? The one where [\u2642 Prince /\u2640\uFE0F Princess}<br> Charming comes to save me when I&#39;m in distress...?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see how that could be...<br> But, if you&#39;re here right now, then... (Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I must be dreaming! And that means I should be able to have things here turn out just the way I want!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> (Quiet squeeing)</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> (Heart pounding)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry to say this after you&#39;ve already lain down, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come on Lip, get up. It&#39;s really me.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Hey, we were just getting to the good part!<br> I might be dense, but you won&#39;t fool me this time.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> This is my mental world, and Master&#39;s a human.<br> There&#39;s no way [\u2642 he&#39;d /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;d} be in here!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, but there is! How, you ask?<br> Because I helped [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} get here!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Believe me, this is the one and only Fujimaru, live and in the flesh.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Go ahead, pick your lazy ass up off the floor and scan [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} yourself if you don&#39;t believe me.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Besides, Fujimaru wouldn&#39;t even be here right now if it wasn&#39;t for you.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As if it wasn&#39;t bad enough you slipped and fell on top of [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...you just had to go and send [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} tumbling into your oversized Breast Valley.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So watch it, okay? If I hadn&#39;t been here, you&#39;d have made a real mess of things...Fujimaru included.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> No way...<br> That really is you, Fujimaru!?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But, this is my mind, not Breast Valley!<br> I know they&#39;re both digital spaces, but how...!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, that was all me. I set it up so the way out of your valley took [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} straight to your mind dungeon.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> After all, there shouldn&#39;t be any secrets between a Master and [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} Servant, right?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So just resign yourself to the fact that there&#39;s no getting off this emotional roller coaster now\u2606 What kind of shocking revelations does the next SG have in store about Lip? I can&#39;t wait to find out\u2606</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh...<br> Please, don&#39;t! It&#39;s too embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> BB! Why&#39;d you have to stick your nose in things now, you big jerk!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...And now, here we are, making our way to the exit...</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Now I see.<br> I&#39;m sorry for the trouble my real self caused you.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m the Lip from her mind&#39;s second Secret Garden,<br> so I don&#39;t know how much use I can be...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;ll do the best I can to help you get back out, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Although... (Sigh)<br> I don&#39;t see why Mothe\u2013BB is here too.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> And why is she even acting like my mother now, anyway? She can buzz off for all I care.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Stupid insensitive BB. Stupid nosy nurse, always doing more harm than good. She&#39;s just a cruel AI who doesn&#39;t know the difference between caring and controlling.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Even when she realizes her charge hates her \u201Ctreatment,\u201D she can&#39;t stop herself.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Can you imagine getting so swept up in your own desires you lose sight of everything else? It&#39;s pathetic.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> She loves to call me dense, but what am I supposed to do about it? If I am dense, the only possible explanation for it is that I got it from her!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> If she wants me to wise up, then she&#39;d better start by fixing her own issues first.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Of course, we all know she&#39;ll just bug out the more she tries to fix herself. She never was very smart.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard you be so aggressive before...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...I see. So this is the SG2 version...)</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Much as it pains me to say it, given how she&#39;s one of my own Alter Egos, this is Passionlip&#39;s true nature.<br> Or at least, one side of it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Masochistic Nature might be a pretty horrid skill that makes you an object of derision just for existing, but it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no reason at all for it.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The person at the center of it is still at least partially responsible.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Hmph. No I&#39;m not! I didn&#39;t do anything wrong!<br> I&#39;ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, you know!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;ve stopped depending so much on others, I&#39;m doing more things for myself... I&#39;m learning and growing every day!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Right, Fujimaru!?<br> I have grown, haven&#39;t I!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sure have. (Maintaining eye contact)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sure have. (Looking downward)</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> See!? I&#39;m not the same old Lip who got bullied just for existing anymore!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;ve mentally grown up a whole bunch! In fact, I&#39;ll say it right now: I&#39;m officially leaving my Masochistic Nature behind forever!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Yikes... I didn&#39;t realize her head had gotten as big as her chest...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> No wonder she hasn&#39;t been feeling right. Our SGs may contain secrets and weaknesses, but they&#39;re not flaws...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Not to mention she evidently doesn&#39;t even understand that personalities don&#39;t change on a dime.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Still, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before reality slaps her back down. For now, I see our next obstacle.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> From here on, you and Lip can do all the fighting.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> How far will Lip and her good girl act take you?<br> I look forward to finding out from my director&#39;s chair!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> It looks like we&#39;re in some kind of plaza.<br> ...Phew, I don&#39;t see any Reliefs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Reliefs?</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> O-oh, uh, in the Sakura Labyrinth, Reliefs are the world&#39;s edges that block off the exits.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Uh, they&#39;re kind of like...the girl who&#39;s acting as the labyrinth&#39;s core is engraved into its walls at the same time...?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> B-but that doesn&#39;t matter right now! This isn&#39;t the far side of the moon anyway, so please, just forget I said anything!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This is a simplified Sakura Labyrinth.<br> You won&#39;t find any Venus Statues here.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But that&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t some other guards around. Take a look over thataway, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Damn, we were just getting to the good part.<br> Where&#39;d that overgrown freak go, anyway?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> How&#39;d someone so huge manage to hide just because I took my eyes off her for a second!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, now I&#39;m just too pissed to give up. You didn&#39;t let her get away &#39;cause you felt bad for her or anything like that, did you?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> How about you, middle child? I bet you&#39;re the kind of Goody Two-shoes who goes around putting beached turtles back in the water, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s not true. I get just as upset as anyone else. (Well, maybe I did feel a little bad for her...)</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I agree that letting that Servant run free will do Chaldea no favors. She must be dealt with.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> It does go against my own beliefs to gang up on an opponent...but I am willing to bend the rules in this case. Let us all go after her.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> For that matter, I think the three of us makes for a rather fair fight. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Para?</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> ...Indeed. Our patience has its limits.</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> She&#39;s gone too far. I can no longer overlook her arrogance and foul mouth.</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> \u201COh, sorry, you&#39;re so small I didn&#39;t see you.\u201D<br> \u201CToo bad you weren&#39;t born a boy, huh?\u201D</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> When she said those things to me, I understood what it meant to put on airs. I will not be satisfied until she has been duly punished.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Another interesting assortment, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Quite the rogues&#39; gallery we&#39;ve got here...</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong></p><p>Ah! There you are, you overgrown freak! How dare you run away from me before I&#39;m done whipping you!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What, you&#39;re not scared now that you&#39;ve got a [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F friend} backing you up? If there&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t stand, it&#39;s a girl who can&#39;t fight her own battles.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> Well said. What sort of tank are you, hiding behind someone else!? You do not see me doing that, do you!?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> You there! You should know that lady hiding behind you right now is positively overflowing with issues.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> If you truly care for her,<br> you should let face her corporal punishment!</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> Indeed. And by corporal punishment, we of course mean stringing her up. Say the word, and I shall excise her excess padding myself.</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> One must fight fire with fire, and venom with venom. Long have I bemoaned my serpent&#39;s curse, but if it will help me vanquish this foe today, I am grateful.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Oh no! It&#39;s...<br> It&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Um...I&#39;m sorry, have we met? None of you are really all that memorable, so I don&#39;t recall...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, she is so dead! I&#39;m usually not that into having other women wait on me, but\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, not that much!<br> But in her case, I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> There&#39;s just something about that woman that makes me want to torment the hell out of her!</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> Agreed. Like Lady Lip, my karma curses me to bear baseless torture at others&#39; hands...</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> ...and yet, for some reason, I am overcome with the desire to make her bawl her eyes out!</p><p><strong>Para\xEDso:</strong><br> I shall seal away her skills, seal away her Noble Phantasm, and send her off to Para\xEDso to lose some of that monstrous weight!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t go that far... All I wish is for her to be more careful with her language. And yet...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> ...every spy bone in my body is calling for me to punish this abomination!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong><br> What sort of outfit is that anyway!? If you must wear something with a flower motif, at least make it a lily!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru. I don&#39;t know why it came to this, but it looks like they want to fight...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Ugh, I hate dealing with weaklings.<br> They never know when to give up...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Oh, but don&#39;t worry. This might take some time, but I&#39;ll end it as quickly as I can. It should be a good way to blow off some steam!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...And now, here we are, making our way to the exit...</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I know how you feel, Master.<br> You&#39;re exhausted, body and soul...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit, I underestimated Lip&#39;s pheromones.<br> Once Medb&#39;s group was out of the picture...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...I never thought we&#39;d then run into Gilles (Saber), Anne, Mary, Arjuna, Martha, the lion, the elephant, the sheep...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Helena, Semiramis, Abby,<br> Andersen, Benkei, Caligula...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Phantom, the pitch black puppy boy,<br> Mecha Eli-chan, and the smart Gil...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And from all these other presences I&#39;m sensing, it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re anywhere near out of the woods yet! That&#39;s my Alter Ego for you!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As an event planner myself, I do have to give her props for the way she causes chaos wherever she goes!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy about this,<br> because I&#39;m sure not...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m doing my best to bite my tongue so nobody picks on me, but they just keep coming by the truckload.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. Did all those things actually happen at Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s all my past trauma coming back to haunt me.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> The real me doesn&#39;t remember them very well,<br> so the details might be a little off...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...but that&#39;s basically how the other Servants always gang up on me. Isn&#39;t it awful!?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I have to deal with all the time.<br> I don&#39;t even bother them like BB does...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And, as you can see, she has absolutely nothing in the way of self-awareness.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s like she doesn&#39;t even realize her thoughtless remarks are what sets all these people off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still, Lip wouldn&#39;t be Lip otherwise...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Right!? I&#39;m not doing anything wrong!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m just carefully choosing my words while making sure to still be honest.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> All I said is that Medb&#39;s good looks aren&#39;t helping her get any dates, that d&#39;Eon lacks the decisiveness needed to be a good defender...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...and that Para\xEDso&#39;s too all over the place to leave a real impression! Perfectly harmless, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think she gets her smiley-prickly nature from you, BB...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m nothing like BB!<br> You take that back, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> BB&#39;s prickly smile is obnoxious and sneering,<br> while mine is meek and adorable!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hmm, I forgot how rough it was seeing an unabashed dark side up close like this. Especially when the girl it belongs to is so clueless.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Even if it is just her second SG ego speaking, there&#39;s no way her contracted Master could completely cover for this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s for sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That means a lot, coming from the one who cut her off in the first place.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re coming up on the endgame here,<br> I&#39;m just going to let that one slide.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Fujimaru,<br> this is Lip&#39;s biggest problem.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> This lack of self-awareness, along with the \u201Ctorment me!\u201D vibe she can&#39;t help but radiate, only makes her Masochistic Nature even stronger.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But this is who she is. It&#39;s not the kind of thing you can fix in a day. Hell, in her case, it&#39;s not the kind of thing she can ever fix.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> However, the good news is that her Masochistic Nature doesn&#39;t need to be fixed, because it&#39;s not a negative.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s where Lip went wrong: thinking of this SG as something that needed to be hidden or corrected.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> As her Master, I hope you can understand and accept that.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> If you tell her you don&#39;t mind her Masochistic Nature at all, or that you like her just the way she is, it ought to help a lot.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> We Alter Egos&#39; Secret Gardens lie beyond the walls we put up in our hearts.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Once you come to know and accept her secrets,<br> that&#39;s when a Sakura series Alter Ego really shines.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Though of course, as the Sakura series goes,<br> Lip and Melt are pretty easy to read.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Lip&#39;s skin might be highly sensitive, but she&#39;s oblivious when it comes to other people&#39;s feelings.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Meltryllis, on the other hand, can barely feel anything on her skin, but she&#39;s sharp as a tack about others&#39; feelings.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Aww, you were finally saying something nice about me. Did you really have to bring Melt up now, BB?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hehehe, I sure did! Thanks to all my babbling, you didn&#39;t even notice that we&#39;d reached our destination!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> All right, Fujimaru,<br> take a look at your next arena!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That...is the last obstacle of this simplified Sakura Labyrinth, as well as its exit!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> For our final scene, I called in the strongest Sentinel around to teach Lip a lesson for being so self-centered!</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...another Alter Ego!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And not just her! She&#39;s also joined by everyone&#39;s favorite mastermind and threat to humanity: BB!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? But you&#39;re over here with\u2013Huh!? Where&#39;d she go!?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Hehehe. You didn&#39;t really think I was going to help you out for nothing, did you?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That was all just an act I put on so I could give Lip the lesson she needs.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> And you, my little Fujimaru, were nothing more than the carrot meant to lead her to class!</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> ...Yeah, that&#39;s about the size of it. Looks like you&#39;ve been up to some real nonsense again, Lip.</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> Well, you can&#39;t get away with this crap forever.<br> Our resources are too damn precious to waste like this.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...<br> (...I can&#39;t believe BB went and called Melt...)</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Now then, as I said earlier, Lip&#39;s problems aren&#39;t the sort of thing you can fix in a day.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Buuut...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Say, for the sake of argument, she witnessed her beloved Master getting killed right in her own mind. Don&#39;t you think that would shock her into straightening out her act at least a bit?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Which is why I decided to bring in a professional to finish the job!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> There&#39;s only so much amateurs like Medb can do to really put the screws to Lip, after all.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But, if Lip&#39;s exact opposite, Meltryllis,<br> aka the Alter Ego of pleasure...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...aka the Sadist Prima with the Sadistic Streak SG,<br> were to carve up Lip&#39;s precious Master\u2013</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> Forget it. I&#39;m out of here.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> So you&#39;re not going to carve [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} up!?<br> But this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance to do whatever you want with my approval!</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> Are you freaking kidding me? I already do what I want, when I want. I couldn&#39;t care less whether you approve.</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> And this? I&#39;m not feeling it.</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> I do love beating up on people,<br> but I&#39;ve no interest in beating up on myself.</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> Besides, isn&#39;t being the bad guy more your thing?</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> If Chaldea&#39;s made any of us lose her touch, \u201CMother,\u201D<br> I&#39;d say it&#39;s you for trying to pawn your dirty work off on your own daughter, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Ouch! I&#39;m going to need skin grafts after that burn!</p><p><strong>Meltryllis:</strong><br> All right, Lip, you don&#39;t need my grief or my help at this point, so I&#39;m out. Sorry for bothering you.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Melt... Thank you for understanding how I feel...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I do want to share my secrets with you...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...but I would&#39;ve sooner died than let her see them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Is that &#39;cause you&#39;re both trying to push each other as rivals?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Right!<br> That&#39;s exactly the sort of relationship Melt and I have!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It looked like she just sided with you to piss off BB...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Yes, that was probably most of it, but there was still some beautiful sisterly love in there!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> (Sigh)... I can&#39;t believe the guest of honor canceled on me at the last minute after I went to all this trouble of setting the stage...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It makes me so sad...<br> But...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...that doesn&#39;t mean she was wrong.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Making a bad situation worse and kicking someone when she&#39;s down are what I do best!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Really, now that I think about it, why shouldn&#39;t I get to do whatever I want with my own Alter Ego?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need any broken-ass AI who can&#39;t even determine her own effectiveness worth a damn. So I&#39;ll just melt you down, Master and all.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Lip will be off to the scrap heap, and Fujimaru will finally come to an ignominious end.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> What, you think that&#39;s a bit extreme?<br> Well of course it is.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I do like teasing humanity,<br> but I love tormenting myself even more\u2661</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Hmph! If you think I&#39;m going to let Fujimaru die for that (completely sensible) reason, you&#39;ve got another thing coming!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Besides, now I&#39;m REALLY mad!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I can forgive a lot of things,<br> but bringing Melt here was a bridge too far!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> You handle the orders please, Master!<br> Let&#39;s teach BB a lesson ourselves!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Juuust kidding! Did you really think you could get rid of me that easily?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I can do anything in digital worlds,<br> including cheating to give myself infinite lives.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I swear, you really are a useless Sakura if you didn&#39;t even realize that.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The only way to purge me from a digital space is to trash the process for the entire zone.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That pitiful performance won&#39;t help you escape.<br> Now face your punishment for defying your god.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Ah...! Ghh...! I can&#39;t... I really don&#39;t think I can take any more of this...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Get out of here, Lip!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But...if I run away now...BB really will kill you...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> She always follows through on whatever she says,<br> even if she&#39;s only playing around...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I have to stop her now...<br> But, I don&#39;t know if I\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stop it, BB!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;m already running my self-maintenance routine. No more external commands, especially not from humans!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> I&#39;ll decide what to do with you once I&#39;ve finished processing Passionlip. Now sit down and shut up.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> A-ahhh...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I knew it.<br> I knew I could never be as badass as Melt...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> All I can do is...sit here and suffer...<br> I&#39;m weak... Useless...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> (Huff...huff...huff...)</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Although, that&#39;s strange...<br> Even though it hurts like hell...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...it also feels like...I&#39;m bursting with power...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Something seems off about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Spartacus?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s it!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> That&#39;s your true power, SG2! The power Lip&#39;s been repressing to keep up her good girl act!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> It&#39;s completely absurd that you&#39;ve been keeping that under wraps!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You have to fall before you can stand! You gotta be losing before you can turn things around!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> You must build up some emotion when you&#39;re being tormented! Now&#39;s the time to unleash it! Physically!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The way I see it, your greatest strength\u2013or, put another way, your most terrifying attribute\u2013is your ability to turn pain into power!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I...see?</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> P-please don&#39;t say things like that in front of Master!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Stupid, stupid, stupid BB!<br> Brynhild Romantiaaa!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, shit! I&#39;m glad this went the way I wanted,<br> but I wasn&#39;t expecting to take it head ooon!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well...that was a thing that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And now, evil has been vanquished.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oogh... That Romantia was powerful enough to bust up this whole zone...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> But hey, at least you get it now, right?<br> Masochistic Nature isn&#39;t just about enduring pain.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Your true power is in the explosive force that comes from enduring that pain. You can&#39;t keep that hidden away from yourself.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> After all, you were never going to be a better heroine than me by trying to be a teacher&#39;s pet.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Your denseness is what makes you, you, so I hope you stay that way forever. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> Oh, and don&#39;t worry about Fujimaru.<br> [\u2642 He&#39;ll /\u2640\uFE0F She&#39;ll} get booted back to Reality Space in a minute or two.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong><br> The real you just succeeded at salvaging [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} from your scrap heap.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you want to thank her or something, Lip?</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Hmph. No way I&#39;m thanking her.<br> I would&#39;ve solved this problem all on my...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...No, I guess I couldn&#39;t have solved it all on my own.<br> Not to mention I ended up having some of my more embarrassing parts exposed.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Still... I guess she was right.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I can&#39;t force myself to be someone I&#39;m not.<br> Especially if it only makes trouble for you...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m so sorry, Fujimaru, but this is who I am.<br> Pessimistic, dishonest, heavy, troublesome...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> So...will you scold me when I&#39;m misbehaving?<br> Will you still be my Master, even with all my faults?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You have to ask?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Hehe.<br> Then I guess I&#39;d better not let you down!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Please take good care of my real self.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> We may still have a lot to learn, but I promise we&#39;ll work as hard as we can to catch up to everyone else!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> So, until we do...I hope you&#39;ll hold my hand.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;re by my side,<br> I think I can find a way to change who I am...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Oh, thank goodness!<br> I&#39;m so glad I managed to salvage you!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Are you hurt?

What a relief...!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...Once again, I&#39;m so sorry, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> It&#39;s all my fault you were almost trashed and crushed...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I guess you must really hate me now. Who&#39;d want to keep around someone who dropped them into a garbage dump...?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry.<br> I&#39;ll stay away from you from now on...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just hide in one of Chaldea&#39;s corners and live out the rest of my materialization as a Rogue Servant, doing what I can to help from the shadows...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was actually really pleasant in there.</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> R-really!? I don&#39;t know all that much about my body,<br> so I thought...you must have hated it in there!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> But...I can tell you&#39;re not lying.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> You must have been through a lot,<br> since I asked BB to help you...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> ...but you&#39;re still holding my hand...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> And on top of that, I&#39;m feeling great.<br> It&#39;s all thanks to you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I bet I could take on anyone right now.<br> ...Would you like to go to the simulator and see?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m really feeling pumped up for some reason.<br> I wonder why!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fine with me, but what do we do for an opponent?</p><hr><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got that covered!<br> I know plenty of other Servants who&#39;d be willing to fight!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> There&#39;s Medb, d&#39;Eon, Para\xEDso, Hijikata...<br> And I&#39;m sure there&#39;d be lots of others if I asked!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Hehe. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll end up losing in the end, but that&#39;ll be fun, too.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to make you proud to have me as a Servant!</p>', 598);
