Oh, My!</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived. Rayshift successful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, why Rayshift to this era now?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if the Singularity has been resolved, it&#39;s still a handful to prove your existence in that era...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...I understand that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Especially now, when we need to rest as much as we can before the decisive battle against the King of Mages.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I also wanted Master to get some rest back in Chaldea, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I had a choice. I was forced.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to say no to Ibaraki...</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hahaha! Rest!? Like I&#39;d let you rest! Cry!<br> Cry while you tell me what a terrifying oni I am!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> People should cry in terror every time they see an oni like me! There&#39;s no peace or rest when I&#39;m around!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...But now that I think of it...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If I were you, every encounter I had with Shuten would only end up with memories of bitterness and agony.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The way she teases me... Yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> True. So true.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hehehe. I see, I see.<br> Yup, I think that a lo\u2013erm... Never mind.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Anyway. The point is, Shuten is amazing. Her cruelty and evil are beyond any regular oni, and I need to follow that example!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, do it in moderation.<br> So, Ibaraki, why&#39;d you want to come here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not just to stop Master from resting, is it?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmph. Nope. There&#39;s somewhere I wanna go.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a lot of walking to do.<br> I hope you have your hiking shoes on.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Actually, doesn&#39;t matter.<br> If you get tired or slow me down, I&#39;ll just drag you along!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And then you&#39;ll scream and cry and tell me how cruel and awful I am! Heehee... Just watch, and be amazed!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s really not a safe place for a stroll...<br> So why do you want to go there?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Something smells. I can&#39;t leave it be.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Smells...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Eh, you&#39;ll see when we get there. I&#39;ll take the lead. Follow me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ibaraki&#39;s hyped up.<br> Let&#39;s just follow her, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe she found a tree that grows sweets...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe she found a chocolate fountain...</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> A-as if! There&#39;s no such thing! Right? RIGHT!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Actually, Uruk has a secret candy tree orchard.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>WHAT!? Wh-where is it? Tell me! We&#39;re gonna stop by on our way! E-even if it&#39;s not on our way! WE WILL GO!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmmm... Just thinking about sweets makes my mouth water. Those are good. Such flavors are not possible within the oni realm.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And even I know how preciously rare they are.<br> I know that I mustn&#39;t have more than one per day.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Butbutbut...! If candy grows on trees...it&#39;ll never run out! And I can eat as much as I want!!!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Kwahahaha! Master, yes! You&#39;ve given me the best news of my life! Candy! Unliiimited caaandy!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just kidding.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> YOU MONSTER!!!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm. This is kinda homey. Reminds me of Mt. Ooe. Everything in these forests is evil.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And obviously I&#39;d be the boss of all this.<br> Not a lotta things out there as evil as a blood-crazed oni!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m just going to say again that I never expected we&#39;d come across an actual oni.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t even sure we&#39;d be able to communicate properly...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not least because of how incredibly violent you were in Rashomon the first time we ran into you...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But since your Madness Enhancement seems to be mixed with your oni nature, you seem to be one of those Berserkers that can converse normally.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad we were able to get along,<br> unexpected as that was.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> An oni getting along with humans...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Cut the nonsense, onmyouji. I am an oni. That&#39;s a human. There&#39;s no getting along for us.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This human is...y-yeah...totally terrified of me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> The only relationship we have is the kind between a frightening tyrant and a whimpering, terrified kid!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (It&#39;s so cute when she tries to be scary.) Terrifying. Truly.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Yes, yes! I knew it! Of course it is!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That dull, warm gaze and your dumb face twitching in a terrified half-smile is all the proof I need!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And onmyouji... Just because I&#39;m an oni doesn&#39;t mean you can look at me like a circus freak. I&#39;ll eat you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not an onmyouji. We&#39;re called doctors.<br> And, well...sorry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see now that I was being insensitive.<br> I&#39;m sorry I upset you, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hmph. Whatever.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> So are oni really that rare in this era? If you went to Mt. Ooe back in the day, there were tons around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mentioned that mountain earlier...<br> Is that your homeland, Ibaraki-Douji?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Homeland? I guess you could call it that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What kind of place was it?<br> You said it was similar to here...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mountain where the oni I led gathered.<br> We even built a palace there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An oni palace... Sounds incredible...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm. Without that, the oni would be no different than mere beasts.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I won&#39;t tell them to live like humans, but we need our pride. That&#39;s why we need food, clothes, and shelter.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...I guess thinking like that is what made me stand out from all the other oni.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> But that&#39;s my problem.<br> My time spent as an oni was glorious!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I led mighty oni troops and we rampaged through the capital in the Heian period. There was Kuma-Douji, Torakuma-Douji, Hoshiguma, Kanekuma...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And my bestest number one companion and loving blood sister...Shuten.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We raided and pillaged human cities all the time. When we were done, we went back to the mountain to rest.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And when we wanted more, we took it!<br> Just thinking of all the fun we had makes my heart race!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. Your story is...disturbing, but it sounds like you were happy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You rounded up a bunch of freewheeling oni and made them into a gang.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oni are powerful, but alone they can be killed by a group of humans. That&#39;s why you decided to band together.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yep, yep. No mean feat. You had the gift of foresight. Might even have been wasted on an oni, really.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Not really. I just acted according to my mother&#39;s teachings.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> The only one who kept to her own principles, lived in luxury, and ruled as an evil, cruel oni was Shuten.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, Shuten-Douji. She is certainly extraordinary. Honestly, calling her an oni might be selling her short.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm? Speaking of which, where is she?<br> She&#39;s not with you this time?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No need. I don&#39;t wanna bother her with this.<br> ...This way. Let&#39;s get this over with before she wakes up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, okay.<br> Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s my imagination...but I&#39;m starting to get a bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Ah...ahhhhhh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It reads almost like a Servant...or not?<br> Is it some sort of remnant...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Ha. That scent... I smell it. Is it you?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You smell of oni, female warrior!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> My current form limits my ability to detect things a bit, but I&#39;m sure you know very well yourself.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There was supposedly a Heroic Spirit who was summoned to this land and later defeated.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Judging from the state of the battlefield...<br> I&#39;d say there were flames. Flames like mine.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> With flames intense enough to scorch your own body, you incinerated the enemies around you. ...I see that kind of intensity and desire. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A female warrior...who died in Uruk?<br> We did not meet her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I have some information on her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant named Tomoe Gozen sacrificed herself to defeat the Demonic Beasts&#39; commander, Girtablilu.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ah. So that means those are her charred remains.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Of course they are. I&#39;m sure you know, but we oni are the epitome of sloppy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are you saying Tomoe Gozen was an oni!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Based on her scent, not exactly.<br> Maybe she was descended from oni.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Though I&#39;m sure she has more direct lineage than that Fuuma kid.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> Ah...ahhhhhh...!<br> AHHHHHH!!!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> She has no sense or will. Just mindless violence.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Or perhaps... She absorbed some power from that, umm... Girta...waffle? Maybe that&#39;s why she&#39;s losing control.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Not that I can blame her for losing her mind after being incinerated along with her enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What a delicious-sounding enemy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tastiest enemy ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Kwahahaha, in name only!<br> It certainly doesn&#39;t SMELL delicious.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> That thing&#39;s just an imitation oni.<br> A writhing, burnt husk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibaraki-Douji... You knew about this...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No. I just wanted to get rid of the source of its stench before Shuten noticed it.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There was no way for me to recognize the smell.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Get rid of it...? If Tomoe Gozen is descended from oni, don&#39;t you feel some kinship with her?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Maybe if it was the real thing, but that&#39;s just a remnant. Looks like there&#39;s other stuff mixed in, too.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to question its existence.<br> Human, what would you do in my place?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If the mostly dead remnants that smelled of your kind were mixed with other, unknown things...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If all they did was writhe around and lash out violently...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...what would you do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds like a zombie movie to me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen this movie. I know how it ends.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When you put it that way, Ibaraki&#39;s approach seems...understandable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I obviously do not know what an oni scent\u2013</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> Gu...ah...ahhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I know it&#39;s something we can&#39;t just leave here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if she was a great Servant who stopped the invasion of the Demonic Front and we are indebted to her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...all this remnant does is pose a danger to an era about to be restored.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh no. It looks like you&#39;ve got her attention!<br> She doesn&#39;t seem at all friendly!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Kukuku... So you noticed my scent.<br> Gonna try and eat me and make me a part of you, eh?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Well as a proper oni, lemme tell you:<br> You&#39;re pitiful! Pathetic! Wretched!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Know your place. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s gonna eat you!<br> My name is Ibaraki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m the leader of the oni of Mt. Ooe! The one who drowned the Heian capital in blood and terror!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> Ibara...ki... Yes... You...returned... How wonderful...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> Please...laugh...at me... I&#39;m lower...than an oni...<br> I... I couldn&#39;t...acknowledge you...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> I...stomped all over...Girtablilu&#39;s heart...<br> He said I...was beautiful...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen?:</strong><br> But... But I told him...that it was impossible...<br> Impossible for an oni to...understand humans...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Threat response...completely gone.<br> Good work.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> What the hell? Did she know me?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Never mind.<br> I knew it. It was neither fun nor delicious.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad that it didn&#39;t cause trouble for Shuten.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... Look how sad she looks...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s just standing there staring at the spot where the enemy fell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, she was talking about her comrades...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. She talks big, but they were both oni.<br> She probably has a lot on her mind.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...If only you were more than a remnant...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> If you are truly descended from oni, come to Mt. Ooe.<br> I am the leader of the oni. I will not refuse you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Maybe, if I feel like it, I&#39;d share a human liver with you... No...I wouldn&#39;t like that, but I&#39;d share wonderful foreign sweets or two to you...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Whew. Who knew there&#39;d still be irregularities in an era even after we fixed the Singularity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s because of the concentration of magical energy in Uruk. But no matter what, you managed to take care of it. Come back with your heads held high\u2013</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I said \u201Cno,\u201D onmyouji.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m a doctor, not an onmyouji! Ugh, never mind that.<br> Are you saying that you&#39;re not coming back yet?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> There are other places to go.<br> Accompany me, Master.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Refuse, and I&#39;ll drag you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The poison of selfishness somethingsomething...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Eh? Poison? No thanks. You know, though...Shuten would even drink up poisoned alcohol if it involves THAT man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...Oh! Right!) How, uh, evil...of you...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? What did you just say? Hey, what did you say???<br> I couldn&#39;t hear you! Say it again!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Bwahahaha! I knew it! I&#39;m such a great oni, I even scare myself! Good! Cry more! Scream more!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master... What a wonderful way to handle her.<br> You really are kind!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I guess you did lead with your nose...?<br> That helped us out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If there&#39;s another place you need to go to, I&#39;m sure you have your reasons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d rather not think about it, but I can&#39;t guarantee there isn&#39;t another remnant like before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Even with the Singularity resolved, we do not know for sure what would happen if we left it alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Besides?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ibaraki...has always been kind of charming, even cute...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Like when she butts heads with Raikou and Kintoki, or when she&#39;s getting bullied by Shuten, or when she&#39;s eating sweets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But back there...when she acted like a proper leader of the oni... I was impressed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seeing that really cast her in a new light. I think I want to see more of this side of her. Or...something like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hey, what are you two babbling about?<br> If we&#39;re going, let&#39;s get a move on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if this is from correcting the Singularity, or whether this is all thanks to the survivors...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the city is very lively now!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not quite so much as when you first arrived,<br> but it is still impressive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Glad to hear it.<br> So is your next destination somewhere around here?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Yes, but we need to walk a bit more.<br> Still...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Hm. What a lively city.<br> If Shuten were here, she&#39;d be thrilled.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Uruk is King Gilgamesh&#39;s city!<br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s rowdy in a lot of ways.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Right. Being lively and bountiful is good.<br> That makes the pillaging more fun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Ibaraki?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m kidding. This isn&#39;t the Heian capital where I ran amok. Besides, I don&#39;t have Shuten nor my minions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (...Does that mean she would run amok if they WERE here?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see that you really do have strong feelings for Shuten. You mention her frequently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can tell you are always mindful of her.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shuten and I spent a lot of time together, like siblings.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Among all the oni on Mt. Ooe, she was the only one I saw as an equal, not an underling.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And not just in terms of rank.<br> I have a lot of respect for the way she lived her life.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm. Would you listen to my story in all seriousness?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In many of the stories about oni, Shuten-Douji is said to have been the leader of the oni in Mt. Ooe...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And there&#39;s a reason for that. Shuten was flashier, stronger, and more dangerous than all the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Even when we attacked the capital, she was the one who stood out.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> She seeks pleasure, after all.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> She lived to drink, pillage, kill, eat...<br> Just watching her was fascinating.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (For humans, I&#39;m sure watching her was utterly horrifying...)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Anyway. We&#39;re almost there. This way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. But how come we&#39;re going through so many alleyways...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh! We&#39;re in front of the ziggurat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this. The Sacred Temple watches over Uruk. There&#39;s no way ghost would be lurking around here.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shut up. I smell something. This way.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard for me to believe that a threat would be hiding under HIS watchful eye, in his kingdom...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> You guys have got it all wrong.<br> What I&#39;m looking for is the treasury.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whaaa...!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make me say \u201Cshut up\u201D again.<br> I&#39;ll rip out your throat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I thought this was just more of what we talked about earlier!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Like some sense of duty as the leader of the oni to clean up oni remnants... Something like that...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...? Isn&#39;t this exactly the sort of thing the leader of the oni should do? Oni loot and pillage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but you just said you wouldn&#39;t attack this city...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Not the city itself, obviously. I wouldn&#39;t be able to do that on my own. But I never said I wouldn&#39;t steal some treasure.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Besides, I want to bring a souvenir back for Shuten.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking about the king&#39;s treasury, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some incredible treasure here that outshines whatever&#39;s in the Heian capital.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Wine Shuten would enjoy... A hairpin that would look good on her... A kimono that would accentuate her beauty...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> And this is a grand treasure vault. Some super delicious sweets that I&#39;ve never even imagined must be stored here as well.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Th-those are totally a gift for Shuten! I just...need to taste-test them in case they&#39;re poisoned... Yeah...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Kuhahaha...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I wonder if I can carry them all out...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I thought I smelled something unusual, so I came to see for myself. What a bold bunch of thieves.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s here!!!<br> Hm? But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Doctor. King Gilgamesh is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-who&#39;s that?? Are you human? Or a ghost?<br> A Servant!? Um...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool!<br> This is MY city, MY castle, and MY treasury!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whether I am on my throne or in the underworld, OF COURSE I would come to see the mongrels who dare attempt to rob it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It would be far stranger if I did not!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We shouldn&#39;t think too much of this guy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This king is no different than the other ones...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway, allow us to explain ourselves, King of Heroes. There&#39;s a good rea\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Silence! You have nothing to say that I need to hear!<br> You all need to learn your place!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Although, I did see what you did with Tomoe.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Because of that, I will excuse some of your behavior.<br> You may wander my city. You may sneak into my palace...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...but I WILL NOT show an ounce of mercy to those who dare to raid my treasury!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is beyond disrespect! This is treason! Anarchy!<br> You will learn what it is to earn my wrath!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> A golden man... Gah, so garish. And he&#39;s so intense... That&#39;s no ordinary man!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...Well, hm... He does seem kinda familiar...<br> Or, well, he makes me a little fidgety.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s this weird sort of discomfort...like when I need to sit down in front of Mother because I&#39;m in for a scolding...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh yeah, King Gilgamesh summoned Banana...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh yeah. Didn&#39;t Ushiwakamaru scare her off?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I have not forgotten your desertion in the face of the enemy. That, also, is not excused by your good deed in ending Tomoe Gozen.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You may not technically be the one I summoned, but you shall take her punishment regardless.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Unnngh...unnngh... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! I feel like I do, but I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just like Chaldea&#39;s Master, what you know or don&#39;t know does not matter!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I shall be the judge, jury, and executioner for your crimes in trying to steal from my treasury!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Brace yourselves, fools! If you want to live, fight with all your power, or suffer my wrath!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This...is no good!<br> Let&#39;s hang in there as best we can, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahaha! I&#39;m just warming up!<br> I shall even put on my armor for you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Burn my regal, glorious presence into your minds!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Why you... This is why I hate golden guys!<br> They&#39;re flashy, blinding, and they just piss me off!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You do know that your main color is gold, right?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> It is in good taste! Mother picked it out!<br> It doesn&#39;t just sparkle all the time like that thing!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite tenacious for a mongrel.<br> As a reward for your spirit, I will call it a day.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Rejoice. I shall show you the contents of the treasury that you so coveted.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Gate of Babylon!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> This is the end!<br> I have no other choice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ibaraki-Douji!?<br> Why are you covering me and Master\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re, uh, really high up...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Waaaaaahhh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Close your mouth tight or you&#39;ll bite your tongue!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use. Even though Ibaraki-Douji could jump over the gate of Rashomon, a point-blank hit there will be fatal!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s...no attack!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Could this be...Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s \u201CDisengage\u201D skill that lets her avoid or flee from enemy attacks?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The legend where she was the only one who managed to flee from Raikou&#39;s four oni-slayers... The legend of her escaping even after Watanabe-no-Tsuna took off her arm is\u2013</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Shut up, onmyouji! How dare you mention that hateful Minamoto! It&#39;s making me wanna KILL!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree this is no time to be chatting!<br> Doctor, please prepare for Rayshift!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmph. Mongrel.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Shall we go after them, King Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No. Leave them be.<br> She is only doing what is in her nature.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Never pursuing dignity or honor... She wouldn&#39;t hesitate to turn her back on all that mattered if it meant she would survive.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How ugly...how pitiful...how beautiful that is.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...I remember now. That&#39;s why I gave up on her. There was no point forcing her to be my dog. A beast will live and die as a beast. That is all it can do.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes, but...what about the crime of attempting to loot the king&#39;s treasury? Shall that be overlooked?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I told you: no more than a beast.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She was simply drawn to the scent of my treasures as a wild dog to meat. No more than a stray lurking near the front door.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to chase such a creature to its lair for the kill. Of course, should she return, I won&#39;t hesitate to crush her.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> (Yawn) ...I am so booored...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hm? Ibaraki. Welcome back. Where have you been?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Shuten. I meant to bring back a souvenir for you... But I couldn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t even know where you&#39;ve been.<br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But more importantly, I was bored because you left me alone.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> My sweetie wasn&#39;t here, and when I tried to pick on the brat, he ran away as usual.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And Raikou didn&#39;t even come and try to take my head off...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If you&#39;re talking about a souvenir, you coming back is the best present, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I sense some large battle about to begin.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The best way to lighten the mood is drinking.<br> Well, I drink all the time, but keep me company, Ibaraki.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Oh. Okay. Yeah... Okay.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> ...O-of course...!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> So where were you all this time?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Ku... Kuhahaha. I may not have a souvenir, but I have stories to tell! Listen to all of my glorious feats!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> I did what only a true oni could ever do! Master cried like a baby! The people trembled in fear...in the hundreds...no, thousands!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...? (Sniff, sniff) Hm, I smell an unfamiliar oni on you.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me... You abandoned poor, lonely Shuten to go have fun with another oni?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> How could you... I&#39;m... I&#39;m going to cry...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> N-n-n-n-n-no! Absolutely not! It&#39;s not what you think! L-listen, Shuten! I can explain!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ... (Sob, sob)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong><br> Sh-Shuteeeeeen!!!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> (Ah, Ibaraki is truly the best entertainment to go along with my alcohol. I never get tired of her...)</p>', 357);
