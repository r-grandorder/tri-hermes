But, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m comfortable with proposing that myself...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Why not? They say love is war, and in war, whoever makes the first move has a clearer path to victory.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Yup! You can&#39;t have a victory without a battle first!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> True... B-but then again, this isn&#39;t actually a war.<br> This is a video game meant to simulate dating.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> So I&#39;m not sure the usual rules of warfare are necessarily the way to go in this case...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Wh-what do you think, Tomoe Gozen?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Ahh, this tea is so good.<br> Hm? Did you say something?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Ahh, I see. Branching dialogue. Personally, I believe choosing whichever option sounds best to you is the way to go...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...but I have also heard from Lord Zhuge Liang that characters in games like these do tend to have distinct preferences.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Well, if it&#39;s a Japanese game we&#39;re talking about, they tend to cover all the bases pretty well. What&#39;s that? A dating sim?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Those aren&#39;t the kinds of games I usually play, but if you want my advice, I&#39;d say make sure to get a bead on your target character&#39;s likes and dislikes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Honestly, it really isn&#39;t much different from gauging a battle. If the enemy has a certain inclination, all you have to do is focus on it and plan accordingly.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> As Sun Tzu once said:</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> \u201CIf you know your enemy and know yourself,<br> you will never be defeated in a hundred battles.\u201D</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Does that help?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> \u201CKnow your enemy...\u201D</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> \u201CKnow yourself...\u201D</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> \u201CAnd you will never be defeated in a hundred battles.\u201D<br> No wonder he was such a revered tactician.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> He might not quite be the kind of brave warrior we&#39;re always keeping an eye out for, but he sure was a smart guy.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Know your enemy and know yourself...<br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Hehe. All that aside, I never expected to have an opportunity to play with you all in the recreation room in such a manner.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> This is wonderful! There are a number of four-player games I have been wanting to try that would be perfect to share with my three new gamer friends!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Gamer friends?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Oh, did I misunderstand?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Nah, I think you can call us your gamer friends no problem. I mean, we do hang out here all the time these days.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> And you&#39;ve been a huge help to us ever since we were summoned. Oh, please help yourself to the snacks we brought.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Thank you. They look delicious. Oh, where are my manners? I haven&#39;t even made you tea.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Oh, no, you don&#39;t have to go to any trouble for us.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Not at all. It&#39;s the least I can do.<br> Wait right here; I&#39;ll be back in no time.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Gamer friends, huh...?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I hadn&#39;t realized it before, but I suppose that is what we are now, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Well hey, considering how much we come here nowadays, it was bound to happen.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Of course she is, Thr\xFAd.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> You know, I hadn&#39;t given it much thought until now...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...but we really have become accustomed to all three of us materializing at once, haven&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> I know we do our best to keep [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} magical energy consumption to a minimum...but there&#39;s no way we could all actually fight together like this, is there?</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> We used to take turns being summoned, but at the moment, Thr\xFAd is the only one of us materialized in an official capacity.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> And even though we always reintegrate into one Heroic Spirit whenever we&#39;re fighting for Chaldea on Master&#39;s behalf...</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> ...having all three of us materialized the rest of the time has got to be...well...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> ...Yeah. It definitely takes a toll on Master.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already talked to the technical advisor about this, but...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> I remember. She said our simultaneous materialization wasn&#39;t having any noticeable effect on Master&#39;s vitals...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> ...and that this sort of thing isn&#39;t all that unusual at Chaldea, so it wasn&#39;t a big deal.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Really, when you get right down to it...we still don&#39;t even know why we all want to be materialized simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Strategically speaking, we know it&#39;s a waste of resources, and yet...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> For some reason...</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> We all just naturally end up materializing together.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I also tried talking to our sister in the hope that she could help us get to the bottom of this mystery, as she knows even more about being a Valkyrie than we do. But...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Utilitarianism may have its uses, but it is far from all there is to life. That is just as true for Heroic and Divine Spirits as it is for humans.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Even if our transient bodies are merely made of ether instead of flesh and bone...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...we still have things that make our fleeting existence worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Pride. Honor. Fate. Love. We may not always know where they are, and we may sometimes stumble on the way to finding them, but they still give our lives meaning all the same.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> And since that is surely the same for all of you as it is for anyone else, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything mysterious about your situation at all.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Love!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> L-l-l-love...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> O-o-oh gosh, oh gosh. Y-y-you think we&#39;re in love?<br> You think we can love?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> D-d-d-don&#39;t be ridiculous, Sister! Y-you know as well as we do that we&#39;re just automated machines the Allfather made.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Right!?</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> .........Pshhht.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Aah! Ortlinde is overheating!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Thr\xFAd!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Ahh, this takes me back.<br> You three remind me of myself when I was younger.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Sisteeer!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> After that, we tried talking to all sorts of other Servants in an effort to learn just what love truly is...</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> ...but none of their answers really clicked for us.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> And that brings us to now.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Dating involves romance, so if these games simulate it, I think we should be able to use them to learn about love.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> I think so too. Man, humans come up with the most interesting ideas sometimes, don&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you agree, Thr\xFAd?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...I see no need for me to give voice to my opinion, seeing as we synchronize our thought patterns at regular intervals.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> I know, but still... Hmm.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> At this point, we should forgo sleep in order to play this game as much as possible. Er, not that we need to sleep in the first place, of course.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. We might all be thinking along the same lines, but three heads are still better than one!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> That&#39;s exactly what a famous Eastern proverb says. And it&#39;s right. With all our wisdom pooled together, there is no conundrum we can&#39;t overcome.</p><p><strong>Valkyries:</strong><br> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> (Nnn... It seems I was right to wait before offering them tea.)</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> (Hmm, I see. So that is why they are here...)</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...So that is the story.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I am happy to have new gamer friends no matter what their reasons may be, of course...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...but the way they are spending almost every moment of every day staring at a screen, well...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I could not help but worry about them...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> It was very difficult for me to come to you about this, Master, but I am afraid I did not know what else to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for telling me, Tomoe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you told me about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Of course...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AVoice:</strong><br> Beautiful. I see the spark of true friendship in your concern for your peers.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> For after all, what is friendship without regard for our fellow person&#39;s well-being?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I know you!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Forgive the intrusion, Tomoe Gozen and Master, but I couldn&#39;t help but overhear your discussion.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Allow me to handle this.<br> For you see...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I have an excellent idea!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Are you all right, Master?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I can handle a trek across a snowy mountain like this just fine since I am able to fly, but it must be much more difficult for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m used to walking.</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> This is quite a lot of snow, even by my standards.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> This is supposed to be a recreation of the Scandinavian Lostbelt, correct?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> While all these mountains and trees made up of ice and snow are certainly beautiful to look at, I can&#39;t help but find them a jarring sight.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> That aside...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Why did we come to the Scandinavian Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> If you only wished to have us simulate combat for training purposes, we Valkyries could do so just as easily in our own mind space.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Of course, if you wish to have us practice coordinating with you, then I can see the value in training like this...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...but it still seems wasteful to use your precious magical energy resources on a, um, o-one-on-one session...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I-I, um... I&#39;m sorry, Master.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Considering how my sisters and I are forcing you to let us all materialize simultaneously, even if only during downtime, I have no right to say that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I knew the Valkyries were a package deal going in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it. The magical energy it takes tokeep you all around is barely a blip on the radar.</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> The wind just picked up...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AVoice:</strong><br> Hehe.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AVoice:</strong><br> Since when do you care about the well-being of a measly human? Now you&#39;re just embarrassing yourself, puppet.</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> That aside, you sure do talk a lot for a damn doll, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Tell me, Valkyrie, just how far are you and your sisters going to fall over a damn human?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be...<br> Surtr!?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> N-no... You aren&#39;t the Fiery King of Giants...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> You are Sigurd, the man Sister Brynhild loved!<br> But... Aah!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I know I have no records of this Lostbelt, yet every circuit in my body is telling me that when his eyes glow red, Sigurd is a threat to the very planet itself!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Your eternally burning hellfire would consume all of reality if left unchecked! Why are you here of all places!?</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Heh. You ask me why, puppet?</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Why? Why, you say!? Hehehehe. That is exactly the question I have for you, Valkyrie!</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Why do you mimic your predecessor and degrade yourself by serving a human? What could you have possibly gained by doing so!?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Exactly. The answer is \u201Cnothing.\u201D</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> The only thing you obsolete automata are good for is deceiving brave warriors who died nobly in battle and taking their souls with you to Valhalla.</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> No more. I will destroy you and stop you from embarrassing yourselves any longer.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Master, I don&#39;t know when or how,<br> but we&#39;ve been surrounded by giants!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> It is still unclear who this man is or what he wants, but it does seem clear that peaceful negotiation is no longer an option!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll just have to stay calm and take them on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. We can handle them as long as we keep our cool.</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Initiating combat routines.<br> Preparing to eliminate all enemy targets.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> O Great Allfather, lend me your strength!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Yaaah!</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Well, well!</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Not bad spearmanship for a Valkyrie who&#39;s lost her way!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right! I...we, are lost!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Before, we would have just diagnosed ourselves as broken, and asked the Allfather for repairs.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> But now, I\u2013we, know Sister Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Both the Allfather and Sister herself said that she was broken...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> But we hesitate to agree...</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> After all...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> After all, Sister Brynhild is so beautiful when she smiles like that.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> We just cannot believe that she only does so because she&#39;s broken. No...we don&#39;t want to believe it!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> That is why we remain lost! That is why we refuse to reject our own half-broken selves!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Even if, by remaining broken, we irrevocably set ourselves on a path towards oblivion...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Even if learning about love brings us nothing but a tragic, fiery death, we will still\u2013</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough!</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Sister...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Huh? Sister...Brynhild?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Red-Eyed Swordsman:</strong><br> And me.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> My dear sister-in-law, Thr\xFAd.<br> No...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> My dear sisters, Thr\xFAd, Hildr, and Ortlinde.<br> I am overjoyed to see your resolve for myself.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...Sigurd?</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> (Gasp)</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> M-M-Master! Is this about what I think it&#39;s about!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure is!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Oh gosh, oh gosh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup! I&#39;m impressed how quickly you figured it out.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Th-then...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> You, Sigurd, and Sister were so concerned about me\u2013er, us...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...spending so much of our time on d-d-dating sims...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...that you decided to trick us like this?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Thr\xFAd. I knew such a deception would be profoundly shocking for you.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> But you three have been so obsessed lately that I figured, if you didn&#39;t get it out of your system like this...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> ...you&#39;d never be able to take a step back and see the larger picture.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> As usual, Brynhild is being too modest. All she did was nod in mild agreement. The responsibility for this deception lies entirely with me.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Sisters, I apologize for what I said to you behind my mask. Even if the goal in doing so was ultimately to help you, I cannot deny that they were still terrible things to say.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I won&#39;t ask for your forgiveness. I will only ask that you direct all of your ire towards me.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Beloved...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Th-then, this must mean...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> We were acting in such a dreadful manner that we caused our dear sister to worry about us...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Sister. Sisters. I trust the other two of you can hear me through Thr\xFAd?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I want to tell you all something very important.<br> Something your sister once told me.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Get lost!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> By which I mean, if there is some piece of knowledge that remains beyond your grasp, or you are unable to find what it is you seek...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> ...then go ahead and stray away from the path you know to look for it. Go ahead and get lost in the proverbial woods.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> You need not worry that you will lose your way forever, for Brynhild and I will always be there to stop you from going down the wrong path.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> So let yourselves be lost. Let yourselves agonize and search for solutions as much as you need. In doing so, you will all learn and grow.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Grow...</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Sigurd. How could we ever grow when we are nothing more than transient ether?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> That is where you are mistaken, Sister.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> As long as we exist in this world, regardless of what form that existence may take, we are still resolutely ourselves.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> At least, that is how I see it.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Same here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s a fine way to look at it.</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Thank you, Fujimaru.<br> I&#39;m so glad my sisters have you for their Master.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> As am I, beloved.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Master...<br> Sister...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Brynhild?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong><br> Beloved, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to hold my spear back much longer...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> I see. Then I&#39;d better wrap this up quick.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> Thr\xFAd! Hildr! Ortlinde!<br> I have an order for you on Master&#39;s behalf!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Y-yes!? What is it!?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong><br> No more than one hour of gaming per day!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Begin Ortlinde&#39;s personal memory log.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As for what happened next...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thanks in part to Tomoe Gozen&#39;s impassioned argument that one hour per day was too short...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...we were permitted to play video games for up to two hours per day. And today...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Dating simulations are all well and good!<br> However!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> As Heroic Spirits, we must not neglect our feelings towards the battlefield either.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Which is why today...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve brought a different game for us to play!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> This is a true masterpiece! Even Lord Tajima has given it high praise, saying it was, \u201CNot bad.\u201D And since it has all manner of challenge modes built-in, I think it will be right up your alleys!</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> What is this?</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> It looks very Eastern.</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Do we get to control this person with the katana?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> In this game, you go around fighting enemies as either a samurai or a ninja. Oh, but you don&#39;t always have to fight them head-on. You may always utilize stealth kills.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Samurai! Ninja!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> (Itching to get started)</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I-I suppose that doesn&#39;t sound too bad. Eastern warriors can probably hold their own just fine against the Vikings.</p><p><strong>Hildr:</strong><br> Come on, let&#39;s try it!<br> I call first life!</p><p><strong>Ortlinde:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll go second.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Thr\xFAd:</strong><br> I-I mean, that&#39;s fine. I am the eldest, after all, so I have no problem taking my turn last.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, it has a multiplayer mode as well!<br> Hehe, come on, let&#39;s all play together!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re still stumbling as we try to find our way,<br> but at least we had another enjoyable day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> By the way, Master?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I have no intention of ever letting you see this,<br> but I thought I would try addressing you while I write it anyway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So,Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Why do you think we became so obsessed with dating sims in the first place?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is it because we asked Sister Brynhild what love is?<br> That is certainly the main reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But admittedly, it is not the only one.<br> You see, we also...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> On second thought, never mind.<br> Okay, see you later then.</p>', 269);
