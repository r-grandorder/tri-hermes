You know, in my home country of Japan, December is known as \u201CShiwasu\u201D and is written with the characters for \u201Cteacher\u201D and \u201Crun.\u201D</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong><br> I am told that is because it is a season where mentor monks like myself tend to be running around frantically.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh?

Pretty much seventy percent of the end-of-year cleanup is just manual labor, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget us, Da Vinci.<br> Senpai and I would also be glad to help out\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh no you don&#39;t. You two stay on standby.<br> Christmas is just around the corner, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And I&#39;ve seen enough in the database to have a pretty good idea of just how crazy Christmas at Chaldea gets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Captain also certainly seems<br> to have a lot on his plate...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You two. What are you looking so giddy about?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you see that everyone&#39;s busy getting ready to deal with the Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Get back to your standby positions at once. This is no time to be sitting around twiddling our thumbs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, Director Goredolf,<br> may I ask you where you got that cake?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about sitting around with a literal piece of cake?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Fou is taking strong issue with that proposed course of action!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hm? You&#39;ve got it all wrong, you little bacon thief. My snack here is all part of my emergency preparation regimen.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Thanks to all these bizarre little events that have been taking place on top of the already strenuous Lostbelts, my stress levels are at an all-time high.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And considering the toll they were found to be taking on me during my last physical before this nonsense, I don&#39;t even want to think about what my next one will be like if this keeps up.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Which is why my technical advisor officially prescribed me a strict sweets quota to aid my mental health.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t believe me,<br> go ahead and ask Da Vinci yourself.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Suffice to say, this cake is mine alone. And before you ask, I&#39;ll have you know there was not a single (overt) bribe involved.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fooou?<br> (Sniffing for anything \u201Cunder the table.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay... But, um, I have to ask, Director Goredolf:<br> Are you sure you&#39;re okay eating that cake?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, considering that there was that,<br> well...poisoned cake incident...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oh, yes, that. Naturally, I&#39;m still dealing with some PTSD from that unfortunate incident.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fortunately, I oversaw every step of making this cake personally, so I have complete confidence in its safety.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Ahahahaha. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever baked with such an...attentive audience before.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> But I&#39;m still happy to do it. Especially if it can help you overcome your cake PTSD.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...(Munch)...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Ordinarily, it would be a tremendous<br> waste of magical energy... (Munch)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...to employ a Servant, who is basically like a<br> familiar, for anything besides combat...(Nom nom)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But considering how few hands we have to spare,<br> as well as the need to let our staff get the rest<br> they deserve...(Gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m afraid I simply had no choice but to have you attend to more menial matters.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Really, it&#39;s okay. Like I said, I&#39;m happy to do it.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Although, speaking of things one&#39;s happy to do...<br> There&#39;s something I wanted to ask you about, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Stare at cake)</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Did I not just get done telling<br> you this cake is mine!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No fair!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> All&#39;s fair in food and war!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Besides, you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ve ever been stressed out a day in your life!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Now, now, don&#39;t worry about that.<br> I&#39;ll bring you some cake of your own later.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> What I wanted to say was, it&#39;s getting to be that time of year, isn&#39;t it? What was it again...? Oh, right! Christmas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s been wonderful seeing all the<br> Servants in such high spirits.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Is that what you call it? It all seems like a bunch of idle frivolity to me. Hmph, some heroes this lot turned out to be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a little hard to take you seriouslywhile you&#39;re holding that cake, Director.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Everyone knows a commander&#39;s penchant for tea or coffee has nothing to do with their ability to lead. Why should cake be any different?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Nom nom) All that aside, Director</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Boudica, my apologies for interrupting, but would you mind not being so quick to dole out excess calories to our resident Master!?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh, sorry. [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] just looked like [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] wanted<br> it so badly. I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Anyway, I think it&#39;s great that everyone&#39;s excited about the holidays, but there is something I found odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Odd, you say?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have a Santa.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And by Santa, I assume you mean one of the numerous Santa Servants we&#39;ve had over the years?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Numerous Santas? Oh dammit.<br> My mustache just lost all its luster.)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (That&#39;s a sign of A-rank danger if ever I saw one. I&#39;d best live up to that Phoenix nickname and fly the coop while I can.)</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Usually, by this point, we&#39;d have a new Santa saving up magical energy for presents...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...or the Santa from last year would already be on the lookout for a new one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I haven&#39;t seen the kid Servants anywhere either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;veseen Nursery Rhyme or her friends either.</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1ADa Vinci:</strong><br> Hey guys!

Then what about those Christmasy bells on your nursing kit?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Oh... When did those get there?<br> I didn&#39;t even notice.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> My point is, if they&#39;re there now,<br> there&#39;s gotta be a reason for it.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Regardless, whether you accept the truth about your Santa status or not...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> ...Santa Island is still overrun with Servants who all claim to be the one true Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> So as long as you have those Santaesque bells,<br> you are going to end up a target.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Oh? Well, if Santa Claus wants to stop giving children cavities in order to come after me...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...I would be more than happy to face him and bring him to account for his crimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hoo boy...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are we going to do about this, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure how we can get on the same page about Santa Claus when her conception of him is so different from ours...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> For now, I don&#39;t want to do anything that might demotivate her if we don&#39;t have to, so let&#39;s see how this plays out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ve figured out where<br> the next group of Servants is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like they&#39;re already fighting, so you&#39;d better hurry if you want to stop them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, Nightingale!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Very well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to see we both wish to see a swift end<br> to meaningless conflict.

I&#39;m begging you here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Forget what ever happened?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Exactly! Thanks for understanding, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Phew. Thanks for snapping us out of that.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> Why in the world was I set on becoming Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> You were sick. Confused. Not in your right minds.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> You were all suffering from...let&#39;s call it<br> \u201CSanta Claus Syndrome\u201D for the time being.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, but how did that happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m pretty sure I was cooking before this all went down, but that&#39;s all I know.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Me too. Though I also get the feeling that someone<br> told me I was going to become Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> Same.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> Oh, I just remembered something else. I also heard a jingling sound, just like the one coming from those.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean these bells?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I remember someone said something like:</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u201CYou can be Santa too!\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Once the bells started ringing,<br> I gradually lost consciousness...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...and the next thing I knew, I was Santa.<br> Well, trying to become Santa, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That sounds like something out of a horror movie.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Indeed, what a horrifying scenario.<br> I didn&#39;t know Santa was contagious...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just to be sure, you didn&#39;t do this, right, Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I did not.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That said...I also don&#39;t remember when or how I acquired this new outfit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I think I may have been talking to someone right beforehand, but I don&#39;t know who it could have been.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> What about you? What are you three doing here?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> We came to tour Santa Island!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah! There were some posters on the wall that said, \u201CYou can be Santa too!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I found the posters in question. It wasn&#39;t hard; whoever put them up wasn&#39;t shy about using any available surface.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Now I remember.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I saw that same Santa slogan, got a bad feeling about it, and promptly chose to ignore it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s when it happened.<br> Somebody came up to me and said...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> \u201CHow could you just ignore it? That&#39;s so mean!\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> And you know the rest.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Right. I remember they sounded kind of...girlish and not girlish at the same time?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> They had a cute voice.<br> At least, I think they did...</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> I can say this much for sure:<br> whoever did this was not a child.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> I also take issue with Boudica&#39;s use of \u201Ccute.\u201D</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> This person&#39;s voice was cute, yes, but I feel like there was also something distinctly...uncute about it.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Aww, come on! It was totally cute!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not sure what to make of it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I think it did sound cute, but it also sounded like the voice of a born troublemaker.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (What is this? Ethereal profiling?)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> What about you, um, Nightingale?<br> Do you still insist you&#39;re not Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Obviously.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Santa is a demon who goes around giving out candy in the dead of night. He is the enemy of children and dentists everywhere.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> That&#39;s so far off the mark I don&#39;t<br> even know where to begin!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Santa Claus isn&#39;t a demon at all! He&#39;s...um...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Reindeer! How would you describe Santa?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to put into words...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;d say Santa gives people hopes and dreams?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It IS hard to put into words, isn&#39;t it?<br> In the end, it all comes down to feeling!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yeah. It&#39;s like how we just know when we have the perfect chance to kill somebody.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We&#39;d guess any Assassin probably<br> knows what that&#39;s like.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That sounds like the unconscious feeling I get when I can just tell my next arrow is going to hit its target.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I know you must be Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But you still can&#39;t accept who you are.<br> That&#39;s so sad!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Yes, it is. If you ask me, being Santa Claus is the greatest job in the world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Trust me! Getting to be Santa is a biiig honor and you should be proud!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Yay, presents\u266A<br> We wonder what we&#39;re gonna get this year\u266A</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...What is it you three want for Christmas?<br> Is it sweets?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Sweets would be great, of course, but really,<br> we&#39;d be happy with anything.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> After all, presents are the stuff of love,<br> hopes, and dreams!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Love, hopes, and dreams, huh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Those are all very important. But presents are supposed to be strictly material things, correct?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You&#39;re not wrong. Kids do love getting practical gifts.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a conundrum every parental<br> figure has to deal with.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You think? I&#39;ve always believed it&#39;s the thought that counts when it comes to gifts.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> That holds true whether those thoughts are affectionate or spiteful.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> I do not think I want to imagine<br> a present given out of spite.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So what you&#39;re saying is, there&#39;s more to the Santa Claus class than going around giving candy to children.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. A lot more.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Wait a second. Are you uncomfortable around kids?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Are you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...A moment, please.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I assure you, I do not dislike or otherwise shun children. I have no negative feelings whatsoever toward them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> However... Um...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I get it. Some feelings, you just can&#39;t put into words.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Anyway, now that we&#39;ve snapped out of it, we should really get back and start getting ready for Christmas.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Sounds good to me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> How about you three? You can stay and continue your tour if you want, but it could get a little dangerous.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We wanna go home too!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I agree. Every child has the right to wait patiently for presents, whether they&#39;re naughty or nice.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> I was hoping to find Santa Island Mask here, since this place is called Santa Island and all...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> But I guess going back home works too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Hey, if you two run into a man with a mask, please tell him I&#39;m doing well!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t believe I&#39;m the next Santa Claus\u2013or at least, I don&#39;t think so\u2013but all right, I will.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Okay Master, now that we&#39;ve successfully eradicated the disease here, let&#39;s go look for the next group of patients.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh... You mean with that umbrella?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Yes, why not? If you like, I would be glad to transport you on my umbrella.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Just make sure you hold on to me tight.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh! Wait, Florence.<br> There&#39;s one last thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> \u201CFlorence\u201D?<br> Very well. What is it?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Would you be so kind as to tell me how you feel about children some time?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I am a hero of children everywhere, after all!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hey, Jeanne? Are you sure she&#39;s this year&#39;s Santa?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> As the last-last-last Santa Claus myself, I can spot another Santa with one-hundred-percent certainty!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> So I can tell you for sure that Nightingale is this year&#39;s Santa!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Looks like she still hasn&#39;t come to terms with it, though.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> Maybe not, but it also seems that your words had an effect on her.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t know about that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> She&#39;s a smart lady. I&#39;m sure she would&#39;ve figured it out on her own at some point.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong><br> Ooh! That&#39;s the Santa who came before me!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Followed closely by a war elephant...</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong><br> If I did not know better,<br> I would have thought I was at a zoo.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (No kidding.

Red or golden?)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve made up my mind!<br> I&#39;m gonna root for A\u015Bvatth\u0101man!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll root for this new Santa!<br> Not for any particular reason, mind you.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Aw man, which one should I root for?<br> They&#39;re both really awesome...</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> ...but I think I&#39;ve got to go with A\u015Bvatth\u0101man!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> (Especially since her umbrella&#39;s actually a big syringe!<br> No way would I want her sticking me with that!)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hmm. Unexpected intruders though you may be, it seems we are obligated to welcome you as a fellow Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Then you all claim to be Santa Claus as well?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Absolutely! We are all Santa Claus here!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> We will grow the economy by delivering hopes and dreams, thereby helping people around the world to lead full and happy lives!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That sounds great in theory, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what&#39;s that giant pile of QP behind you for?</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It&#39;s all part of our stimulus plan.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> What was it he called this again?<br> ...Oh, right.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I think I heard him talking to himself about this gig being his ticket to easy money?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll thank you to keep that bit to yourself!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> It&#39;s too soon for me to tell whether your actions are right or wrong...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...but I do get the sense that your interpretation of Santa Claus is overly focused on the economic aspects.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Then it would seem we each walk very different paths, despite both of us being Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Speaking of which, am I right to assume that you are indeed Santa Claus yourself?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Well...<br> You might be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Perhaps I am the sort of Santa Claus you describe.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> My job is also to deliver hopes and dreams\u2013things that we need to ensure tomorrow will be better than today.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Perhaps you know what I mean, Master? Surely you&#39;ve heard me say the word dozens of times by now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you talking about health?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you mean health?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Health.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> If I am truly Santa Claus,<br> then health is the only gift I will give.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn, that&#39;s a good motive...<br> Now I feel bad about mine.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Me too.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Santa Claus as the protector of health!<br> What a wonderful idea!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I agree.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Specifically, I&#39;m planning to give out medicine instead of candy.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAll:</strong><br> Wait, what?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Medicine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry.<br> This medicine will still taste perfectly sweet!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Who cares!?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> I-I take it all back! That&#39;s a terrible idea! Nobody would ever dream about getting medicine for a present!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter how sweet it tastes!<br> Medicine and candy are completely different things!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Really?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Is that true?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> Unfortunately...<br> I&#39;m afraid I have to agree with them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Do you think so too, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a real conundrum for sure, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, probably most kids would rather get candy, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Ah yes, the classic Santa quandary. Should a present be what the recipient wants, or something the recipient needs?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Truly a dilemma for the ages.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And you mean to tackle it head-on, do you? Hmm.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I applaud your bravery, Nightingale. The way of the Santa Claus you have chosen may be the most difficult there is.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Does that mean you think my notions<br> about gift-giving are mistaken?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter what I think.<br> Our battle will decide who&#39;s right and wrong.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Go on, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man!<br> Take up your arms!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Uh, okay. I guess Santa Clause can&#39;t<br> back down from a fight, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Something tells me he doesn&#39;t really know what Santa Claus is about, either...)</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Very well, Mr. Caesar.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> It seems you know what lies<br> beyond the way of the Santa.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So if fighting this battle will allow me to learn that as well...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...then I am happy to accept, one Santa Claus to another!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...So, which one do we root for now?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> G-good luck, you two! May the best Santa win!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Medicine or candy... Medicine or candy... She did say the medicine would be sweet... Oh, which one&#39;s the right choice?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong><br> Argh, I can&#39;t make up my mind!<br> Why do I always get stuck with the hard decisions!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Aw crap! I ran outta Santa Power!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...Wait. Why&#39;d I wanna be Santa again?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I think that takes us more into existential questions than we really have time for...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s easy enough, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It&#39;s because I was using my own Santa Power to...encourage you towards that end.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So you were using me? Huh!?<br> Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> But think back on your experiences, and be honest:<br> Didn&#39;t you enjoy being Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Hell no I...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> You know what? I did!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Being Santa was a ton of fun!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> I especially liked how the audience got all excited whenever I transformed, though I still don&#39;t know why!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, there ain&#39;t a red-blooded male around who hasn&#39;t dreamed about bein&#39; a transformin&#39; superhero at least once.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Huh? What about my Golden Huge Bear armor?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That is a thing, but everyone knows the big mecha is second place compared to bein&#39; able to TRANSFORM!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I can technically transform, but it&#39;s not anywhere near as cool as when you do it.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself, Fuuma Kotarou.<br> We&#39;re still us, no matter what we look like.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So be proud of what you got, dammit!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> O-okay!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> So what do you transform into, anyway?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> A grotesque, red-skinned monster about two-hundred and sixteen centimeters tall.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> I can still think when I&#39;m in that form, but I can&#39;t pull my punches anymore since I&#39;m basically half-mad.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s no problem. There were guys with transformations like that back in my day, too!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> (\u201CNo problem\u201D my ass. If Raikou ever catches Kotarou like that, his head&#39;ll be on the floor faster than you can say \u201Cgolden\u201D...)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Well, Nightingale? Did you learn anything from our little t\xEAte-\xE0-t\xEAte?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...No. If anything, I feel like I now<br> understand Santa Claus less than ever.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Other Santas provide children with hopes,<br> dreams, candy, and gifts.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But if I were Santa Claus,<br> the only thing I would offer is medicine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I have no idea what the right answer is. I can&#39;t even see a way for me to figure out what it could be.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Ah, my dear Nightingale. It seems there is one thing you still have yet to realize.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say you come across two patients. One is suffering from external injuries, the other from pneumonia.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> What would you do?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Well, first I&#39;d determine which patient is in greater need of medical assistance...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Then I would stitch up the trauma victim&#39;s wounds or administer medicine as needed...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> There you go.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Just as no two patients have the same needs,<br> no two children have the same wants.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> As long as you understand that, I have no doubt you will go on to be an excellent Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> Does that mean the person who made us all Santas isn&#39;t this year&#39;s Santa?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> No, they are not. Though they do excel at enticing others towards Santadom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hold up. There&#39;s a person turning people into Santas?</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Indeed there is.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I was under the impression that Ms. Nightingale had met with the same misfortune as us, but perhaps I was mistaken?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...Yes, you were.<br> I don&#39;t recall ever meeting anyone like that.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t even remember when or how I became Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So who is this person you&#39;re talking about, Caesar?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hahaha, surely you can think of any number of individuals at Chaldea who could be responsible for a mishap like this.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...A great number, come to think of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin making up a list of suspects...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...I suspect you may already have a firm image of this latest caper&#39;s culprit in your head, Master.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Picture someone who loves festivals and parties... Someone who has yet to show their face in all this commotion.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Add a few more conditions to narrow it down further, and I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll soon see what&#39;s really going on here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> All right, everyone, if you&#39;re still looking for the perfect present, the Caesar Company will be happy to assist.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> And if that perfect present should be for the lad(ies) in your life, Cleopatra will get you fixed up in no time!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> By the way, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you guys for a while now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong><br> What is it?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong><br> You know my name?

All this time, we thought<br> A\u015Bvatth\u0101 stood for something really cool!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Yeah...

Then shall I skip over its summary?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d appreciate that, thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we go over it just to be sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Very well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Then as you&#39;ll recall, Scrooge has three fateful encounters that inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Of course. It is a fairly old story, after all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Very well then, here&#39;s the short and simple version.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Ebenezer Scrooge, a rich and notoriously miserly old merchant, is visited by three spirits on Christmas Eve:</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> They show him how he became so coldhearted in his past, the effects his cruel policies are having on his clerk&#39;s family in the present...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...and how the path he is on now will lead to him dying alone and unloved in the future.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> You remember this parrot, don&#39;t you?<br> This is where you were born.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> That lonesome boy reading a book by<br> the low fire over there is you.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> Of course, at this point in your life,<br> you still had hopes and dreams.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> But over time...</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> ...you changed. Oh, how you changed.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> You made a big show about how you were no longer a child, and parted ways with the woman you loved.</p><p><strong>Past:</strong><br> That choice, Scrooge, has made you who you are now.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> Your greed and cunning made you rich, but at the expense of everyone around you.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> Your clerk is just barely scraping by thanks to your refusal to pay him a living wage.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> He can&#39;t even afford treatment for his third son,<br> Tiny Tim. But that is of little matter to you, hm?</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> If they&#39;re going to die, they had better do it,<br> and ease the burden of surplus population.</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what you told those guys who came asking you for donations to help feed poor, hungry children?</p><p><strong>Present:</strong><br> Well, Uncle Scrooge?</p><p><strong>Future:</strong><br> (This ghost remains silent, yet its intent is clear.<br> Behold your future, Scrooge.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong><br> (It sneers as if to say you have no one to love,<br> and no one who loves you.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong><br> (Its stare causes you pain and suffering, just as you have spent your life causing pain and suffering.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong><br> (It merely watches, idly, as your body is stripped of its clothing, leaving you in nothing more than threadbare underwear.)</p><p><strong>Future:</strong><br> (Beneath its gaze, you realize you leave nothing behind but a cold, rotting corpse.)</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> And so, Scrooge&#39;s three fateful encounters inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Today, it&#39;s believed that the publication<br> of \u201CA Christmas Carol\u201D in 1843...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...directly led to the popularization of Christmas celebrations in England as we know them today.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> The day of the Nativity is a very important one,<br> both for soldiers and for myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I might have even celebrated it traditionally when I was still a child.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But that all went away once<br> I began living my adult life.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Truthfully, my childhood memories are so hazy that I just can&#39;t be sure if I celebrated it or not.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> The idea of an old man who embodies the holiday, whether you know him as Santa Claus or Father Christmas, hadn&#39;t yet been established in my time.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So even though I have lived in two very different times that share Christmas as a major event...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...I still understand neither<br> Christmas nor Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> At least, that&#39;s how it seems to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t change the fact that you ARE Santa Claus now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> If you say so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay.

But of course, that also means we need to make sure you&#39;re up to it.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> Agreed.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> After all, you can&#39;t have a Santa<br> Claus without a Santa Claus arbiter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-is that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A rose Black Key!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Good to see you again, everyone.

A lineup like that<br> would be much too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I thought we should keep those two in a separate block.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What would that be? Some kind of fistfighting world championship?</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Hahaha, a championship like that is the last place I&#39;d ever want to fight. Between punches, takedowns, submission holds, and flying kicks, they&#39;d have every approach covered perfectly.</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> At any rate, we are the ones to whom you&#39;ll need to prove your dedication.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Now...show us how much you&#39;re willing<br> to fight for your Santa Clausdom!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t know why you&#39;re wearing that mask, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but I&#39;ll be glad to face you all the same!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> Please stick to Santa Island Mask here,<br> if you don&#39;t mind!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> This is quite a surprise.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I see you&#39;re still as strong as ever,<br> even with a new Archer Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> And above all...</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> ...I hear your dedication to being<br> Santa Claus loud and clear.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> To be honest...I still don&#39;t feel confident that I can be a Santa Claus beloved by all, but\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see. So that is what has been plaguing you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Then hear me, the first Santa Claus of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Pay it no mind.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> Dreams, hope, love...

Now that I&#39;ve won this battle,<br> does that mean I&#39;m officially Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong><br> Not just yet, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong><br> Astolfo still has the last key.<br> Er, the last bell, I mean.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> Once you obtain that bell for yourself...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> ...then you can proudly declare that you are this year&#39;s Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> Make sure you do your best. I know I certainly did.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be rooting for you on<br> Jeanne Alter Santa Lily&#39;s behalf.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t know what connection you have<br> to Santa Claus, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> My name is Santa Island Mask.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...At any rate, I appreciate your support.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but would<br> you mind ringing those bells for me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> You mean like this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Perfect. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve calibrated the sensors, I can see there&#39;s an almost identical ringing sound not too far from there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which means\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So that&#39;s where we&#39;ll find Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Come then, Master, let&#39;s be on our way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right!

Is that you!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Master!? Where is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]?<br> What page is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] on?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh Stolfo. I see your language<br> function is still pretty glitchy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey hey.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> And...Huh? Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you say you didn&#39;t wanna be Santa?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Yes, I did.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> However...I see now that I was<br> unknowingly being selfish.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm. I see.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But, um, didn&#39;t you also say that if you did become Santa Claus, you&#39;d be handing out\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Medicine? That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> It will taste sweet and delicious, just like candy...<br> but it will still be medicine through and through.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aw come on, you can&#39;t give away medicine as a present!<br> That&#39;s just so...boring!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Yes, I agree.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I originally declined<br> the offer to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But I realized something thanks to my experiences here on Santa Island.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with being boring.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? Come on, you can&#39;t be serious.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But I am. For the medicine I give away will be an expression of my love.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I will of course be sad if anyone chooses to refuse it, but I will not force it upon them if they don&#39;t want it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Whatever the children do with<br> my gifts is entirely up to them.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But I thought you didn&#39;t even like children.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale doesn&#39;t have anything against kids.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> How can I put this...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I admit that I don&#39;t always know how to behave around children, but that isn&#39;t because I dislike them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I was just...afraid of them. You see, in my time,<br> children frequently died much too young.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> That&#39;s true in pretty much any time.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s why those who are strong enough to fight will always have a duty to keep children safe.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m scared of children.<br> They&#39;re so small, and weak, and fragile.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I want to give them medicine. I want them to be hale and hearty, so that they no longer have to fear the specter of death.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That way...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I might one day be able to give a gift...<br> to the girl I never got to be.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hmm... I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re talking about at all, but I can still tell you&#39;re really passionate about it!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> But I dunno, I still feel like something&#39;s missing!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Oh, give it up already, Stolfo.<br> Or if you can&#39;t do that, why not just fight her now?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Yeah, good idea!<br> Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa (Archer):</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo (Saber):</strong><br> But I&#39;m gonna lose!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ughhh.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Waaah! Okay, fine!<br> I&#39;m just gonna pull out ALL the stops then!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Astolfo is gathering up magical energy!<br> It looks like\u2013</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> All I gotta do is ring this bell, and I&#39;ll get both stronger AND more Santa...um...Santay! Maybe!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So this is the power of the true Santa bell. Impressive. All my bell does is make a little jingling sound.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how this works either, but I do know that this bell is amaaazing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You know, there&#39;s something about that bell...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it just me, or does that bell look kind of familiar?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> No matter. I cannot afford to lose this fight!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Now that I have decided to be Santa Claus,<br> I refuse to turn away from my chosen path!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Um... I guess I don&#39;t need to be here anymore, so...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aw come on, Mante, I was counting on you to join me!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ughhh! Okay, okay!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> It&#39;s my duty to help my fellow paladins,<br> and I can&#39;t go back on that now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Sorry about this, Master!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Then this is it. The final battle to determine who will be the true Santa!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You or me, Santa baby! Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Noooooo! I loooooost!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> (Sigh) What a surprise.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hey! What do you mean, \u201Cwhat a surprise\u201D!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ...Huh? I feel like...I&#39;m getting weaker...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> I&#39;m back to normal again!?<br> Why? How? WHYYY!? HOOOOOOW!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Hmm. I wonder...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Maybe it was that bell that turned you from a Rider into a Saber, Stolfo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Really? Then, it wasn&#39;t because the heavens saw how hard I&#39;ve been working and decided to grant my wish?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pretty sure that wasn&#39;t it.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take a closer look.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Ah.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aaaaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. It&#39;s a Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now it all makes sense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that bell gathering magical energy was actually a just Holy Grail disguised as a bell!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Then, we were spending precious magical energy resources just so someone could pretend to be Santa Claus!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;m not recording anything in our archives about this mess. If word got out, Chaldea&#39;s reputation would be ruined!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what was going on. I turned into a Saber &#39;cause I&#39;m always going around wishing I could be one!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> (Man, I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t wish for something crass, like being a billionaire!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Now I see.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> So Stolfo lost his Saber powers when Nightingale officially became the bell&#39;s new owner!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Aw man. I guess life just never goes how you want!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Are you sure, Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Bwa!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> No way. I&#39;m a Saber again!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> H-hold on a minute!<br> Did you just use the Holy Grail&#39;s power!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Yes, I did. Though only enough to<br> change Astolfo&#39;s Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Any Holy Grails we find are supposed to be turned over to Chaldea anyway.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> And above all, I didn&#39;t gather this Santa Power myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I may have decided to be Santa Claus...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...but I have no intention of using this power to jump straight to the conclusion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Now that I have made my decision, I&#39;m going to see it through to the end fair and square.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Wow, so mature...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> No wonder she was the world&#39;s greatest nurse...<br> I&#39;ve never seen anyone else with so much willpower.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly happy to continue using this replica.<br> Besides, I&#39;ve grown rather fond of its timbre.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> (Sniff) Thanks, Nightingale! You&#39;re the best!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> (Sigh) I guess all I did was<br> mess everything up again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> If it weren&#39;t for you, I don&#39;t think I would have ever decided to be Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> If not for you, I would never have come to Santa Island or ever looked back on who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So...thank you.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Whoooa! I can&#39;t believe you just blushed!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> You&#39;re so cute!!!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Cute!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Wow... That blush could stop a<br> thousand ships in their tracks...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She really is cute when she blushes, isn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So, Master. I apologize for asking<br> this on such short notice...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...but would it be okay if I continued my Santa Claus training for a while longer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget about me! If there&#39;s anything I can do to help with your training, just say the word!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m the greatest Saber who ever lived,<br> so I&#39;m sure I can be of service!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t get carried away this time, Stolfo.<br> Remember, you&#39;re only a Saber now thanks to her.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong><br> In the meantime, I&#39;d be glad to help out too!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not gonna do shit, but I did bring along a bunch of goody-goodies who wanna help.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong><br> Seriously, though. Don&#39;t expect me to help.<br> &#39;Cause I won&#39;t. No freakin&#39; way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She&#39;s totally going to help out...)</p><hr><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong><br> As Chaldea&#39;s original Santa,<br> I am honor bound to aid my successor.</p><p><strong>Santa Island Mask:</strong><br> I trust my answer goes without saying?<br> Welcome, new Santa Claus. I&#39;m glad to have you.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> We&#39;ll help too, of course.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:</strong><br> \xA1S\xED!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><br> SANTA...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong><br> And so will Darius III.<br> At least, I think that&#39;s what he&#39;s saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be glad to help from<br> Chaldea in any way I can, too!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Thank you, everyone. In that case, there&#39;s one favor I&#39;d like to ask of all of you.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAll:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I&#39;m told it&#39;s traditional to have a party for Christmas, so I was hoping you could all help me hold one.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Would...that be okay?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAll:</strong><br> Absolutely!</p><h2 id="epilogue-to-you-who-was-left-behind" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-to-you-who-was-left-behind" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: To You, Who Was Left Behind</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t remember when I lost my sight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I told myself it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but it turned out to be just as limiting as you&#39;d expect.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But even with my sight gone,<br> my body continued to breathe.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Spring turned to summer, summer turned to autumn, and before I knew it, winter had arrived.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can hear children buzzing with excitement,<br> \u201CChristmas\u201D constantly on the tips of their tongues. I sigh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Christmas used to be just another holiday. Now it&#39;s a great event, with every family holding huge celebrations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wonder if the people I saved got to celebrate Christmas. Did they thank Santa Claus for their new lease on life?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thoughts like that flit in and out of my mind, never staying long enough for me to dwell on them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can tell that my own life<br> will soon be coming to an end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I probably won&#39;t die today, or tomorrow, but I can tell I won&#39;t live to see the next winter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What about regrets?<br> Is there anything I wish I&#39;d done, but didn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I feel like I have many such things...and, simultaneously, that I did everything I could ever have wanted to do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Regret and contentment seem like two sides of the same coin. I can&#39;t tell which of them I ought to feel.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As I close my eyes and think about it further, I feel my body as it&#39;s gradually wrapped by something warm and cozy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Is this a dream? Am I dreaming?</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> It&#39;s Christmas, Florence.<br> Today is Christmas.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> You might not care about it anymore<br> now that you&#39;re a grown-up...</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> ...but you&#39;d still be doing her a terrible disservice if you didn&#39;t celebrate it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Who are you, little girl?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And who exactly would I be doing a disservice?</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> You, of course.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> You&#39;re a wonderful person, Florence.<br> And you accomplished some amazing things.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> I doubt there&#39;s a person anywhere in the world who doesn&#39;t hold your name in the highest regard.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> But I also doubt that means anything to you.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> This is exactly why nobody has<br> noticed that poor little child!</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> Do you know how painful it is to be forgotten?</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong><br> I bet you have no idea what it&#39;s li\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No, Nursery Rhyme. I do know what it&#39;s like.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I finally found the courage to face you. You&#39;ve been admonishing me for a long time now, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, I have.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;m a hero of children everywhere.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> So I have no mercy for anyone who mistreats children.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Not even if that child\u2013</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Is myself.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Then I suppose that makes me<br> Scrooge from \u201CA Christmas Carol.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> He was miserly, while I had other<br> goals I cared about more.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> But whatever our excuses, the result was the same. He mistreated others&#39; children, while I mistreated myself.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. But as long as you understand that now, that&#39;s enough for me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Although, in that case...</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> Does this mean you, Astolfo, and Master were my three Christmas spirits?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh my. I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way, but I love it! What a wonderful interpretation!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Though of course, I doubt Astolfo and Master had any idea of the roles they were playing.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;m the only one who was consciously testing you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I would never dream of saying<br> anything to you as your usual self.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I can&#39;t even count how many lives<br> you must have saved, after all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But once I knew you were going to be Santa Claus...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...I thought it was time you finally<br> faced who you were as a child.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I tormented you by showing you this dream over and over.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, Florence.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite all right.<br> In fact, I&#39;m grateful to you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be here now if it wasn&#39;t for you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale Santa:</strong><br> So thank you, White Knight,<br> hero of children everywhere.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome, Ms. Nightingale!
