Good timing to have tea with everyone.</p><hr><p>\u201CHeeey, Sakura, Tohsaka\uFF5E I&#39;m making tea\uFF5E\u201D</p><hr><p>I call out towards their rooms as I head to the living room.</p><p>I&#39;ll set up for tea with Saber first.</p><hr><p>And...</p><hr><p>\u201CWelcome home. I have already been served tea.\u201D</p><hr><p>Bazett calmly places a teacup onto the table.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015, wha...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWHA\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015TTTT......!!!!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\uFF08...Shirou. If I may ask, why is she here? Do you have some kind of personal relationship?\uFF09\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\uFF08...No, that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to ask. This should be our first time meeting, but... somehow, she doesn&#39;t feel like a stranger...\uFF09\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura-san. May I have another cup of tea?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CY-Yes! I-I&#39;ll prepare it right away...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Well then, an introduction is in order.</p><p>I am Bazett Fraga McRemitz. I was a member of the Mage&#39;s Association, but am now a freelance magus.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, nice to meet you. I&#39;m Emiya Shirou, and this is Saber.</p><p>...Um, though I&#39;m not a member of anything like that...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am aware that you are independent.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, that&#39;s right. If I had to guess, the owner of this estate... would be you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell said. That is correct, magus.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s promising. If Saber gives me her approval, then my perception appears to have been correct.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThere is no mistake.</p><p>Shirou is the head of this household. I would prefer it no other way.\u201D</p><hr><p>Bazett-san is having a peaceful conversation with Saber.</p><p>...But somehow, the image I had of her was more... frightening...?</p><hr><p>\u201CAah, thank you.</p><p>So Bazett-san, what&#39;s your business here today?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CCould you wait just a moment, Miss McRemitz?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya-kun, this way.\u201D</p><hr><p>My arm is being pulled before I have a chance to argue.</p><p>Catching onto Tohsaka&#39;s intent, I leave my seat without objecting.</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry, I have to leave for a bit.</p><p>Saber, keep Bazett-san company.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, what&#39;s this about, Tohsaka?</p><p>...I have a vague idea, but is this a risky situation?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRisky, you say? You don&#39;t get it.</p><p>I mean, isn&#39;t she a Sealing Designated Enforcer!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAt the Mage&#39;s Association they even say that number one is Gazamy the Wraith, number two are Sealing Designations, and number three are Enforcers in terms of disaster ranking!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGet it!? If that person feels like it, ten minutes from now we&#39;ll have been massacred, and as a bonus we&#39;ll be squished enough to be stuffed into a punching bag!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I really don&#39;t get your reasoning.</p><p>But, is she that dangerous? Wasn&#39;t she smiling normally?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLies. In what way does she look like that to you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... in this way?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re joking! In my case, I could only see it this way!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUgh... No, even so, saying we&#39;ll be massacred is...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CShe&#39;d do it. Sealing Designated Enforcers are beyond our understanding.</p><p>Look, see for yourself.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHere, your tea...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you. Naturally, I refuse to eat or drink in enemy territory. However, this is not enemy territory.</p><p>So, as proof of that\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEek, in one gulp...!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CU-Um, Did it not suit your tastes!?</p><p>B-Before you get mad, I&#39;m sorry!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? No, it was tea.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh...? Um, that&#39;s not what I mean... It didn&#39;t taste good, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? Tea neither tastes good nor bad, don&#39;t you agree?</p><p>When it comes to the flavor of tea, then isn&#39;t it, without mistake, tea itself?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHoho. So that&#39;s how you see it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSee? That&#39;s her true nature.</p><p>Everything is just zeros and ones to an Enforcer!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor example, meals aren&#39;t delicious or awful.</p><p>Taste is secondary. She&#39;s a killing machine that only cares whether she finishes eating in five minutes or thirty!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, whatever. I only got that she&#39;s the polar opposite of Saber.\u201D</p><hr><p>And also, I understood that Tohsaka dislikes Bazett-san... No, rather than dislike, is it just that she doesn&#39;t respect her...?</p><p>\u201CIf that&#39;s the case, what are you saying we do?</p><p>Maybe what you wanted to say is that she&#39;s like a human bomb, so try your best not to set her off?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, but...... huh?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI wonder why she came here in the first place...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Maybe we shouldn&#39;t continue without that cleared up.</p><p>Alright. Tohsaka, ask Rider for help. For a <em>cool</em> person like that, we&#39;ll call on the coolest person in the house.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;d have done that already if I could.</p><p>Rider&#39;s at her part-time job at the antique shop. She won&#39;t be back until 5 pm.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGeh... So there&#39;s no choice but to somehow handle this on our own...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CExactly.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;ll work out on way or another, won&#39;t it? For some reason she seems to trust you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CW-Why!?</p><p>I don&#39;t remember doing anything to cause that!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell I don&#39;t know. But she wouldn&#39;t have come all this way here otherwise. Earlier, she even insisted that she couldn&#39;t speak until you returned.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CPerhaps, she thinks of you as a little brother?</p><p>From the viewpoint of someone proper like that, you might seem like a rambunctious younger brother-type.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;m starting to understand less and less... I&#39;ve barely even spoken to this person.</p><p>What about you, Tohsaka?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI suppose this is the second time for Sakura and myself.</p><p>She came to the Tohsaka and Matou households to say she&#39;d be living in Fuyuki City for a while, but had no interest in fighting over territory.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C......Is that how magi greet each other?</p><p>But anyway, I wonder why she would come here now? It could be related to my old man.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI guess there&#39;s no choice but to speak with her.</p><p>The truth is that I want to run away, but Sakura and I will support you from the other side of the living room.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Pray that somehow she leaves peacefully without having her fuse lit, Emiya-kun.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn other words, your Mystic Code reacts not to &quot;Noble Phantasms,&quot; but to the opponent&#39;s &quot;trump card.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. I can use it at my own discretion even if the opponent isn&#39;t resisting, but in that case, Fragarach&#39;s special ability won&#39;t activate. It will be treated as simply a C or D rank Noble Phantasm.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. If the situation arises where you are cornered alone with an opponent, that is a reason to train yourself. An inferior underlying ability, that is how a prized sword of legend falls to an insignificant one.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIncidentally...</p><p>Can a Noble Phantasm be intercepted if it is used at point-blank range?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COf course. That&#39;s what hand-to-hand combat is for.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFragarach is a projectile, but even if not thrown, I would surely match any short range attack with my fist. No, even if I were to be caught, <em>my attack will strike first</em>.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>What&#39;s this? An incredible bloodlust suddenly filled the air.</p><p>Saber and Bazett continue to sit politely as sparks scatter.</p><hr><p>\u201CS-Senpaa\uFF5Eiiii...!</p><p>It-It&#39;s no use, I can&#39;t do anythiiing!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Sorry to keep you waiting, Sakura. I&#39;ll take it from here, just watch from as far away as possible.\u201D</p><hr><p>Or should I say, prepare for the worst. Even if it&#39;s by herself, I want Sakura to survive.</p><hr><p>\u201CAhem. Um... I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting.</p><p>So, what&#39;s your business today?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUhm... hello?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Bazett-san?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s... My thoughts have been restless for a little while now, but the cause is your voice, Shirou-kun.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CReally now, I&#39;m even making a fool out of myself.</p><p>My usual insensitivity had left me. It&#39;s fine to call me &quot;Bazett&quot; without the honorific.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh!?\u201D</p><hr><p>A shocking new fact has just been revealed!</p><p>I was on a first-name basis with Miss Bazett!</p><hr><p>\u201CE\uFF5Emi\uFF5Eya-kuun? Didn&#39;t you even just say this was your first time meeting Bazett-san\uFF5E\uFF5E?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFufufu. Her &quot;Usual&quot;* sensitivity, was it? That sounds a bit like a close relationship, doesn&#39;t it, Senpai?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWait, don&#39;t accuse me unfairly!</p><p>This <em>really</em> is the first time I&#39;ve met Bazett...-san! Y-You there, don&#39;t make this even worse!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... I-I see.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhem... Just now was a misunderstanding. Forget about it.</p><p>Instead, from now on there won&#39;t be an issue just calling me &quot;Bazett.&quot; It shall be my punishment.\u201D</p><hr><p>The situation continues to deteriorate by the minute.</p><p>The older sister&#39;s trust level, minus 100.</p><p>The younger sister&#39;s condition, plus 100 toward the breaking point.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>...For the time being, I&#39;ll deal with the problem in front of me.</p><p>If I call her &quot;Bazett,&quot; she&#39;ll be more relaxed.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo, once again, let&#39;s start over from the beginning.</p><p>Ba-Baz...ett, what&#39;s your business here?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. In truth, I have two matters I earnestly wish to consult about.</p><p>Because you are suitable, I will be asking for your cooperation.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh, matters to consult...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CW-What about your colleagues in the Mage&#39;s Association?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI no longer have any relation to the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p>The matter this time is ultimately a personal problem... Or rather, it is what&#39;s necessary to establish myself as an individual.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...? Sounds like something important. Fine, I don&#39;t know if I can help, but I&#39;ll listen to your story.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I appreciate it.</p><p>Now then, the first matter is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>A gulp resounds from each person of the Emiya estate.</p><p>Bazett nervously straightens her tie, and...</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015The truth is, I am unemployed.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................Come again?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou don&#39;t understand?</p><p>I have no place of employment. I have no income. I have the desire to work every daaay!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>...What happened to my almost perfect image of the Mage&#39;s Association...? Somehow, this is starting to feel really depressing.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... So in other words, you want references for places to work?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTo put it simply,</p><p>I want suitable advice.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat are you on about? Shouldn&#39;t you just pick up <em>any</em> part-time job, like Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI would have done that already if I could.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut... I&#39;m, that is... The kind of occupation someone like myself is suited for, I don&#39;t even know in the slightest...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Now that you mention it, you&#39;re kinda awkward, aren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Somehow, the atmosphere became friendlier all at once.</p><p>Even Sakura, who had been so afraid before, looks as though she is watching a close friend.</p><hr><p>\u201CUm... hmm, why not something standard like a bodyguard?</p><p>I can give you an introduction if you&#39;re fine with the Fujimura Group.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI decline.</p><p>I looked into it for a few days, but that organization is averse to conflict. It&#39;s full of cowards.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI would do poorly at a place where I couldn&#39;t make use of my skills.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...How about being a teacher at Shirou&#39;s school?</p><p>Couldn&#39;t you teach all kinds of sports?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I&#39;ve also thought about it, but I wouldn&#39;t be good at teaching others... it&#39;s that, my hand comes out before an explanation.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, I agree. There&#39;s no place for a violent teacher nowadays.\u201D</p><hr><p>Well, the cause of all of this is that she wants to use her fists.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, then how about something like a professional boxer!?</p><p>Since it&#39;s Bazett-san, can&#39;t she aim for the world title? As for her gender... because she dresses like a man, she&#39;ll trick them someway or another, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura-san.</p><p>You would like to experience getting blown away that much?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Bazett looks flashy, but is actually quite reserved.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSuprisingly, wouldn&#39;t she make a good librarian? It has physical labor, courtesy is required, and she can read books in her free time.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You&#39;re surprisingly well-informed about Bazett-san, aren&#39;t you, Emiya-kun?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh? Ah, no, I just thought that for some reason... Why is that?\u201D</p><hr><p>Well, let&#39;s set that minor issue aside.</p><p>Wanting to find employment, Bazett&#39;s so-called troubles are normal for a person to have.</p><hr><p>\u201CFirst of all, why are you looking for work?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou&#39;re rich, right?</p><p>I heard something about it, didn&#39;t they say you had three metal suitcases full of cash?\u201D</p><hr><p>I heard the story from Lancer.</p><p>As the enforcement of designation seals is such a big job, the compensation must be absurd.</p><hr><p>\u201C...This and that are different stories.</p><p>Because without employment, I cannot be called a master.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C? What do you mean by that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat I am speaking of, is the relationship between a Master and Servant.</p><p>The Master employs the Servant. Therefore, it is natural that they must prepare all the necessities of life.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA Master must support their Servant.</p><p>I am unemployed, but my Servant should not have to do something like work to cover his own travel expenses.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... I see, so you&#39;re saying the Master provides or the Servant works?</p><p>Then, even having them help with things like housework is out of the question?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COf course. One who serves as a Master must manage their own life.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe only thing to ask of a Servant is the management of oneself to maintain maximum combat power for an emergency. Would not having them work, including household chores, be the sign of a third-rate Master?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSplendid. That&#39;s completely true.</p><p>It seems we will get along, magus. I completely understand why you are relying on Shirou.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...That&#39;s just your own philosophy on Masters.</p><p>But whatever. In the first place, you&#39;re not a Master, are you? You don&#39;t have a Servant, after all.\u201D</p><hr><p>Everyone nods in agreement.</p><hr><p>\u201CYou are mistaken.</p><p>My Servant is just on loan for the time being and the borrower is merely reluctant to return him.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CEh, is that right?</p><p>Then, you and Lancer-san...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThe contract is still intact.</p><p>If only that rotten woman would relinquish the Command Spells this instant, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...How disappointing.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that a cruel thing to say to the one who saved your life, Bazett?</p><p>With that, I am feeling less and less inclined to return him.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C!!?\u201D</p><hr><p>Everyone turns toward the unexpected voice.</p><hr><p>\u201CGood day.</p><p>It seems that you all were having quite an amusing conversation.\u201D</p><hr><p>...A peaceful moment in the early afternoon.</p><p>The chaos continued to increase as yet a third foreigner appeared.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease, don&#39;t mind me and continue with your meeting.</p><p>You were discussing something like taking Bazett to the Employment Service Center?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...The topic isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t have employment, but a consultation on finding the right type of occupation for me.</p><p>Aside from that, Caren. Were you eavesdropping on our conversation?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...It is truly regrettable, but you have misunderstood as I&#39;ve only stated the facts.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou would have self-destructed had I simply left you alone a while longer, but I could not withstand such verbal abuse and my mouth moved on its own.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Seems I don&#39;t have enough discipline,&quot; Caren added.</p><p>After briefly experiencing harmony, the atmosphere of the living room became tense once more.</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................She came.</p><p>The person I least want to run across in this town just came.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s bad, Nee-san... You&#39;re saying some rather harsh things openly.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sparks scatter between Bazett and Caren, whereas behind them, two friendly sisters whisper to each other.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Tohsaka, Sakura, are both of you acquaintances of Caren?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. We came by to greet her when she was appointed as the church&#39;s acting priest.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. Ever since then, we&#39;ve come face to face quite frequently. Well, we had been getting behind on communications with the church, but still...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, I want a regular report every Saturday from now on.</p><p>To ensure that Tohsaka Rin does not neglect her obligations as an administrator of Fuyuki.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAlso, Matou Sakura will attend as much as possible as Tohsaka Rin&#39;s capable collaborator.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Do you have any questions?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I have no objections to the arrangement itself.</p><p>The report is fine. Although, essential parts like Kotomine and the Holy Grail will be completely omitted.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIs that so? However, because verifying the authenticity will take time, I will not concern myself with it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt may only be provisional, but your verbal report will be submitted as truth.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. So you&#39;re giving us a loan?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTo call something of this level a loan... You have quite a strong sense of duty, don&#39;t you, Rin?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015However, isn&#39;t this all truth? If so, there is nothing to lend.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that right, Sakura-san?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CY-Yes... it&#39;s just as Caren-san says.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSee? Even if some details are not reported, these are just facts we are unaware of. There is nothing to be considered false testimony.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right... if we say that the Heaven&#39;s Feel has ended, we would not be lying. I think it&#39;s called... sharing a common secret?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Meaning, we are accomplices.</p><p>You will be sharing the burden of guilt as well, Caren Ortensia.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right. I mean, would you send a report so blatantly full of holes like this? They will not pardon what is lacking, but as things stand now it is no reason to call me back.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CU-um... then, what about you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRest assured, Sakura-san. Though I am merely a temporary representative, I am sure I will be entrusted with this church for some time to come.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hehe. This as well is thanks to you. Something like a living imitation of the Holy Grail, I wonder how many years it will take to verify it&#39;s authenticity.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...What an outrageous brat. In other words, you use Fuyuki City to become a priest and control us through the Church&#39;s authority.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat means the main force of the Church will turn up if someone opposes you even slightly, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI suppose that sort of outcome is possible as well.</p><p>Nevertheless, it will take two years. It will take two years at most to proceed to my next post. Even this is due to the great demand of my rare talents.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see.</p><p>Well then, I will do my best to find your weakness before that time comes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn order to defeat you if talk ever becomes useless.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right\u2015\u2015\u2015We seem to think alike, Rin.</p><p>Please do struggle like a cat to the best of your ability.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Are we done talking?

If you&#39;re caught off-guard, it could be checkmate before you know it.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Yes, but Caren-san truly thinks of us as senpais. I can tell she has good will toward us...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHer &quot;good will&quot; is filled with malice.</p><p>She is the same as that fake priest, don&#39;t be fooled, Sakura.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>...The church&#39;s new priest seems like a terrible villain.</p><p>And, that villain is engaged face-to-face in an argument with Bazett.</p><hr><p>\u201CTo begin with, you were not chosen as a Master, correct?

It&#39;s only appropriate that the Master&#39;s rights are transferred to this place.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThis &quot;transfer&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015wasn&#39;t it done without permission?

Let&#39;s begin the second consultation.</p><p>Here lies the main issue\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Once again, a resounding gulp could be heard from every direction in the Emiya estate.</p><p>Bazett imposingly straightens her tie as though ready to make a decisive announcement, and...</p><hr><p>\u201CAmong food, clothing, and shelter, shelter is missing.</p><p>Frankly speaking, because I have no place to stay, will you rent a room to me?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat,\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201Cin,\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201Cthe,\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CheeEEEEEELL\u2015\u2015\u2015!!!!!?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything to make a fuss about.</p><p>Isn&#39;t this the refuge for Masters I&#39;ve heard about?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CN-No it isn&#39;t\uFF5E! It&#39;s true we still have lots of empty rooms left, but they&#39;re all for men\uFF5E!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I feel the same way. I don&#39;t want to interfere in the lodging matters of others, but the ratio of magi is too high. As an administrator of Fuyuki, I won&#39;t concentrate forces in one location.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh? If that&#39;s the case, Rin or Sakura-san, I wonder if one of you should go back home?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CS-Sakura and I are fine!</p><p>Because we return home every second day, and pay rent and food expenses too!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI will also pay my share of lodging expenses.</p><p>...Let&#39;s see, how about 10,000 yen a night?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CKhh... So that&#39;s your move? This is bad. This offer is too attractive... I almost want to recommend her to my house... wait.

I don&#39;t really mind.</p><p>There are rooms and if even Shirou approves, should we not then provide the basic necessities of life?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...You know, Saber.</p><p>If she lives here, it&#39;s certain that her profession...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. Being Shirou&#39;s bodyguard is suitable for me. He doesn&#39;t seem to have any shortage of conflict.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am against this, Shirou! There is no room for newcomers to intrude in this house!\u201D</p><hr><p>A firestorm sweeps through.</p><p>Even Saber joined the discussion. Bazett&#39;s proposed occupancy is hitting rough weather.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I understand your opinions.</p><p>But the landlord here is Shirou. The decision rests with him. You should also be aware of that, right, Saber?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI am aware that you are independent.</p><hr><p>Ah, that&#39;s right. If I had to guess, the owner of this estate... would be you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell said. That is correct, magus.\u201D*</p><hr><p>\u201CGack... (wobble)\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAah, how could this be?</p><p>If Saber-san, the only one who can win against Bazett in power, accepts her defeat, my Senpais no longer have a chance.\u201D</p><hr><p>Caren is praying in sorrow.</p><p>A &quot;fufufu&quot; escapes her lips, she is actually laughing quite happily.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo way... S-Senpai, what are you going to do...?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s a difficult question.</p><p>Taking Fuji-Nee into consideration, I should refuse. That, and if we lodge any more people the neighbors will start spreading rumors.</p><hr><p>However\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201COh my. You are abandoning someone in need?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGuh.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Now that I think about it...</p><p>It&#39;s true that Bazett has no place to live, she isn&#39;t familiar with the area, and if she doesn&#39;t have a relationship with the Mage&#39;s Association anymore...</p><hr><p>\u201CTime out.

I wonder why the wind has shifted in my favor.</p><p>You seem to be acting as my ally, Caren.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s because I&#39;m always an ally of the weak.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLiar. I&#39;m clearly the weak one here.</p><p>From any point of view, you are the ones attacking me.\u201D</p><hr><p>I sit on the floor grasping my knees while grumbling.</p><p>I&#39;ve been taken advantage of this whole time, she even said that sarcastic remark and then irresponsibly abandoned me.</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, what is it? You both look like you&#39;ve suddenly seen a ghost. Scaring me won&#39;t work anymore. I&#39;ve already been plenty frightened earlier.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Caren. There is something I would like to propose...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLet&#39;s do it. I&#39;ll handle the restraints.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Huh?\u201D</p><hr><p>They communicate something with each other through eye contact.</p><p>I get a bad feeling.

Just graffiti!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Quiet, please.</p><p>Even Bazett is not a demon.

I knew she wouldn&#39;t take it at face value and believe I&#39;d use scissors... huh?</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;<ruby>Answerer<rt>That Which Comes Later Cuts First</rt></ruby>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Wait, what is this human weapon muttering...?</p><hr><p>\u201CGotcha\u2015\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Rock, paper, diiie...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hm. It&#39;s my win, Shirou-kun.</p><p>Because, details aside, you did wait until after I went.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Seems like that&#39;s the case.</p><p>Even though she threw out her hand after mine, she used <em>that</em> to make hers end up going first.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Using any means in order to win. That way of fighting really is like you, Bazett.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBut... I think you should have restrained yourself from yelling &quot;Die&quot; at the end of &quot;rock, paper, scissors.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFu, fufu... More importantly, rock-paper-scissors isn&#39;t that kind of game, you know (faints)\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSorry for the wait!</p><p>Um, huh? Emiya-kun, you&#39;re not sulking or something are you?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I was sulking earlier.</p><p>I&#39;ve pulled myself together now, I&#39;m fine. Don&#39;t worry about me so much, just hurry up and get this over with.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah, I&#39;ll respond to her request.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, Bazett.</p><p>We&#39;ve come to a conclusion, we agree with your proposed stay here. It&#39;s the right thing to do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGeeeh...!</p><p>W-W-W-What the hell, what kind of strategy meeting what thaaat!?\u201D</p><hr><p>She&#39;s gone from calling her &quot;Bazett-san&quot; to just &quot;Bazett.&quot; When Tohsaka doesn&#39;t add the honorific to the end of someone&#39;s name, it means she&#39;s decided to fight them head on.</p><hr><p>\u201CStop right there. That person is seriously a human weapon.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;ll be fine, hear me out to the end.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CBazett.</p><p>You&#39;re a foreigner with no friends to rely on and on top of that, the visa and identification nonsense would make getting a residence impossible.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s correct. Now that I don&#39;t have any backing from the Association, I can&#39;t even check into a hotel.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor that reason...</p><p>As an exception, I will permit your stay at the Emiya residence for a single week. Afterward you are on your own, how does that sound?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015In other words, I am to find my own residence in one week, is that right?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight. Although you wouldn&#39;t get into a normal property if they do a background check, there are ways around that with properties that have shady histories.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CFor the time being, how about the western-style house in the forest nearby? The owner won&#39;t come by so long as a natural disaster doesn&#39;t occur; it&#39;s even clean and in good condition. Though, you&#39;d be there without permission.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Let&#39;s see.</p><p>That would be a good area to settle in. Also, I&#39;d like to have my own place if possible.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDone, then it&#39;s decided!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Yaay!&quot; Sakura rejoices. &quot;Hmhm&quot; Tohsaka is nodding happily.</p><p>Saber had been readied to react instantly for battle if Bazett objected.</p><hr><p>What the... I was out of the loop even though I&#39;m the landlord?</p><hr><p>\u201CWell then, thank you for looking after me this next week.</p><p>It may not scream luxury, but at the very least, this room is suite class.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAhaha, listen to that, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Umm, by &quot;this room,&quot; you mean the storehouse, right?\u201D</p><hr><p>A noisy, peaceful atmosphere.</p><p>The conflict of Tohsaka vs. Bazett is simmering beneath the surface.</p><p>...It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s only one week.</p><hr><p>There is one more thing to worry about now, but if it&#39;s just Bazett, I should be able to pull through.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s good. With this, one matter is settled.\u201D</p><hr><p>Caren breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>Even though they are on bad terms, looks like she is glad that Bazett has found a place to stay.</p><hr><p>\u201CI was worried what would happen for a bit, but I&#39;m glad it worked out somehow.</p><p>Oh. That reminds me, what did you want a consultation for?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh my. You remembered about that?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CI promised I would listen after I finished talking with Bazett.</p><p>So, what did you want to talk about?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015At that moment.</p><p>For only an instant, I caught a glimpse of a true demon&#39;s smile.</p><hr><p>Then, this demon, with timing that couldn&#39;t be any more perfect,</p><hr><p>\u201CYes. Actually, it&#39;s time for the church to be renovated.</p><p>Therefore, about my place of residence until renovations are complete\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2606\xD7$%\u2019&amp;$\u201D\u2019(&amp;$&amp;#%&amp;!!!!!\u201D</p><hr>', 1023);
