Which means he can make allies and cooperate with others, as long as they can compensate for each other\u2019s disadvantages.</p><p>If you are, for example, inside a labyrinth made by a mage, he will prove himself to be a reliable ally with his strong physical abilities, expertise at handling traps, and ability to merge into the shadows to sneak behind your prey.</p><p>Additionally, his cylindrical right hand is a cursing hand (a Middle Eastern magecraft specialized in cursing people) he obtained as the final result of his self-modification.</p><p>He went through the hard and laborious work of spiritually assimilating the non-human Shaytan arm and incarnating it.
