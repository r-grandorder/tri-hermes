With how much common sense one has, one even understands that an appearance like hers is the standard at the waterside; even so, as far as Kiyohime is concerned, for her own body to be in a swimsuit, it is possible to say that this is surely insane for her\u2026 Declaring that to be an easy understanding however, she changed into a swimsuit, and concerning her, given that in itself is the result of her having mustered her courage, one should give praise for her openheartedness, please.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A naginata (it is something part of a maiden\u2019s taste somehow).</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Kiyohime (Berserker)</strong></p><p>\u201CIf we multiply as we are, that being the case, won\u2019t this complete an absolute encirclement that won\u2019t let Master get away?\u201D<br> The Kiyohimes are suspicious.</p><p><strong>All of the C\xFA Chulainns</strong></p><p>\u201CI\u2019m thinking of treating him as the midway target.\u201D</p><p><strong>All of the Artorias</strong></p><p>\u201CI\u2019m thinking of treating her as the final target.\u201D</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>\u2018I also happened to receive requests that are full of variety, such as for kimono-styled swimsuits, school swimsuits and bikinis, so I guess I will specially do some drastic designs for those people based on the modifications of her attire!\u2019 I completely conveyed all of those requests when I drew the designs for Kiyohime.

Nevertheless, given that I was considering her appearance as a battle sprite as well, I was able to implement her designs, and I was likewise happy. Hey, speaking of such, for her Third Stage, I had put a parker on her when I was designing her in the beginning. However, because it was plain, I turned it into a kimono. Although, since it was later intended for her chest to be just a little bit bigger, the charm of huge breasts with the nature of cosplay made me put aside the first one\u2026 By the way, given that my child is LV 100, has a Lv. 5 Noble Phantasm and MAX Skills, and is being fed all the 4\u2606 Fou-kuns, she is stronger than the limited teacher[1].
