In Ragnarok, Scandinavia\u2019s endgame war, he is the one to burn in flames. It can be said that his character was inspired by a volcano and its eruptions.</p><p>The doomsday device was born to provide the extinction of all life. The Primordial Titan (Ymir)\u2019s destructive nature is not recorded in the Pan-Human History\u2019s legends. The person that mostly inherited it all is Surtr.</p><p>A being from Lost History. Establishing disaster at the core of the Scandinavian Lostbelt\u2019s world. In the Age of Gods, he ate Fenrir, the giant wolf who beared the same destruction as himself, and he decided to deviate from the pre-established Ragnarok (the one identical with Pan-Human History), so he attempted to burn the entire planet instead of only Scandinavia. It\u2019s possible to say that deed was the first step to a pruning phenomenon without a future. However, when he was about to start the planet\u2019s incineration, he was met with opposition from the gods ,starting with the Almighty Odin. The battle ended with no winner, as Surtr managed to annihilate them all but his body was sealed inside a \u300Cfalse sun\u300D. That world was supposed to have been pruned right there, but...</p><p>Surtr plans the\u300Cplanet\u2019s incineration\u300Donce again with the world existing as a Lostbelt. In the beginning he concealed his true form inside of the Heroic Spirit Sigurd; replaced his personality, accept Ophelia as his master; behaving as Scandinavia\u2019s strongest knights wielding the demonic sword Gram, but--------- In the end he reveals his true self, he merges with the \u300Cfake sun\u300Dfloating in the skies of Scandinavia. He takes the form as the enormous flaming titan and plans the greater doomsday that surpasses the past doomsday....the incineration of all landmass on Earth.</p><h2 id="feelings-towards-ophelia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feelings-towards-ophelia" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Feelings towards Ophelia</h2><p>Surtr was slowly torturing Ophelia emotionally while he was behaving as the knight Sigurd. He grilled her inside. However, he would never destroy her. In decisive situations------situations were Ophelia would be broken if he tormented her---------, Surtr respected Ophelia\u2019s orders. That is because he seriously loves Ophelia in his own way.</p><p>Surtr has only one reason clinging onto Ophelia. When he failed his role as a doomsday device and got secluded in the grey world, she was the woman who \u300Cfound\u300D him. Although he fears this was mere coincidence, that encounter was the first element of unpredictability in Surtr\u2019s entire life--------the\u300Clove\u300Dknown as surprise. While Surtr tried to achieve the role of destroying the world, he clings to Ophelia to the very end, to show the end of the world to the \u300Cfoolish woman\u300D(to make her survive it). Harboring gratitude, getting emotional, wanting to repay a favor. That\u2019s called\u300Clove\u300D, but Surtr didn\u2019t know that.</p><h2 id="appearance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#appearance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Appearance</h2><p><strong>\u3010First form\u3011</strong></p><p>An appearance as Flaming Titan, the M\xFAspell King.

His coloring changed to incorporate giant wolf of ice Fenrir (a hidden fact never written in either the Saga or Edda: in this story, Fenrir swallows half of the blizzard domain Niflheimr, granting it ice bones, ice flesh, and an ice heart).</p><p>The Titan King of the Icy Flame.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>A Flaming Titan with a black shell. I put emphasis on him being good-looking by making him slimmer than the rest of the Ancient Giants, given that he\u2019s Norse Mythology\u2019s final boss. In the initial drafts, I designed him all the way down to his legs, but, tragically, everything from the waist down was cut to fit the screen. But he deserved it because he was cruel to his Master y\u2019know. Learn your lesson. I like how putting him next to an Ifrit makes them look like father and daughter. Kehe.
