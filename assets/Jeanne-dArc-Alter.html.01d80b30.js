Also, its power will increase even more if her allies die, etc. Then, whether it is a slashing attack, a striking attack, or on top of that, a hit by means of a curse, all of it will in the same way be converted into her physical attack power when they are halted by the Noble Phantasm.</p><p>The flag can release flames with performance resembling a first-rate Dragon Breath.

She believes in God. And yet, faith does not exist in that belief. She will wage war with her companions against God, and she will simply delight in this cause to kill.

As Jeanne lived through her life as a Saint, there is no element that can properly be converted for Alteration. Therefore, Jeanne Alter is purely \u201Ca Jeanne d\u2019Arc dreamt of by the people as an avenger\u201D, and properly speaking, there is no capacity to the extent of being able to summon her as a Servant.</p><p>However, something once created will not return to nothingness. Jeanne Alter had set a trap on Jeanne d\u2019Arc to work out her plan. By producing an element for Alteration not in the Jeanne of the past, but in the Jeanne as a Servant, she created a core for Jeanne Alter; furthermore, she improved her Saint Graph values through the Counterfeits\u2019 Riot, having publicly transformed into a Servant. Regarding the Counterfeit Heroic Spirits that were summoned on the occasion of the Counterfeits\u2019 Riot, it appears that Jeanne Alter wanted to forget all about their existences except for her owns.</p><p>Since she is not denying Jeanne d\u2019Arc already, Jeanne Alter aims to surpass her. Even for her writing practices, she will not fail in being earnest about them every day. And she is steadily going through a little bit of writing already!</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Jeanne d\u2019Arc</strong></p><p>It goes without saying that Jeanne is a holy maiden. The detestable original of herself. However, since Jeanne Alter perceives her very existence as becoming a pest to Jeanne d\u2019Arc, she enjoys her Chaldea life with an air of smugness\u2026 Jeanne d\u2019Arc thinks that sort of Jeanne is a little pleasant, and that should not ever be realized by Jeanne Alter.</p><p><strong>Artoria Alter (Including Santa)</strong></p><p>Someone who is playing the role of something like a destined rival. Jeanne Alter is herself when others are themselves. And then against Artoria Alter, who could think of and come to a clear decision while being evil, she becomes absurdly weak and passive.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais (Caster)</strong></p><p>One person who Jeanne Alter has for mental support.

Her shading and a bit of her design differ from the Jeanne Alter that appeared in Chapter 1. Because there is a meaning for her hairstyle in having its braid cut off, there was some resistance in having her hair grow out long for her Third Stage, but I also did this long hairstyle on Jeanne preferably because it was said to be towards a good direction, and hey, it was a good direction to have it be flashy after all.</p><p>She was Jeanne Alter (Ruler) at the time of her appearance in the First Chapter. For the development in those days, since it was a time where there was no leeway for us mentally as well as timewise, the only option was to re-use Jeanne\u2019s outfit with a colour change. Be that as it may, given that implementing a character of Jeanne with a colour change in her standing pose is, as one would expect, unattractive, we made sure to turn around the way Jeanne was drawn in the key visuals. Even though she was called an NPC, she was drawn with distorted facial expressions and the like, doing whatever I please without any kind of eagerness, and it was quite a bit of a surprise that many were pleased with that side of her. Nowadays, she became a character totally known for her amusing facial expressions huh?
