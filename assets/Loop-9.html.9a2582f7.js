Even with all that, she has no trouble handling club activities\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>The title of Miss Perfect is totally appropriate for Sakura... or it should be... wait... what&#39;s with this gloomy atmosphere?</p><hr><p>Maybe practice is over, or maybe there just weren&#39;t that many members to begin with, but I can only spot Sakura and Mitsuzuri inside.</p><p>I bow at the entrance way, and just as I am about to enter... From where I am, looks like a pretty serious conversation. My chance to escape is starting to slip away.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s what I think, Senpai.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut that&#39;s your own problem. It may seem like I&#39;m being cold, but it&#39;s not something that will go away by itself, you know?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Yes, you&#39;re right.\u201D</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s problem?</p><p>Sounds quite complicated. Even I don&#39;t have the nerve to cut in here.</p><p>I quietly go outside so they wouldn&#39;t notice.</p><hr><p>\u201CEmiya, you heard our conversation, didn&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p>As I leave the dojo, I hear Mitsuzuri&#39;s voice from behind.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhat, you realized I was there?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, although from where Matou was she probably couldn&#39;t see you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Keep up the good work.\u201D</p><p>\u201CBut it is a bit of a tricky situation.\u201D</p><p>Saying that, Mitsuzuri folds her arms.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Regarding Sakura?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh? That&#39;s not it. Weren&#39;t we talking about how she&#39;d feel a sense of oneness with the group?\u201D</p><p>Mitsuzuri said a word I haven&#39;t heard before.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Oneness?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWow, your face says that&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve heard that word.</p><p>Just so you know, it&#39;s got nothing to do with &quot;onions.&quot;\u201D</p><p>I can at least figure out that it&#39;s not food on my own.</p><hr><p>\u201CMaybe I shouldn&#39;t be saying this, but... She&#39;s not the type to push people around her forward, right?</p><p>She always seems to draw back and respect everyone else&#39;s opinions.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd that&#39;s bad?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, not bad at all, but she doesn&#39;t want to stay like that herself.\u201D</p><p>\u201COh? Well, that means she&#39;s got some will as a leader now. Isn&#39;t that a good thing?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CIn that respect, it&#39;s a relief for me, too.</p><p>But if she wants to throw away that security and aim higher, it&#39;s her own matter to deal with.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo that&#39;s what you mean by oneness?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo\u2015\u2015\u2015For example, had Matou been a Makidera-type jerk, &quot;Everyone support the captain!&quot; would have been her slogan, but... lately, she wouldn&#39;t show even this kind of weakness, see?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you&#39;re worried that if she&#39;s too perfect, the club members will lose interest?\u201D</p><p>She nods with a difficult expression.</p><hr><p>\u201CI mean, well, the archery club events shouldn&#39;t all be so strict and uptight\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CUptight, huh...?\u201D</p><p>The choice of wording does give me an idea of how she feels about it.</p><p>...But what kind of a get-together (er, &quot;club event&quot;) would make the club feel a sense of oneness...</p><hr><p>As we start talking, we hear the first bell.</p><hr><p>\u201CWe have to get to class soon. You&#39;re still in your uniform, will you make it?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I&#39;m fine. I don&#39;t have a class in first period.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see\u2015\u2015\u2015wait, I&#39;m not fine at all, gotta run!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHahahaha!\u201D</p><hr><p>But even after she&#39;s retired from active duty, coming out here in the morning just to help with morning practice and talk with Sakura... Mitsuzuri sure looks out for her.</p><hr><p>\u201C...A sense of oneness, huh...?\u201D</p><p>...Yeah, gotta tell her if I come upon any ideas.</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-1rider-and-the-sandwich" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-1rider-and-the-sandwich" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 1Rider and the sandwich</h3><hr><p>Lunch time.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;ll buy something from the cafeteria\u2015\u2015\u2015Then I could eat it in the student council room, or on the roof.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hey, did you see that?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat was awesome. I didn&#39;t think people like that really existed.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll the girls in our school combined might still not be a match for this one.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWho knew that beauties like these exist out there... think she&#39;s a model? Or some kind of celebrity?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, she&#39;s gotta be an alien. There are no people like her on Earth.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Earth, Mars, or wherever - I wanna know what someone so gorgeous is doing here, at our school.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m starting to hear.</p><p>I wonder who it is? Model or celebrity\u2015\u2015\u2015But who, exactly?</p><hr><p>\u201CI wonder how long it takes to take care of all that hair.\u201D</p><p>\u201CForget the hair, don&#39;t you think she&#39;s not even of the same race? Ah, look at that physique of hers.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHer legs and arms are so long. I feel embarrassed just passing by her.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAnd that head... She must be over 8:1 height-to-head ratio, too...\u201D</p><hr><p>Such was the girls&#39; assessment.</p><p>As I head down the hall, the talks about this mysterious person get even louder.</p><hr><p>From the information thus far, there&#39;s only one candidate I can think of.</p><p>...Why is she at Homurabara?</p><hr><p>\u201C...I have a bad feeling about this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat is unfortunate, Shirou.</p><p>Would I happen to be the source of this bad feeling?\u201D</p><hr><p>A cool voice comes from ahead and above me.</p><p>A noisy bunch of students already have me surrounded.</p><p>\u201CW-Who are you?!\u201D</p><p>I blurt out the first thing that came to mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CI am rather troubled by your sudden decision to feign ignorance.\u201D</p><p>No matter what, she keeps her calm.</p><p>A cloth-wrapped package in one hand, Rider stands there, blocking my path.</p><p>...I can&#39;t pass, and if I try to escape, her long legs would probably catch me in a few strides...</p><hr><p>\u201C......Sorry. It&#39;s what a normal student would do. I apologize, I really wanted to pretend I didn&#39;t know you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou are unkind, Shirou. I had hoped you would give me a heartfelt greeting like you always do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CGeh.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Ooooh!&quot; The audience pipes up.</p><p>&quot;What is this?! Emiya has so many pretty girls around him! That blonde lady, Tohsaka-san, and even Matou&#39;s younger sister. Oh, and Ryuudou is pretty good-looking, too!&quot; I keep hearing all sorts of prickly remarks behind my back.</p><hr><p>I feel like I&#39;m going to get crucified.</p><p>The gears are creaking as they turn in my mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, since this is a school, there are certain rules a student must follow... Anyway, Rider, what is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight, I am here to deliver something you happened to forget.\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Oooooh, an older wife!? Is he following in Kuzuki-sensei&#39;s footsteps?!&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015No, I realize that would be quite a sensation, but that&#39;s really not the way it is. It&#39;s more like an older sister and younger brother, if anything.</p><hr><p>\u201CFor me? I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t leave anything behind.\u201D</p><p>\u201CTo be precise, it is something that Sakura forgot... to bring\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Rider glances briefly at her surroundings.</p><p>Feeling the sheer pressure of her beauty, the audience takes a step back, like a receding tide.</p><p>One can hear the wind whooshing through the quiet lunchtime hallway.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt appears you are uncomfortable talking here.</p><p>Is there a place where we could go to?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Let&#39;s go to the rooftop.\u201D</p><p>There aren&#39;t that many students that eat lunch there during this season, and it can&#39;t be any worse than being the center of attention here.</p><p>We wade through the crowd\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CThis should be okay.</p><p>You sure did well getting inside, Rider.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI experienced no difficulty infiltrating the school building.\u201D</p><p>...I have a feeling she&#39;s missing the point, but whatever.</p><p>Rider is still holding on to that package.</p><hr><p>\u201CSomething that Sakura left behind... so what does that have to do with me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHere. It is your lunch, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>The cloth-wrapped package that Rider just gave me is, indeed, a lunchbox.</p><p>Ah... I see, that&#39;s why she was looking for me.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura made my portion, but forgot to give it to me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNo, she forgot both yours and her own. Therefore, I had to bring it over. I was able to locate her quickly, however...\u201D</p><p>She probably found her by the archery club. Having just recently assumed the title of the club&#39;s captain, Sakura&#39;s busier than ever, and ended up forgetting\u2015\u2015\u2015quite unlike her.</p><hr><p>\u201CSakura said she could not leave her job, and requested that I deliver it in her stead.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI see. Thanks.\u201D</p><p>Being treated to a lunch made by Sakura is no small deal.</p><p>Very grateful, I open the lid.</p><p>A tri-colored serving of meat over rice. A sausage shaped into an octopus, and an apple made into a rabbit.</p><hr><p>\u201CPlease direct your thanks to Sakura instead.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, you were kind enough to bring it here, Rider.\u201D</p><p>All of a sudden, she sits in front of me.</p><p>...I thought she was going to jet back home right away, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p><hr><p>\u201CRider?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, I thought I would wait until you were done eating.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015?!\u201D</p><p>I unintentionally gulp down the whole apple at once.</p><hr><p>\u201CI thought I would get yours and Sakura&#39;s empty lunchboxes after you were done. That is similar to what I have conveyed to Sakura, as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat would mean we&#39;d have less to carry home, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider is right in front of me.</p><p>The sight of her sitting in front of me as I hold my chopsticks creates a very oppressive air around me.</p><p>It&#39;s like being watched by a teacher, making sure you don&#39;t leave behind the foods you don&#39;t like.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Rider, um...\u201D</p><p>\u201CYes? What is it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWould you like this sausage?\u201D</p><p>I offer her the octopus-shaped sausage held between my chopsticks.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, that&#39;s your lunch, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, yeah, but what about yours, Rider?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Please do not worry about my lunch.\u201D</p><p>No matter what she says, I don&#39;t really like eating by myself.</p><p>I want to share some with her, but unfortunately, there is only one pair of chopsticks.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay, then. Wait just a second.\u201D</p><p>I close the lunchbox and run off.</p><p>\u201CShirou?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWatch my lunch there for a moment, alright\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHah... hah... hah... here. Ham sandwich and strawberry milk.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What is this?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour lunch.\u201D</p><hr><p>I hand her a bag of stuff I got from the student cafeteria.</p><hr><p>\u201CNo, as I have said before, I have no need for lu...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIf you don&#39;t eat, then I can&#39;t, either.</p><p>So, if you intend on going home with the lunchbox, give up and have some.\u201D</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t want to be blankly stared at, or have my food eyed greedily.</p><p>She takes the triangular sandwich from the bag with some bewilderment.</p><hr><p>\u201C...You are speaking strangely, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThink of it as a payment for having brought the lunch here.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Understood. Then I shall gratefully accept.\u201D</p><p>Looks like we have reached an agreement.</p><p>Now I can enjoy Sakura&#39;s handmade lunch in peace.</p><hr><p>Rider is wolfing down her sandwich.</p><p>...Well, maybe that&#39;s not quite the right word.</p><p>Should I say &quot;eating firmly&quot;? Or maybe &quot;gallantly&quot;?</p><p>She finishes the sandwich in five bites, but I can only say that it looked more attractive than exciting as she did it.</p><p>But I also think that she should get into a habit of chewing her food thoroughly before swallowing.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, your chopsticks are not moving.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, yeah.\u201D</p><p>It was a really distracting meal.</p><hr><p>When Rider started drinking the strawberry milk, my sights could only go to the straw that she was sucking on.</p><p>\u201CShirou, you seem to be nervous.\u201D</p><p>I quickly shift my attention back to my lunch.</p><p>It&#39;s strangely embarrassing... Maybe I should have eaten alone.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Thank you for the meal.\u201D</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s timed it accordingly, but she finished right as I swallowed my last bite.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah... it was a good meal.</p><p>Say &quot;thank you&quot; to Sakura for me, please.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood. Then I shall be off to collect Sakura&#39;s lunchbox, as well.\u201D</p><hr><p>Rider strides elegantly across the rooftop.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015While my gaze remains fixed on her long hair and ribbons swaying in the wind, she opens the door and looks back.</p><hr><p>\u201CThank you for your consideration for me today, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh, this is nothing. Anytime.\u201D</p><p>Then... I guess I&#39;ll go back to my class, too.</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-1-the-light-on-the-way-home" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-1-the-light-on-the-way-home" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 1 The light on the way home</h3><hr><p>\u201C...Ah, I really am tired.\u201D</p><p>The lights are all on. As you&#39;d expect, everyone should already be home at this hour.</p><p>I decided to walk back home, but it got pretty chilly as the sun went down.</p><p>For now I&#39;ll have dinner, take a bath, then decide what to do after a good rest\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CWelcome back, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m home.

Now that it is over, I can tell you - the way I had been treated was infuriating.</p><p>If you were going to disguise me, there ought to have been a better way of doing so.\u201D</p><hr><p>I see. M&#39;lady Saber was displeased by the yellow raincoat, hmm?</p><p>Then again, she&#39;s using it quite often, which would make it a type of silent protest against me?</p><hr><p>\u201CHmph, it appears that you have something to say. Very well, as an apology for that incident, let us settle this no\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou...!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CWha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Sword bounces against light.</p><p>The aftershock causes the air and the bridge supports to vibrate.</p><hr><p>\u201CStay back...!

For now, do not move...!\u201D</p><p>The fourth shot.</p><p>There is urgency in her voice.</p><p>The enemy knows that I am her weakness.
