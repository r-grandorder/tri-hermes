It&#39;s really relaxing.</p><hr><p>I feel like I&#39;ll go to heaven if I relax a little too much.</p><hr><p>Right? The benefits of this hot spring include relieving fatigue and sending souls to heaven.</p><hr><p>You won&#39;t be able to come back if you drop your guard.</p><hr><p>Huh......!?</p><hr><p>I think I saw a butter field...!</p><hr><p>That was close. I shouldn&#39;t sleep in the bath.</p><hr><p>Well this is the grand finale of the Tiger Dojo.</p><hr><p>We will now hold a review meeting to wrap up Fate.</p><hr><p>Hey, it&#39;s boring to be scolded until the very end.</p><hr><p>We&#39;re at a hot spring, so let&#39;s just stick to talking about what happened.</p><hr><p>Huh!? I&#39;m being expostulated by an underage loli-girl?</p><hr><p>But you&#39;re right. The hot spring feels good. Review meetings are what lions do[heart]</p><hr><p>Yeah, I contemplate my actions. Let&#39;s look back at what&#39;s happened without thinking about anything.</p><hr><p>So, what was your favorite part of the main story?</p><hr><p>Me? Hmm, I&#39;ll say the part where I got killed in Rin&#39;s route. There wasn&#39;t a CG there, but they added one later on.</p><hr><p>Oh, the one where you get your heart ripped out? Yeah, my heart skipped on that scene.</p><hr><p>Why don&#39;t you just die like that?</p><hr><p>I&#39;m talking about the CG of me and Berserker.</p><hr><p>By the way, the one you&#39;re talking about is a mysterious CG that was the top candidate to be dumped, but was completed and inserted before everyone realized it.</p><hr><p>I-I see.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s weird. So they kept such a nasty CG and dumped the one where I transform using the God of Babylonia&#39;s power to fight one-on-one against Angra Manyu?</p><hr><p>\u2014Hey, Taiga. It doesn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s Jaguar Man that transforms using the God of Babylonia&#39;s power. It&#39;s not tiger.</p><hr><p>What!? No way! But that tiger with the mantle has these really cute whiskers!</p><hr><p>If having whiskers makes you a tiger, even Mobi** Suits will be tigers.</p><hr><p>Shock! It&#39;s as shocking as finding out oshiruko and zenzai are two different kinds of food!</p><hr><p>Sigh... I&#39;ve been wondering, but why are you concerned about tigers?</p><hr><p>You don&#39;t like being called Tiger, but the clothes you wear have tiger patterns. Do you like them or not?</p><hr><p>Hm. I love them and detest them at the same time.</p><hr><p>......Well, okay. People have their tastes, so I won&#39;t pursue the question.</p><hr><p>So, what part of the main story is your favorite?</p><hr><p>Hmm. I like the opening movie.</p><hr><p>Especially the part where Fujimura Taiga shows up.</p><hr><p>I guess it was stupid of me to ask.</p><hr><p>We won&#39;t make any progress like this, so let&#39;s go in order.</p><hr><p>We&#39;ll start out with the first part, Saber route.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a route that represents the game Fate, just like the route name &quot;Fate&quot; indicates.</p><hr><p>I have no complaint about this route because I have a big part and Taiga comes out in the ending.</p><hr><p>Yeah. I was one of the main heroines back then. Time sure is cruel. Fufufu. I should kill the guy who wrote the story[heart]</p><hr><p>Okay, don&#39;t feel sorry for yourself.</p><hr><p>The purpose of Saber&#39;s route is to give the details of the Holy Grail War with the main focus on Saber.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a standard story intended for beginner Masters.</p><hr><p>You were one of the bosses too.</p><hr><p>Shirou had to part with Saber-chan, but this should make him stronger...</p><hr><p>...Wait.</p><hr><p>Does that mean there&#39;s a big danger of Shirou becoming Archer-san in this route?</p><hr><p>That would depend on how Shirou lives.</p><hr><p>Well, I think that&#39;s a pretty small possibility. I&#39;m by his side, after all.</p><hr><p>I see. I&#39;m relieved to know that Shirou will head down the path of evil with this small devil.</p><hr><p>Oh, wait a minute.</p><hr><p>You can live that long, Illya-chan!?</p><hr><p>That&#39;s a secret.</p><hr><p>Well, everyone eventually dies, so don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p>So, next is Rin route, &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot;...</p><hr><p>It follows many perspectives, and the story is more oriented towards the Servants.</p><hr><p>And quite frankly...</p><hr><p>We had no part in the story.</p><hr><p>Illya-chan exited the stage midway, and I was treated without much consideration.</p><hr><p>You&#39;re always treated without consideration.</p><hr><p>Guwa! The truth pierces my heart!</p><hr><p>But Tohsaka-san&#39;s pretty unimportant, even though she&#39;s the main heroine.</p><hr><p>I think Archer took all the great moments.</p><hr><p>That can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p>As the title &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot; indicates, Rin&#39;s route is a story about Shirou.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fate&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Blade Works&quot; are two sides of one story.</p><hr><p>Shirou is the protagonist of this game, so the game has to be about Shirou.</p><hr><p>He&#39;s a pretty warped person, after all.</p><hr><p>I see.</p><hr><p>So the first two routes completely covered all the themes.</p><hr><p>Yup.</p><hr><p>So this is the front side of Fate. The story you get if you do everything you can as a Master.</p><hr><p>Next is Sakura&#39;s route, the back side of Fate.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s the deadly struggle chapter, where you fight through from the beginning to the end of the Holy Grail War!</p><hr><p>Deadly struggle chapter, huh? You&#39;re right. You die the most in Sakura-chan&#39;s route, after all.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t laugh at how the shortest route ended up being the longest.</p><hr><p>There would&#39;ve been a route for me and Illya-chan if this one had been shorter.</p><hr><p>Your route didn&#39;t exist from the plot stage.</p><hr><p>Well, Sakura-chan&#39;s route was full of quick twists and turns, but what do you think, Illya-chan?</p><hr><p>Can you call it a grand finale?</p><hr><p>Of course you can. Something ridiculous like the Great Holy Grail was destroyed, and everyone&#39;s alive except me and Saber.</p><hr><p>You can&#39;t ask for more.</p><hr><p>Oh. But I guess there was a plan to have a ridiculous ending where Sakura-chan, Rider-san, and Saber-chan are alive.</p><hr><p>................Um, is that heaven?</p><hr><p>It&#39;s more like hell than heaven.</p><hr><p>Well, life&#39;s fun because you can&#39;t have it your way. It&#39;s just right when some people are missing.</p><hr><p>Wow, your words are filled with dignity.</p><hr><p>As expected from a character that&#39;s both a younger sister and an older sister.</p><hr><p>So, would you say Shirou is your younger brother or your older brother?</p><hr><p>That&#39;s a secret!</p><hr><p>As I have both attributes, Shirou also has both!</p><hr><p>Oh, I understand.</p><hr><p>But it&#39;s interesting and sad at the same time, considering that he might end up like Archer-san if he matures in the wrong way.</p><hr><p>Well, it&#39;ll depend on how he grows up, so let&#39;s leave it to Rin and Sakura.</p><hr><p>I said it before, but Fate is Shirou&#39;s story. The question of how Shirou should exist is presented in Saber and Rin&#39;s routes.</p><hr><p>One of the answers is Sakura&#39;s route, &quot;Heavens Feel&quot;.</p><hr><p>We don&#39;t even need to say what the answer was.</p><hr><p>He lost many things, but he&#39;ll be accumulating new things from now on.</p><hr><p>Yup. That&#39;s why this is a grand finale.</p><hr><p>Everyone&#39;s going to be as happy as they can get.</p><hr><p>Oh, you&#39;re such a good girl. We don&#39;t learn how good you are until after you&#39;re dead. You really are like an evil heroine.</p><hr><p>Heh. That&#39;s my role from the beginning. I have no regrets.</p><hr><p>The rest is a battle for the remaining people. I&#39;m just going to enjoy my hot spring and look down at the earth.</p><hr><p>I see.</p><hr><p>Then let&#39;s wrap this up nicely with a smile, pupil number one!</p><hr><p>Osu, all right, master!</p><hr><p>All right!</p><hr><p>This is the end of Fate/stay night!</p><hr><p>Thanks for not getting discouraged from the long playing time and fighting through the whole game!</p><hr><p>Yeah, thanks for playing the game!</p><hr><p>We took part after every dead end, but our duties are over now.</p><hr><p>This is the real farewell, but let&#39;s meet again in the main story!</p><hr><p>Goodbye! Don&#39;t die again!</p><hr><p>Goodbye!</p><hr><p>Huh...? By the way, Illya-chan. Were you saying something about looking down at earth from here?</p><hr><p>Yeah. I said I&#39;ll watch over the earth from here.</p><hr><p>.........C-C-Could this hot spring be...</p><hr><p>Um...... Heaven?</p><hr><p>Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not ending nicely at all!!</p>', 256);
