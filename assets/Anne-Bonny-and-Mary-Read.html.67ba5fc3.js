They were two female pirates on board the pirate ship Calico Jack that was lead by a man named John Rackham.</p><p>One person was Anne Bonny. Although she was the daughter of a wealthy person, Anne eloped with a good-for-nothing man in the end and joined John Rackham\u2019s pirate crew.</p><p>And the other person was Mary Read. As she was disguising herself as a man and was in the process of working on a Dutch ship, Mary was captured by Rackham\u2019s pirate crew and was forced to work as one of their crew members. Although, she was originally raised up as a man by her mother, so it seems that she had fitted in with the nature of the piracy business, having fought boldly together with Anne Bonny whom she personally shared her secret of being a woman to. The two are close friends, comrade-in-arms, whom were linking a powerful bond between them that went beyond passions like romance and love.</p><p>It was the same in their last battle as well. When John Rackham\u2019s pirate crew had anchored in Jamaica, they were struck by a raid from privateers (they are ships permitted to snatch away enemy cargos, and it is even possible to say that they are state-authorized pirates). It is said that while John Rackham and his subordinate men became frightened and hid inside their ship\u2019s hatch, Anne Bonny and Mary Read were the only two people that kept on fighting to the very end. A testimony left behind said that one among the two fired her pistol into the ship\u2019s hatch while shouting \u201CGet out and fight like men!\u201D, but in the end, Rackham and the others were arrested without mustering the strength and courage to fight back, and the two female pirates were finally captured too after a fierce battle.</p><p>Mary Read died while suffering from a fever inside her jail, but it was said that Anne Bonny turned and escaped due to her father\u2019s moves. When she did so, Anne informed John Rackham with a scornful look in her eyes the following:</p><p>\u201CIf you had fought like a man, you need not have been hang\u2019d like a dog.\u201D</p><p>\u2026 The name of John Rackham remained in pirate history. However, the reason is not because of the bravery and brutalness he himself has, but for being \u201Ca shameful coward and the captain of the ship that had on board two rare female pirates named Anne Bonny and Mary Read.\u201D</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Francis Drake</strong></p><p>As female pirates identical to Drake, Anne and Mary express their respect for her.</p><p><strong>Edward Teach</strong></p><p>As pirates identical to Blackbeard, Anne and Mary declare their intent to kill him.</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>Anne\u2019s clothes have a huge admiral clothing article coiling out of her waist, and that forms the silhouette of a dress with a large ribbon attached to it. (Although I do not know who on earth was originally planning to wear that, no matter what kind of size a human being has.) The image of that battle when their various clothes are becoming ragged is at the most extraordinary closing moments. In addition, one can conclude that the burning background is not in accordance with historical fact as it is the result of me having attached an importance of understandability to the background. The rifle seems to be terribly long, but the point is that, for those days, it is not an unusual size even then. Its range is not 100m, so after firing a lead bullet at someone with a bang, it is assumed that the way to use it is by using it as a club with iron covered on both ends.</p><p>Mary\u2019s coat, rather than even calling it clothing, is an article similar to a leather armour with the purpose of defending her neck and arms. On the back side of it is a skull painted with white paint. (As a result of reflecting on it, it is not that famous pirate flag when they are summoned as Heroic Spirits, yet what is the significance in Mary fighting while carrying that flag on her back?)</p><p>Regarding the bunny suits, they were not in the orders. Naturally, it has no connection to them, not any at all, even if one assesses it historically (Bunny girls were born around the 1960s time period. Even Anne Bonny, who died in the year 1762, would not be at the level of history where she could receive such a thing in advance). The explanation is that, basically, this is my preference. Sorry. Though one should know by now that bunnies are nice, isn\u2019t that right? Just in case, as an excuse, how about I go through with insisting on swimsuits for them? Hey, when I decided to seriously negotiate about that, there was just about no clothing specifications assigned to me when I got the approval. Just that they are fine with them as long as they look like pirates. But look, considering that, there is already elder sister Drake for a proper female pirate I can refer to.
