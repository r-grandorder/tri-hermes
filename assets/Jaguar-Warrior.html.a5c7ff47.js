The Jaguar \u2013 namely, a symbol of \u201Cwar\u201D and \u201Cdeath\u201D \u2013 is an existence revered for a long time in the Central and South American civilizations of all eras, and it is said that in the bygone days, it would often show its form to the world. In the Olmec Civilization of the Preclassic Period, the Jaguar Deity was a being who possesses the mixed-blood of a jaguar and a human, and it was deified in the shape of a \u201CJaguar-Human (Jaguar Man/Werejaguar)\u201D figure and the like.</p><p>In Central and South American mythologies, the Jaguar is frequently spoken of as a spiritual existence called a Nagual, a shadow and a supernatural Guardian Spirit. It is said that Tezcatlipoca, one of the chief gods worshipped in Aztec Civilization, is also endowed with a Nagual, and this Nagual is a fearsome Jaguar Nagual.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>In \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, while Jaguar Man owns a nature as a Divine Spirit of old, it is simultaneously syncretizing its aspects as a Nagual of Tezcatlipoca, drawing them from its own genealogy.</p><p>Heroic Spirit Possession. The Jaguar Nagual achieved its materialization as a Divided Spirit, done by possessing a particular human as its vessel. From time immemorial, it is said that humans who obtained the Nagual of a Jaguar were endowed with supernatural powers. The Nagual tales are narrated even in modern times. Furthermore, concerning the criteria for possession, among the humans that has a tie to the Holy Grail, the person who carries the fate of the wildness and the wildest force is elected.</p><p>It is unknown why the Jaguar attempted to materialize in this world. Maybe it came along while being attracted to Quetzalcoatl, or maybe it came along while in a playful mood. Perhaps it stole a march on Tezcatlipoca when he was about to appear, and so on; this is an endlessly intriguing matter.</p><p>Because the Jaguar belongs to the lower grade among the Divine Spirit Servants, its selling point is that it does not cost a lot to cover in terms of Magical Energy.</p><p>No matter how one looks at it, the personality of the possessed body is the main host, but that should not be pointed out.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>A frightening club.
