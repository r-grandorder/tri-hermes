Is it okay if I ask one thing of you, Master-san? Please, tell the Servants here to not come for advice about love to me.

Aah, if you want to attract your husband&#39;s attention, I&#39;ll lend you this arrow so be my guest and have a go at it. Even if you meet a terrible fate, as long as you have love, you&#39;ll be able to endure it, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wonder just how much the Holy Grail has caused the life of this young girl I and Parvati possessed to go off the rails. ...This child is a victim too. Just like me.&quot;</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>Kama is the god of love in Hinduism. kama means &quot;love&quot;.<br> A handsome man who rides a parrot holding a bow made of sugarcane and five flower arrows.<br> Eros (Cupid) would be his Greek counterpart.<br> Those shot by his arrows would fall in love.</p><p>Kama&#39;s most famous episode is about Parvati and Shiva.<br> The gods wanted Parvati and Shiva to make a child, but Shiva was in the middle of his ascetic meditation and had absolutely no interest in Parvati.<br> And so, the gods (or just Parvati) sent in Kama and forced him to shoot the meditating Shiva with the arrow of love.<br> It is said that Shiva was enraged and, opening his third eye, burned Kama to ashes.<br> This is the origin of Kama&#39;s other name, &quot;The Incorporeal One (Ananga)&quot;.</p><p>In addition, Kama is viewed as the same as the incarnation of worldly desires, the demon Mara. The origin of the word Mara is &quot;one that kills&quot; and is translated as &quot;demon&quot;, &quot;obstacle to Buddhist practices&quot; and &quot;demon king&quot;.<br> In Buddhism, it is the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven that resides in the sixth heaven of the six heavens of the desire realm, the heaven of controlling others&#39; emanations.<br> When the Gautama Buddha was reaching enlightenment, Mara tried to hinder that in various ways.<br> It sent three beautiful girls to him (they were all Mara transformed), threw a plate of fire at him, rained stones and weapons on him, assailed him with monsters, heavy rain, and wind......<br> However, the Gautama Buddha turned the plate of fire and weapons into flowers and his enlightenment couldn&#39;t be obstructed.<br> Having hindered Shiva, Kama has been established as Mara who obstructed the Gautama Buddha and her role as &quot;one who stands in the way of the practitioners of Buddhism&quot; has been fixed.<br> One could even call Kama/Mara the god who represents the good and bad sides of the concept known as love.</p><p>The lazy &quot;evil goddess of love&quot;.<br> In the past, when she shot Shiva with her arrow for Parvati&#39;s sake, it turned into an outrageous situation.<br> She didn&#39;t do anything bad, but she was turned into ashes and killed.<br> &quot;How ridiculous...I am sick of working for the sake of others&#39; affections and love.&quot; is what she currently thinks.<br> That&#39;s why, when it comes to her duty as a god of love, she&#39;s doing what&#39;s all the rage these days: she&#39;s boycotting it.</p><p>Basically, she&#39;s apathetic, always bored, uninterested and sick of everything.<br> However, contrary to that, once she finds something that looks &quot;somewhat interesting&quot;, she&#39;ll make her move with an unpleasant smile on her face.<br> For the most part, it will turn into something that brings trouble to others (mostly Parvati).</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>The Kama who has a connection to the &quot;Tokugawa Kaiten Labyrinth: Ooku&quot; holds a special significance when it comes to the nature of &quot;The Incorporeal One&quot;.<br> Shiva is the one who administers the &quot;destruction of the universe&quot;.<br> Kama, who directly took on the power of the third eye that is an &quot;existence that burns up the universe&quot;, turned into ashes=nothing=the incorporeal one, in a paradoxical manner, gained the qualifications to become the universe. It is a conceptual assimilation with that infinite domain, due to having one&#39;s form turned into the same kind of nothingness/void by a &quot;power like that&quot;. In short, as &quot;The Incorporeal One&quot;, Kama has become tied to the concept of the universe.<br> By acquiring that authority, as the &quot;victim&quot;, Kama has become one that &quot;brings suffering&quot; to all.<br> At any rate, she&#39;s the universe. Her screams of anguish, her rage, her envy, her discontent, they all reach every substance in this world.<br> By burning her own body, Kama&#39;s limbs turn to ether lumps and she becomes &quot;Shiva&#39;s Universe&quot; itself.<br> Kama in that state would turn into a phenomenon that transcends the limits of a Divine Spirit, a threat to humanity, and an unhindered calamity.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Bow and arrow<br> Vajra<br> In hindu mythology, it is a weapon of Indra, but it is said that Kama got in the way of Shiva&#39;s meditation on the orders of Indra.

Thank you very much for accepting my bold approach of making the third ascension all sparkly (she&#39;s a god after all), putting a universe inside her hair (she&#39;s a god after all), and having her limbs be burning (she got burned after all). Having the Indian lotus in her third ascension&#39;s background reflected in her Noble Phantasm animation made me really happy.
