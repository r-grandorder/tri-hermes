A. S. T. E. R.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, please don&#39;t cry out so!<br> It is I, your Kiyohime, Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...I too have just woke up.<br> Do you know where we are?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> At any rate, let us walk.<br> Look, Mash is here as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t get in contact with the Doctor.<br> Anyway, let&#39;s take a walk around.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. Let&#39;s wander around. This too is one of the delights of travel\u2013Or so it seems.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Well, to be honest, I have never taken a real trip.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> When I chased after Lord Anchin, that most certainly could not be called a trip.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Now, then. Shall we begin walking?<br> I wonder what sort of things await us.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It sure is a little exciting, isn&#39;t it?<br> Hehehehehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Enemies!<br> Kiyohime, get ready for battle!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Umm, Kiyohime?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, my! Just when I was expecting romance, such a horrid encounter! Dear god! What have I done to deserve this?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Oh, right. I do have a vague idea of what it might be.<br> Most of my behavior in life could be the cause.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Hmm... I do deserve this. But for this trouble to be imposed upon my Master simply won&#39;t do...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Our trip has only just begun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Thank you, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...If Elisabeth were here, she&#39;d probably joke about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ahh, such a magnificent view.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, yes.<br> ...About that trip.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> The only thing that I saw was his back. That dreamy back. He abandoned me and simply ran away\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...But just so you know.<br> I did think back on my actions.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Yet, still, even so.<br> Why didn&#39;t he utter a single word of apology.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If he can not do that, he could at least yell at me\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That would be tough.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s never happening.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But why? I am not the type that would slit her wrists at the slightest reproach.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> However, my chat-room friend, Tamamo, told me,</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> &quot;You know, your understanding of why Anchin left you is wrong at the most basic level.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> &quot;He didn&#39;t want to stay away from you, in fact, he liked you a little, just a little.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> &quot;However, your love for someone who only liked you a little is too heavy. Too much is as bad as too little.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> &quot;With you it&#39;s either love or hate, one or zero.<br> You really need to change your digital way of thinking!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> That is her opinion of me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You were too lovely.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Because I&#39;m lovely\u2013<br> So he didn&#39;t want to say anything harsh to me?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a man&#39;s pride.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> A man&#39;s pride?<br> That is a matter that I am unable to comprehend.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Such a pathetic man.<br> Putting on pride and running away...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Well. I am still completely unable to comprehend the heart of a man.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Tamamo tells me to trust her on matters between men and women. She says she can give me the perfect answer because of what she&#39;s been through\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Those are the kinds of things she says...<br> But for some reason, I just can&#39;t trust her.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It seems to me she&#39;s the type that would turn to mush the moment a handsome man gazed at her seriously.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> She&#39;s usually open about her feelings, but once the man makes a move on her, she&#39;d freeze up and get swept away.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> She always says, &quot;It&#39;s so easy to control a man.&quot;<br> But in reality, it&#39;s more like, &quot;Serving obediently is true happiness.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> In the Holy Grail War that we&#39;re in right now, perhaps it&#39;s a good idea to have an offline party sometimes.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Everyone knows she&#39;s a shut-in, so I don&#39;t know if that Osakabe-hime would show up.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, dear me! I&#39;m sorry.<br> I&#39;m doing all the talking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m quite fascinated by what you&#39;re talking about.<br> Chat-room buddy... Offline Party...?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I want to hear more about Master.<br> How were you born, and how you&#39;ve lived your life\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What&#39;s your favorite food?<br> And what&#39;s the food you dislike?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What&#39;s the type of woman you like?<br> What&#39;s the type of man you like?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What your schedule is like every day?<br> Where do you wash first in a shower?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Your height, weight, eyesight, grip strength, speed, endurance, lung capacity, whether you&#39;ve run a marathon...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh! I forgot one very important thing.<br> Are there any temples that you&#39;re acquainted with\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> If possible, I&#39;d like to hear about them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What would you do if I told you that?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s a secret.<br> Hehehehehehe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your face has become stiff...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, my!<br> Such a nice aroma.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...But wait, it seems there&#39;re some creatures who would dare to splatter the stench of blood in this beautiful forest.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Come out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lamia...!<br> Be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> My, they&#39;re snake monsters.<br> How hideous.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Wait, you and I both have a similar appearance.<br> Then the hideous thing here is\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Your nature as a mere beast.<br> Perhaps it&#39;s because you only care about your appetite...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Ahem!<br> Master, would you mind averting your eyes?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You see, I&#39;m not used to being looked at.<br> Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, my! Such a large cavern...<br> It&#39;s so mystical.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A cavern like this seems like the best place for a dragon to keep its treasure in...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But obviously there&#39;s no dragon here.<br> Yet, I do sense something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, be careful.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> It&#39;s exactly as Mash says.<br> Please stay behind me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Do not fret. No matter what sort of monster it may be, I shall protect you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2013I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that.<br> Excuse me, my dear self. May I ask you a question?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Wha...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Do you really think you&#39;re qualified to be a Servant?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> You who killed the man you loved out of hate, spite, and fury? Can you really swear to protect your next Master?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> You&#39;re...me?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Impossible! Utterly impossible!<br> Because you are just a lowly beast.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Quit showing your pretty self, and expose your hideous form. If you think you&#39;ll be loved then, you&#39;re kidding yourself.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Does a soldier show the one he loves what he&#39;s like when he cruelly slaughters on the battlefield?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> People express their love by hiding something.<br> But in your case, it is deception\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> By deceiving, don&#39;t you think you are forcing a human to love a beast?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> It&#39;s true, is it not? You, even after revealing your true identity, shamelessly\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> You pursued him!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> No... I never... Did...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Now then, Master.<br> You must discard this creature.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> Someday, this woman will reveal her true self over some petty lie, and sink her fangs into your neck.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> It is much more sensible to reject that woman.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Never!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I refuse to.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> I see. You are very kind.<br> Just like that Anchin was.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> But can you look upon Kiyohime&#39;s miserable, hideous form and still say that\u2013Why don&#39;t you try?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, stand back!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Master ...I will protect you!<br> That&#39;s the truth, it&#39;s not a lie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I trust you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Thank you!<br> Here I come, impostor\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime (?):</strong><br> \u2013Hmph! You will regret it someday.<br> These are my own words, so you know it&#39;s the truth.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Whew.<br> Master, may I ask you one question?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> ...Please, I beg of you. Do not lie about this.<br> Master\u2013Am I, hideous?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not one bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> What?<br> But, I mean... When I transform...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> I transform into a hideous dragon.<br> I thought it might be a hideous sight...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s so reliable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s so cool.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> \u2013My, how cruel!<br> You certainly are not lying...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Ah...ha, ahahahahaha!<br> Me? Reliable and cool?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Those are not words of praise for a maiden!<br> You are such a cruel Master!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m fine with it.<br> I can&#39;t stand a lie\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> But the words of that imposter, I will turn them into lies.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> A girl\u2013who accepted no lies and burned her love with crimson flame. I will show you just how determined that girl can be.</p>', 151);
