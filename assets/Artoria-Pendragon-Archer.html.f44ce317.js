She is a fastidious person alright.</p><p><strong>Independent Action: [A]</strong></p><p>Artoria, who acquired the Independent Action Skill that the Archer Class possesses, displays a very active participation in many fields at the time of the Water Blitz. Sometimes boldly raiding the enemy headquarters, sometimes meticulously lying in wait to ambush the enemy forces, and sometimes relentlessly aiming and shooting at the backs of enemies from a hiding spot. According to an assassin (with a Calico equipment) who is wearing a red hood, those mobilizations got him \u2013 who is skilled in field operations to a degree \u2013 to say, \u201CSo by some chance that is the case, is her true nature identical to mine then?\u201D</p><p><strong>Territory Creation: [A]</strong></p><p>Primarily a Skill from the Caster Class. It is also Magical Burst (Water). A dream-like effect due to the protection of Fairy Princess Vivian, which highly boosts the morale of comrades, raises Luck, raises accuracy rate as well, even gets rid of irritation, and as a bonus, refreshes Artoria and her comrades. A cheat Skill in survival games. By exhibiting this Skill, Artoria will become the champion of the Water Blitz World Tournament, but that is for another story.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Summer Splash!: [A+]</strong></p><p>Magical Burst (Water).<br> The attribute of Artoria\u2019s Magical Burst is being altered because of Vivian. Although its firepower has surely decreased, its duration capacity has increased. Also, it can even increase the entire party\u2019s defensive power. It is practically a water barrier.</p><p><strong>Protection of the Beach Huts: [EX]</strong></p><p>A personal Skill that restores HP in compensation for NP. While at the beach, Artoria is revered by most food stalls as the \u201CGreat King of Foods\u201D. It is probably because of her lavish food orders, the scene of her having her meals being a pleasant feeling, and the shining smile she makes after eating everything on her plate that cause those establishments to prosper, or so it has been told. Is it really? Perhaps it is. However, only mashed potatoes are a \u201Cno thank you.\u201D</p><p><strong>Beach Flower: [B]</strong></p><p>A summer Charisma. But at the beach, it is one step behind the other Servants and the destructive power of their bodies. This fact is not even a nice thing to talk about, but Artoria herself does not particularly care.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="excalibur-vivian-the-sword-of-sunlight-glittering-victory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#excalibur-vivian-the-sword-of-sunlight-glittering-victory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Excalibur Vivian: The Sword of Sunlight-Glittering Victory</h1><ul><li>Rank: A</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 9~30</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>Despite saying all of that about the Archer Class, it turns out like this in the end. Truly childish. \u201CStill, Excalibur is originally something entrusted by the Fairy of the Lake, so there should be nothing whatsoever odd about this aspect even if it has a Water Attribute, do you not agree?\u201D Even Aggy[1] would let out a strained laugh at this.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / kisama / kiden<br> Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics)</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>The same Artoria as always. However, her attention is just a little bit more relaxed since this is the beach. Her committee chairperson temperament has not changed, but she shows a gentler smile than usual. Thus, she should have a good time during playtime. When it consists of beach games, she will appear with an expression that shows that she hates to lose, playing in order to obtain victory.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>\u201CFor this rare vacation, it is probably fine to cut loose at least this time around\u201D \u2013 such is her stance. Even while saying such, Artoria is as serious as ever. She is delighted even though she feels embarrassed when someone praises her swimsuit. Apart from that, Artoria cannot swim because of the Protection of the Fairy that causes her to \u201Cwalk on water\u201D. During her lifetime, she did not need to swim, so she did not really need to practice swimming. In other words, she cannot swim\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CPlay in moderation. Understand?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAs I am now, I am neither a knight nor a king, but a shooter who fights as your representative. No matter what kind of stage, I shall take the position of number one!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSwimminggg! Splendid, too splendid! Mast, die a noble death; Excalibur\u2026 Viviannnnn\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat I dislike\u2026 Something like an Assassin Roller that stealthily comes up behind your back, or a Caster Sniper that aims and shoots at you from far away, but hey\u2026 I think what makes sports fun is competing in EARNEST while face-to-face!\u201D</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A great king of the beach who descended onto the summer sea. Who said King Arthur is only a Heroic Spirit of the Sword? Using a sword. As well as a lance. And even a bow. She also mounts reindeer and assassinates the same kind of Saber she is too. Because of that, is it not possible to say that with these all-purpose battle techniques, she does not feel ashamed of her title, the Knight King?</p><p>Since all her duties as a king were left behind at the office at this time, Artoria is dealing with the summer sunlight with all her energy. As she is not able to fully enjoy swimming because of her existing circumstances, Artoria was enjoying herself with watermelon splitting at the beach when she then encountered the Water Blitz (a survival game that uses water guns), and her appearance turned out like this before anyone noticed. It goes without saying that she, who hates to lose, is aiming at becoming a world champion.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014On that day, Artoria came across her (relatively trivial) destiny.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Gilles de Rais</strong></p><p>\u201CSea Demons? Ahh, hey, it was those sort of small fry enemies. Before, I competed in killing as many of them as I could and fell behind, but now, they are no longer a threat to me. Octopuses are not something to cut, but something to shoot at. After that, let us both deep-fry them so that they are tasty to eat!\u201D</p><p><strong>Knights of the Round Table</strong></p><p>\u201CListen, I am about to make a purchase for souvenirs for the Round Table Knights too\u2026 How about everyone gets something like matching aloha shirts? It seems like I can picture them wearing them while being delighted.\u201D</p><p><strong>Swimsuit Artoria Alter</strong></p><p>\u201CAs I would expect of Great Britain, its maid culture is something to boast about. Its three most important requisites are for one to sweep right on point, to slice right on point, and to shoot right on point\u2026 Even so, are you not slightly overdoing this?\u201D</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>In the middle of creating the swimsuit event, which should even be said to be a large gathering of the popular characters, we thought that if we did not completely develop the characters\u2019 special features properly, then we would be drawing the designs and pictures while feeling an immense pressure on us.</p><p>For Artoria\u2019s Second Stage, I was worried about whether or not I should have her wear the competition swimsuit I drew before in a magazine around the time of Fate/Zero, but in any event, it resulted in this swimsuit, and it even seems to be better for her appearance in matching with the water gun she has. She has traces of her Zero hairstyle on how her hair is tied.</p><p>I thought of the flood of emotions I had put into the drawings of Artoria\u2019s standing pose where her appearance shows her back, and the result of the colouring\u2019s finishing touches happened to be too magnificent as well, so I felt that I had delivered to many of the users with these drawings.
