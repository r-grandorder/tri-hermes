Well, just leave it outside for now.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood.\u201D</p><hr><p>For now, the two of us are just throwing the scattered stuff outside.</p><p>A pile of completely unrelated junk in front of her, Saber accompanies me without a hint of amazement.</p><hr><p>\u201C...However, now that I look at it...\u201D</p><p>There&#39;s probably enough junk to fill a light truck here.</p><p>And this is just the stuff from the first floor. How much is packed in there altogether? I&#39;m afraid to even guess.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, what would one use this iron plate for?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, that one... wait, isn&#39;t it a taiyaki griddle? Why on Earth do we have one?\u201D</p><p>...Furthermore, this isn&#39;t even meant for domestic use. It&#39;s a big one with a hinge, not unlike the type you may see at a food cart.</p><p>In addition, it has what looks like a plate for making takoyaki, a cotton candy machine, and a Christmas tree-like something with skates.</p><hr><p>\u201C...We could stage a whole festival with stuff out of this storehouse...\u201D</p><p>\u201CWas it you who brought all of this in, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201COnly about half of it. The other half I&#39;ve never even seen before.</p><p>...Well, either one is nothing but junk, anyway.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Although the things I put away are the &quot;stuff that you could use once fixed&quot; type. It&#39;s never been the &quot;stuff that was brought from god-knows-where&quot; kind.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo you have nothing to do with it.</p><p>Then, where did all these seemingly disordered, yet similar goods have come\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>There is only one name I can reply with.</p><p>Even Saber should have realized it by now.</p><p>But, pretending to be stumped myself, I keep silent.</p><hr><p>\u201CWow, this sure brings back memories. What&#39;s up, Shirou, why&#39;d you spread stuff out like this? You wouldn&#39;t be preparing for a festival, by chance?\u201D</p><p>So. The culprit chose a good time to make an appearance.</p><p>Like a criminal returning to the crime scene.</p><hr><p>\u201CNot preparing, but rather cleaning up.</p><p>Thinking of finally doing something about all the junk that a certain someone has brought from somewhere.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CH-How dare you call it &quot;junk&quot;! It&#39;s almost all been collected for your own sake, Shirou!\u201D</p><p>\u201CDoes that mean that all the objects here are things that Shirou wanted?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right! He spent hours clinging to the store window, always looking at that iron plate over there.</p><p>And then years later, his kind elder sister, having accidentally come across one in her house, was nice enough to remember and give it to him as a present.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHow wonderful.</p><p>Taiga, your sisterly care is an inspiration for siblings everywhere.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p>And yet, not only does he not put it to good use, for some reason he tosses it into the storehouse and forgets about it too!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Hold on a moment, Fuji-Nee. And you, Saber.</p><p>Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s something wrong with that story?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat? Isn&#39;t it a great story?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CNow look here. It&#39;s true that I wanted it at some point, but how many years passed since then? I may have stuck around food carts as a kid, but all I want now is a new frying pan, at most.</p><p>And that, for instance\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>&quot;Um,&quot; I point at the taiyaki griddle.</p><hr><p>\u201CHow do you propose we use this monstrosity, now that we have it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat are you saying, Shirou?</p><p>It&#39;s an iron plate for grilling taiyaki. Just start making some and it&#39;ll be alright.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAmazing. Would this allow one to make taiyaki at their own home?\u201D</p><hr><p>...Sorry, Saber.</p><p>Terribly sorry to break your dreams and expectations, but being oriented to commercial use, it&#39;s not much help in a regular home.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;s no good, Saber. You won&#39;t be making taiyaki with that thing.</p><p>And Fuji-Nee, how the heck were you planning to grill stuff on this, anyway?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat do you mean, &quot;how&quot;? Don&#39;t you know how to make taiyaki yourself, Shirou?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s not the problem! We don&#39;t have a heat source that&#39;s big enough.</p><p>The stupid thing is half the size of a tatami mat. How do you propose we keep it hot enough, you dumb tiger?\u201D</p><p>\u201CBah, you kept saying you wanted it even when I told you.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDid not. And why is it that you only remember stuff like this, anyway?</p><p>......Well, I do appreciate your feelings.</p><p>So where did you get it from?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThey left it at our place after a festival.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh...\u201D</p><hr><p>It must have been used at a food cart during the festival, then left with the family.</p><p>Some young guy in the Fujimura Group will probably get scolded by the old man Raiga for not looking after the inventory.</p><p>...Unfortunately.</p><p>I bet the rest followed a similar sequence of events. I&#39;ll get them to take it all back when opportunity arises.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou.\u201D</p><p>Having found something in the mountain of junk, Saber suddenly stops.</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber? Did you find something?\u201D</p><p>Maybe some dangerous magic-related item got mixed in there?</p><p>I rush over to her side.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015What could this possibly be?\u201D</p><p>In her hands, she holds a shaved ice machine.</p><p>This time, it&#39;s not a commercial, meant for festival use type, but a regular penguin-shaped one.</p><p>Deeply impressed by something, she keeps looking at it in the eyes, motionless.</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s a tool for making shaved ice.\u201D</p><p>\u201CS-Shaved ice... Could something so charming be really used to make frozen sweets?\u201D</p><p>...The fact that this cute little thing could actually be used for something seems to be a shock for her.</p><p>The hands holding the penguin start trembling.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlright. How about we make some, once we&#39;re done cleaning up?\u201D</p><p>We&#39;ve worked up quite a sweat.</p><p>After a day of hard work, a reward like that ought to really hit the spot.</p><hr><p>Sadly, we don&#39;t have any syrup.</p><p>Instead, I&#39;ll whip something up with matcha powder and sugar and cool it down in the fridge.</p><hr><p>Regarding the festival food cart drama, once we&#39;re done with the cleaning, I&#39;ll give the Fujimura Group a call\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>\u201COh, so that&#39;s where it was...\u201D</p><p>The family members that showed up, after a few words of exasperation, ended up retrieving Fuji-Nee, as well.</p><hr><p>\u201CI&#39;ll have a word with Grandpa and be back soon, so remember to leave some for me!</p><p>...But if I&#39;m starting to run late, do the right thing and come save me, I&#39;ll sure appreciate it.\u201D</p><p>Like that. Sounds like she&#39;s not coming back for a while.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, how would you go about using this?\u201D</p><p>There is no hiding the fact that the sparkling clean shaved ice machine on top of the table is now the subject of Saber&#39;s undivided attention.</p><hr><p>\u201CMm, just a moment.\u201D</p><p>I put a plate inside its belly.</p><p>As I open its head to load the ice, I notice Saber cringing slightly.</p><hr><p>\u201C...The way it opens, um... isn&#39;t very pretty.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHaha. Yeah, that&#39;s where it&#39;s just too functional.\u201D</p><hr><p>With a bitter smile, I take the handle mounted on top of the head and spin it a few times.</p><p>As I do so, little pieces of cut ice start to accumulate on the plate in its belly.</p><p>No matter how hard Saber is trying to feign disinterest, she looks about to burst with curiosity.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, does this machine happen to exist in any other shapes... Say, a lion or a panther, perhaps?\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>...Crap.</p><p>Despite having seen Saber like this many times before, the sheer imbalance still makes the corners of my mouth jerk up involuntarily.</p><hr><p>\u201CShirou, why are you turning away?</p><p>Besides, if you stop, the ice will melt away. You have to finish shaving it quickly.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUh, sorry. Erm... let&#39;s see, I don&#39;t really know, but perhaps there is a lion-shaped one, after all.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... Does it really exist?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, I mean, I haven&#39;t seen one myself, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did.\u201D</p><p>I keep working the handle.</p><p>As soon as there is about a cupful, I take out the plate, put some matcha syrup on top, and hand it over to Saber.</p><p>Delighted, she takes a spoon, and then suddenly stops, looking at me.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Will you not have some yourself, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is plenty enough for me.\u201D</p><p>I show her the teacup that I&#39;ve been filling at the same time.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. In that case, I will dig in.\u201D</p><p>Scooping a bit with the spoon, she brings it to her mouth.</p><p>She looks quite calm on the outside, but I bet she was really looking forward to it.</p><p>Having eaten a mouthful, she nods approvingly, looks at the penguin, then me, and keeps going.</p><hr><p>\u201CSaber, did they have something like this in the olden days?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Let me see. Indeed, I have tasted food articles that were not made as nourishment alone.</p><p>However, none were developed in an ice room like this one in front of me now.\u201D</p><p>&quot;That was a luxury reserved for select few,&quot; she concludes, returning to her shaved ice.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, Saber. Shaved ice does melt easily, but if you don&#39;t slow down\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>Looks like my warning came a little late. She has already stopped, her face turning a different color.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015you might get a headache, or so I was going to say. Guess it&#39;s too late now.\u201D</p><p>She nods, her eyes starting to tear a bit, and I pass her my teacup.</p><p>She takes what I thought was fairly hot tea down in one gulp.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What is it, Shirou?</p><p>Is seeing me get a headache because of the ice really that amusing?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHuh...? Oh no, not that it&#39;s amusing, I mean, uh...</p><p>Nevermind that, it&#39;s just going to melt if you keep talking.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Is that so?\u201D</p><hr><p>Unconvinced, the ice is still on her mind, and she soon goes back to enjoying it.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015I wonder if we could find it in Shinto.\u201D</p><p>\u201CShirou? What is the matter, is something on your mind?</p><p>Mm, you wanted to eat some shaved ice after all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. But, some other time.</p><p>Anyhow, next time I&#39;ll make sure to get some syrup\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201C?\u201D</p><hr><p>She tilts her head in confusion.</p><p>If there will be a next time, somehow\u2015\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll get a job at a storehouse in Shinto or something, and find that lion-shaped shaved ice machine, no matter how rare it may be.</p><p>...Until then, no more eating shaved ice with Saber.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3>', 195);
