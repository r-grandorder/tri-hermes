Strength that&#39;s been depleted must be restored.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Then this way, please.<br> I shall accompany you to the cafeteria.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe head to the cafeteria after I rest a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Ah. You must be exhausted.<br> I will notify the kitchen that you will arrive later.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Then I will accompany you to My Room.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Um, I mean...I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like that...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I&#39;ve recently come to reflect on my past actions... The fact that I would sneak into your bed without permission is, well...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Miss Raikou told me that such a thing is...indecent.<br> She was wearing a swimsuit when she told me...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Of course, I always knew that to be the case in the back of my mind, and I always meant to behave appropriately, as I was raised...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But I could not help myself, and that&#39;s why I... multiple times... Oh, yes...multiple times...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I bothered you so many times...<br> I will be careful from now on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to be so formal about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> All things in moderation. Moderation.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...But if you say that, I might...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> No... No! Decency is important!

I may not be in any position to say so because I&#39;ve not traveled the world to learn much about various places...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But that&#39;s how I feel... Many heroes from different times and parts of the world exist here together...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Heroes of the past.<br> Heroic Spirits. Servants.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Dead beings, whose purpose isn&#39;t to live correctly in the present age...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t they...incarnated temporarily?</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Oh, I mean... Well, I&#39;m not sure how to say this...<br> I suppose that is one way to describe things.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> We retain our form using our Spirit Origins to stay in Chaldea, and we live like humans.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I do not know the details of its system, but this is all thanks to the immense amount of magical energy that is supplied by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Perhaps a mage, even a Caster-class Servant...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...would be able to better put into words what I am trying to describe...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But I can say this much: this body of mine is made possible through the power of ether.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Blood courses through me, and I have a heart and brain. But at the same time, I have a Spirit Core.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> So unlike you, I am not a being with a proper body.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> A true incarnation...in other words, to gain existence as a complete living being would likely require the power of a wish-granting vessel like a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> If I...could possibly...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oops.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Not looking where you were going, huh?<br> Walking distracted isn&#39;t a good idea, Miss Serenity.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Yo, Master. You&#39;re safe.<br> How did that last Rayshift go for you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m back, Arash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Back home safe and sound!</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Haha.

Hassan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry.<br> I...um...I...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m terribly...sorry.<br> Now&#39;s not...no...no...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I cannot...no matter what...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Huh. She went as far as dissipating into thin air.<br> I didn&#39;t mean to cause her so much distress.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wonder what happened...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Oh, yeah.<br> Well...you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you have any idea, Arash?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Sorry. It&#39;s probably best if I don&#39;t say anything.<br> I think she should tell you personally.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> It&#39;s quite the pickle.<br> All you can really do is to brace for it.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> To us Servants, the Master is our foundation.<br> No matter how much magical energy Chaldea supplies...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> And no matter what anchors us for manifestation...a Servant&#39;s existence rests on the Master.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Well, we&#39;re not really humans, but that&#39;s another story. There&#39;s no use lecturing you on that.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...Just act naturally.<br> I beg you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just try not to get flustered.</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> That&#39;s the spirit.<br> That&#39;s our Master!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...In regards to the strange behavior of the Assassin, Hassan of the Serenity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Our first witness is Archer, Arash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It appears the two of them ran into each other in the hallway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Note that she was unable to properly respond to the sudden encounter, as she was focused only on Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...and as a result, she made skin-to-skin contact with Arash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As you all know, the poisonous toxins that course through her body reach a wide range. They can even penetrate special garments made from magical energy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> While not always fatal, a Servant touching her body will be affected by her poison.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Paralysis and dizziness are common effects.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Arash Kamangir, however, is highly resistant to poison.<br> So, he seems to be fine even after this contact.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But it was around that time when Hassan of the Serenity began to exhibit other strange behavior.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Second witness: Mash Kyrielight.<br> Third witness: Chaldea Staff J. Doe (name withheld).</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are multiple witness reports of the subject standing in front of Master&#39;s My Room, doing nothing but bowing her head.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And not just once or twice. Over the past few days, there have been at least five witnesses who have all given similar reports.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She is clearly disturbed, which must be what is driving her behavior. She is obviously in psychological pain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...The reason is clear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She has finally come to realize that there are individuals other than Master to whom her touch is not fatal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was just a matter of time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After contact with Arash, it appears she is trying to remain calm...at least around Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But swift action must be taken, or there is a possibility that this could affect her and our activities in our Rayshifting missions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u300AThis concludes the report by Paracelsus.\u300B</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I sense multiple entities with hostile intent.<br> It appears we are surrounded, Master.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Whether we choose to break through or flee,<br> it appears a fight is inevitable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay, just stay calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just do things as usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Yes. I await your orders.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...This may only be the simulator, but I will behave as if it were a matter of life and death. Whatever my Master commands...I will do!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Master.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> You went out of your way to invite me to join you in the simulator, yet...I was of no help.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t expect so many enemies. If I only managed to break through even the slightest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, it seemed like a successive battle program.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Hassan.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.<br> You are always so kind... Our Master...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But I...I&#39;m really...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Even though I am one of your Servants...though this should never happen...I just...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I cannot act...the way I should...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Welcome back, Senpai!<br> Serenity!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.<br> Please take care of Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, Serenity...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She didn&#39;t even say \u201CI&#39;m back\u201D...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She just left...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Good work in the simulator, Hassan of the Serenity.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I figured whatever was bothering you would have gone away once you accompanied Master into battle.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yet you immediately ran back to your own room...<br> This is very serious.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...I thought I locked my door.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> You forget that I am a mage.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...And a physician as well.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Servants have no need for physicians.<br> I ask that you leave.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...First, a little parable for you.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It&#39;s also a sort of fairy tale.<br> Once upon a time, there was a poisonous girl.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The poisonous girl killed many people. As the name suggests, the girl&#39;s veins ran black with poison.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The girl was searching...for someone who would not die from her touch, who would smile back at her.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> For someone whom she could lean against...just like she&#39;d seen so many people doing.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The girl was searching...for love.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The first one, a man, ended in failure. He died. He spoke sweet nothings to her, but then died as soon as the two kissed.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> But then...the second one...was a young girl.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> One so very powerful that she managed to touch the poisonous girl&#39;s skin as if it were nothing...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...and then smile.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Is that...story true?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Like I said, it&#39;s a parable.<br> Though, of course, there are elements of truth.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> So the poisonous girl thought to herself, \u201CAh, this maiden is the one. The one I&#39;ve desired, the one I&#39;ve been searching for all this time.\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> She was thrilled.<br> She worked herself into a fervor.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The poisonous girl accepted the powerful girl as her master, and entered her service. She killed many, and collected many souls...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...A soul eater?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Who knows? That may have been the case.<br> Either way, the poisonous girl killed and killed and killed.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> And then she met a young man.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> He was a kind young man. He possessed a noble soul, and he was even concerned with the poisonous girl&#39;s safety when she showed herself in battle.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Even though...he was destined to die by the girl&#39;s hands.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The girl killed the young man...kissing him with her poisoned lips.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> She did so without mercy, even though she felt only kindness from him.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> And so, the girl continued to work under her powerful master, killing more and more.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Then one day, the poisonous girl received a gift from a man.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> It was the kind man, animated as one of the living dead by some kind of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...A gift...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The man said to her, \u201CO poisonous girl. You don&#39;t care who the person is, as long as they don&#39;t die, right?\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> \u201CYou only serve your master because your touch does not kill her, not because you love her.\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> \u201CThen this living corpse should satisfy you.\u201D</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...And what did she say?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Who knows?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Which did the girl love...?<br> The girl, or the young man&#39;s corpse?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I cannot say. The story&#39;s ending is the poisonous girl&#39;s alone. It is not for you to know.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> At the very least, the girl went into a long slumber, carrying the story&#39;s conclusion with her. And she was never to wake up again. Ever.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Caster Paracelsus.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> What you are trying to tell me is that my hesitation...this turmoil within me...is...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...not...love...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I cannot say.<br> I wonder, do you even know what love is?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Hassan of the Serenity.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Sometimes, getting lost and hesitating is a good thing. That makes it a story all your own.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> You stand before us as a Spirit Origin.<br> Your manifestation in Chaldea is all your own.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Memories and thoughts do not linger. Just like with humans. If a Heroic Spirit dies, its Spirit Origin simply ends there.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, Hassan-i Sabbah...should you chose to cling to the reservations that plague your heart...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> ...and continue along your journey with that sentiment...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I will not stop you.<br> Nor will I tell you that you are wrong.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Then... I... I...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Paracelsus, oh, Paracelsus.<br> There&#39;s just one thing I must tell Master\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Then go on.<br> I will not stop you.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Thank you, Caster Paracelsus.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I wish you luck.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> But I couldn&#39;t help but watch.<br> You chose your words...very carefully...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Memories don&#39;t remain, huh?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> I did not wish to lie, so I was, as you say,<br> very careful in my choice of words.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Hassan of the Serenity. Her Spirit Origin is somewhat different than ours. Even if SHE were to be summoned once again...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Those records would never be carried over from the Throne.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Only when she gains love, that is.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> The Hassan of the Serenity who fell in love will never be summoned again. That Hassan shall sleep for eternity, and carry those emotions with her.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Even if she were summoned using the Holy Grail or through a special magecraft ritual, the checks and balances system should make it so that a different her with a different Spirit Origin would manifest.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> ...Yeah, the one we have now is a great example.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes. She&#39;s a completely different person. Different than the girl we know from that distant Holy Grail War in a faraway past.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> Even we&#39;re different. Circumstances and their outcomes may differ slightly, but I understand that is the way it is for all Servants.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Indeed. Just a SLIGHT difference. Heh. And...that should ring true the next time we are summoned as well.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t for the Singularity or the exception that is the Chaldea summoning ritual, fragments of our memories carrying over should not be possible, either.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong><br> What a pain in the ass.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong><br> Yes. For you and me, both.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...U-um...I...I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;ve come back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. Take your time.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Y-yes...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Breathe in...breathe out...<br> Calm down...focus...I...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I can do this. I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll talk.<br> Inhale...exhale...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Master. First of all, I apologize for my mishap in battle earlier.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I am fine now. I decided I will be fine from now on.<br> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tell me, Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I will tell you the truth. I have learned that there are others who my touch does not kill. I mean, apart from you, Master.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> And so...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I was hesitant. I wavered.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I thought I was determined...that I wouldn&#39;t mind even if the First One&#39;s evening bell tolled for me...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> But then I became confused...<br> I panicked, I wandered, and my mind was all a mess...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Someone who doesn&#39;t die from touching me.<br> Someone who doesn&#39;t die from embracing me...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> The role was so easily filled...the hero Arash was absolutely unfazed even after I touched him!</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I heard he was strong against toxins, according to his lore and characteristics. But...I never thought that was actually true...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> The moment I witnessed it for myself...I...I...<br> It felt like my chest was about to burst...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> And then I couldn&#39;t look at you in the eye...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...I...I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nods)</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> No...no, you do not understand, Master.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> It was true that I hesitated. I&#39;m still confused.<br> But...but I want to think that it&#39;s fine...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I was the one who decided to be with you.<br> That feeling will never change.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> After hearing Paracelsus&#39;s story, I began to realize...that if this Spirit Origin that is me...does not stay forever...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I will no longer avoid the truth. This Spirit Origin shall begin and end here. There is no me beyond that.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m fine now.<br> I won&#39;t flee...from anybody.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...And not even from my own heart.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay. Got it.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I will stay by your side. That is what I have decided. That&#39;s why...th-th-this is a confession.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I am unsure whether this feeling is love or not...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> No! I will try my best! I&#39;m sure I am going to keep agonizing over this, but I&#39;m sure I will eventually come to a conclusion.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> That&#39;s why, until that time...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Please...I would like you, Master, to resist any love or affections from anyone who comes your way...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> And wait...for me...<br> I would...appreciate that...</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> ...Would you be able to forgive me for thinking and wishing this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I, uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Thank you very much, Master.<br> I&#39;m going to keep trying my best.</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> I will eventually come to a conclusion.<br> Even before Kiyohime whisks you away.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AKiyohime (Ambush):</strong><br> Did you call for me, my dear Anchin!?</p><p><strong>Serenity:</strong><br> Eh...uh...um...seriously?<br> Presence Concealment?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong><br> Oh, no.
