It is possible for him to create a special crystal called the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements called Elementals, robots (homunculi) endowed with advanced judgement abilities and a multibody synchronized thinking faculty, and so on. In addition, mass production of gemstones used for Gem Magecraft is possible by utilizing a Spiritual Ley Line connected to his territory.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>High-Speed Incantation: [A]</strong></p><p>The ability to speak magical incantations at an accelerated speed. Paracelsus is able to finish Great Magecraft incantations in one step (at the speed of a Single Action).</p><p>In addition to this, for his case, Paracelsus attempts to make his Gem Magecraft (specifically, his Philosopher\u2019s Stones) more efficient by combining them with his High-Speed Incantations.</p><p><strong>Elemental: [A+]</strong></p><p>The ability to employ artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements. Paracelsus also names these artificial spirits Elementals, or Elemental Masses more informally. They are literally magical existences created by using crystals of each elemental attribute, in which they are clumped together super densely, as a base. For example, a Fire Elemental Mass is something made from agglomerated flames, and it can manipulate ultra-high heat. If it is an Earth Elemental Mass, it is endowed with an ultra-high mass as well as a hardness equal to adamantine (diamond). (In addition, because the Void/Ether Elemental Mass is something different from \u201CEther Clumps\u201D, so to speak, one should be careful.) Although it depends on the labour expended in its creation, they can also be manipulated as familiars that are feasible enough to support oneself even in Servant battles to some extent.</p><p><strong>Philosopher\u2019s Stone: [A]</strong></p><p>The technique to manipulate a Magical Energy Accumulation Crystal\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015or a Photonic Crystal more informally, that was purified by oneself. The rank greatly fluctuates according to the degree of purity that one can attain. Although various effects can be demonstrated depending on the rank, if it is at least Rank A, it is even possible to bring about a pseudo-immortality upon any given target.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="sword-of-paracelsus-the-magic-sword-of-the-elementalist" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sword-of-paracelsus-the-magic-sword-of-the-elementalist" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sword of Paracelsus: The Magic Sword of the Elementalist</h1><ul><li>Rank: A+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~99</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people</li></ul><p>The original Azoth Sword.

The whole sword blade is composed of Philosopher\u2019s Stones purified to an ultra-high density. Its original effect is to amplify/supplement/strengthen the power of Magecraft.</p><p>Paracelsus does not use this sword to attack his target(s) directly, but he instead exercises Ritual Magecraft instantly with the Magical Energy charged up within the sword, and by making use of all the Five Elements, a pseudo-composition of True Ether \u2013 which was viewed as the Magical Energy that the world from the Age of Gods was filled with \u2013 is stimulated.

Paracelsus\u2019 temperament is mild and he does not like combat. Regarding young companions, he has joy in teaching and guiding them without his cool, calm and collected attitude being disturbed, even frequently expressing this joy by showing a smile on his mouth.</p><p>Unusual for a mage, Paracelsus advocates that human affection is a precious quality. He regards all modern mages far and wide as the descendants of his pupils whom inherited his teachings, receiving them with open affection as if they are like his children. He greatly believes that these men and women have infinite potential and are surely the future, and that the accumulation of their potential will even allow them to eventually arrive at the Root, the Truth of the World. If it is from the perspective of the common mage who honours the mages\u2019 bloodline of individuals and family lineages, his words are close to the state of madness, but he does not intend to bend his beliefs. He is naturally a mad scientist.</p><p>There is absolutely no variation in Paracelsus\u2019 interactions between men and women.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Paracelsus quietly swears allegiance towards his Master. Or rather, it is more accurate to say that he swears friendship. In a situation like in a conventional Holy Grail War where a mage is his Master, he will build an equal relationship as a comrade who aims to reach the Root together with his Master. In the case where his Master does not study Magecraft, he will propose to be their \u201Cfriend\u201D.</p><p>The wish Paracelsus wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cto reach the Root.\u201D Speaking of that furthermore, he surely wishes to ascertain his personal opinion that the Ether that consists of the Truth \u2013 which once filled this world \u2013 and the light of the planet (like that of the Sacred Sword for instance) were probably the lights shining out of the Root\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015or, so it was. It may not come to light that he, as of the present time, is seeking atonement instead.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CPlease, become friends with me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAll my dear children whom fill this earth, you are the brilliance of the precious stars.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThe Ether\u2019s finality\u2026 I think it will lead to the ritual of the Age of Gods that was lost.

In the 16th Century, Paracelsus von Hohenheim is known as a historic figure who played an active role in the Renaissance Period. Spanning over the course of his lifetime, he devoted himself to the studies of medicine and alchemy, having left behind many achievements and books such as the \u201CRediscovery of the Four (Five) Elements\u201D and the \u201CRediscovery of the Three Primes\u201D.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A rare figure who left his name in both human and magic history. A powerful mage (Average One) who is endowed with the attribute of \u201CVoid\u201D in addition to the four attributes of \u201CEarth\u201D, \u201CWater\u201D, \u201CFire\u201D and \u201CWind\u201D, studied Gem Magecraft, and was also considered to have deeply influenced the development of alchemy as a Magic Foundation. In the significance of the Magic Foundation of what mages far and wide was taught as alchemy in the modern era, there is a likelihood that this one man is the pioneer that deeply engraved alchemy into this world. Although Paracelsus was a person who was close with the Clock Tower, it is said that he exceptionally conducted networking with both the Atlas Academy and the Wandering Sea, having advanced their mutual researches.</p><p>However, as one can further understand from the matter of his name being visibly left behind in history, Paracelsus has a tendency to \u201Cspread to people\u201D the secrets of Mysteries that should have essentially been concealed, having continued to publish towards the general public a fragment of his magical research as theories while ignoring the inhibitions of the Clock Tower and the warnings extended to him from that association again and again, and in his final moments, he lost his life to enforcement figures from the Magic Association as he was in the process of increasing the production of his Philosopher\u2019s Stones and distributing these mass-produced items. During the occasion of assassins having arrived at his mansion, it is said that he showed absolutely no panic in his bearing, having greeted them while smiling.</p><p>A rare mage who surely loves children and values humanity. That is indeed Paracelsus von Hohenheim\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015However. The possibility of him suddenly abandoning his entire creed and falling into injustice is also by no means zero. For example, what if there is something like a situation where he came across someone connected to the Root itself that he is aiming for?</p><h2 id="colour-correspondence-of-the-five-elements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#colour-correspondence-of-the-five-elements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Colour Correspondence of the Five Elements</h2><p>Earth (Yellow), Water (Silver), Fire (Red), Wind (Blue), Ether (A deep Purple close to Black).</p><p>At the time when the colours were established for the Five Elements in Western Magecraft, the basis of the colour scheme is the same as the assignments based on India\u2019s Tattva.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Paracelsus can carry out long distance attacks by means of Magecraft.

A mage who possessed noble thoughts, and although their research contents differ, Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him. Since he is aware of Makiri as an idealist who should be a noble and respectable person, even if he saw Makiri at the time of the 21st Century, it does not appear likely that Paracelsus will regard him as the very same person.</p><p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong></p><p>As a matter of fact, another acquaintance during his lifetime. Paracelsus deeply respects da Vinci, who has been literally omnipotent even in regard to Magecraft. Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him, or something like that, but he feels da Vinci is too awe-inspiring to do so. He often does not remember since when da Vinci did become a woman.</p><p>\u201CWhen I met him for the first time\u2026 well now, which was it\u2026?\u201D</p><p><strong>Arash / Henry Jekyll / Hyde</strong></p><p>\u201C\u2026\u2026 For some reason, it feels like I am about to recall something.\u201D</p><h2 id="comment-from-the-illustrator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment-from-the-illustrator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment from the Illustrator</h2><p>I smile without knowing why every time Paracelsus appears in the game on-screen.
