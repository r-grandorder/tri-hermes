However, the intel-gathering team of the Resistance \u201CHack&amp;Crack\u201D, which placed their headquarters at the Republic of Bangladesh and were mainly active in the Middle East, discovered a group that based itself in the lunar resource exploration headquarters of Akalabeth, which was abandoned by humans in the 2010s, and is continuing lunar exploration. Since large scale data jamming occurred when this gathered intel was being released, its contents are not completely clear. However, a shocking piece of information was revealed in the fragmented contents. That is \u2013 the lunar surface exploration being carried out at Akalabeth is highly likely to be related to the Western European Conglomerate.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[1]</strong> \u2013 NERO = North Earth Resource Organization. An organization of 45 countries that was created due to the urging of the Western European Conglomerate in 2015. Its main goals are to strictly limit the excavation and utilization of earthly and lunar resources, and also suggested a complete ban to space exploration. Since most of the countries in the northern hemisphere had joined it, all resource excavation activities on Earth are in fact controlled by NERO.</p></details><p>Soon after this revelation, the Hack&amp;Crack\u2019s headquarters were discovered by the Indo-American ally force and destroyed with large scale aerial bombing[2]. When this is taken into account, the possibility that \u2018the Western European Conglomerate has obtained and has solely kept some designated-to-be-sealed space exploration technology\u2019 can be regarded as exceedingly strong.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[2]</strong> \u2013 It is well known that the United States of America, the Kingdom of Britain, and the Republic of India are allies of the Western European Conglomerate, and provide for large amounts of the Western European Conglomerate\u2019s military operations.</p></details><p>Since the forbiddance of new satellite launching in 2015, all artificial satellites in orbit can only act through the Western European Conglomerate\u2019s assessment system[3]. Therefore, it is impossible to physically survey the lunar surface. This current event can be said as the solo act of the Western European Conglomerate, which regarded sealing up technologies as correct and as a contribution to world peace.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[3]</strong> \u2013 It is no easy task to evade the assessment of INQ-EXIT, which is the assessment system that enforces all databanks to allow its operation. Communication that did not go through INQ-EXIT had been seen as a breach to International Agreement 404 for a long time.</p></details><p>With gratitude to Hack&amp;Crack\u2019s release of information, the anti-NERO alliance \u2013 comprised of the 68 countries that oppose NERO \u2013 produced an accusing declaration. This, however, was ignored by the NERO countries. As a punishment towards those repetitive and incorrect accusations that threatened the maintenance of peace, NERO decided to impose commercial sanctions to the anti-NERO alliance.</p><p>Also, NERO had been accused by over a thousand not-for-profit investigation organizations for breaching the International Agreement 404[4]. After this, it carried out considerably severe measures[5]. Therefore, all talks of this had ceased.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnotes</summary><p><strong>[4]</strong> \u2013 International Agreement 404. This agreement is also called the designated-to-be-sealed agreement. Its target is chosen by the Western European Conglomerate and would become enforced once the NERO countries agree to the decision. This agreement forbids all forms of contact, investigation, analysis, and declarations related to the target. It is truly a sealing designation.</p><p><strong>[5]</strong> \u2013 All inmates on the death row in North American Union prisons were executed last month. Rumour has it that it was done to ensure there will be places to instill criminals that may breach the Agreement.</p></details><p>Based on the fragmented report that the Hack&amp;Crack intel-gathering team had brought back at the risk of their lives, our editorial group grasped, to some degree, detailed information on what the Western European Conglomerate discovered on the lunar surface.</p><p>We would like to present it here.</p><hr><p><strong>The discovery of the giant hole, and the giant mineral vein slumbering in the Moon</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KNGTYwP.png" alt="GiantHoleOnTheMoon"></p><p>What the Akalabeth exploration team discovered is a giant hole with a depth of a few kilometers. What they discovered within this hole, which can be compared to a crack that bore through the Moon, are pure photon crystals[6] of a shocking volume. According to survey results, its diameter appears to be up to 30km. If this is true, then it would become apparent that apart from its surface portions, the entire Moon is made of a giant photon crystal.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[6]</strong> \u2013 A nano-substance that periodically changes its light refractory index. It is a substance that can control the transmission of light. Apparently, it can create a quantum computer using light itself as the media. Although some progress was made when it was discovered in the early 21st century, humans have only managed to successfully crystallize barely a few centimeters of it. The giant photon crystal slumbering beneath the Moon can be considered as a resonator of light with wave conductors, a super computer of giant size and incredible complexity that was created using nano-particles.</p></details><p>At the same time, the Western European Conglomerate made this enormous photon crystal \u2013 that is, the Moon itself \u2013 a designated-to-be-sealed target. This may appear ridiculous, but us inhabitants of Earth and of NERO countries are forbidden by International Agreement 404 to even discuss about \u2018the Moon\u2019.</p><p>According to their analysis, this giant photon crystal is a substance that can be considered as a quantum computer. That is, a super computer with a processing power that we can\u2019t even measure. Although most super computer development had stopped on Earth since the 2010s and shifted the focus onto cloud computing, the processing power of the entire Internet on Earth cannot hope to match the abilities of this substance. Just who made this giant photon crystal? That remains a mystery. Perhaps the Western European Conglomerate grasped its truth, but the report left by the intel team gave no clues. The Western European Conglomerate called that pseudo-quantum computer, our Moon, as the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019.</p><hr><p><strong>The Divine Automatic Recording Device, the Holy Grail</strong></p><p>The \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 scans the entire Earth about once per nanosecond and compile the results of its scan in its database. Although the time the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 began operating remains unknown, even a conservative estimate based on its composing substance shows it to be older than the Moon itself[7], at an age of approximately 4.6 billion years old[8]. In other words, it is the oldest entity in the Solar System and had been observing us since the birth of Earth. That existence can therefore be called the Eye of God, the Divine Automatic Recording Device.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnotes</summary><p><strong>[7]</strong> \u2013 According to radioactive carbon dating of lunar rocks, the creation of the Moon is about 4.55 billion years ago.</p><p><strong>[8]</strong> \u2013 According to radioactive carbon dating, it seems to be a substance created 4.6 billion years ago.</p></details><p>Unfortunately, we could no longer extract any more information from the analysis report that Hack&amp;Crack members left behind at the risk of their lives. However, taking into account the fate that Hack&amp;Crack suffered and the reaction of the Nero countries (centered around the Western European Conglomerate), we naturally felt the credibility of the Conglomerate initiating lunar exploration and discovering the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 to be high.</p><p>Since we have already received 651 lawsuits from the Western European Conglomerate, the follow-up articles this time would no doubt be sued as well.</p><p>We eagerly pray that one day someone would be able to know the full scope of the great event of human history that is occurring on the surface of the Moon, and bring truth and hope to this world suffocating inthe control of the Western European Conglomerate.</p><h3 id="conspiracy-theory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conspiracy-theory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conspiracy Theory</h3><hr><hr><p><strong>The Conflict of WIZARDS</strong></p><p><strong>Conflict of Wizards: The Eruption of the War of the Holy Grail!?</strong></p><hr><p><strong>\u3010The key phrase \u201CWar of the Holy Grail\u201D suddenly became very popular online recently.\u3011</strong></p><p>We had reported, in our November issue in 2031, the clandestine lunar exploration initiated by the Western European Conglomerate and the discovery of the man-made artefact\u2026 While we still had vivid memories of the impact of the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D that shook the world, currently these events are progressing with new leads.</p><hr><p><strong>\u3010The Earth that is related to the Moon\u3011</strong></p><p>We still do not know just who made the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D and placed it deep beneath the Moon. However, one thing that we can be certain of is that it is an extremely dense and enormous data bank[1]. It is also called the Divine Automatic Recording Device that recorded all of history since the creation of human beings, a pseudo-intelligent being that has the supreme ability to affect the outside world with its internal scintillations[2].</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnotes</summary><p><strong>[1]</strong> \u2013 According to investigation, the processing power observed from the Moon Cell Automaton cannot be estimated. However, we can at least be certain that its memory capacities far surpasses that of all digital media on Earth combined.</p><p><strong>[2]</strong> \u2013 After the discovery made by the Western European Conglomerate, all the Internet inspection systems in the world fell into lament. The reason is hacking from the Moon Cell Automaton. Every system around the world formed a passage with the Moon Cell Automaton within 2 seconds, and a situation where anyone can log on to this path (as long as they can log on the net) was established. It shouldn\u2019t be too far-flung to suppose that the Moon Cell Automaton, which completed this work in 2 seconds, harbours some kind of intelligence \u2013 or even a super-intelligence that humans can\u2019t even fathom. It was proposed that the hacking itself was conducted through the static satellites managed by the Western European Conglomerate.</p></details><hr><p><strong>\u3010The observed abnormalities</strong></p><p>At the same time that the Western European Conglomerate discovered the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D, abnormal phenomena were observed on the Internet. In terms of absolute length, it was such a short period of time that it was almost undetectable by us, but the entire Internet on Earth received a great amount of unknown visitors and many Internet users were momentarily disconnected. It was presumed to be a reverse-connection of the lunar \u201CHoly Grail\u201D towards the Internet on Earth. This report was immediately propelled through the Internet, but it was probably banned soon afterwards and all related news was deleted.</p><hr><p><strong>\u3010The \u201CCyber Deaths\u201D that followed\u3011</strong></p><p>Soon after, an event consisting of the disappearance of famous hackers around the world occurred. After that, the report of the discovery of the bodies of large numbers of hackers also stared at us starkly across newspaper titles. This event that was initially thought of as the doings of some terrorists working for the Western European Conglomerate was later proven to be caused by the hackers themselves, something that has been called \u201CCyber Death\u201D.</p><p>All the disappeared hackers were already corpses when they were discovered at their homes or work places. It has been established that all of them died due to heart attacks of unknown causes. Strictly speaking, we still haven\u2019t established what caused their hearts to stop. However, after analysing the records in the terminals they used to connect to the Internet, the result showed that their own souls were etherised[3]. After autopsies were conducted, it was confirmed that almost all of their cerebral neurons suffered a tremendous overload that caused their cardiac and pulmonary functions to stop. Although the etherisation of souls is a technology still in the middle of being researched, some kinds of humans\u2026 those humans who have the ability to digitalise their own souls have taken an appropriate step onwards.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[3]</strong> \u2013 Something that digitalises the soul, the root and core of all things. Frankly, a concept that should be called the soul; in other words it is the \u2018primordial form of existence\u2019 that can unite all elements. It is something that digitalises a figurative concept and make it materialise, and can also be interpreted as information with life energy, data that gained life. Of course, etherising the soul requires ridiculously large processing powers and memory storage that\u2019s too big even for cloud computing service. A technology that simplified these steps and solely uses the power of the human will to etherise the soul has also been acknowledged as existing.</p></details><hr><p><strong>\u3010Matou Shinji, Asia gaming champion\u3011</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKFmKCi.png" alt="EpicGamerShinji"></p><p>At the same time, we should all be able to recall the news report about how Matou Shinji, famous as the Asia gaming champion[4], was hospitalised due to sickness. The reason was fatigue caused by continuously logged on in the virtual world for 78 consecutive hours. After he was released from the hospital, something immensely interesting was written in his blog. He declared that \u201CThe Holy Grail will become mine\u201D.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[4]</strong> \u2013 The winner of the 2030 world game championships VAMP (Virtual Arcade for Massive-multi Players).

However, there are a few points of interest in his words\u2026</p><hr><p><strong>\u3010The Western European Conglomerate\u2019s inspection intensifies\u3011</strong></p><p>At the same time of Matou Shinji\u2019s \u201Csurvival\u201D, the Western European Conglomerate\u2019s Internet inspection also intensified[5]. As of now, Matou Shinji seems to have avoided the government\u2019s charge; however, many hackers have been arrested and imprisoned.</p><p>The aftershocks of International Agreement 404, which forbids access to classified intel and overwrites all laws with its punishment, did indeed suppress the world\u2019s discussion. It also subdued the build-up of inconvenient truths for the Western European Conglomerate. However, judging from the hasty moves so far, it\u2019s hard not to feel the distressed state the Conglomerate is trying hard to hide.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[5]</strong> \u2013 The enforced update of the inspection system INQ-EXIT that kept up with the version updates of basic OS. In fact, it\u2019s impossible to connect to the net without going through INQ-EXIT. Of course, there existed exceptions in the ways to save your data, but the INQ-EXIT version update this time added on the ability to follow saved data. It\u2019s true that INQ-EXIT had literally become the \u201CInquisitor\u201D</p></details><hr><p><strong>\u3010The hero of Resistance, Tohsaka Rin\u3011</strong></p><p>Moreover, the famous Tohsaka Rin, who is known as the hero of Resistance, also made some strange comments in our interview. Please look to her interview for details. In it, she had clearly stated that \u201CThe War of the Holy Grail has begun\u201D. The \u201CHoly Grail\u201D that far surpasses human intelligence, the pseudo-quantum computer on the Moon, and the war beneath the surface surrounding the ownership of this man-made artefact that has yet to be claimed by any man; is this what has been called \u201Cthe War of the Holy Grail\u201D? All reports and news articles about the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D has been sealed and it hard to discern the truth in it. We would like to pool all that we know together and end this report thus.</p><hr><p><strong>\u3010The inspection also relates to academia\u3011</strong></p><p>The Second University of Tokyo\u2019s High-Tech Intel and Science Research Institute is famous for its research of the Internet. The latest research topic here is the digitalisation of the soul; in other words, turning the soul into ether. Although it is widely recorded that certain unique talents are required to digitalise the soul, only a very small number of humans in the entire world have such talents. A list of people with the ability to digitalise souls[6] are stored in the Institute\u2019s research subject list. According to our investigation, 97.2% of hackers who have been arrested and exposed by the Western European Conglomerate are recorded in this list in the form of symbols.</p><p>In other words, isn\u2019t the Western European Conglomerate trying to seal the connection with the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D through sealing the Wizards able to etherise souls?</p><p>Large portions of the truth are buried in the darkness. Many people who have the right to connect to the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D have been buried by the Western European Conglomerate. Just what is the truth that they are trying so hard to hide? After this, we would like to tear apart the darkness of the Western European Conglomerate\u2019s savage control of information, and convey the truth to our readers.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[6]</strong> \u2013 They are called \u2018Wizards\u2019 by the Institution.</p></details><h3 id="red-hot-scoop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#red-hot-scoop" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Red-hot SCOOP</h3><hr><hr><p><strong>INTERVIEW WITH RIN TOSAKA</strong></p><p><strong>An exclusive interview with the beacon of the Resistance \u2013 Tohsaka Rin</strong></p><hr><p>We have successfully obtained an exclusive interview with the special technology consultant of the previously-destroyed Hack&amp;Crack, and the hero of Resistance who became famous for participating in many Resistance battles \u2013 the modern magician, Tohsaka Rin.

The Middle East is her main area of operations. Moreover, the Tohsaka house fell into obscurity since the 1990s.</p><hr><p>\u2014 Thank you very much for kindly agreeing to our interview today.</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> There\u2019s no need. It&#39;s all because my employer was nagging me about how promoting us is also a part of our job, so I had to accept it. Cos it gives us money, and we can\u2019t turn that away.</p><p>\u2014 Really? You were originally a tech staff with no affiliation. Now, it seems you use the Middle East as your headquarters most often. Were you alright when Hack&amp;Crack was attacked by NERO?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> I simply detected the attack by the Western European Conglomerate and escaped to a safe place. Although I passed that information to other members, they prioritised our equipment, materials and data over their own lives\u2026 I don\u2019t think I need to repeat the outcome of that. At that time, we only managed to save the things most important to us.</p><p>\u2014 What kind of work does Hack&amp;Crack do?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> We\u2019re a coordinated effect in investigating novel hacking skills. I provide the resource known as \u2018me\u2019, and they provide the equipment and materials.</p><p>\u2014 Can you be more specific?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> Our goal was to ascertain the skill needed to infiltrate the Moon Cell Automaton. After all, Hack&amp;Crack wasn\u2019t eliminated just because we obtained the evidence of lunar development by the Western European Conglomerate. Rather, it was us having clues on how to infiltrate the Moon Cell Automaton that angered the Western European Conglomerate.</p><p>\u2014 Did the Western European Conglomerate want to eliminate that technology \u2013 or rather, you \u2013 along with Hack&amp;Crack?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> The Western European Conglomerate is attempting to infiltrate the Moon Cell Automaton, but their technology is something from 30 years ago. They cannot communicate with the Moon Cell apart from physical contact, and they can only literally go to the lunar surface to attempt to directly contact the Holy Grail. However, we have another portal. The Moon Cell completed the reverse-connection of almost the entire Internet on Earth, right? We can manage to log on over the Net too. As long as we can make an etherised saved file and be able to read it.</p><p>\u2014 Etherisation\u2026 what is this concept that was publicized in the latter half of the 90s, and was called a magical theory?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> True. We can\u2019t match the Holy Grail\u2019s processing powers if we intervene using older programming. Even if we\u2019re talking about the extent of cloud computing utilizing the calculating power of a few continents, we can\u2019t even manage to indirectly infiltrate it. We can only connect to the Holy Grail via the Net if we etherise the soul itself. Even so, only those humans whom can accomplish this\u2026 Wizards\u2026 are allowed to connect to the Holy Grail.</p><p>\u2014 Does the Western European Conglomerate know this too?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> Yes. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve exposed and arrested Wizards who have yet logged on. It\u2019d be troublesome if the Moon Cell is easily infiltrated. In other words, the only thing they don&#39;t have are those Wizard-grade hackers. Since I don\u2019t like the Western European Conglomerate either and got hired by the Resistance, I want to provide results that exceed my employer\u2019s expectations.</p><p>\u2014 It seems you want to start a war against the Western European Conglomerate.</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> But I don\u2019t want to start something as wasteful of resources as a war. It\u2019s just that the way the Western European Conglomerate does things is against my personality. Even if I wasn\u2019t hired by the Resistance, I would probably still fight against them in some other way. And as for the international manhunt for me, all I have to say is that unfortunately, the war has left the Earth and moved to the Moon\u2026 to the Moon Cell itself. Also, there are many other Wizard-grade hackers apart from me. They\u2019re probably being very busy right now because before I agreed to this interview, I have revealed to the entire world the method of logging onto the Holy Grail.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W3PPCBm.png" alt="HackerRin"></p><p>\u2014 You mean that document currently stirring up the entire inspection system? Are the things written in it true?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> It\u2019s what the Hack&amp;Crack research team and I compiled after 3 years. Of course, not everyone can master it. However, those hackers who can apply these novel infiltrating methods\u2026 those outstanding Wizards\u2026 may be able to implement them.</p><p>\u2014 We would also like to help via distribution of this interview all over the world. Speaking of which, can you tell us the way to connect to that document?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> Right. Since digital media are untrustworthy, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to leave an entrance in the virtual media. However, there were quite a few levels of security. It\u2019s my little challenge to everyone else. The final information is hidden on the Net, away from INQ-EXIT\u2019s inspections. Although I imagine the Western European Conglomerate have yet to find it, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they intervene. The key needed to connect to the place where the information was hidden is located in the UVD-ROM, and it was scattered everywhere. I don\u2019t know who will have possession of it at the end, but for those of you who have the ROM, please have a go at connecting.</p><p>\u2014 How can someone obtain that UVD-ROM?</p><p><strong>Tohsaka:</strong> As for that\u2026 embarrassingly, there aren\u2019t a lot of it. The guy responsible for promotions was too stingy. However, because of it was of a make that anyone can obtain if you get proactive with the hints I left outside of the ROM the best way that I could, those who read this interview should be able to detect it. Although I do not know who might have them, please challenge it \u2013 those of you who managed to obtain the ROM.</p><p>If you want to be freed from this ruled and suppressed world.</p><p>\u2014 Thank you for your time at such a busy moment.

However, before he released his latest work \u201CMoon Princess\u201D, which was eagerly expected by gaming fans all over the world, he had disappeared without a trace. No one knows whether mysterious novelist (we aren\u2019t even sure of his gender) is dead or still alive. It had been more than 10 years since his disappearance. Also, it is still a mystery whether the character that appeared in \u201CHeaven\u2019s Feel Online\u201D, which is similar to the said novelist, is actually himself or a NPC. At least, the management company have denied the NPC theory.</p><p><em>[Bryn&#39;s notes: The above is Nasu taking a stab at himself...]</em></p><hr><p><strong>CASE 2</strong></p><p>Jessica Hilton has been emerging in \u201CReal Life\u201D[6], famous as a large-scale dating sit-com digital communication hub. People have witnessed her in all corners of the virtual world since \u201CReal Life\u201D opened its services. Endless rumours started, such as \u2018it\u2019s as if she\u2019s existing in the virtual world 24 hours a day, 365 days a year\u201D. There was also the contemplation that she is a NPC prepared by the managing company, but the company had denied the theory that Jessica Hilton = NPC.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[6]</strong> \u2013 A virtual communication hub service. A total of 35 million people have used since its launch in 2025. It is also famous for its high charge. Since the majority of its users are of an older age and are likely to be married, it has been slandered as \u201CSecond Wife\u201D.</p></details><hr><p><strong>CASE 3</strong></p><p>The rumour that \u2018the ghosts of the residents who lived in the experimental city on the sea, which was destroyed in a large-scale disaster last year, have been emerging in all sorts of virtual-reality services\u201D. There were no survivors from this city.</p><hr><p><strong>CASE 4</strong></p><p>The white-clad man that became the hot topic amongst hackers. It has been said that he would appear if you connect to the net for long enough. Rumour has it that he would chat to the user in a gentle tone and call for people to participate in \u2018the War of the Holy Grail\u201D. It is still unclear what the \u201CWar of the Holy Grail\u201D that the white-clad man spoke of is.</p><hr><p>Also, there are some who thought of this simply as things we can dismiss as stories and urban legends. The development of Autonomous AIs, things that can truly be called Artificial Intelligence, has been stagnant for a long time. On the other hand, although humans gave up trying to complete it, the development of intelligence-mimicking and limited AIs has rapidly accelerated in the extremely-digitalised modern era. This is especially so in the sex industry[7].</p><p>Such an overwhelming number of complicated service programs are related to the urban legend of Cyber Ghost\u2026 Although we cannot prove this possibility, we can neither deny its existence in this vast sea-like Internet, which has ignored the stagnant scientific development of the world and endlessly progressed towards further complexity and advancements.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[7]</strong> \u2013 In the 2020s, all countries in the world have started to make the sex industry government-owned, and 32.7% of the market is actually virtual-reality AI experience.

As of now, 48 countries are supervised by NERO, which is in turn governed by the Western European Conglomerate. It has been said that using these 48 countries, the Western European Conglomerate controls 67% of the global economy and 90% of the global military force. In fact, the majority of the \u2018world\u2019, when we speak of the word, refers to countries governed by the Western European Conglomerate.</p><p><strong>[2]</strong> \u2013 This refers to the countries and regions not controlled by the Western European Conglomerate. It mainly refers to areas where Resistance powers are active and are only weakly influenced by the Western European Conglomerate, namely the Middle East and up to north India and the eastern seaboard of China. Of special mention is the African continent, where the two forces are in conflict.</p><p><strong>[3]</strong> \u2013 The manufacture of clones is designated-to-be-sealed by the Western European Conglomerate due to the International Agreement 404. Of course, it is also prohibited by the law of the majority of countries in the world.</p></details><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KSrioTd.png" alt="leak"></p><p>This is a fragment of the report gained through infiltrating Atlas for investigational purposes, and having ascertained the manufacture of clones. It can be used as evidence towards crimes such as modifying genetic codes.</p><hr><p><strong>[Chasing the darkness of manufacturing clones]</strong></p><p>Within the African continent, which was contested by the Chinese and the Western European Conglomerate, the issue of manufacturing and trading clones have been brought up numerous times since the mid-2010s. It is conducted in a scale that can now be paralleled to slave-trading. As goods, these clones are not only sold within the continent, but are continuously exported in secret to developed countries concentrated in Europe, Asia, and North America. Therefore, it became as complicated as the firearm export routes back in the 2000s, and each good would have been through tens of countries to hide their origins. Therefore, the investigational bodies could not uproot the clone manufacture and trading network. Truth is, they can\u2019t even obtain evidence for these transactions.</p><p>Due to our exclusive sources, we have ascertained that the headquarters of an international criminal organisation involved in clone transactions is located in the Republic of Egypt.</p><p>The Resistance force has spread throughout the Middle East towards the north of India and the Far East, and the Western European Conglomerate has encircled the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans with its centre in Europe, India, and North America; an empty space where neither powers could reach is the African Belt that starts from the Republic of Egypt and extended to United States of Beafera[4]. The criminal organisations placed their power centre at this African location, and shipped the \u2018goods\u2019 that are gathered by northern African states such as Egypt from the north to the southwest, and export them from the United States of Beafera.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[4]</strong> \u2013 A small country in southeast Africa that became independent in 2016. Some international organisations have pointed to it as \u2018a puppet regime that relies on criminal organisations\u2019.</p></details><p>Then, their origins became concealed as they were shipped into the embraces of the buyers through a complicated route. That is where our investigation currently stands.</p><p>There are some accusations on the lines of \u2018the United States of Beafera is just a puppet regime of the criminal organisations\u2019. Because the United States of Beafera didn\u2019t join NERO and gave up the right to excavate resources, even NERO does not have a reason to undertake military action against it. The truth is, in the current world where countries have in fact lost their power, it is impossible to attack the United States of Beafera on a humanitarian basis. After all, in the modern era, the 2030s, the United States of Beafera is one of the only countries left that refused to connect to the Internet. In fact, there are no ways to investigate it apart from slipping in through its physical borders.</p><p>We have given up on the idea of investigating in the United States of Beafera, where information is tightly censored, and focused on Egypt, which is regarded as the purchasing and wholesale centre of these \u2018goods\u2019.</p><p>What emerged was the fact that \u2018with regard to the providers of the vast clone market, a large amount of them are within the African continent\u2019.</p><p>Afterwards, a very mysterious organisation emerged as one of the main buyers in the African continent. Its name is the Atlas Academy.</p><hr><p><strong>[The modern mystery realm, Atlas Academy]</strong></p><p>The origins of Atlas Academy are terribly ancient. It is a collective organisation made up of fringe scientists who call themselves \u2018the father of magecraft\u2019. However, it has been an organisation of alchemists in the past, and to this day it is still active in the darkness of history. They constrain themselves with their unique creed, and would never interact with the outside world[5].</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[5]</strong> \u2013 The Atlas Academy that stirred in the darkness of history\u2026 according to their creed, there once existed on the world something called \u2018magecraft\u2019, which controlled the \u2018magical force\u2019 \u2013 Mana \u2013 that exists within nature and the environment. They also held that many magi had existed. However, Mana became exhausted in the world, and they believe only the Atlas Academy preserved the knowledge and skills required to lead towards \u2018magecraft\u2019. On an objective viewpoint, although they are an existence that is infinitesimally close to scientists, they probably never communicated with the human world due to their unique creed. Therefore, their existence has almost been wiped out from orthodox history records.</p></details><p>Endless dark rumours encircled Atlas Academy. In detail, it concerns purchasing large amounts of clones, nurturing them in the Altas facilities, and apply all sorts of human modification. To go a step further, there are also rumours that they have added requirements on the genetic DNA of the \u2018goods\u2019.</p><p>According to the documents we have acquired, Atlas Academy began to touch upon clone transactions in the year 2021. Hundreds of \u2018goods\u2019 are purchased every year, and in the recent years this number had been gradually increasing.</p><p>What we will introduce next is a photo we have taken when we infiltrated Atlas Academy. A girl was lying on the floor of the facilities, not even wearing undergarments, and gazed at the journalist with an empty stare that didn\u2019t even have any feelings of shame. Judging from the photo, she can be presumed to be of Indian origin, and we couldn\u2019t help but feel that the criminal organisation\u2019s clone-transaction network has extended to all areas of the world.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EUYdwrJ.jpeg" alt="RaniVIII"></p><p><code>\u2191 A picture that was successfully captured during the undercover investigation. The girl on the floor was connected to a machine, and just laid there listlessly.</code></p><p>It is very difficult to expose the full extent of the clone market. However, after having thoroughly investigated their purchasing records, we have discovered the special properties of the \u2018goods\u2019 that the Atlas Academy purchases. The Atlas Academy is currently purchasing, in large amounts, \u2018goods\u2019 that have special genetic codes that they call \u2018Magic Circuits\u2019[6]. Moreover, some purchasing records also hint that there are clone manufactories within Africa that specifically supply to Atlas.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Footnote</summary><p><strong>[6]</strong> \u2013 An ability that enables a human to understand his own soul as a material, and enables the digitalisation of the soul. It should be a physical trait that is inherited and cannot be learnt through training.</p></details><p>The clone market in Africa is extremely advanced due to the large demand, and it is very difficult to uproot it due to the reasons listed above. Even if they are to break the International Agreement 404, the Western European Conglomerate cannot launch military attacks as long as these countries give up the right to resource utilisation.</p><p>The countries oppressed by the Western European Conglomerate have suffered innumerable trampling of human rights. However, in the continent of darkness that their eyes couldn\u2019t reach, repulsive events that threaten the very dignity of life are currently increasing. For us, and for the Western European Conglomerate, there is currently no method to solve this problem. However, we\u2019d like to expose this problem through our continuing investigation and reports.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AurbMWo.png" alt="Back"></p>', 191);
