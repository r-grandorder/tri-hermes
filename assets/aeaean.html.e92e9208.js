I can imagine such a scene all too easily.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Well, bully for you!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> But, never mind that for now.<br> So, what&#39;s it gonna be, Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Just so you know, I got no problem<br> whatsoever with you staying behind.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a minute Singularity, after all,<br> so three Servants ought to be plenty.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What about me?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What, you thought I was counting you? Do I look like a guy who needs help from a talking teddy bear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Orion&#39;s more levelheaded than you&#39;d think.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Oho, very perceptive of you, Master.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It&#39;s true. I&#39;m very good at taking a step back and seeing the larger picture.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Uh...

I need some time to think.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> (Uh... Why&#39;s Ms. Queen Witch just sitting on a corner of the bed shaking like a leaf?)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Well, ready or not, we&#39;re leaving.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m sure we can make do just fine without a queen witch or two.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><h1 id="wha" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wha" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Wha...!?</h1><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> C-c-come on, Jason, don&#39;t be rude.<br> Who couldn&#39;t use a queen witch to help them out?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...All right, let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Huh? Wait! Hang on!<br> I still need more time to\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That felt even faster than usual...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> We could&#39;ve waited all day and it wouldn&#39;t have made any difference. Now come on, Queen Witch.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I knew I had a bad feeling about this.<br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hmm. This certainly is a lovely place.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Just look at the colors of that beautiful Greek sea.<br> I&#39;d better get a picture of it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> You know, I&#39;ve been wondering this for a while,<br> Georgios: Where&#39;d you get that camera, anyway?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say. Photography became a favored hobby of mine before I&#39;d even realized it had happened.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Perhaps I wished for it upon winning a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I kid, of course.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ......Right! Of course! (I can never<br> tell when serious guys like this are joking.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh. That didn&#39;t take long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like there&#39;s a Servant<br> reading not too far from you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> So we&#39;ve got a Rogue Servant, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. They seem to be an unknown Heroic Spirit that<br> isn&#39;t registered in Chaldea&#39;s Spirit Origin graph.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> We don&#39;t yet know if they&#39;re friend or foe,<br> so we&#39;ll need to approach them carefully.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yeah, sure, makes sense.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Though you know, a Rogue Servant&#39;s<br> a hell of a thing to call someone.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What do you expect? They&#39;re not exactly wild Servants either, so what we call them should reflect that.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Now, musclehead types like Atalante or Penthesilea?<br> Those are what I&#39;d call wild Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Jason? I feel I should let you know that both Atalante and Penthesilea are here in the Command Room...</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong><br> Congratulations, Jason. You have earned yourself a very warm welcome indeed on your return.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Please, permit me to be among<br> those who welcomes you back.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Tell me, Jason, what role in such a party appeals to you? A live archery target, or a crash test dummy?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Dammit Mash, why didn&#39;t you tell me who else was there with you sooner!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Are you TRYING to get me killed!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t you just...not say anything mean?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Who asked you, Mr. Rational!?<br> I can&#39;t help it if I have opinions I need to share!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> That sort of thing is exactly what people mean by<br> \u201Cputting one&#39;s foot in one&#39;s mouth.\u201D</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> (Sighhh)... I am so not feeling up for this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is everything okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, don&#39;t worry.<br> This is just a mental problem, not a physical one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you really have that many bad memories associated with Aeaea Island?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...No, most of them are pretty good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But there is one really bad memory that kind of<br> feels like it&#39;s tainting all the good ones...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You mean Odysseus?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Cripes! Anyone ever told you you can<br> be a real insensitive jerk sometimes!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Tons.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Then why the hell haven&#39;t you<br> done anything about it by now!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, it was just a matter of time until it came to light, anyway. I mean, your legend&#39;s one of the most famous around.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> You know it too, right, Master?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You bet.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Craaap.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I guess that at least means I don&#39;t have to tell you about it, huh? Now come on, let&#39;s keep moving!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Long story short, she basically just got her ass dumped by the guy she was in love with.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Did you have to put it that bluntly!?<br> Ugh, guys like you are exactly why I hate human royalty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not really...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Great! Trust me, Piglet, you&#39;re better off not knowing!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, I suppose I can take the<br> opportunity to fill you in.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Don&#39;t. You. Dare.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It was after the Trojan War had come to an end.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Odysseus had set sail to return to his homeland...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You. Little. Bastard.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...only for him and his crew to end up adrift at sea.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Eventually, they all washed up here on Aeaea Island.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> But unfortunately for them, that misanthropic queen witch there had been changing every human who set foot on her island into wild animals.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Boars, lions, wolves, you name it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Odysseus&#39;s crew fared no better,<br> as she turned them all into pigs.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Enraged, Odysseus turned his sword on her, nearly killing her, and she made some quick apologies.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Urk, ack, gah...<br> (Writhing in agony)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> After that, Odysseus agreed to stay with her in exchange for her turning his crew back to normal.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Damn, now that I think about it, you&#39;re a lot better at cutting deals than I realized.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S what you&#39;re impressed with!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> However, Odysseus was already married<br> to a woman named Penelope.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> So once he&#39;d recovered his strength on Aeaea Island,<br> he decided to resume his journey homeward.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><p>(Curling up in the fetal position)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> And that&#39;s when her ass got dumped!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Gee, thanks for explaining the most painful episode of my life in excruciating detail, guys! How would you like me to turn you into pigs in gratitude!?</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hey, Master, is that the Rogue Servant over there?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> &#39;Cause he doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s doing too good, what with being sprawled out on the ground and all.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Those Demonic Beasts sniffing around him don&#39;t look like good news, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> W-we&#39;d better go save him!</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Agreed. Come, let us be on our way!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hang on. I still have something to sa\u2013</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Will you just help us already!?</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> There we go.<br> All right, everyone.</p><p><strong>All:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Say cheese.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Okay, I know I smiled on reflex,<br> but was that picture really necessary?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> You can&#39;t put a price on memories.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> (Sigh) Don&#39;t you think we should wake that Servant up and make sure he&#39;s okay before we start arguing about photo ops?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I swear, you heroes never think about anyone but yourselves.

They are both legendary heroes... Is that who you two are?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Not me. My name is Georgios. This tiny bear is Orion.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> And the man standing there with his arms crossed,<br> ready to turn tail and run at a moment&#39;s notice...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...though you wouldn&#39;t know it to<br> look at him, of course...is Jason.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hey!

Great, just great.

They were never here before!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> So we have a clear discrepancy between this place and the true Aeaea Island.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> It seems whoever&#39;s behind this is practically inviting us in. What do you think we should do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ll just have to see what&#39;s down there.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Anyone NOT want to go down there?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Yes! Me!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> In my opinion, do an about-face,<br> leave this Singularity, and head right back home!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Ha ha ha, and what would that solve?<br> Denied.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Tch.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Well, come on, an underground labyrinth?

Trust this god...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong><br> Both Mephisto and Shakespeare are lying liars...</p><p><strong>Great Stone Statue God:</strong><br> Trust the gods...

What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask me, Shielder.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> All I can say is that only one<br> of these doors is the right one.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> So we have three people,<br> each in front of a different door.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I suppose this means our task<br> is to choose the correct one.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> But the only leads we have to go on<br> are these three&#39;s testimonies...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> So this is the paradox.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Somebody here is lying,<br> and somebody is telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Except...is that even possible when we<br> don&#39;t know how many of them are liars?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Good question.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> For example, say that Mephistopheles is telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> By extension, that would mean that both<br> Shakespeare and the statue are lying.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> However, the statue is also telling us that Mephistopheles and Shakespeare are the ones lying.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> And here, we have a fatal contradiction.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Because if the statue is lying...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...that would mean both Mephistopheles<br> and Shakespeare are telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Indeed.

So basically, you just goofed up.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> In that case, this will all come down to<br> who can best match Circe beat for beat.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Master is automatically out, of course.<br> We can&#39;t risk putting [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] in any danger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> So that just leaves us.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Me? Stay in sync with Circe? Queen Witch Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s never happening.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Same goes for me.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Considering that Arjuna and I come from<br> very different times and cultures...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...Odysseus would seem the most sensible choice.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Forget it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Why?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I can&#39;t explain why.<br> I just don&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> If I teamed up with Odysseus here, it would feel like the gods\u2013er, god, has me dancing right in the palm of her hand!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, yeah, in one sense, you definitely would be,<br> but come on, this is no time to be selfish.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I said forget it!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Ugh. Go on, Master, give her a good scolding.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If Circe doesn&#39;t want to, we can&#39;t force her.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> We can&#39;t!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Ghh... D-dammit. Now that you&#39;ve said that...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...it really does make me feel<br> like I&#39;m just being selfish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So if not Odysseus, who would you be willing to dance with?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, definitely not Jason or Orion.<br> I mean, talk about being out of the question.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What was that!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any intention of teaming up with you either, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m out of the question!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never been so humiliated!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Medea.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Lady Artemis.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> As for Arjuna and Georgios...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Nnn, something tells me we wouldn&#39;t<br> be able to stay in sync very well...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I am uncertain how much basis that opinion has in fact, but I still agree.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So it looks like...<br> Nnn...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You really are the only choice...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I guess...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> So it would seem. But at least neither of us has anything to be embarrassed about at this point.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> After all, we&#39;re already dead.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, yeah, I know...<br> But it&#39;s still complicated for me, all right!?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> This is what we have to do to make<br> our way through the Labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sure you have your reasons for disliking me...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...but I hope you can put them aside,<br> at least for the moment.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> See!? That, right there!<br> THAT&#39;S what I don&#39;t like about you!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Unfortunately, this seems to just be who I am.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Man, I&#39;m glad I put these limiters on my feelings.<br> We could&#39;ve ended up killing each other here otherwise.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> All right, I&#39;ve had enough.

Jump!<br> Together and turn!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> They really do work well together.<br> I knew this was the right call.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> NO COMMENTS FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> One, two, three...<br> And turn!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It really does look like ballroom dancing.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, this isn&#39;t as easy as we make it look!<br> We&#39;re fighting for our lives out here!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> If a goddess is behind this disturbance,<br> then these lasers must pack quite a punch.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Duck!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Riiiight!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hahaha, looks like Odysseus is<br> fighting pretty desperately too\u2013</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Hey. How did a lock of my prized blond hair just burn away?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Are you telling me this is an actual death trap!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Why do you think we&#39;re fighting<br> for our lives right now!?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> All that said, it really is a lovely dance.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Okay, you two, let&#39;s see those pearly whites.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Now!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Fine! You want us to smile? We&#39;ll smile!<br> But we&#39;re also gonna duck...now!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> There, we made it!<br> Time to shut this thing down!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> It looks like the lasers are gone.<br> Shall we be on our way then?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Guess it was too much to hope we wouldn&#39;t<br> have to fight another battle, too.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I see the goddess wasn&#39;t exaggerating about her whims.

Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Did you seal your emotions away with magecraft again?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Again?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> You did that a number of times when I was here, too.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Whoa, really?<br> What was I like then?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> You mean you don&#39;t remember?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Uh, no. Not at all.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...To be honest, I don&#39;t know if<br> I can bring myself to tell you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> And why is that!?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Hahahaha. Forgive me, I was only joking.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...<br> ...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, Odysseus, let me ask you something.<br> What do you think of me?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Good question.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> You are the proud queen witch,<br> and a wise sage knowledgeable in all things.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I only wish you would do something about your habit of turning people into animals.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hmph.<br> I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;m selective about who I turn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really!? You are!?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Aah! Master!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> To be perfectly honest, Circe...I&#39;ve always thought<br> you would turn anyone and everyone into pigs.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Indeed, I&#39;ve long had the same impression.<br> Do you actually have some sort of criteria?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Sure I do!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But I&#39;m not gonna tell you guys what it is.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> That&#39;s all right.<br> I already know what your criteria is.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You do!? How?<br> I didn&#39;t think I ever told anyone.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s only a guess on my part, and I could be wrong.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> But regardless, I&#39;ll keep it to myself,<br> since I&#39;m sure you&#39;d prefer it remain a secret.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (So they&#39;ve got their own little secret!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Y-yes, it&#39;s very exciting, isn&#39;t it, Senpai?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Really, criteria or not, I wish you&#39;d juststop turning people into pigs altogether...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Sorry, but I&#39;m not gonna give it up now.<br> Turning people into piglets is kind of my thing.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you try being turned into a piglet<br> yourself and see how YOU like it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Another photo, Georgios?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> I just had to capture that wonderful expression on your face.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I see. I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Now then, let&#39;s go see the goddess who stole my<br> memories and made this Singularity, shall we?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Once we do that, this case will be firmly closed.<br> I think.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Okay. Then let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> But first...I&#39;m feeling rather hungry.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> As a Rogue Servant, I apparently don&#39;t have<br> enough magical energy to sustain myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What can we do?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Forming a contract would be the<br> quickest way to remedy it, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that would be very wise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Want to form a contract then?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;d better not.</p><hr><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Minute or not, a goddess is still<br> involved with this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> So you shouldn&#39;t go around forming contracts with Servants unless you&#39;re absolutely sure you can trust them.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Does that mean you don&#39;t even<br> trust yourself?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> In that case, maybe a meal could replenish your magical energy? And I&#39;ve got just the dish in mind!

Okay, I&#39;ll tell you. There&#39;s plenty of examples to draw on from our corner of the world.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> There&#39;s King Lycaon, who Zeus turned into a wolf<br> and banished for killing his own infant son.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> There&#39;s Actaeon, who got turned into a stag and<br> eaten just because he happened to see Artemis bathing.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> There&#39;s Callisto, who got turned into a, um...bear...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Indeed, tales of transformation are found<br> in legends all throughout the world.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> People are said to have been turned into wolves, serpents, bears...and of course, dragons, like in Fafnir&#39;s case.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Incidentally, bears are said to symbolize lechery.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can totally see that.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Me too... No, wait!<br> I can&#39;t let myself see that!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> However\u2013and this may be because pigs have long been kept as livestock...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> ...it is rare for people to be<br> turned into pigs, even in myth.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Though there is Kamapua\u02BBa,<br> the god of pigs in Hawaii...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> For the record, my pigs aren&#39;t livestock OR gods.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> By the way, Circe...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You put those emotion limiters on and all,<br> but could they ever come off?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hahahaha, naw, no way they&#39;d come off.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Still, that being said...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...I guess they could technically come off on their own if I were to experience a really huge emotional upheaval or something.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Hmm.

I think I&#39;ll take some photos to commemorate the occasion.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Think I could get a copy of those pics?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Of course.

I guess I can tell you that...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> But first, there&#39;s something else we should do:</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Fight!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I suppose that does keep things simple.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s begin. I am Medea, princess of Colchis, first disciple of Hecate...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...and the devoted witch who has dedicated her<br> life to the pursuit of magic. Now have at you!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Guess this is it.<br> That&#39;s enough, Asterios.</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> &#39;Kay.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Thank you, you two.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> No problem.

While I do like the very witchy way you took<br> the shortest and most crafty path to your goal...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...this is still something for Odysseus and I to work out on our own.

Our only company<br> is the deep red sunset and the sound of the waves.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Odysseus, I hope your life is full of happiness.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> All I want... All I&#39;ve ever wanted...<br> is for you to be happy.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved too.<br> I&#39;m glad to see you looking so happy yourself.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> That&#39;s &#39;cause I am.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a great Master, great new friends...<br> I&#39;m living the hell out of this second lease on life.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I guess it&#39;s time for me to go.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, take care.<br> See you at Chaldea someday.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Same to you.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...Oh, and Fujimaru?<br> Look after Circe for me, would you?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;re around, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I will. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> There he goes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Oh yeah. Better than okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope I wasn&#39;t a third wheel.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Of course not.<br> I&#39;m super grateful you were here, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I&#39;d already made peace with my feelings a long time ago. I just didn&#39;t want to accept that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m okay now.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Sure, he broke my heart...but I got over it! It&#39;s a little painful, but I can deal with it no problem!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, Master?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m just one of dozens of Servants to you...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...but I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re my Master.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Anyway, on a different topic,<br> will you lend me your shoulder for a bit?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> &#39;Cause I&#39;m just gonna break down sobbing for a bit.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> ...Thank you. I mean it.<br> Farewell, my love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so, this insignificant little Singularity disappeared without a trace, carrying my regrets away with it.</p><h2 id="epilogue-you-smile-like-a-flower" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-you-smile-like-a-flower" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: You Smile Like a Flower</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Some time later.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Aun\u2013Lady Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Good, you remembered.<br> Excellent work.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Well, you said you were going<br> to curse me if I didn&#39;t, so...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You better believe it!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m surprised to see you with short hair.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> I just felt like a change of pace...or hairdo, anyway.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like it made me weaker or anything,<br> so what&#39;s the harm?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Is this because of Odysseus?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hahaha, of course not.<br> I told you, I just felt like it.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, see you later.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Now that work&#39;s all taken care of, I&#39;ve got a lot of lazing around in Master&#39;s room to catch up on.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Okay, have fun.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Oh, and one more thing:<br> don&#39;t go creating any more minute Singularities!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> I won&#39;t. Especially not after that earful I got from<br> you and seemingly everyone else in Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve learned my lesson.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Good. Still, that being said...<br> Thanks, Medea!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re welcome!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Oh, Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey, Arjuna. Say, how was the curry<br> you were looking forward to, anyway?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> They actually had curry in the cafeteria just now...but it was the especially mild variety they make for children.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t you have tossed in some<br> hot peppers or something?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I plan to, but I&#39;m going to do so in my<br> room just so I don&#39;t get any complaints.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> What about you guys?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Us? We&#39;re taking Arjuna up on<br> his ultraspicy curry challenge.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> Heh... He may have the upper hand,<br> but I&#39;m still a Greek hero.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> I certainly can&#39;t afford to lose a duel over<br> something as insignificant as spiciness.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> You said it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Besides, it&#39;s just spicy food, right? So I figure the worst that could happen is my tongue burns for a while.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Would you care to join us, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Nah, I&#39;ll pass, thanks.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Besides, I can already tell you<br> two are gonna lose miserably.</p><p><strong>Jason &amp; Orion:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you think!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Where the hell do you guys get<br> all your confidence from!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Hm? Hey, I just realized there&#39;s something<br> different about you. Is it the hair?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Crap. Guess I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d notice, Orion.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing by that initial \u201Ccrap\u201D reaction<br> that you don&#39;t mean that as a compliment.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> ...Ohhh, I get it!<br> It&#39;s because you had your heart bro\u2013</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Ugh, get with the times already, Jason.<br> What do you think this is, the B.C. era?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> What was that!?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, if you ever feel like joining us in modern times, you could do worse than taking a page from the Red Archer in the cafeteria&#39;s playbook.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m gonna bounce. Byyye.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> She&#39;s been in a weirdly good mood ever<br> since we took care of that Singularity...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> It kind of feels like she&#39;s more...<br> comfortable with herself now?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I see. In some cultures, people cut their<br> hair after they&#39;ve suffered a broken heart.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> TIL, as they say nowadays.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong><br> You&#39;re still hung up on that!?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Oh, hello, Circe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Georgios?<br> Out taking pictures again?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Yes, I am.<br> ...Say, would you mind if I took one of you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Me? Sure, if you want.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> All right, here goes...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> So why&#39;d you want my photo all of a sudden?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Good question.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> If I had to give a reason, I suppose I&#39;d say that you looked so sublimely happy...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> It reminded me of a beautiful flower<br> basking in the sunlight.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Aww, thanks.<br> It&#39;s always nice being compared to a flower.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> By the way, I&#39;m exhibiting the photos I took at the last Singularity in the cafeteria if you&#39;d like to see them.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Ooh, nice. I&#39;ll have to check those out.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;d better be on my way.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong><br> Oh, but first, there&#39;s something I need to tell you.<br> You-know-who was just summoned here.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Oho!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> You already showed up, huh?<br> That was faster than I thought.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Circe... Is that you, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> It sure is!<br> I see you finally got summoned here too, Odysseus.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Indeed. It&#39;s good to see you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Same. So hey, if you ever have any questions about things here, feel free to ask. I know my way around this place pretty well by now.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> No. I was just surprised how you seem<br> a little...different now than when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of being a Servant. We&#39;ve got a second lease on life, so we might as well make the most of it.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...Is that so?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Sure is.<br> Oh, right, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re going to be fighting under the same Master from now on, I figure we should at least shake hands.</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Good point.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Well, see you around!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> Circe!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...No, never mind. It&#39;s nothing.<br> I look forward to fighting by your side.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> As well you should.<br> I&#39;m not the queen witch for nothing, you know!</p><p><strong>Odysseus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...A second lease on life, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come in!</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> Hey there, Piglet!? How are you doing?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong><br> It&#39;s me!<br> Your beloved Servant, Circe the queen witch!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It was nice to meet you, my love.<br> Now, it&#39;s time to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I pray.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I pray for his happiness... My happiness...<br> And Master&#39;s happiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I hope.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I hope that he&#39;ll like it here in Chaldea,<br> and that he&#39;ll find somewhere he belongs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wish.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wish that my love, wilted as it may be now,<br> might one day bloom again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> By doing so, I&#39;ve come to love myself as I am,<br> even if only a little.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I do have wings, and so am always<br> ready to take to the sky...</p><p></p>', 1605);
