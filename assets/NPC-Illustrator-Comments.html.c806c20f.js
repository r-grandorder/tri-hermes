The being who always approached the tree to gazing at the blink of life that squirms on A Pale Blue Dot. I was mainly attempting to give her body surface an organic velvet feel to it (smooth, soft and cool). I photographed an aurora film that was made into strips of paper as reference for her hair.

His sprites were made by the animators, and I have to say his facial expressions are marvelous no matter how many times I look at it\u2026!!

Also her huge feet. I was drawing her while Part 2 Chapter 1 was being released, so I could guess what her role in the story would be and\u2026 I felt heartbroken while drawing her. She was so cute in the story and I was so overjoyed when she was talking with her friendly smile.

While I was searching and collecting materials from real armored vehicles, countless of my rough drafts were rejected for all imaginable reasons. There were signs of where I was worried on how to handle 12 wheel tires. I included some ship elements to make it large and amphibious as it is now. It\u2019s overall silhouette and a surrounding windshield are the most ship-inspired parts. I could have made it feel a lot larger with more detailed design, and I kind of regret not thinking of this until now. For FGO Events I built some 3D models and 1/1 diagrams of the Shadow Border\u2019s front half, making it feel a lot more like a three dimensional object. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t fit the schedule, so all people could do is check the online report on my PC and gasp. I wish it could be there~~!! Also I realized this was my best work ever when it got a Choro-Q. Thank you very much! (Hirai Yukio)</p>', 8);
