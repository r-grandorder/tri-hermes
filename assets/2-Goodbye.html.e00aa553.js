Probably because of overexertion during the day. There is something wrong with this much heat.&quot;</p><p>I had heard that Japanese summers were hot, but I had not thought it would be this bad.</p><p>The heat shining back from this town is too strong even for me, a child of the desert.</p><hr><p>I thought I would sleep through the heat of the day, but it seems I could not control the time of my awakening.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... A cold night. I must have slept too long?&quot;</p><p>Whatever the case, confusion is for certain.</p><p>Not sleeping properly and not ordering all this information is setting myself up for failure.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

Then, all that&#39;s left is this?&quot;</p><p>I come out to an unfamiliar clearing.</p><p>A small clearing apart from the office buildings.</p><hr><p>Until a short while ago everything was another large city park but it now transitions into private property.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wow. From down here it really looks impressive.&quot;</p><hr><p>I look up at the building under construction.</p><p>I heard the monumental architecture would be finished next spring.</p><p>Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it&#39;s going to be, but it&#39;s something important.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard everything from a big department store to the corporate office of a powerful electronics company.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The area around it is also being landscaped. Maybe I don&#39;t have to go this far.&quot;</p><p>The land all around the building is perfectly flat like a mirror.</p><p>The name of the building, Shrine, may be appropriate... but it&#39;s going a little too far.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Well...&quot;</p><p>I hold my breath and scan the area.</p><p>No sign of anyone else around.</p><p>Of course there are less and less people as night falls, thanks to the rumors of the vampire murders starting up again, but...</p><hr><p>I can understand why no one would be in the park, or the back alley, but this place is empty of people for another reason.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Well, after all, this is private property. The only people around would be trespassing, so why should I expect to see anybody......?&quot;</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p>I suddenly get assailed by nausea.</p><p>My fingers are numb and my throat is parched.</p><p>My pulse quickens.</p><p>A feeling like poison creeping from the back of my brain.</p><p>Without even realizing it, my right hand reaches into my pocket and soundlessly takes out my knife.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This... sensation.&quot;</p><p>...... I&#39;ve felt these chills so many times before.</p><p>Am I just disposed to this?</p><p>Before I meet up with something unworldly, I always get assailed by this sensation.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p>...... I sense someone.</p><p>Someone standing right behind me.</p><p>Someone (a human?) on this private property where no one should be.</p><p>A faint chill.</p><p>And...... the vampire has returned\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... But, something is......&quot;</p><p>It feels a little different.</p><p>Are my reactions weak?</p><p>It simply feels &quot;different from usual&quot;, a discomfort that indicates the presence of an outsider.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500Well, show yourself......!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hello? Is someone there?&quot;</p><p>I speak with my knife hidden behind my back.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500And then,</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Good evening. Do you have business with me?&quot;</p><p>Even though it was all so sudden, the girl speaks so calmly.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Seeing her, I was startled.</p><p>That distinctive dress and hat.</p><p>Definitely a foreign look, and I&#39;m almost afraid to say it, but she looks really cute.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, ah... well, no, nothing really.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um\u2500\u2500Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Sorry to be so rude.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You do not have to apologize.</p><p>But that is not the way to greet someone, is it?&quot;</p><hr><p>Her tone is so smooth.</p><p>...... Now that she mentions it, it makes total sense.</p><p>Lately, I seem to be off-kilter.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a little late, but, good evening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, nice to meet you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So, what are you doing here?</p><p>Are you looking for something at this hour?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Ah, yeah, something like that.</p><p>And what about you? You couldn&#39;t have not heard about how dangerous it is at night\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, right.</p><p>If she&#39;s a foreigner, she wouldn&#39;t have heard the rumors circulating this town.</p><p>Since she&#39;s probably just sightseeing, she wouldn&#39;t know anything about the vampire murders last year, either......</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s nothing...... Um, I don&#39;t know why you are here, but it&#39;s better to not hang around places where no one is around. You never know what might happen.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>She just stares at me.</p><p>...... It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>There&#39;s no way she can understand me if I keep suddenly blurting out all this stuff.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, you cannot say I don&#39;t know what will happen. Whatever shape he takes, the vampire will appear. Even you are patrolling in order to find him, are you not, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500what?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You could say we are looking for the same thing, Tohno Shiki. ...... Although our reasons are very different.&quot;</p><hr><p>She speaks devoid of any expression.</p><p>Those chills return.</p><p>Pain in my temples like a stabbing needle...</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;An irregularity like you throws the equation out of balance. Unless I move quickly to root out any problems, the results this time will also be undesirable.&quot;</p><p>Her arms swings forth and I hear an unfamiliar click.</p><p>She holds a black gun in her hand.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Please, resist if you wish. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. Your freedom now belongs to me.&quot;</p><p>And with that, she jumps towards me.</p><p>This foreign girl I&#39;d never met before attacks me with almost unspeakable speed.</p><hr><h2 id="shiki-vs-sion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-vs-sion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki vs Sion</em></h2><h2 id="shiki-wins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shiki-wins" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Shiki wins</em></h2><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ahh......&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s enough. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to do, but it&#39;s meaningless to continue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I admit defeat. Even though I collected all your data I could not finish reading it. ...... Even if everything was walking on a tightrope I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finished before even had a chance to start.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What&#39;s the matter? I have no strength to resist. This may be a selfish request, but please end it as cleanly as possible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Cleanly as possible? Look...... You seem to know something about me, but aren&#39;t you making a big mistake here? I&#39;m no killer out for blood. Even if you asked me I wouldn&#39;t kill you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Not... a killer?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not going to hit someone while they&#39;re down. I don&#39;t have a quarrel with you so there&#39;s no need to take it all the way. If you promise you won&#39;t attack me I&#39;ll let you go. \u2500\u2500You don&#39;t look like a vampire anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... This is troubling. I may keep quiet, but I will not lie. Therefore I can&#39;t promise not to attack you again.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... You can&#39;t... then you mean... um...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s right. Once my wounds heal, I will bind you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If you don&#39;t like it, then you just have to kill me. For someone like you it would be very easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......... Idiot, what do you mean, easy?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh? Did you say something, Tohno Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said something. I was complaining about being involved in something weird again! ...... For crying out loud, if it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s another\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I cannot understand. This seems to be causing you pain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You&#39;re the one who isn&#39;t understandable. But you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ll go back on your word.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As long as I am not mistaken, I will not change.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. Your expression speaks for you. (Why do I only meet these kinds of people?)&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, anyway...... Um, can you tell me about your situation? You&#39;ve been telling me what to do, so maybe you can at least tell me why?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... My situation ... You mean my purpose here?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. For some reason, you don&#39;t seem like a bad person. If you could tell me about your situation, I&#39;ll listen... Um, I&#39;m also kind of curious why you attacked me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. I was told you were not a bad person, and this confirms it. I should have explained the circumstances from the very start, Tohno Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;My goal is to find a cure for vampirism. I have been researching a way to return humans bitten by a vampire back to normal.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A cure for vampirism......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As you know someone who became no longer human after being bitten by a vampire, you can understand, right? The result of someone being desecrated by a vampire is death. Of course, we know how a human could become a vampire, but we don&#39;t know if a vampire could return to being a human. Many magi have attempted to research this problem and failed, but I do not intend to. I will make the impossible possible. That is what Atlasia means.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tohno Shiki, I believe you can understand how I feel. Like me, you have seen a friend become a vampire before your eyes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You seem to know a lot about that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... That was inconsiderate of me. This is upsetting you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just being childish.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying. You want to find a cure for vampirism\u2500\u2500I can&#39;t hate you for something like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But why did you attack me? I&#39;m not turning into a vampire, and I don&#39;t know a lot about them, either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. I did not come here to make you a research specimen. I came to this country to ask the cooperation of the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500True Ancestor, as in Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. If I want to find a cure for vampirism I have to study the source of Dead Apostles, a True Ancestor. If I merely needed data on the Dead Apostles, The Church has compiled much of that. However, that is insufficient. I need to investigate an unaltered True Ancestor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. But I&#39;m not sure Arcueid would go for that. She&#39;s kind of fickle that way.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I know that. A noble True Ancestor would not grant the request of a mere mortal. I need you to negotiate for me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Me? Negotiate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Idio-That&#39;s not going to work! You think she&#39;d listen to me? Where&#39;d you get an idea like that!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;W-well, you... the True Ancestor... aren&#39;t the two of you... l-l-lovers?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;With you as a mediator, perhaps I could speak with her a little. That is why I wanted to secure you first...... This is all the result of my carelessness.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha...... carelessness? You mean before?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I drew in all your data. The numbers indicated we were evenly matched, but my thorough knowledge meant my chances of winning were high. However, my loss means my abilities were the slightest fraction lower.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Um, then that isn&#39;t being careless...... doesn&#39;t that just mean your fighting ability is\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Wha, what are you sayinggg! I only lost because of carelessness! Excessive carelessness! My performance was far below my standard! I admit I miscalculated your power, but under normal circumstances, I would be the victor! You see, an hour ago, I calculated every single one of your maneuvers. Doesn&#39;t this just mean my evasion rate data was off by less than 0.5%!? If not for that one small mistake, our positions would have been completely reversed! Can you not understand such a simple thing!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500right. Sorry I doubted you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... no, I was being a little rude. I would appreciate it if we just changed the subject.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(......Hmm. She seems totally different from before.)</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;To get back to your problem, you really just want me to bring Arcueid to you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. My intent was to formally request the True Ancestor&#39;s cooperation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see. So you won&#39;t give up even now? ...... Okay...... if that&#39;s the case, oh well.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;? Oh well? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I mean, I can act as a middle man between you and Arcueid. ...... In all likelihood she&#39;s going to say no, but you wouldn&#39;t give up unless we tried, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Nod)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s just asking for cooperation, right? So, I&#39;ll lend you a hand. To be honest, I&#39;d like to cheer on someone doing your kind of research.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh......... cheer... on......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. Suddenly attacking me out of nowhere was surprising, but we can call it even. ...... If your research is successful, I feel like\u2500\u2500\u2500I could finally help her.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;ll do something about Arcueid. Actually, I&#39;m looking for her right now. I figured she would know something about these disturbances happening. I went to her place, but\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So she has concealed her location.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. And by patrolling the town, I thought I&#39;d find the rumored vampire, or at least Her Highness the fickle princess.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... I understand. Then I can lend you a hand in your purpose. If you&#39;re tracking down the rumors, I can find the vampire more quickly than you can.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? Really?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, if the rumored vampire does exist. Data gathering is my specialty. If I have at least a backup, I can scan the minds of everyone in this town in one day.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Hmm, I don&#39;t really quite understand, but you don&#39;t have to go that far, do you?&quot; (...... She has a scary look in her eyes.)</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;But, yeah. I&#39;d appreciate any help. I was feeling kind of hopeless by myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Then I will chase down these rumors. And you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s alright if I look for Arcueid and bring her to you isn&#39;t it? But, there&#39;s one other thing before that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Before that?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s Sion, right? If we&#39;re going to be partners, we should call each other by our first names, shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You have a point. Very well. You may call me Sion. And you\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, Shiki&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shi-Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s much better, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki...&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I said that&#39;s fine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;..........................................&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............... Then I will go start gathering information on the vampire. Please prepare for the negotiations with the True Ancestor, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah. But we don&#39;t have to go right away, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That would be the best, I think. We&#39;ll both need some time. Let&#39;s meet again tomorrow night right here, in front of this building.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Okay. I think I can manage something by then.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. Can you... hold on for a minute?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh......? Did I have something on my head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Something like that. Well then, see you tomorrow night.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow\u2500\u2500\u2500Hm. This seems a little familiar.

You are right on time, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Same for you. A big difference from someone I know.&quot;</p><p>...... Actually, she would come extremely early and then go hide.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. How did things turn out with the True Ancestor?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, it can be pretty hard to get hold of her sometimes. But I left a note in her room. Maybe tomorrow will be different...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Is that so? So she covers her tracks well. This won&#39;t be easy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Right, right. As fickle as she is, she might just have decided to go off and play around for a while without even knowing what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps. Do you not think she left you intentionally, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Intentionally? What do you mean, Sion?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I mean that the returned vampire could possibly be the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><p>Shiki:&quot;That&#39;s impossible. Arcueid would never do the kinds of things they&#39;re talking about.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Never? You really are a wonderful person, denying it so completely like that, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Er, well, thanks...&quot;</p><p>I stammer a reply.</p><p>For some reason, her words don&#39;t seem sarcastic, and almost have a ring of admiration to them.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A-anyway, Arcueid doesn&#39;t drink human blood. You might not know that, Sion, but she\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;She isn&#39;t the vampire in the rumors, right? If you say so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;However, if the vampire has returned to this town, then isn&#39;t it strange that there is no other vampire around besides the True Ancestor? There has to be something which was a model for all these rumors.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A model for the rumors......? Wouldn&#39;t that be the incident from a year ago?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That isn&#39;t the model, but the source. The rumors have been very clear about that. No one has actually seen or heard anything themselves. Putting aside what is true or false, does there not have to be some &#39;shadowy figure wandering the night&#39; on which to base these rumors?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......?&quot;</p><p>Sion is a little hard to follow. No, in the first place\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, I&#39;ve been wondering. You talk about research and studying vampires... who exactly are you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am an alchemist. You know about magi, do you not? The one named Ciel belongs to The Church, but there is another organization called the Mage&#39;s Association.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I am a member of the Mage&#39;s Association. There are three separate branches. I belong to Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Church views vampires as their enemy, but they have an agreement with us, the Mage&#39;s Association. ...... You could say we&#39;re a military force that isn&#39;t black, but not white either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Mage&#39;s Association......&quot;</p><p>...... Hmm. If that&#39;s the case then maybe Sensei is also in this Association.</p><p>Maybe Sion even knows her.</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I do not. Your Sensei is London&#39;s problem child, so it is natural for a member of Atlas like me to not have met her.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;W-what did you say, Sion? How did you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I can tell what you&#39;re thinking. You&#39;re someone whose face is easily read.&quot;</p><p>...... Hmph.</p><p>I&#39;m used to Akiha and the others saying that, but it is a bit of a shock to hear it from Sion, whom I&#39;ve just met.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Whatever. Then what do we do from here? It isn&#39;t fair if you don&#39;t tell me the results on all the information you gathered before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I don&#39;t mind. But what I gathered was not really any different than the rumors you heard. So I have nothing to tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;My. That&#39;s a little troubling.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Isn&#39;t it? So now we will just have to confirm it with our own eyes after all. If we&#39;re going to find the rumored vampire and the source behind it, we have to search the city at night.&quot;</p><p>...... So we&#39;re back to that. I didn&#39;t expect anything better.</p><p>This reminds me more and more of what happened last year.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;So...... This is my plan, Shiki. Why don&#39;t we look together? I don&#39;t know this town very well. I would be wasting my time without a guide.</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? ...... Well, they say two heads are better than one but is it alright? Your purpose is to research vampires, so......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We cannot declare for certain the source of these rumors isn&#39;t the True Ancestor, correct? Reason stands that if we fulfill your goal, it would be easier to find the True Ancestor. It would be meaningless if only I found the True Ancestor, and you would become free much quicker. I think that goes without saying.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p>I see, that&#39;s what she&#39;s thinking.</p><p>Well, we&#39;ll see, I guess.</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Give-and-take, then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. As much as I can, I will help you with your agenda.&quot;</p><hr><h4 id="park" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#park" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Park</h4><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;We&#39;ve walked so far and still we haven&#39;t found anything. The town is strangely quiet, but there&#39;s no odd feeling to the air.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;We haven&#39;t gone into the areas mentioned in the rumors. I hate to say this, but more victims will appear as time passes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Huh?

Don&#39;t tell me, you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I think you misunderstand, agent. I asked for Shiki&#39;s help, so he accompanied me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No one forced him. As for what you&#39;re thinking about, no.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... Is that so? So he has nothing to do with you, then. So you won&#39;t ask for his help when we fight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Se, Senpai, hold on! This may look like something is going on, but you don&#39;t have to bring out your Black Keys like that all of a sudden.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Tohno-kun please be quiet! ...... Goodness, why do you always show up in these bothersome situations? Or is it that you can&#39;t resist the request of a cute girl?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;T-that&#39;s definitely not it!&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;At any rate, stand aside, Tohno-kun. I will not listen any longer. If you get in my way, prepare to be punished.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Sion Eltnam Atlasia. An order has been issued by The Church to take you into protective custody, or failing that, to capture you by any means necessary. A similar request has been issued by the Atlas Institute. Do you have anything to say in your defense?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500I have nothing to say. But I will not let you capture me. If you try, you will be destroyed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, saying that all of a sudden is a little\u2500\u2500 W-wait, Sion... What did you just say!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You will not comply with The Church&#39;s orders? Very well, then. As an agent of The Church, I am placing you under arrest.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;I will make you reflect on your actions.

What do you mean by that?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Just what I said. Ciel, if you do not leave at once, I will burn up Shiki&#39;s brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The artificial nervous system implanted in Shiki, my Etherlite, is connected to me through my bracelet. I can destroy his brain at any time if you do not agree to leave me alone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Etherlite...... I&#39;ve heard of that before. I thought it sounded familiar, but the name Eltnam is related to that man... typical of Atlas. I&#39;ll accept this temporarily.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You should not speak of knowledge gained from Roa. I am different from that man you speak of.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But, we are getting ahead of ourselves. This Etherlite is connected to Shiki&#39;s brain. Before you could stop me, his brain would be fried.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, you......&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... I see. So you enlisted him for purposes of using him as a hostage all along.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course.

Please try and make the best of a bad situation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Um, Senpai?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;You agreed to cooperate with Sion Eltnam, so you brought this on yourself. Well, it is probably good policy to stay in the good graces of the one who could fry your brain, Tohno\u2212kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uwaaa, Senpai, you&#39;ve really said it now!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500It would be easy if it was this simple, though. Unfortunately, I cannot believe all of that, Sion Eltnam.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Certainly you would turn him into a vegetable if I tried anything. No matter what I did, I could not stop you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;However, it would not be anything that could not be healed. After I brought you down, I could simply heal him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;...... But, your control over him is different. I cannot win as long as Tohno\u2212kun is restrained. In the worst case, I could not even escape.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s not impossible for us to start over here. Certainly I received an order to arrest Sion Eltnam, but it is just one of many orders. My priority mission is to deal with the Dead Apostle that is hiding somewhere in this town. I can deal with your case after that mission is over.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The Dead Apostle hiding in this town...... Senpai, so you are looking into the rumored vampire after all!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;The Church has decided to investigate, and the job of eliminating it has fallen to me. That mission takes precedence over her arrest. However, do not think there will be a second time... I will not let you off next time.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ciel</strong>: &quot;Okay? By then, please cut your ties with her. ...... Really, Tohno\u2212Kun, even though you already have so many loose ends, you voluntarily stick your neck out for even more......&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Senpai\u2500\u2500\u2500seems to have let us go.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A wise move. If she tried to force the issue, the cost in terms of time and effort would be greatly damaging to efficiency.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;What is it, Shiki? You seem like you wish to say something.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion. Was what you said really true? You&#39;re connected to my head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not exactly like that. The Etherlite, the artificial nervous system, is simply linked with your nervous system. It will not cause any problems with your brain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant. Why did you do that?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I did it so I could locate you when I needed you. And to get information from you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;And what about your threat? Could you really burn out my brain?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. It would take some work, but the chances of success are very high.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... That pisses me off. This isn&#39;t exactly what you call a cooperative relationship.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... You are right. I understand how you feel. But that is why I decided not to tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You deliberately hid this?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I thought you might refuse to cooperate if you knew, and I didn&#39;t want to lose a valuable partner. I decided it was best to conceal it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. You just certainly know everything about what I would do.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. But it is a last resort. If I did use it, there would be no going back.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I understand if you want to part ways here.

Let&#39;s just drop it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Let&#39;s just forget about what happened earlier. ...... Well, it was a pretty good plan after all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I&#39;m saying, you were right, it might really have been the best course of action after all. With your bluff, you were able to drive Senpai away.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Wrong, it was not a threat. I was not lying earlier, I really was\u2500\u2500\u2500kyaa!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Stupid, at times like this, you should just go with it. You should just say &#39;yes&#39; like you normally do, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Y...... yes, if you say so, Shiki\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright, then that&#39;s how we&#39;ll look at it. But I have a few things to ask you, and I don&#39;t want you leaving out the details.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;.......................................................................................&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Senpai said you were a wanted criminal. What&#39;s that about? Aren&#39;t you just researching a cure for vampirism?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;As you say, I am just researching a cure for vampirism. But, that went against the doctrine of Atlas.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The Magi Association I belong to makes no exceptions for breaking its precepts. In my research, I had to do just that. That is why they are after me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Breaking its precepts... Sion, did you kill someone in your experiments?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course not. The Atlas Academy only has one precept. The results of one&#39;s research are not to be shared with anyone other than the researcher. ...... But I could not complete my research with just Atlas&#39;s resources alone. I needed the help of other associations. I traveled to them, and traded my research for theirs. To Atlas, that is an unforgivable sin. I knew they were chasing me, but it is surprising they even went so far as to reach an agreement with The Church. Then again, I have been out of touch for half a year.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hm. What you&#39;re saying is, your school doesn&#39;t permit you to study abroad?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes. You could put it that way. By doing so, I have been branded a traitor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A traitor, isn&#39;t that a little...... much? Senpai was pretty serious, I couldn&#39;t imagine why. ...... But your explanation about breaking the rules makes sense. Still, why did you have to go so far if you knew what kind of trouble you&#39;d get into?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... There was no other way. If I stayed in Atlas, I couldn&#39;t finish my research on vampires. Staying would have been a mistake. I must find a cure for vampirism, by any means necessary\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, then, I guess it can&#39;t be helped. (Sion&#39;s really not the type to back down.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Alright. Well, let&#39;s get started finding Arcueid then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, Sion, you said you need Arcueid&#39;s help to complete your research, right? So we have to hurry up and talk to her. I promised you that I&#39;d see this through to the end.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... You mean, maybe I cannot say it directly...... that you still plan on helping me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;But I used you as a shield. And if I decide it is the best course of action again, there&#39;s no way you can stop me from doing it! Even knowing that\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500um.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;It&#39;s alright. It would be tough for me to find the rumored vampire without you, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. I understand, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Well, our partnership is renewed...... Ah, that&#39;s right.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Partners usually shake hands to mark the occasion, but we kind of skipped that part.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Yeah, a handshake. Maybe we should do that, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............ (open, close)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? Sion, you&#39;re just opening and closing your hand. Maybe... you think my hand is dirty or something?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............... (Open, close. Open, close.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;???&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;(Stops)\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uh, eh? Wha, what is it? D\u2212did I do something wrong!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... There&#39;s no need for you to touch me excessively. I may be on the run from Atlas, but I am still the successor of the House of Eltnam. In the future, please bear that in mind.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah\u2500\u2500\u2500yeah, got it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The operation will commence at once. In the daytime I can gather information on my own, but at night, we are better off patrolling the town together. I will not be able to do anything if I find the True Ancestor alone, and it would be dangerous for you if you encountered the rumored vampire alone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500slow down there, Sion! I need to rest a little from that fight!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;......

If Arcueid is the source of these rumors, then they can&#39;t be believed, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. They are just rumors after all. But, if rumors converge, then they become real. The True Ancestor seems to walking around town aimlessly. That is why the rumors about her are increasing...... There are also rumors about a girl with red hair searching for her prey.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;G\u2212girl with red hair!?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... That is just what was said. At any rate, the rumors indicate that the True Ancestor is the serial killer. Please act accordingly, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Got it. Anyway, let&#39;s go to the park for now, Sion. We can probably meet up with Arcueid.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............ That is true. It might be better to have a painful experience at least once.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Hm? Did you say something?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, but I was merely thinking aloud. Let&#39;s go to the park, Shiki.&quot;</p><hr><h4 id="park-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#park-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Park</em></h4><hr><p>The moment we reach the park, I feel something wrong.</p><p>The smell of blood is overpowering.</p><p>We run into the depths of the park, fighting our way through the thick night air, to find\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wh...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p>Under the pale moon.</p><p>Above the countless corpses, above the ground dyed with blood, Arcueid stands before us.</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;......

Because you were so late, I wanted to have a little fun. So I trapped five or six people here and played around with them. But, you don&#39;t need to worry. I didn&#39;t drink their blood. I won&#39;t do anything that makes me lose control like drinking blood.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You...&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid</strong>: &quot;What, you&#39;re upset? Then I&#39;m sorry, but I did hold back, you know? But humans are so frail, and they just died after I petted them. Rather than being enjoyable, it stressed me out even more.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... No, Shiki. That is not the True Ancestor.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid(?)</strong>: &quot;...... Oh? It&#39;s you of all people, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh\u2500\u2500\u2500You two know each other!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...........................&quot;</p><p>Arcueid(?): &quot;Hm? No, we just met. But this is the second time we&#39;ve ran into each other, right, Sion Eltnam Atlasia?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki. This is the vampire that has been stalking the town. Looking at her, in this situation, there is no other explanation.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;What...... No, that&#39;s wrong. That, has to be wrong. Because Arcueid would never\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;This is not Arcueid Brunestud. Is that not right, Arcueid Brunestud?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Arcueid(?)</strong>: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m really not Arcueid. I&#39;m just an Arcueid, Shiki. ...... Ah, is this confusing you? Would it be easier to understand if I said I was a fake Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A fake...... I can understand that, but you\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A fake is not exactly correct. Because it really is Arcueid Brunestud. In the first place, that Dead Apostle...... &#39;Tatari&#39; cannot be described of in terms of real and fake. It is just the manifestation of rumors about a sinister vampire\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Hmph, after three years it&#39;s still the same old thing. But, I don&#39;t mind that about you. After all, you were probably antagonized by what happened. But I&#39;m happy you&#39;re chasing after me though. Yes, it really was a good idea to let you live.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If your intent is self\u2212destruction, then you are correct. I came here to stop you, Tatari. I may not be able to make you disappear totally, but I can at least stand in your way\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... agghh......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Dummy. You think you can maintain your sanity with me as you did before?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Then, I&#39;ll make it easier on you. It really would have been okay to make you my next, but you do not compare to the body of this True Ancestor. ...... You really do have the worst timing.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah...... Shi... ki......&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500! ...... What are you doing, Shiki? Are you getting in my way?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Hey now.

I wonder if I should allow you to keep boasting so much.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll play with you.

For you to beat me, not fully formed as I am... what a false start. Shiki, you really are unbelievable.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;But, it&#39;s all pointless, Shiki. Killing me is meaningless. And you know, you shouldn&#39;t really show off your toy like that so early. I can kill a nobody like you in a flash if you let me in on your secret.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You don&#39;t have to say it. I&#39;m well aware of that already.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh really? That&#39;s good. I&#39;ll see you two later. I&#39;ll kill you right away next time.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Gone...... no, more importantly, Sion......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Sion, are you okay!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Don&#39;t touch me......!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Um, but......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;I said, don&#39;t touch me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;........................&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;There is no need to worry, as that thing is gone now.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... If you say so. Aren&#39;t you hurt?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That is nothing you need to think about. You should put your priority on the vampire, correct?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Maybe you&#39;re right. Then I have a question. Who was that Arcueid just now? You both used the term &#39;fake&#39;, but it really was Arcueid. It used Arcueid&#39;s face and killed five people...... Huh? Huh!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No bodies, right? It really was nothing more than scattered trash. ...... But from far away, it could look like dead bodies.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wh\u2212why!? I know there were dead bodies, and there was even the smell of blood......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A hallucination. Were you not influenced by the rumor that a killer is in the park? That was the True Ancestor from before\u2500\u2500no, the Dead Apostle Tatari, to be more precise.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Eh? That Arcueid was Tatari?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Yes. The Dead Apostle who can make rumors into reality. The vampire clad in the shape of rumors. There are strange rumors spreading through this town. False information that feels real is passed between people. The moment a rumor becomes widespread, Tatari appears. No, you can say it occurs. Tatari cannot exist independently. It is like a mirage rising from people&#39;s fermented uneasiness.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......? Sorry, but I&#39;m a bit at sea right now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;A little... in the ocean? I do not know what you mean, but let&#39;s disregard that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Simply put, the Dead Apostle Tatari does not have a form of its own, only taking form when rumors &#39;become so real that no one doubts them&#39;. People of this town began to believe that the killer is a woman with blonde hair. And since you knew Arcueid Brunestud, you denied the rumor, yet feared it was true. The convergence of rumors and what you knew. As they mixed, Tatari became Arcueid Brunestud. ...... The Tatari before was a fake True Ancestor, yet was the True Ancestor at the same time. At least for you, it was reality. Were you not thinking how bad it would be if the True Ancestor drank blood like a vampire? You were not thinking that the vampire in this town was a fake True Ancestor. Tatari thus became what you feared, &#39;The True Ancestor who became just like a vampire&#39;.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... What do you mean? That just because I was anxious, that appeared?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The meaning of Tatari is a curse. People destroy themselves with a blind belief of the curse they themselves created. Tatari is a Dead Apostle who continues existing by becoming the uneasiness of others. As Tatari is the embodiment of their &#39;uneasiness&#39;, they cannot resist and can only have their blood sucked. ...... It appears Tatari is not yet fully formed. Your anxiety was not sufficient enough for it to be a widespread rumor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I kind of understand now. So you mean Tatari has the same powers as whatever people imagine it to have? Then what happens if people think about something other than Arcueid?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;He would of course become that instead. ...... Tatari does not have a true form of its own, so it will take that form before it appears. In the past, Tatari once became a divine beast as large as a mountain. But, that is only because many more people feared the darkness back then. In the current age, Tatari will not become anything that strong. However, if Tatari is able to become the True Ancestor, then it will certainly reach that level.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;R\u2212really!? Well, certainly an unrestrained Arcueid would be invincible...... Uwaa, what would happen then!?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Simple. If Tatari occurs fully, it will destroy everything around it. No matter what exact shape Tatari takes, it will be the realization of people&#39;s fears. Those that fear something cannot resist it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Man...... I understand that, but why was Tatari able to use just my uneasiness? If people simply do not have to be uneasy, then all I have to do is not think that Arcueid is the vampire, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;No, that would only affect you internally. Tatari&#39;s goal is to become the worst possible thing to be imagined in the area. So it is very likely that it will use you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. Why me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Y\u2212you are the one most connected with the True Ancestor. Because you stand in the True Ancestor&#39;s favor, this town is highly regarded.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The True Ancestor&#39;s favor...... isn&#39;t that a strange way of putting it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Perhaps. I did try to choose the right words.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A\u2212anyway! Think what you want, but why does that make me highly regarded by Tatari?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Because you know the True Ancestor very well. What&#39;s more, you really do know a lot about vampires. Even if it cannot take advantage of your uneasiness about the True Ancestor, you still have uneasiness about vampires.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Uneasiness about vampires\u2500\u2500\u2500like Nrvnqsr still being alive or maybe a fight between Ciel\u2212senpai and Akiha, or......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Those possibilities are also high. Curses work more on the principle of changing things which exist rather than creating something out of nothing. Please think of Tatari as a sort of Dead Apostle who uses &#39;curses&#39; as familiars. In this situation, wouldn&#39;t it simply be easier for Tatari to take possession of the True Ancestor and start rampaging rather than truly becoming a rampaging True Ancestor? Furthermore, the strength of your uneasiness is much stronger than anyone else&#39;s. As you have seen vampires many times before, a regular person&#39;s imagination pales in comparison.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Then, even though we defeated Tatari, it could just reappear as Ciel\u2212senpai or Akiha?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;That possibility exists. ...... The worst case would be Tatari becoming the True Ancestor, but the rumors are still growing. There is still time for Tatari to appear as a Dead Apostle. The Tatari from before was simply an experiment using the rumors here. So if you think not of the True Ancestor but of a vampire who was once human, Tatari might shift to that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s pretty inconvenient...... In other words, it falls on me to decide...&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Because Tatari uses your imagination. But what decides is really this town. There are many people afraid of what is happening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. You really know a lot about this. It&#39;s almost as if you specialized in this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, because this makes it the second time I have seen Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Oh, I see. That&#39;s why you know so...... wait.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Second time!? Sion, you fought that!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, three years ago. The time and place of Tatari&#39;s occurrence was random, there was an attempt to conceal it. I answered The Church&#39;s request to suppress Tatari and fought against it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;The Church&#39;s request...... but if Tatari is here, then that means it failed?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Both the attempts to suppress it and even our attempts to defend against it...... The Church did not understand what Tatari was. Even though I warned them it was not something that could be destroyed, they only carried their normal Conceptual Weapons. Just like you did just now, they defeated Tatari many times. But it was meaningless. Tatari is like a natural phenomenon. No matter how many times it is defeated, it can occur again once certain conditions are met.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;A natural phenomenon occurring once certain conditions are met...... you mean like rain or snow?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. Even if storm clouds were dispersed to prevent a windstorm, they would no doubt occur again. But this typhoon does not occur that often. The conditions are rather complicated.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... A Dead Apostle that will continue occurring as long as the world occurs? ...... That&#39;s just like...&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(Just like Roa...... existing through others.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes, what is it, Shiki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Ah, nothing. So what exactly are these conditions?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Generally speaking, there are four of them. One, there needs to be a rumor about an individual, preferably an extension of something human. ...... This is not necessarily a minimum rule. It is what Tatari desires. Tatari was originally human, so it cannot move without human intelligence.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Two, the extent of this legend must be somewhat socially isolated. It is hard to spread a rumor uniformly across a large area. That is why Tatari normally occurs in isolated villages. ...... It helps to have something which occurred earlier to base it on, like in this town.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Three, there must be one, or several, witnesses in the place where the rumor is spreading. There are varied ways of being a witness, such as knowing the basis of the rumor like you or those people in town who spread it. The rumor must have a terminal point. Usually, it begins with one person and floods forth from there. In some rare instances, there are those who guide the rumors intentionally to form Tatari according to their own thoughts. Probably they are on the same wavelength as Tatari. Those people do not have any ill intentions, but wonder themselves why things turn out the way they thought.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Four, the place where the rumors begin must be determined beforehand by Tatari. And the realization of people&#39;s anxiety can only be hatched for one evening. That is the limit of that conception. Tatari is a Reality Marble. It is impossible for it to occur for longer than one evening.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Everything was explained to the Knights of The Church three years ago, but they did not listen. ...... From the very beginning, they only believed one thing, and that was not to consider the explanation worth believing.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The result was the death of all the villagers and the annihilation of the Knights. Riesbyfe...... the leader let me escape, but she did not survive herself. And I was not able to escape either. I was only able to survive because Tatari took pity on me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;You survived because it took pity on you......?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;(...... Then, you mean\u2500\u2500\u2500you had your blood sucked, Sion?\u2500\u2500\u2500)&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Ah......&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;.....................&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... I see. Then what happened earlier makes sense. The outer form may have been Arcueid, but inside it was truly the Dead Apostle named Tatari. That&#39;s why you were unable to resist it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;...............&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;And that is why you are researching a way to cure vampirism. ...... Certainly, you have to continue your research at all costs. Even if you are treated like a traitor, you have to do it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500You are correct. I was... bitten by Tatari.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Three years ago. In the forest, Tatari caught me. ...... Tatari is a Dead Apostle limited to only one generation; an abnormality that won&#39;t reproduce itself. Yet, it still let me live. Even though Tatari is completely a vampire, it is not a perfect Dead Apostle. Tatari drinks the blood of others, but even if it gives blood to others, it is unable to make others its complete subordinates. The poison of its blood as a vampire is weak. That is why I am able to remain human. But this time, if it completely takes form, Tatari&#39;s influence will grow tremendously. Since Tatari never occurred in these past three years, I was able to remain as myself. But if Tatari occurs, I may become a full vampire.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;The body of a vampire is superior to that of a human&#39;s. The only saving grace is that as an alchemist, I will be able to fight better. But a superior body requires more fuel...... But you can say this fuel is bad. Vampires are unable to use regular food. For vampires, the highest concentration of energy is found in the blood of their own race. Desiring blood is no more than a life function for vampires...... No matter what, you cannot resist it just using reason alone.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tatari may be fully formed at any day now. Since it is this burdensome to fight Tatari before it even has occurred, I cannot say for sure how things will turn out when I face it again.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If Tatari has limited intelligence, it will not be a problem. But if it has intelligence like before, it is very likely that I will become a vampire. Tatari will not ignore me as my parent vampire.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Humans who have had their blood sucked by a Dead Apostle cannot go against their parent...... That is why you are still alive?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Tatari can only occur for one night. So, Shiki. Please consider what will happen when I face Tatari.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You mean, kill you if you become a vampire?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;If you cannot do it, then it is best if we part here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... And? No matter what, you&#39;ll still pursue Tatari?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Of course. Tatari will occur before I can find a cure to vampirism. If I wish to avoid becoming a vampire, I have to dispel Tatari before I become its subordinate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Even though you can&#39;t oppose Tatari?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;It is not that I cannot oppose Tatari. I simply need strong willpower when I fight. So, Shiki, what will you choose? I recommend that we part here.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;You cooperated with me to gain information, not to help me fight Tatari.

Since the 15th Century, there was really no chance of the True Ancestor Royalty being conciliated with humans. ...... The only thing you did of worth was to believe in your ability to predict the future. ...... If it was me, I would not have believed this to be possible.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;That is your limit, isn&#39;t it? Even if you have a superior mind, exercising only in theory leads to a lack of experience.<br> Well...... maybe you have grown a little bit. Bringing Shiki along with you since you can&#39;t defeat me by yourself; the old you would never have even thought of it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;He is here as a witness, and will take my head if I cave in to you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh really? I bet Shiki doesn&#39;t like that. Right Shiki?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Yeah, you&#39;re right. But this is between you and Sion. If she tells me not to fight, I&#39;ll stay out of it unless she loses.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Ahaha, that&#39;s so like you, Shiki! Hm, maybe it&#39;ll be alright to play around a little. If I transferred my vampiric impulse to Sion, she&#39;d fall way too quickly and that would be boring, right? Instead, I&#39;ll let you watch Sion suffer in pain, Shiki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Of course, then you&#39;re next, Shiki. Since it&#39;s you, it&#39;ll be a great warm up before I drain everyone in this town of blood. I actually have a little confession to make. I always wondered what I should do to you for slicing a True Ancestor like me apart.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Shut up, vampire. Don&#39;t use her face and her voice to smile like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;Oh, does it bother you? You&#39;ll be even more delicious than Sion.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;Shiki, I know how you feel but you have to control yourself......! You will have your turn if I am defeated, right......!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............ Tch.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;This nonsense has gone on long enough, Tatari. I am the only one connected to you. I will take care of you without Shiki&#39;s help.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arcueid(Tatari)</strong>: &quot;...... Heh. You think you can defeat me alone? You seem to be really trying hard, but let me show you a little of my power.&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="scenery-changes-to-the-millennium-castle-brunestud" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenery-changes-to-the-millennium-castle-brunestud" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <em>Scenery changes to the Millennium Castle Brunestud</em></h2><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PEfe9Px_d.webp?maxwidth=760&amp;fidelity=grand" alt="Castle"></p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500!

Shi, ki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;...... Thank goodness you&#39;re safe, Sion.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;............ Yes. But, I did become like this after all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;? What are you say\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......!

With Tatari&#39;s destruction, I was also at my limit. Tatari&#39;s strategy was better than mine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion</strong>: &quot;As Tatari was defeated, Tatari&#39;s vampiric impulse and even Tatari&#39;s will were transferred to me and now swirl inside my head.<br> Further explanation is unnecessary. I am now completely a Dead Apostle. I have become Tatari&#39;s successor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;............ No, you&#39;re wrong. That&#39;s not it at all. You&#39;re still yourself, right? So\u2500\u2500\u2500you&#39;re not under his control.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;You say I am not Tatari. ...... Yes, that is correct, Shiki. Truthfully, Tatari&#39;s will did not transfer to me. What he wished for is beneath me. That is, yes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;He is already gone. Tatari will soon be no more.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;I see, that&#39;s good. ...... Then, won&#39;t you return to normal?&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500No. I am different from before. I can no longer return to being human.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;...... With a vampire&#39;s body I was able to resist using my force of reason, but that reason has now lost. ...... Even this is painful. But, we did promise. At least I had to explain it to you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;Wha, what are you saying? Tatari is no longer here, right? So there&#39;s nothing coercing you anymore. You can just act like you did before and\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500Yes, Tatari is gone. However, I can no longer resist a part of me that has nothing to do with Tatari at all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;...... It would have been better if you were not here. Maybe I could have resisted.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;...... Shiki. Those who receive the blood of a Dead Apostle are not able to simply just live. As long as they have human emotions left, they attack people so as to drive those emotions away. ...... When that stops, they become full vampires. Most Dead Apostles just desire human blood for sport.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;But, I am still young. I cannot take pleasure in drinking blood like Tatari nor do I desire blood to become stronger. I just\u2500\u2500\u2500want your blood, Shiki.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Sion, you...&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;You promised, Shiki. You said you were ready. So\u2500\u2500\u2500I want you to fulfill that promise. I can&#39;t approve of myself being a vampire. I hate being something that has to steal from others to live. I couldn&#39;t bear being like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;But more than that, I want your blood. If I can&#39;t have it, I should just shoot my brains out. But I can&#39;t kill myself. So\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500You want me to kill you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Vampire Sion</strong>: &quot;Yes. If not, you will be killed. I am finished. I will lose control if I taste blood. So before that happens\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500&quot;</p><p><strong>Shiki</strong>: &quot;......
