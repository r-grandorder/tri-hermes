Another name for this is the Jabal Hamrin Breaker.</p><p>While in the middle of her Noble Phantasm, Ishtar warps to Venus; however, this is not the Venus in the outer space of the modern era, but rather, the Venus in the outer space of the Age of Mythology. Afterwards, grabbing (the concept of) Venus and loading it onto her bow as a bullet, the Venus Blaster shoots this Venus that had been turned into a bullet towards the Earth (surface), and from another person\u2019s perspective, it casually warps into the modern era\u2019s airspace through the utilization of Displacement Magecraft. The mountain range that was a nuisance to others, even to the Earth and to Venus, is accordingly destroyed by this Venus.</p><h1 id="gugalanna-strike-the-bull-of-heaven" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gugalanna-strike-the-bull-of-heaven" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Gugalanna Strike: The Bull of Heaven</h1><ul><li>Rank: A+</li><li>Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 1~99</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 400 people</li></ul><p>This Noble Phantasm temporarily summons the \u201CBull of Heaven\u201D, the greatest and strongest Divine Beast that was once dispatched to destroy Uruk on behalf of the Goddess Ishtar. The \u201CBull of Heaven\u201D appears in the skies and pulverizes the ground with its very large hooves. Large destruction is done similar to a meteorite falling down (meteor strike). It looks like a shining sky is falling down. It is as if the sky is blanketed with the Morning Star emitting a beautiful light, but it is actually a large golden hoof coming down to pulverize everything that is in the space between the sky and the ground. The attack deals a large damage, regardless of friend and foe, and temporarily bestows a Rank-Down effect (heavy pressure) to all of one\u2019s Stats, but only Ishtar herself does not receive any of the damage and effects.</p><p>At the time of its True Name Release, Ishtar speaks words that are similar to the ones she speaks during the occasion of her utilizing a portion of the \u201CAuthority\u201D that the (original) source of the Goddess Ishtar possesses, but in any event, one of Ishtar\u2019s and the original source\u2019s Noble Phantasms are exactly the same. Since it is not the case that it works as a physical materialization of the Bull of Heaven, it is also possible to employ this Noble Phantasm while confined by the space called \u201Cthe indoors\u201D, all done without destroying the structure. In \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, it is not used because of some existing circumstances.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><p>First Person Pronoun: watashi<br> Second Person Pronouns: anata / \u25CB\u25CB (without honorifics) / (only towards the Protagonist) Master<br> Third Person Pronoun: anatatachi</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>Active and extroverted. The goddess of war and good harvests who lives according to her own whims without being a slave to her own fixed position, all while having high intelligence and pride. Ishtar loves beautiful things, hates ugly things, and the things she desires are the things she absolutely takes hold of in her own hands. Even though she is smart, she is also impulsive and sometimes leaves with an unthinkable reckless abandon. In myths, Ishtar is commented by Gilgamesh as thus: \u201CInanna? Is she not the most annoying goddess in the world!? She will destroy something that certainly does not need to be destroyed, and she will also create something that does not need to be created!\u201D If Ishtar becomes ostentatious in this world, then surely in that way, she will simultaneously invite chaos.</p><p>The root of Ishtar\u2019s personality does not have any changes even when she materialized as a Servant. It cannot be helped that Rin, who is the possessed vessel, almost has the same nature as Ishtar\u2019s as well. However, there is one thing that Rin has that Ishtar does not. That is \u201Cperseverance\u201D. Rin is a hardworking person who is not negligent in her trainings even though she is a genius. She knows perseverance, which appears to be giving a little influence on this Ishtar. Incidentally, Rin became independent after losing her father when she was very young, while Ishtar behaved like a spoiled child up to the very end towards her almighty father.</p><p>Ishtar is the exact opposite of Kongming (Zhuge Liang) \u2013 who is identical to her by being another Pseudo-Servant \u2013 in that the human personality, the basis of the possessed human, does not come out to the surface. Ishtar thinks and behaves as Ishtar to the very end. Although she thinks to herself \u201CIs it because I\u2019m just being a Deity of Destruction?\u201D, Rin\u2019s innate goodness is mixed in with that creed as this Ishtar, and the following changes were made:</p><ul><li>\u201CI must be the most beautiful\u201D \u2192 (\u201CIf there\u2019s someone more beautiful than me, I will strive to become more beautiful then\u201D)</li><li>\u201CI will kill anyone who opposes me\u201D \u2192 (\u201CIf I made someone cry because I went too far by killing someone, I would rather stop then\u201D)</li><li>\u201CI will tolerate anyone who\u2019s faithful to me\u201D \u2192 (\u201CI will lend my power only in proportion to the faith one has in me\u201D)</li></ul><p>\u2026 Like this, Ishtar\u2019s cruelty is held back, and when assessing this as Tohsaka Rin, it at least becomes \u201CAh, I became just a little higher than usual.\u201D Also, Ishtar herself is not conscious of Rin being her possessed body. \u201CI am myself. Whatever human this possessed body was is now the Goddess Ishtar herself. Think of it like this. Instead of saying this human was taken over by Ishtar, it is rather that suddenly on one day, she became Ishtar as well.\u201D Although it sounds like she is making light of Rin\u2019s human rights, it actually means the exact opposite. Ishtar recognizes that \u201CIf Tohsaka Rin is Ishtar, then that means Ishtar is Tohsaka Rin, regardless if it is from something like whoever is on top, to something like whichever one of us accepts this current state of things first.\u201D Although she will absolutely not say this.</p><p>To say it in a few words, \u201Ca Tohsaka of Light (yet a devil)\u201D.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>A human worth teasing. Although she thinks of herself as someone celebrated, Ishtar will not do things such as looking down on someone given that there is Rin\u2019s basis. She comes into contact with the Master with deep affections and friendship, although simply as \u201Ca toy worth teasing.\u201D However, as their bonds deepens, the virtue of taking care of people that she has since the beginning and her emotional weakness (of completely emphasizing with someone) work against her, and they grow from \u201Ca toy worth teasing\u201D into \u201Cmy cherished contractor, whose future is worth watching over.\u201D</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201COuch!!\u2026 Those cruel eyes\u2026 they unexpectedly shot up from the ground\u2026 Though, it was good luck that I suffered less damage than what I had thought I would. Since my usual high-handedness (actions) are also good for this\u30FC\u30FC\u30FC\u30FCW-What are you\u30FC\u30FC\u30FC\u30FC!\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not doing that!

By some chance, is that\u2026 not the seven-jeweled crown too!? If it\u2019s just these, then I won\u2019t be badly off with these gems being used for Magecraft\u2026 Lies\u2026 eh?

And Ishtar (me)!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSo it\u2019s like that. Although it\u2019s a provisional contract, Ishtar has become a Servant of Chaldea. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m boring, so since that\u2019s the case, I will ask you for a favour. Please treat me favourably, ok?\u2606\u201D</p><h2 id="historical-character-and-figure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historical-character-and-figure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Historical Character and Figure</h2><p>Ishtar is the goddess of beauty, lust and discord in Sumerian Mythology. Her Sumerian divine name is said to be Inanna, and that name is actually her older name. Ishtar is her Akkadian divine name. It means \u201CThe Mistress of Heaven\u201D. A Goddess of Venus, a goddess who governs over the good harvests that bring prosperity to the people, and even a goddess who rules over war and destruction, she is a great goddess who, among the goddesses, was presented with many rights and Authorities from the gods. In Sumerian Mythology, she plays an active role as a dynamic goddess and as a goddess who is like a protagonist, possessing various anecdotes. Particularly among them, a famous one is her feeding the city of Uruk to the \u201CBull of Heaven\u201D, an anecdote that caused the city to be on the brink of destruction.</p><p>At any rate, Ishtar is a whimsy deity who is free and uncontrolled, and it is said that she has many lovers, irrespective of them being from the domain of man or from the domain of the gods. She is an existence who was perfected as a deity, and someone who takes control and command as the usual state of things. There is no compromise. The motive for bringing out the Divine Beast onto the Earth is said to be the result of the Hero King \u2013 Gilgamesh of Uruk \u2013 having not responded to her temptations.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>In \u201CFate/Grand Order\u201D, Ishtar has materialized as a Pseudo-Servant by possessing a human. Since Ishtar is egotistical, she behaves without paying any regard to the possessed human, but her nature is receiving a big influence from the human that she possessed. Originally, Ishtar is both deeply compassionate and cruel, but because the personality of the possessed human is more virtuous, her cruelty has retreated to the bottom of her heart, and her good side appears to have come out ahead of it.</p><p>In Chapter 7, Ishtar appeared as the only living Sumerian Deity. By becoming a Pseudo-Servant, she manifested on the lands of Mesopotamia, attentively watching the Seventh Singularity and the future of humanity. Although she says she is attentively watching them, she is watching over them while letting out an evil sneer. \u201CWell then. I wonder, will the humans survive this, or will they be destroyed?\u201D By chance, she happens to see the Protagonist persevering as a mere human being while losing their Servants, the Protagonist becoming one of her favourites among those she teases, and she temporarily links a contract with them. In the end, she proves to be a literal \u201CGoddess of Victory\u201D.</p><p>Ishtar is always floating lightly because she is not the \u201CGoddess of Earth\u201D, but the \u201CGoddess of Heaven\u201D. The main weapon of her choice is \u201CMaanna, the Boat of Heaven\u201D, which is both an airship and an enormous bow. Maanna is the boat of the gods that soars across the Mesopotamian world, and it is also an interstellar teleportation stargate (gate) that connects between Earth and Venus, but because she is a Pseudo-Servant, its warp function is sealed except during the occasion of her using her Noble Phantasm. While called a Mesopotamian Deity, her image is like that of an invader flying in from Venus to attack the Earth. Bibyu.</p><p>Also, it is a digression, but regarding the battle against Ishtar in one section of the Seventh Singularity\u2019s Tenth Chapter, she had a Passive Skill called \u201CBroken Lapis Lazuli Necklace\u201D. Because it is broken, its original effect becomes the exact opposite (Noble Phantasm damage is reduced by 30%). Ishtar herself realizes that negative effect, but daringly wears it. Even if it is for this reason: \u201CIt\u2019s still beautiful, and I wanted to flaunt it; plus, if I think about this conversely, even if it starts to act up violently and flare up, I\u2019m not going to suffer damage because I\u2019m already suffering from its debuff, right?\u201D Or so she thinks. But she ignores pointing out that she had used her Noble Phantasm before, which caused it to act up violently in the first place.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh</strong></p><p>\u201CAfter losing all the money he has on hand through gambling, he returned back to his home to find his storehouse of treasures burning, and for the finishing blow, while he was still broke, his debt was being collected after the break period he had implored the collector for had just ended, and he died!\u201D</p><p><strong>Enkidu</strong></p><p>\u201CIn the middle of its journey, its vehicle\u2019s engine stalled and even its cellphone had a flat battery, so it wandered around without any decent food too, before in the end, it finally arrived at a diner, only for zombies to infest the place, and it died!\u201D</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal</strong></p><p>\u201CA Tohsaka of Darkness, huuh?\u2026\u201D</p><p><strong>Artemis</strong></p><p>\u201CIt seems that person is said to be a Greek Deity?

If it is said that \u2018As a result of Ishtar being a deity who rules over war, comparatively anything can properly be a reasonable Class for her\u2019, it then becomes a strained interpretation of an Archer as well; although, I thought that since she is a goddess, I wondered what can be more fascinating for an enormous Noble Phantasm that she can carry in her hand, so I took into consideration a weapon with a form that can work similar to a bow. However, that weapon that can work similar to a bow turned out to be something unexpected, and after saying \u201CI will make that as Maanna, ok?\u201D, this Maanna was added to the setting.</p><p>By the way, Maanna\u2019s colouring references the gold and blue colours of the Ishtar Gate. And then, the earrings reference a statue of Ishtar. And finally, speaking of Archer\u2019s appearance regarding Tohsaka Rin\u2026 I added a loincloth to her first look. Although she has a lot of skin exposure, considering the Mesopotamian culture and the nature of the Goddess Ishtar, I wonder if that seems to show more skin in this way\u2026 Right, of course\u2026 I did not think that she would have screen time later on in the summer as well\u2026 yeah.
