The Devil who, even as he continues to find faults in mankind, grasps their hand and shows them the way in the right direction.<br> Although he speaks ill of effort and faith by uttering this like &quot;Those things are not as straightforward as you think, you know?&quot;; he would never make fun of them.<br> Humanity at its foundation, is something that betrays.<br> Such \u300Ebetrayal\u300F, without getting mad or being disappointed, he frogives with words like &quot;Such is life.&quot;<br> Although his attitude seems to be one of a third party utterly disappointed in humanity, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p><p>\u300CBasically, betrayers, once in a while, believing in people due to some mistake, leave behind something good. I will not laugh at such a mistake.\u300D</p><p>Angra Mainyu, born of hatred, is an avenger that speaks about love,<br> the King of the Cavern, born of love, is an avenger that speaks about hatred.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>Of course, he&#39;s not the real Devil.<br> The form of an ordinary young man from a certain village who committed no crimes and did not achieve anything great either.<br> Due to a single teaching of the village, the villagers came to an agreement and he was chosen as a human sacrifice.<br> It was a teaching that establishes evil.<br> In that village, for the sake of enduring the hardships of their daily life and their poverty, the teaching was necessary.<br> \u300EIt&#39;s the evil&#39;s fault that our lives are not easy in the least.\u300F This was the problem they could not solve. For the hearts of the people who wouldn&#39;t be saved, to beat this unreasonableness, a necessary evil\u2500\u2500\u2500a scapegoat was necessary. The young man was chosen as the \u300Cevil threatening the good of the villager\u300D \u300Cthe culrpit for things not going well\u300D \u300Csomething that you can unconditionally show contempt for\u300D, imprisoned at top of the mountain and dropped into Hell on Earth.<br> The young man that went through every torture one could experience passed away, as a matter of course. However, the hatred felt towards such absurdities was burned into the rock prison and he became a nameless ghost.<br> Even after the young man disappeared, even after the villagers he hated were gone and even after the village itself vanished.<br> In a state bound to the top of the mountain, he continued to watch the actions, ugliness and joys of mankind.<br> A warm light. Thinking about the &quot;ordinary everydays&quot; that were not granted to him, like a sage.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>A form that&#39;s not the real Angra Mainyu, but a young man who was set up as Angra Mainyu, summoned as a Servant. Basically, everything he does is without interest and negative, but he&#39;ll properly carry out his duty for his contractor and he&#39;ll accompany the Master until the end.<br> Despite saying that, given his animalistic nature, there is a danger of him snapping at any moment and biting the Master to death.<br> Even while swearing and critisizing them with abusive language, he&#39;s a Heroic Spirit that will watch over the Master&#39;s growth.<br> Such way of observing the future of the immature human race, is also that of an outcast.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300CHeya-!
