We can&#39;t even go outside to gaze upon the moon, it seems.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> All I&#39;m good for is drinking and appreciating flowers.<br> You understand why I&#39;d visit you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You like flowers?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, my favorite thing is alcohol, followed by flowers, then pretty young men\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have a fourth favorite, and fifth is the moon,<br> I suppose. I like things that please me, and pretty things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s very elegant.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, how kind.<br> But it&#39;s not like that.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t read poems or write love letters, and being all formal in a palace is just so bothersome.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Hmm? What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s with that look?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The oni of Mt. Ooe aren&#39;t really that special.<br> I&#39;m just a girl who likes to drink.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I do eat people, I suppose, but I&#39;m not as violent as Ura or Ootakemaru.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, an oni is an oni. I suppose we&#39;re not so different in the eyes of humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What exactly did you do before?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hmm\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What kind of oni were you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufufufu.

No wonder it didn&#39;t get passed down.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. Anyway, some things happened and I came back to Japan.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I wandered around Kyoto, around the rivers.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And the next thing I knew I was drinking in a marvelous palace on Mt. Ooe.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You see, it was Ibaraki... Ibaraki-Douji.<br> She was considerate and showed me to the oni lair.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oni were probably the ones who built that palace.<br> It was quite a sight, up on that mountain.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> After that, I had such a wonderful time.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I drank whenever I desired, and I loved whatever I desired.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I ventured to Kyoto whenever I felt like it, and killed, ate, and plundered, as I pleased.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I took what I liked back to the mountain.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Flowers, the moon, handsome men, pretty women, rare jewels, fabrics, pots... I loved all of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You killed people?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Here and there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It sounds like you had fun.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Of course I did.<br> I&#39;m an oni.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I rampage, love, laugh to my heart&#39;s content without a shred of worry or doubt.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I am, an oni.<br> Humans like that kind of stuff too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It was so much fun, but it didn&#39;t last long.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The nobles and onmyouji of Kyoto got very mad.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> They sent the famous Minamoto-no-Raikou, the next head of the Minamoto clan, and Raikou&#39;s Four Heavenly Kings after me\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Ah yes, that was a terribly amusing night.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;d been after him for a while. That boy with blonde hair and blue eyes... And then he came for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sakata Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. Him.<br> The one they called Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s strange, isn&#39;t it? He moved up in the world after he became famous through stories. As if he was a Shogi piece.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Golden?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Right. What&#39;s with that? He was a cute kid, and now he&#39;s even cuter, you know?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> In life he was reviled for his blonde hair.<br> Here people just think he&#39;s a fan of Western culture.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Hahh. When I look at his body, I remember.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If I&#39;d pulled it off that night, I could&#39;ve put the Red Dragon&#39;s ulna in my wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> What would it have tasted like, I wonder?<br> I&#39;d love to drink it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But that night, they beat me.<br> They won the fight and killed me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> They gave me poisoned wine\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And well, I got drunk, and that was it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The divine poisoned wine, Shinpen Kidoku! With an excellent wine like that, of course I&#39;d get drunk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...They attacked while you slept, huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Indeed. I was having a nice nap, and off went my head.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I still remember his face when he did it.<br> He looked like he couldn&#39;t bear with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does it still bother you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Not really? I&#39;m mostly impressed they managed to do it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I killed and ate humans.<br> It&#39;s natural that I&#39;d be killed in turn.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I may be a little ditzy, but I don&#39;t forget when I&#39;ve embarrassed myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Oh, but... I wish I could&#39;ve seen those blue eyes once more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;re daydreaming now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you love him?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh, my. Are you saying that because...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re jealous when I speak of another man?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufufufu. Instead of fearing the oni of Mt. Ooe, you&#39;re getting jealous. You&#39;ve got guts. I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...Come, move closer. Why don&#39;t I take this chance to teach you a few things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Teach me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, how&#39;s the training coming, Boss?<br> I take it everything is going well? I&#39;ll tag along\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Oh my. Speak of the devil, huh?<br> What a coincidence.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Sorry, Boss. Gotta run!<br> Just remembered I didn&#39;t eat breakfast!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Wait just a minute.<br> You&#39;re making it a little too obvious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t grab my collar!<br> I&#39;m not a cat! You&#39;ll wrinkle it!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re not a cat, you&#39;re a tiger.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You think you can just come in here when I&#39;m in the mood, and then ignore me and leave?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re in the mood for, but it takes too much energy to deal with you this early!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re still as naive as ever.<br> All right, I have an idea.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> The perfect way to liven up my drinking\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s a good way for the three of us to all work up a sweat together. How about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Work up a sweat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Together?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Are you stupid!? If you want to do stuff like that, you need to... um... yeah...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Do stuff! You know!<br> Like it&#39;s gotta be at night, right?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Right, right. Look into my eyes and say that.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I am! You just can&#39;t tell because of my shades!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Tch. I mean for one thing, you shouldn&#39;t just strut around with such revealing\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Yoink.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Waah!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Quiet.<br> Okay, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Senpai?<br> And Shuten and Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?<br> Kintoki looks really upset...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shuten-Douji is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Shuten-Douji is what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, perfect timing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. If it&#39;s perfect timing for you, it&#39;s perfect for me, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, um, what are you doing in the Command Room? We&#39;re adjusting the equipment...</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got that thing. The see-mu-lay-tor, was it?<br> We&#39;re borrowing it for a bit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm? You want to use the combat simulator? We can&#39;t Rayshift because we&#39;re still adjusting the equipment, but that should be fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Seeing you together had me worried for a bit, but you&#39;re not fighting, are you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> We&#39;re not fighting, but\u2014 Wait!<br> Is that what you meant by working up a sweat?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Working up a sweat?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hahahaha. What did you think I meant?<br> You were talking about training, so I agreed to help.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And I really am feeling in the mood.<br> I need to smash some things to calm down.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Will you come with me?<br> You, Master, and Mash, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If Senpai wants me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess I have no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Morning workout time!</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That&#39;s what I want to hear.<br> You really are my type.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Come, child. Let&#39;s work hard.<br> As hard as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Be ready to kill, please.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> It&#39;s been so long since we&#39;ve met. I want you and me to be more... more, more, more, more...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Covered in sweat... and covered in blood...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Until you can&#39;t tell flesh and bone apart...<br> Come at me at full strength...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I want a deathmatch in that ephemeral world.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. You really have a frightening mind.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> You&#39;re a Servant, at least in theory.<br> I thought you&#39;d turned into something more ladylike...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> But I guess I didn&#39;t need to worry!<br> Okay, time to snap off your horns and make you cry!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Hahaha. Splendid, splendid.<br> Come join us, Master.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Regardless of how he looks, he&#39;s as tough as a bear. Let&#39;s fight him, hand in hand!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see you fight next to a human!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Wait, are you really drunk?<br> Maybe seeing doubles or triples of me?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Fine. Come and get me!<br> I&#39;ll give you a golden wake-up call!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Wait, we&#39;re helping her, huh?<br> No, if you&#39;re fighting, so am I!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep this from getting out of hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try not to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Right, Master!)</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got guts. Nothing less from the hunk I had my eyes on.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I think this&#39;ll be fun.<br> Doctor, lend me your ear.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> (Psst... You can do this, right? I know you can.<br> I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re VERY talented.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Your breathiness, your words, the way you move, it&#39;s all really sexy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I guess I can&#39;t help it if I&#39;m giving in to your temptations!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me! You want mass-produced Kintokis, you got &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Huh!? What are you talking about?<br> Hey, that ain&#39;t fair, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Thank you so much\u2606<br> I&#39;ll pay you back later with a drink, okay?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Now\u2014 Let the party begin! Be consumed by drunkenness, madness, and excitement! Everything starts after that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Damn! You&#39;re tiny but you hit hard!<br> I guess you haven&#39;t forgotten a thing, huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Of course not! I&#39;m an oni to my core.<br> Do you think I&#39;d fight a war I couldn&#39;t win?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re still as strong as I remember, though...<br> If I let my guard down you&#39;ll split me right into two...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> That makes me happy.<br> You&#39;re hitting me with your real strength.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But... This isn&#39;t enough for me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Let&#39;s stop fighting like little kids. I want you to come at me in a way that&#39;s more...grown-up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Huh!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Kintoki&#39;s pretty strong already.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Y-Yeah... He seems fiercer than usual today.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I see a second fight coming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Yes. I can&#39;t see this just ending.<br> There&#39;ll probably be at least one more fight.)</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...You really haven&#39;t changed, have ya?<br> No matter how much time passes, you&#39;re still the same.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I&#39;m a classic, not some passing fad.<br> And as for you...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Your appearance has changed, but your heart hasn&#39;t. You&#39;re still the little kid you used to be.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You&#39;re holding back. Is it because you&#39;re that afraid to hit a woman?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. Be fiercer. More violent.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> If you want more of a fight, let&#39;s bring out the bears!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> BEARS!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, right. Bears. Hmm...<br> Yeah, I&#39;ve got bears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (He&#39;s got bears!?)</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get back to it.<br> I&#39;ll melt both you and the bears.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll lap up all your blood before it touches the ground.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Hah, I&#39;m not so out of it that I&#39;ll let you eat me! I&#39;ll take your head, and use my own blood as lipstick on it!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Ahahahaha! I like that!<br> It sounds so elegant!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> To have you put funeral makeup on me would be so wonderful and I bet that idiot Raikou would grow horns from hearing it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Simulation complete. Both have only suffered minor damage to their Spirit Cores.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, um... Those were soul eaters.<br> Not bears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It said they were bears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Doctor was being silly.<br> Doctor, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, I was getting too into it... But I think it was the only way to calm down Shuten-Douji.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She may look refined, but she&#39;s the most brutal oni of them all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She might&#39;ve attacked Fujimaru if she got bored.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m just glad everyone&#39;s alive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. Both of them were extremely agitated...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad we made it back safe.<br> Good work, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufu, that was fun.<br> Thank you both, Mash, Master.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> You played along with my little game.<br> Such good, good children you are. Lovely.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> And you too, of course, sweaty little boy.<br> That was quite the invective for being impromptu.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> I bet you could&#39;ve taught those nobles in Kyoto a thing or two about plays.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m never reading poems or haikus again.<br> Bikes are the big thing now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...Sigh. Damn it, I got all worked up. You look unconcerned as ever... You were just toying with me, huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> How much of what you say is just an act?<br> Crap, I&#39;m so tired...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufufufufu. How much is an act?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Of course, I&#39;m always serious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> ...R-Right.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fufufu. You&#39;re still a kid. Even though you&#39;re SUCH a big and handsome man.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> Fighting for your life while drunk, outwitting your opponent while pressing your body against theirs...<br> Now that&#39;s amusing.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong><br> \u2014Don&#39;t you think so, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> R-Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ask me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai is panicking!<br> Hang in there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow. In the face of a drunk Shuten-Douji, Heroic Spirits and their Master are all nothing but playthings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just how oni are, or just how she is, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yeah. I-I&#39;ll do my best, too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary.<br> Actually, let&#39;s just get back to work.
