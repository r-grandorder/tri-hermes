Let&#39;s see... Senpai...<br> When he says he might be liberated...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It might mean a liberation reaffirming violence...<br> don&#39;t you feel... it can, be taken, that way...?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Actually, Sorry I had you bring me all the way to London, the Fourth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m grateful to you guys.<br> Ascension, was it? It was truly amazing.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed that it could turn me, nothing more than a failed mage, into such a powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Besides, as you can see... I got a chance to come to London, though the Demonic Fog still remains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Since the Holy Grail was removed,<br> London is undergoing correction to its original era\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what brought you here?<br> You just wanted to visit your homeland, is that it?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Sure, something like that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Mash, you are quite perceptive.<br> Yes, I wanted to see my &quot;homeland&quot; firsthand.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you understand me.<br> You&#39;re &quot;lovely,&quot; Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A-A love confession!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I don&#39;t think so. He seems\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Oh, I love you, London! Of course I love you, sky!<br> Gas lamp! I love you very much!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As you see, his love spreads very wide.<br> But it is exactly as we predicted beforehand...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m sorry for interrupting when you are hyped up,<br> but there&#39;s a bit of Demonic Fog left\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You guys might hinder the phenomenon called Correction of the Era by being there. Yeah, who knows what might happen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it time for us to go back?<br> Can I prepare for Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, but will you wait just a little?<br> There is a place I want to visit.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> You guys saw &quot;me&quot; once before, right? In this era, in this foggy city, seeking the Fourth Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean, we saw you in your lifetime.<br> Yes, you did help us a lot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you remember?<br> About when you saved London with us\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Sure, mostly.<br> Anyway, you know...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...I want to see for myself.<br> This apartment where I supposedly lived.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> If possible, I wish to talk to myself in my lifetime, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, I get it. But, you should know that Mr. Jekyll may no longer be there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This era is being corrected. He may already have returned to the time he&#39;s supposed to live in.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Even if so...<br> I still wish to visit. May I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you could see him...<br> Would there be anything you should do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is that why you came to this era?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Face yourself, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Yes, I have something to tell him. That no matter what happens in the future, he can definitely overcome it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> At least I overcame &quot;Hyde&quot; by killing myself.<br> So, I hope that I can just...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...give my past self a piece of advice. It can even be something short like &quot;Be brave and face yourself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s merely self-satisfaction. Whatever I say will probably be erased in the Correction of the Era.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> And yet...<br> I wish to tell him...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, if that&#39;s the case\u2014<br> Hmm, Is it okay? Is something like this okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course, it won&#39;t cause something like a time paradox, but Hmm. Hmm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> ...So you came to me?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> I understand most of the situation.<br> At any rate, it&#39;s great to see you guys again like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pleasure is ours.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Saber and the Heroic Spirits...<br> are all gone. No, I am fully aware of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, you rather seem different?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> You\u2014think?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Me, too, it&#39;s good to see you again,<br> Mr. Henry Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re doing great.<br> And, well, whom I see over there is my\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> &quot;Your future self.&quot;<br> Just think that way for now.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> &quot;I thought so.&quot;<br> I take it you understood the basic gist at a glance.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> In that case, I suppose you also know what I&#39;m trying to do, Mr. Henry Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Surely.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Haha\u2014Then, can you die for me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> W-What!? What&#39;s going on there!?<br> He just jumped on Mr. Jekyll, didn&#39;t he!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He did, Doctor.<br> He...tried to murder himself from his lifetime!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Haha...<br> That&#39;s right, I wish...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> \u2014No, you listen to me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> I wanna kill me, or &quot;Jekyll&quot;... Who&#39;s lived his goody-goody life from the day he was born!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Honesty, trust, goodwill!<br> I don&#39;t need that kind of crap!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> You hear me?<br> I can&#39;t stand the fact that you exist!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> I will kill you!<br> And I will be the complete &quot;Hyde!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m positive he&#39;s an anti-hero!<br> Wait, he is, right? A-at any rate, we must stop him!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s okay.<br> I&#39;ve always wanted to fight seriously with him once.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mr. Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re reckless to battle a Heroic Spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want to kill yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;m not losing my mind.<br> And, I&#39;m not a powerless human failure of a mage, either.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> I am a &quot;Heroic Spirit.&quot; I&#39;m one of the lost Servants materialized from the remains of Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> I was summoned after you returned to Chaldea, and the living Jekyll returned to his original era\u2014that&#39;s the story.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Somehow I had a feeling that a thing like this could happen\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> So I was waiting. Right in this room,<br> right after my living self returned to the original era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Two identical Heroic Spirits are in the same place!?<br> Could this really...happen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait a second. I see. Maybe his spirit &quot;has completely separated personalities?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Damn, damn, damn!<br> Shoot, I did all this for nothing!!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Finally!<br> I thought I could finally kill &quot;Jekyll&quot;!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> You should read Wells.<br> Though his books were published after we died.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> The rank system of Heroic Spirits may be something that transcends such a notion, but it&#39;s fine\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash.<br> Can you fight with him against me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> If he&#39;s like that,<br> he could be dangerous to get along as your ally, right?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> So, I think I should make him learn his lesson now.<br> For the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It makes sense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Fine. Fine, you bastard!<br> I&#39;ll be happy to play your game, even by myself!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> Goddamnit\u2014<br> I&#39;m going to take all my pent-up anger out on you!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!<br> What are we going to do now...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whatever happens happens!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We just do the best we can!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes, Master!<br> Servant battle\u2014commencing!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> ...Whew. Your combat power is as quite good as I expected. Well done.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll be going now.<br> I&#39;m sure he learned what his limit was after all.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Nothing will do you good to be overcome by &quot;Hyde.&quot;<br> Don&#39;t forget your original purpose, &quot;myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Are you going to live a life that would shame Tatsumi?<br> Think a little, and you&#39;d have figured that out.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru.<br> Give my regards to Saber and Fran if you see them.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong><br> Good-bye\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Servant Jekyll is gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We got the results of the observation.<br> It shows that his existence itself was unstable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Demonic Fog remaining in London is not perfect, either, so it wasn&#39;t a proper summon or materialization.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He would have disappeared by himself sometime soon anyway. So, um\u2014</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong><br> ...Humph.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> That killed the mood.<br> I should probably leave it at that, too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> That part of &quot;me&quot; looked happy when he disappeared.<br> What the hell was that &quot;learning his limit.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...Oh my.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Oh\u2014)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai. Compared to before, he seems...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A bit more obedient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Calmed down?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...Yes)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I&#39;ll return to Chaldea.<br> Pardon me for getting you in trouble, Master.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> It&#39;s true I acknowledge that I am also &quot;Hyde.&quot; but it wouldn&#39;t do any good if my thoughts become too hasty.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...It will, ah, never allow me to achieve anything.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> Someday I will resume my battle to control &quot;Hyde&quot; myself. I&#39;m truly sorry, Master, Mash.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> I should take no more detour and start correcting the world now.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll challenge myself to a rematch afterwards.</p>', 144);
