His love runs deep for the mekakure[1] type (regardless of their gender) but isn\u2019t vocal about his feelings.</p><p>\u201CI am not vocal about it, but Mash is cute. You sure are Mash. Oh Fran-chan. You are lovely, Fran-chan. And you, Fuuma Koutarou-kun, I could totally go for you.\u201D</p><p>Save his obsessive affection towards the mekakure type, Bartholomew is generally well-mannered and at the same time can commit wicked deeds without batting an eye. He is a great pirate who possesses both cruelty and sincerity.</p><p>His episodes of violence are not sporadic like Black Beard\u2019s, but he is quick to deal with those he has chosen to abandon.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>He interacts with his Master elegantly like the dandy he is. However, he starts speaking too fast when it comes to the mekakure type.</p><p>He is blessed with good judgment and decisiveness, but he is generally willing and makes it a point to abide by his Master\u2019s commands.</p><p>That said, when he betrays you, he does so without so much as a by-your-leave\u2014which lives up to his reputation(?) as a pirate.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CLeveling up feels like there\u2019s some heat building up in my lower abdomen\u2026 I could get hooked to this.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYour usual crudeness makes me envious, Black Beard.

Bartholomew was a lowly second mate on the slave ship Princess, but their ship was captured by a pirate ship one day, leaving him with no choice but to reluctantly join the pirate business in order to stay alive. As it happens, Bartholomew had remarkable aptitude as a pirate, and with the death of their captain, his crewmates convinced him to take post.</p><p>Perhaps fed up with how very hopeless pirates are after several acts of piracy, he worked out a stringent pirate code. It was obviously unlikely that all his crew complied, but nevertheless Bartholomew\u2019s pirate code was enforced on the crew of his large fleet.</p><p>While other pirates had been disappearing one after another through the increasing efforts of crackdown of the armies of various countries, Bartholomew remained standing as the last and greatest pirate of all.</p><p>However, like all other famed pirates, he would also suffer the same tragic fate. Bartholomew engaged in battle with the army ship that had located them while reprimanding his drunk, unconscious crew at the same time. But as ill luck would have it, his throat was torn out by a grapeshot, and he died instantly.</p><p>Perhaps shocked by the death of this man of overwhelming charisma, his crew apparently surrendered without much resistance.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>For some reason, it seems that all pirates are into some sort of type, and in Bartholomew\u2019s case it\u2019s the mekakure type (regardless of their gender). But because he claims to be a dandy, he would never make a move that will blatantly expose his fetish. Was he always into the mekakure type, or did he develop this fetish after death? Bartholomew doesn\u2019t remember either.</p><h2 id="in-atlantis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-atlantis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Atlantis</h2><p>Bartholomew was originally one of the Servants summoned ahead of time in Atlantis. Instead of joining the main force, he operated as a separate squad and was in charge of disrupting the Atlantis army, overseeing covert maneuvering, as well as acting as decoy.</p><p>Even after the main force was annihilated, Bartholomew integrated into Atlantis as a transporter (it helped that the people of Atlantis had become less vigilant after many years of peace in the islands), waiting for the day when reinforcements would be sent.</p><p>In the end, he fulfilled the dream he could never have achieved in his lifetime due to his position as a pirate. His dream of delivering hope came true.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Cutlass and flintlock</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Black Beard</strong></p><p>I don\u2019t want anything to do with you.

Not in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Mary Read</strong></p><p>A bit of a shame\u2026 Could you perhaps try growing your bangs?</p><p><strong>Frankenstein</strong></p><p>Wonderful.

If I remember correctly, he was supposed to be a closet otaku in his first profile setting (Well, you\u2019re not doing a good job hiding it!) which is why I designed him to have this snobbish feeling over all, then show his unconcealable otaku-ness through his expressions and his gun strap. I guess I could have shown a bit more? Also, his clothes don\u2019t quite fit him because I imagine him to be dressed up in his loots. I want to make him wear a T-shirt like Black Beard.
