If she is serious, she can erase her presence to the extent that people would not even notice her being right in front of them. Because of that, everyone would notice the state of affairs they are in after they realized what she has just done.</p><p><strong>Riding: [A]</strong></p><p>Piloting and remodelling spaceships are also some of Jane\u2019s specialties.

Even if it is shot right in front of the opponent, this attack will go around and cut in towards them from behind their back without exception. This grants the attack a \u201Ccertain hit\u201D effect. It is said that the shot opponent will hallucinate playing cards in the makeup of \u201Ca two pair that resembles the Aces and Eights of Clubs and Spades\u201D while in the course of their death. It is a special move that causes the same manner of death that \u201CThe Champion of the Plains\u201D, \u201CWild Bill\u201D Hickok \u2013 who was Jane\u2019s lover and comrade-in-arms \u2013 had suffered to her opponent.</p><p>In historical fact, in the town of Deadwood in South Dakota, \u201CWild Bill\u201D \u2013 while in the midst of amusing himself with poker in a bar \u2013 was assassinated from behind by Jack McCall.

As far as Jane is concerned, with her extremely positive thoughts, the future is something that will come as a matter of course. She will never lose hope, even if the existence of the universe before her is at stake, and she will believe in everyone surviving in the end with an easygoing attitude. Her motives are all out of a good will, but there are times when she will occasionally take actions that will leave others with some doubts and make them question \u201CIs she actually a good person?\u201D For example, if a hypothetical situation becomes something like, \u201CWatch out! It looks like the bridge is gonna collapse!\u201D, then she will come to a house in the neighbourhood and completely cut off and take a supporting pillar from it for the bridge.</p><p>The only disciple taken in by Professor Tokiomi \u2013 a space archaeologist who held a principle where he did not take in any disciple with the exception of his daughter (Ishtar) \u2013 and, should he be in an emergency and something happened to him as a result, someone who earned his trust to the extent that he would entrust Jane with the situation that would occur after his death. Nonetheless, she had not been academically appreciated by the Professor, viewing her as someone like an unworthy disciple who was not able to learn the orthodox techniques to accurately decipher the historical materials and infer the historical facts from them; instead of trying to use those orthodox techniques, she would start to say \u201CIt was right where I was pointing at with my sixth sense\u201D when discovering a relevant material.</p><p>To Professor Tokiomi, he had predicted that \u201CEven if I can teach her the innate goodness of man by following a textbook, to me, (because Ishtar is a clever child,) she will see through that fake goodness right away, and aside from the period of time where I am staying close to her, she may eventually lose interest in that goodness and completely shift to her natural wickedness. But if she \u2013 by looking at Jane, who is a good person from the very beginning and is not two-faced, and who arrives at the truth in a straight line after some struggle\u2026 despite the fact that there are even some times where she brings about destruction and disorder to the surroundings as compensation for those traits \u2013 can come to realize that good and evil are not necessarily limited to the two sides of the same coin, I think she will at least never end up stooping to plain evil.\u201D</p><p>And just as the Professor predicted there, Ishtarin carried through with her training as the brilliant straight woman of the duo to Jane\u2019s comedy act without lapsing into wickedness even once, and although she is fussy during the times when she is calculating her profits, and although it is somewhat easy for her to lose her temper, she had healthily(?) grown up into a fierce bounty hunter who helps the weak and snaps at the strong.<br> Moreover, regarding Jane, she has truly not changed at all, astonishingly.</p><p>Jane will never blame other people, and on the contrary, she will rejoice and praise them for anything they accomplish, no matter how trivial those accomplishments are. In addition, regarding that kind of point, she has a good compatibility with Ishtar, who gets carried awa\u2026 er, rather, who grows with praise.</p><p>A capable space scout, Jane\u2019s survival abilities are exceptional. However, she has zero life skills. Her sabotage and disturbance skills that do not involve anti-personnel targets (and when she is put on the spot) are reliable, but her direct anti-personnel combat capabilities fall one step short in comparison.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CIt\u2019s okay!

Although Jane is not a so-called \u2018outlaw\u2019, and although much of her achievements are exaggerated and she has made many dubious claims, she had lived a life that was filled with both praise and censure, even during the days when she was alive. She has a large quantity of debuffing Skills mixed in with her positive disposition due to that dual nature of hers. A figure of the American West who took the word \u201CCalamity\u201D for her own name, and someone who lived in the same time period as Billy the Kid. An expert with guns, and a brilliant scout, she was crowned with the nickname \u201CThe Heroine of the Plains\u201D for being the comrade-in-arms of her lover \u201CWild Bill\u201D Hickok \u2013 \u201CThe Champion of the Plains\u201D, the two having simultaneously ran through many predicaments together.</p><p>Regarding how Jane got the name \u201CCalamity\u201D, there is a rumour where she is \u201CThe Helping Hand who Saves Those From Calamity\u201D in that she rescued the cavalry that were being assailed by the Indigenous Peoples, there is a rumour where she is \u201CThe Woman who Invokes Calamity\u201D in that her lovers would always lose their lives in the middle of battle, and there is another rumour where both of these folk tales are regarded as true. She is also known as \u201CMiss Greedy Woman\u201D.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A bounty hunter who does not think about difficult matters, is cheerful and happy, and loves new things.

A Space\u2606Cheerleader who lives on \u201Cthis day\u201D, forgetting about the grudges from yesterday as well as the debts from the days before yesterday once and for all.</p><p>In the Servant Universe, Jane joined the \u201CPrimeval Goddess Sealing Team\u201D 2000 years ago as their scout. Although the team succeeded in the sealing operation due to the accurate reconnaissance data that Jane provided, Jane received a curse of \u201Cimmortality\u201D as the price for killing the Goddess, and that resulted in her completely attaining a body that is unable to die until the time the Goddess awakens again. By all rights, a person\u2019s spirit would get tired and degenerate from wandering for a long time, but Jane did not fall to her knees from this curse because of her characteristic cheerfulness.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Space Ishtar (First Saint Graph[1])</strong></p><p>\u201CAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Ishtarin is my friend, my money, my partner, and my target, but after all is said and done, she\u2019s very much my friend, you know?\u2606<br> But say, I do have a problem with her in not giving even the slightest attention to my romantic tales~<br> Master from Earth, I wonder, but won\u2019t you come back for me once again?~\u201D</p><p><strong>Billy the Kid</strong></p><p>\u201CWhat do you think about a fella who happened to get shot from behind and die while in the middle of playing poker?
