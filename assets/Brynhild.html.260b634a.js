As the one who taught Rune Magecraft to her beloved Sigurd, she is also a first-rate magus in her own right. Originally as a skill symbolizing the &quot;Primordial Rune&quot; granted by her father the great god himself, its power is normally suppressed. If she demonstrates the full potential of the skill without having Divinity at A Rank or above, not only would she receive restrictions on the use of her Noble Phantasm, severe damage would be inflicted upon her Spirit Core as well, to the point where Brynhildr would eventually be annihilated.

Back when she was a Divine Spirit as the eldest among the Valkyries, she was something akin to a \u300Cdoll\u300Dwith little sense of self, after she was cast down to earth when she incurred the wrath of her father, the great god, she attained a human-like nature and a personality due to her encounter with Sigurd.</p><p>Deeply compassionate and passionate in love, willing to go to any lengths for the one she loves. Had tragedy not befallen her, a woman that would definitely spend her life as a good wife. While continuing to love the hero Sigurd more than anyone else, she was wreathed in the flames of killing intent at the conclusion of a cursed tragedy of fate, eventually killing him and burning up her very existence.</p><p>Even now as a Heroic Spirit, she remains deeply in love with Sigurd. With that said, if on the off-chance that he was summoned in her presence, her spear would automatically be leveled at him. As the very concept of \u300Cthe one who has slain Sigurd\u300Dwas imprinted upon not only her Noble Phantasm, but also herself in her form as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p>While she consciously understands that the \u300Cdragonslayer\u300D hero Siegfried, who shares an origin with Sigurd, is \u300Csomeone else who&#39;s not Sigurd\u300D, for some reason it seems that she feels close to him so she would just enthusiastically stare at the two of them. (And then kill them.) Then that also sometimes includes Master.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Initially she would approach with restraint. She\u2019ll calmly obey any order. Fundamentally, she wouldn\u2019t defy any of Master\u2019s instructions in any situation. She accompanies Master. Whether it is the helplessness felt during her previous life, a habit formed when following the orders of the great god as a Valkyrie, her passivity that precludes resistance towards the system of Heroic Spirit Summoning, or a combination of the above, all of that could have shaped that inclination.</p><p>Barring extraordinary circumstances, she feels no deep attraction nor love for any person. She is strongly aware that, at the conclusion of any affection she harbours in her heart, the target would likely die at her hands from her Noble Phantasm. Besides above all else, already, her love has been devoted to for Sigurd-----it could also be put this way. She dreads the fact of\u300Cfalling in love with somebody\u300D. Of course, there is the incident with Sigurd, yet, trapped within her own fixation that \u300Cif I fall in love, I shall kill that person\u300D, she goes to great lengths to avoid even chatting with the Master.At least it\u2019s inside of herself.</p><p>She has one wish she desires for the Holy Grail. To reunite with her love Sigurd. Even though, if it came true at such a place, she would start to kill automatically.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u300CIt\u2019s troubling\u2026.\u300D</p><p>\u300C...

A tragic heroine from Norse Mythology. The battle maiden is identical with Sigrdrifa[2] in\u300CV\xF6lsunga saga\u300Dwith her companion\u2019s fate of the King of Warriors Sigurd, in the Poetic Edda\u300CSigrdrifa\u2019s song\u300D\u300CBrynhildr\u2019s trip to Hell\u300Dit talks about a Valkyrie falling in love with Sigurd identically.

She experienced her divinity abundantly stolen because of God\u2019s anger, she was placed with a curse of slumber in a castle surrounded in flames. Manifesting in there was the hero Sigurd, he undid the curse with the demonic blade Gram. Brynhildr fell in love. Teaching him all that she knew, even gifting to Sigurd magical runes, her blessing and that happiness so that he can move in the path of a hero. But, the happiness was nothing but merely short lived. Afterwards, Sigurd lost his memories----- Betrayed her, she was saddened in grief and was abandoned, she deliberately murdered Sigurd whom she loved. And shortly after, she severed her own life by herself.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>Even (presently as a Heroic Spirit) she still likes Sigurd now. Loves him even. To the extent that she would be challenging giantess/J\xF6tunn[3] of the underworld to get him back. Stripping away the shell of missed opportunities, sadness, hatred, and feelings of betrayal, what remains is only her pure love towards Sigurd. In her heart, she knows full well that he, who is stricter towards himself than anyone else, loves herself without a doubt, and she has decided to return his affections. For that reason, even now, she moves automatically.</p><p>If they meet once more, this time for sure they\u2019ll cuddle close together.</p><p>Thinking in that way, that body craves that life by itself.
