Good morning, Liz!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Ah. Good morning, Shirou.\u201D</p><p>I walk up to her leisurely.</p><p>It may sound rather blunt, but her manners somehow remind me of a baby duckling.</p><p>Especially this unconditional emotional attachment I sense from her.</p><hr><p>\u201CHey. Sure is an odd place to meet at.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Mm. This is the first time I come to the temple... Do you come often, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... Well, sort of. I have friends here, so it&#39;s nothing to do with the temple, I just drop in for a visit.</p><p>What about you? You said it&#39;s your first time here, did you need something?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Nothing in particular. However, I sensed a bad aura around here, kind of.\u201D</p><p>\u201CKind of?\u201D</p><p>\u201C......Yes.

Can it actually be seen?\u201D</p><p>\u201C..............................Do you want it?\u201D</p><p>And again, she skips a line, if not a whole paragraph.</p><p>We&#39;re now at the top floor, standing at the very edge of a communication cliff.</p><hr><p>\u201CEr... Do you have it?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI found it there.</p><p>I looked for it thinking it may be Illya&#39;s enemy, but it has Illya&#39;s scent, too.

It ought to be something ancient. Over two centuries old.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat, even older than the Heaven&#39;s Feel!\u201D</p><p>Then it&#39;s got to be a highly valuable archaeological artifact.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;m not too sure about the &quot;over two hundred years old&quot; part, but let&#39;s leave it at that.</p><hr><p>\u201CThanks, Liz. I&#39;ll gladly keep it... is that really okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt is.

No, she just goes straight into the woods.</p><p>......Don&#39;t want to think about it, but it does look like she just walked all the way from the castle.</p><hr><p>\u201CYeah. See you later, Liz.\u201D</p><p>\u201CRight...

If anyone else were to come up here, there&#39;d be an uproar like you can&#39;t imagine.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CDo not worry. We are already using magic to ward people off. The only ones who can notice us are those who possess magic themselves. And there is not that many of them in this city.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh. Indeed, you&#39;d definitely be found out by someone.

I saw her down in the shopping district buying a cake while dressed like that... Is that okay?\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Why, that is indeed a most interesting sighting.</p><p>Allow me to ask, was that a one-time happening? Or a serial occurrence?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201COh no, you definitely couldn&#39;t call it serial.</p><p>Only about once a week or so.\u201D</p><p>\u201CLeysritt!\u201D</p><p>\u201C...It&#39;s okay. We, all friends. Shirou help translate.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat is far too much trouble!</p><p>...Honestly. I had wondered where you&#39;d been getting such low-quality cakes from, but to think that they came from a mere bakery, and one in that distasteful shopping district...\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Okay. So, should I stop?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat would be wise. Order a catalog, we shall have them delivered from now on.</p><p>Yes. That would be the smart thing to do.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C............\u201D</p><p>I can&#39;t tell at all whether they love or hate each other, but either way, they sure are one interesting pair.</p><p>But, why is this duo here in the first place?</p><p>\u201C...You&#39;re not here looking for that bakery, are you?\u201D</p><p>You want Beko-chan, and that&#39;s over two kilometers away from here.</p><hr><p>\u201CNope. Looking for...\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt does not concern you. Let me make myself clear. Neither Leysritt nor I have the slightest interest in this school building.</p><p>The reason why we came to such a lowly place is to have you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><hr><p>Sella closes her mouth as if she made a mistake.</p><p>\u201CEh?

In order to avoid trouble, we must clarify the reason why we are here.\u201D</p><p>She nods to herself.</p><p>...I have a bad feeling about this. My ability to sense approaching man-made disasters has gotten a lot keener recently.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. In that case, I&#39;ll leave you to it. I won&#39;t ask what you were doing, so please go ahead and enjoy the nice view from up here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease wait a moment, Emiya-sama.</p><p>Forgive me for changing the subject, but does that sack in your hands contain what people call a boxed lunch?\u201D</p><hr><p>Our conversation just did a 180.</p><p>Indeed, the object I&#39;m holding now is most definitely a lunchbox. I just felt like packing one and bringing it with me.</p><hr><p>\u201CBoxed lunch...? Sella, Shirou... delicious?\u201D</p><p>\u201CAccording to Milady, they are beyond compare.</p><p>And if Milady, who is so particular about taste, said so, it must be first rate indeed.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................Shirou, we eat.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CUwaah, too close, too close...!\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>...Um.</p><p>The two stare intently and silently this way.</p><p>Liz... just seems to aim for my lunch.</p><p>Sella, on the other hand, has malicious intent in her eyes. Those are the eyes of a dangerous rival, one who&#39;ll be all over you the moment she sees a chink in your armor.</p><hr><p>\u201CA-Anyway, I&#39;ll see you two later!

What possible reason would you have to come here?\u201D</p><p>I ask her as I kick out at the desk.</p><p>\u201C...How strange. Will you not continue your search for a recorder left behind in some unsuspecting girl&#39;s desk?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhy would I do such a thing?!\u201D</p><p>The blue maid tut-tuts in disapproval.</p><hr><p>\u201C...What a puzzle. A boy of high school age, here at school during a holiday... I can think of no other reason why you would be here.\u201D</p><p>\u201CGuh... how did that twisted sense of logic get into your head?! I demand you get it back out again!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CTwisted...? But a significant portion of the books Leysritt bought contained such themes... around one in three, I would say.\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>She&#39;s hopelessly misinformed.</p><p>Whatever Liz has bought, there wasn&#39;t the slightest bit of common sense in it.</p><hr><p>\u201C...I see. So I was mistaken in believing you to be sexually aroused by your female classmates&#39; musical instruments.</p><p>...How unfortunate. I would have found it slightly admirable if you felt lust towards an instrument rather than the girl&#39;s body itself.\u201D</p><p>Sella&#39;s shoulders slump in disappointment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liz has been staring at my lunchbox the whole time.</p><hr><p>\u201CSo... If you guys don&#39;t have any business here, would you mind leaving?\u201D</p><p>I came to school today because I wanted to take it easy, so it&#39;d be great if they could leave me in peace.</p><hr><p>\u201COh, please take no notice of us. We simply wish to observe your daily activities at school. Please spend your day off as you normally would, be it sifting through the girls&#39; lockers or pleasuring yourself upon the desk of the girl you harbor secret feelings for.\u201D</p><p>\u201C........................\u201D</p><p>In conclusion...</p><p>If I cannot escape from these two, it looks like my peaceful morning will never come.</p><hr><p>\u201COkay.\u201D</p><p>I stand up.</p><p>\u201CEmiya-sama? Is it the recorder, after all?\u201D</p><p>\u201CHey look, a super gigantic ultra special strawberry cake from Fleur, down there in the schoolyard!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CA super giant cake...?! Could it be, perhaps, the legendary creature that attacked Athens?!\u201D</p><p>Sella runs to the window, while Liz stands with her unwavering gaze still fixed on my lunch.</p><hr><p>\u201CWhere?! Where is it, Emiya-sama?!</p><p>If it is indeed as big as you say, then it should at least be ten meters across at the very least! Anything less would be simply unforgivable! Completely tasteless, plain, decorated with whipped cream in such perfect symmetry that each white peak seems as if it was copied and pasted into its place, the ultimate, impossible to defend against, the one and only! An instant words cannot describe!</p><p>...Ahhh, should such a horrific and lowly cake exist, simply thinking about it is enough to make my magic circuits collapse in upon themselves!\u201D</p><hr><p>&quot;Kyaaaaaa!&quot; Sella screams in joy.</p><p>...Um. It sounds like the Einzberns&#39; magic circuits have a fatal flaw or two in them somewhere.</p><hr><p>\u201CHuh?! Liz! What has become of Emiya-sama?!\u201D</p><p>\u201CHallway. Like a deer. &quot;Taptaptap,&quot; like that.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt can&#39;t be, was that just a feint...!?</p><p>Kuh, how cunning...! After him, Leysritt! We must not let him escape!\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...Did I do something to deserve this?\u201D</p><p>Certainly nothing that I can remember, but since they&#39;re chasing me, I&#39;d better run for it.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not the castle, but the school. I should be able to lose them with no trouble\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015, whew.\u201D</p><p>I gather my breath and wipe the sweat off my forehead.</p><p>I circle back around the club building and the auditorium before taking shelter in the archery range.</p><hr><p>By the time I&#39;d finally shaken my pursuers off, it was almost noon, and...</p><p>\u201CMmm. Shirou, welcome.\u201D</p><p>Liz was already waiting for me at the range.</p><hr><p>\u201CW-We found you... <em>huff</em>... <em>huff</em>...\u2015\u2015\u2015 E-Emiya-sama, please do not concern yourself with us and proceed at your leisure.\u201D</p><p>Sella arrives, short of breath.</p><p>I&#39;d heard she was hardly the athletic type, but to tail me all the way here would have taken a fair bit of energy. She must have quite some tenacity.</p><p>...There&#39;s definitely something very wrong with those Einzbern magic circuits.</p><hr><p>\u201C...All right, all right. I give up. Let&#39;s just settle down and eat. I&#39;ll split it with you two, so please be satisfied with that.\u201D</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Sella may be another story, but Liz will be perfectly satisfied if I just share my lunch with her.</p><hr><p>\u201CI... see... <em>huff</em>... I must also have nourishment after this. Today we will settle for Emiya-sama&#39;s cooking, and call it research. In-depth investigation to... <em>huff</em>... follow... <em>huff</em>... later.\u201D</p><p>Sella staggers towards the boxed lunch on wavering steps before finally collapsing in front of it.</p><hr><p>\u201CSella, don&#39;t hog.</p><p>Shirou said, split it for two.\u201D</p><p>And as Liz sees it, there&#39;s none for me.</p><hr><p>\u201C...Well, if that&#39;s what it takes for you to leave me alone, it&#39;s fine, I guess.\u201D</p><p>But that reminds me.</p><p>What were these two doing here, anyway?</p><hr><h3 id="school\u30FBday-4-flip-flop-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#school\u30FBday-4-flip-flop-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> School\u30FBDay 4 Flip-flop 3</h3><hr><p>After finishing lunch, I walk through the school building.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s a holiday, I could see people here and there.</p><p>It&#39;s probably the students who are working hard for their club activities.

I wish they got used to it already, there&#39;s always so much noise whenever I&#39;m gone.</p><p>I was preparing to cause quite a stir, actually, but with those two around, it was a total waste.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... that is, how should I put it...\u201D</p><p>I guess I ought to thank them.</p><p>The thought of Illya trying out some new trick at school is rather scary.</p><hr><p>\u201CMilady!\u201D</p><p>Speaking of the devil... A maid is approaching from the courtyard. Running while holding the hem of her skirt in her hands. Immodest, yet somehow cute.</p><hr><p>\u201CAs I thought, you came here.</p><p>...In the future, I would humbly request that you call to us if you desire to leave the castle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI told you, I won&#39;t do things I don&#39;t want to do. If I go out alone, I want to be alone. As a servant, you should consider at least that much.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...I am well aware of it, but this much was the order of the head of the household.</p><p>For as long as the most minuscule of dangers befall Lady Illyasviel, I shall protect her to the utmost of my poor ability, my body shall become her shield\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201D</p><p>\u201CAh geez, that&#39;s so annoying, I&#39;m telling you.</p><p>You worry way too much, Sella.</p><p>There&#39;s practically nothing even remotely dangerous left in this city and even then, I&#39;ll be able to handle it myself, one way or another.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C...It is exactly as you say, however... danger has many faces, and not all of them may look frightening.</p><p>For instance, a treacherous friend.</p><p>A normally worthless existence that is waiting for just the right moment to rebel.\u201D</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Why is the blue maid looking right at me?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Muh. There&#39;s some logic to what Sella&#39;s saying. I am well prepared against an outside attack, but I haven&#39;t thought about enemies coming from within.</p><p>But in that case, it might be even more fun.\u201D</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>I&#39;m asking, why are you all looking at me, young lady?</p><hr><p>\u201C...Enemy? Shirou, enemy?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWrong. More like a sacrifice. I know I&#39;ll be the victim, no matter what happens.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmph, how shameless. How dare you say that after calling Milady to a place like this?</p><p>Leysritt, Emiya-sama is not an enemy, but neither is he a friend. From now on, if he does something to make our lady sad, make sure to punish him mercilessly.\u201D</p><hr><p>...Ugh, the situation&#39;s going from bad to worse.</p><p>From now on, if Illya ever cries, Emiya residence ought to expect a visit from Liz the Hitman to follow right after.</p><hr><p>\u201CIt&#39;ll be okay, Liz actually has a lot more restraint than Sella. Yeah, in your case, I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t just split you in half.\u201D</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ll be captured and questioned first,&quot; follows her reassuring explanation.</p><p>&quot;Good thing they&#39;re still listening, isn&#39;t it? Now you have a chance to come up with a good excuse.&quot; is what she seems to mean by &quot;okay.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u201C...Milady. Your impression of myself as having less moderation than Leysritt is a misunderstanding. As one that has been placed in charge of your education, I could not possibly be inferior to Leysritt in the intelligence aspect.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYeah. Sella is smart.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CLook. Liz actually has a charming side to her. Besides, a lack of memory capacity isn&#39;t the same as a lack of intelligence. You&#39;d do well to be a bit more amiable yourself, Sella.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhile I shall duly take note, we have no need for human qualities. They have no bearing on our ability to be Milady&#39;s guardians.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CReally. You are truly hard headed.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s fine. If you two have come to search for me, your job is already done. I shall come back early tonight, so go on ahead of me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CCertainly. Then, do excuse us.\u201D</p><p>\u201C..................\u201D</p><p>Sella adheres to Illya&#39;s strict order.</p><p>On the other hand, Liz looks rather lonely.</p><hr><p>\u201CWait. I&#39;m just wondering, how do you two plan to get back to the castle?\u201D</p><p>\u201CThere is a car waiting in the shopping district&#39;s parking lot. While it is meant primarily as Milady&#39;s transport to and from the castle, I am permitted to use it once in a while, as well.\u201D</p><p>\u201C&quot;Use&quot;... as in &quot;drive&quot;?\u201D</p><p>\u201CNaturally. If you are still in doubt, would you like me to show you my driver&#39;s license?\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh... I believe you, I&#39;m just surprised. Yeah, considering how far the castle is, having a car makes total sense.</p><p>...Then, when Illya comes to my house...?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, you didn&#39;t know? When I come by myself, I drive.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201C!?\u201D</p><p>A s-shocking fact has been revealed just now...!</p><p>The private forest land is one thing, but to think that there&#39;s actually a mysterious silver-haired girl roaring around on public roads...</p><p>...We might be the only ones who don&#39;t know about it. There may well be a pretty famous ghost story about the Miyama town street racer.</p><hr><p>\u201CThen, what kind of car do you drive? A Bersercar?\u201D</p><p>\u201CA supercar from another world.</p><p>...I mean, what was its name... Whenever Sella hears the engine, she&#39;s so fascinated she keeps muttering things like &quot;Valkyrie Geschrei.&quot;\u201D</p><p>\u201CLady Illyasviel. That is a Mercedes-Benz 300SL Coupe. Ten years ago during the last Heaven&#39;s Feel, that high performance machine saw a lot of activity for the sake of the Einzbern.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, right right, that&#39;s the one. It&#39;s just a tool for running away, but it sure sounds great, doesn&#39;t it? They say the top speed is something like 270 kph, too bad you won&#39;t see that on public roads in Japan.</p><p>It really is amazing. The craftsmen from that country must either love custom orders, have a special vision, or maybe they just hate the very phrase &quot;mass production.&quot;\u201D</p><hr><p>Ooh, Mr. Benz, is it?</p><p>I don&#39;t know if the 300SL is a famous car with a rich history, but I&#39;m sure it comes with an eye-popping price tag.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm. Well, I guess we&#39;ll be parting ways at the bottom of the hill. Let&#39;s go back together until then.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat nonsense are you saying? While I am still hesitant, Milady did say that she wishes to walk back with you alone, did she not? I do believe that is good fortune you may not see in a hundred years.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CThat&#39;s right, Shirou. Today, I&#39;m walking home from school with you, so they ought to go back first. If Sella and Liz are here, it&#39;s just no different than inside the castle.\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I suppose we&#39;re not at the castle here. The two of us can walk home anytime, but having everyone together is quite rare.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CRight? So let&#39;s go like this today.</p><p>I hate having to walk up this long hill every morning to go to school, but it does come in handy on occasions like these.\u201D</p><p>\u201C......<em>sigh</em> It can&#39;t be helped, can it. If Shirou wants to, then we shall all keep him company, just this time.</p><p>Let&#39;s go Sella, Liz. As an exception, you are permitted to accompany us to the bottom of the hill.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CT-Thank you very much, Milady. I am very grateful for your consideration...!</p><p>And Emiya-sama, may my rudeness today never be forgotten.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;m happy. Shirou, good person.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CYou really are a dummy, Shirou. They&#39;re my servants, there&#39;s no need for you to worry about them.\u201D</p><p>Her harsh words and smiling face telling opposite stories, Illya heads towards the hill road.</p><p>The two maids look like they&#39;re attached to her back.</p><p>This is an unusual development, but I guess it&#39;s nice once in a while\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u201CBy the way. Why were you following me around?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWe thought we would find out the reason behind Milady&#39;s coming to this school. Learning what catches her interest could become very useful information in the future.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm\u2015\u2015\u2015Then, what does that have to do with me?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDo you not remember anything? Your part in this, as one of the main causes, is quite obvious. If we found out more about your school life, it would help find a method to persuade Milady further.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CHm. So basically, you were looking to find out my faults and sell them out to Illya?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou are quick to understand. Unfortunately, we were unable to capture the kind of image we were hoping for.\u201D</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>This person really sees me as an enemy.</p><hr><p>\u201CHmm. Sella, what was Shirou like in the morning?\u201D</p><p>\u201CIt was quite disappointing. Emiya-sama&#39;s conduct was boring in the extreme.\u201D</p><p>\u201CSkimmed his lunch a bit.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CAh, you two ate from his lunchbox!? The one I was aiming for myself!\u201D</p><p>\u201C! I beg your forgiveness, Milady, I obtruded improperly...! But at that level of skill, given time to study, I shall be able to reproduce it...!\u201D</p><p>\u201CSella, no way. Ad-lib not work on that.</p><p>Also, stealing food makes you fat. Fat Sella, can&#39;t stand.\u201D</p><hr><p>\u201CL-Leysritt...! That was pure sampling of food, d-do you really think that I would do something so discourteous!!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon&#39;t know. But midnight snacks, you should cut.\u201D</p><p>\u201C!?</p><p>H-How do you know about that!?\u201D</p><hr><p>With Liz and Sella&#39;s quarrel livening things up, Illya smiles as she walks down the hill road.</p><p>I ended up being just an extra.</p><p>This may not be what Illya had in mind, but I think it worked out for the best.</p><p>There&#39;s a few minutes before we reach the intersection.</p><p>The evening&#39;s tumult looks like it&#39;ll continue for a little while longer.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3>', 483);
