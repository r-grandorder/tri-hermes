We are fine with whatever name you choose to differentiate us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hello, Hundred Personas.<br> What a surprise to see you in Senpai&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just brought over some tea.<br> Would you like to join us?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> No, if Master is busy, that&#39;s fine.<br> Please excuse us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did something happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, please wait. If you leave now, I will not be able to enjoy tea time because I will be so curious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you have something on your mind,<br> please do not hesitate to mention it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh. Is it something that you cannot say because I&#39;m around? If so, I can leave\u2013</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...No, actually we wanted to ask Master a favor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A favor?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Yes. We need the assistance of someone familiar with the layout of Chaldea and who knows where people in it can be found.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Which is to say, we will probably need Mash&#39;s help, too.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t mind, we would like you to listen, too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. If there is anything I can do,<br> I&#39;m happy to help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...what is this favor?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Well, to put it simply:<br> we would like you to help us find somebody.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Find...somebody?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you&#39;re looking for a staff member or Servant, we can just use the PA system to ask them to come here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We considered that approach, but if she could answer such a call, we would have found her a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Actually, ever since we were Summoned,<br> we have been looking for her in our spare time.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We did not go as far as make an announcement, but we did shout out her name, peek inside rooms, and check all the hallways.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> But since we still haven&#39;t come across her...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> She either doesn&#39;t want to answer the call,<br> or she simply can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> That was our conclusion.<br> That&#39;s why we need to search for her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...this is starting to sound like a case that needs to be solved!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So who is this person you are searching for?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...Um, well...it&#39;s quite embarrassing, but...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm? Um, you were kind of mumbling there, so I didn&#39;t hear you.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> A-anyway! We&#39;re all in good hands now that Master and Mash are here to help us!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s get out there and start searching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, she headed out so eagerly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s still so many questions left,<br> but let&#39;s just go after Hundred Personas, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you have any clues?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Well, she is almost certainly inside Chaldea,<br> but other than that, we have no clues.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you&#39;re going into this blind?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To search every nook and cranny somewhere as vast as Chaldea could take a long time!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> There is no need for concern. We have full knowledge of her personality, characteristics, and abilities.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We have some limited insight into what might happen around her, or what she might do...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> So we ask Master to lead us to places where she might be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see...rather than sleuthing, you already have a few places in mind to search.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Exactly.<br> Now, the first place we would like to go is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This...is where you wanted to go...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Interesting...here...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Then, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, why are you pulling out your dagger and swinging it around before you enter!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hundred Personas?<br> Hundred Personas!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Dufufufu...pretty girl figurines are the BEST. It&#39;s like two and three dimensions got together and made the baby of my dreams!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This plump yet oh so flat belly is to DIE for...<br> Ahhh, this sculpt is a work of ART!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That devilish whim called adolescence...the wonderful transition between girlhood and womanhood that lasts only the briefest of moments...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This delicate balance can only be expressed through microscopic adjustments...a technique and craftsmanship that can only be achieved by steady-handed experts.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> That soft skin...and the bouncy bits...all to convey that age. It&#39;s so...ah, marvelous!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Nugh!? This Blackbeard&#39;s eyes can&#39;t be deceived!<br> Th-this figure...has cast-off parts?!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Colchis Brand figures...always a high quality brand!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> You never disappoint.<br> It&#39;s already a superb piece of work...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But to put even more curvaceous elements and incorporate the third-dimensional sense of being able to take off clothes...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This has gotta be a challenge for the great Blackbeard. Taunting me! To strip it, or not to strip it...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But don&#39;t underestimate me! I don&#39;t have a problem displaying my figures in my room after they&#39;ve been stripped!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Even if my parents see them, I would proudly declare: \u201CMom, Dad, this is my girlfriend!\u201D</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This is how a REAL man lives!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...And now, if you&#39;ll excuse me...<br> I&#39;ll take a little taste...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Aaagh!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...Oh no...the edge of the figure&#39;s clothes...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Apologize! Apologize to the expert craftsman (aka Medea) who worked so tirelessly on every frill of the figure&#39;s skirt!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Tsk. We missed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that all about!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even pervy otaku like Blackbeard have rights. Maybe.</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hmph. You saw what kind of man he is.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> He loves cute things to an almost sickening level, and his greed drives to make them his own. And he feels joy from managing and observing them...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> If the one we are searching for has been captured,<br> this creep would naturally be the first suspect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The reason why Hundred Personas cannot find who they are looking for is because they&#39;ve been captured and imprisoned by Blackbeard!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s a bit far-fetched\u2013</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Totally!<br> I&#39;m being framed! Totally blameless!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> There are tons of angels in Chaldea of prime age,<br> like Mary and Jack...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> But that&#39;s exactly why I always try to interact with such angels at the borderline acceptable level!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> After all, if I \u201Caccidentally\u201D touch or hug them,<br> I&#39;d get killed!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> But that only means that if there were no such risks, you WOULD do that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> The one we&#39;re seeking is not risky or dangerous at all. They are just small. Just cute.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Eh? What kind of rare angel is that?<br> Are they around? Where? Where&#39;s my camera???</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We knew it.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> There&#39;s a possibility that he would trick them with enticing words, or drag them back to his lair.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Fess up. Refuse, and it&#39;s just a matter of us annihilating you first, or we can search your room!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Tch...<br> Give me a break.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Blackbeard may be bad, but I&#39;m no low-level scum who can&#39;t be proud his own way of life.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> If I were to fall in love with a girl, it&#39;d only be because it&#39;s mutual. I&#39;d get her parents&#39; permission!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> And then head off to a church to get married.<br> That&#39;s the route to a True End!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong></p><p>Th-there&#39;s no way we&#39;re giving her away to scum like you! We will not allow it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This has taken a turn for the insane,<br> but let&#39;s try to calm things down, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Fuuuuuu!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> Here I was in MY OWN room, minding my business, just admiring my lovely figures, and you go all aggro! What did I do to deserve this!?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...Not here.<br> We were wrong.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> I told you I didn&#39;t know what you were on about as soon as you got here...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> My brand new figure...broken...ungh...Blackbeard&#39;s gonna cry... (Sniff)...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Ugh. Don&#39;t cry while we&#39;re here.<br> Disgusting.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> SHOCK!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mustn&#39;t, Hundred Personas. Blackbeard may be bad, but he&#39;s a pure-hearted dreamer when it comes to his hobbies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if disavowing his hobby is the right thing to do, it&#39;ll only result in his mental collapse!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> What, it&#39;s okay to insult me in front of my face now!? Even you are so cruel today, Miss Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Give it up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just accept it...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> It was all just a misunderstanding.<br> The one we&#39;re looking for is not here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We must apologize.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Apology!? Do you think apologizing will fix my poor, beloved figure!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> This...this girl...an elven-eared craftsman worked her hardest to make this figure by hand. There&#39;s no chance of getting another one...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hm. Will you accept our apology if this thing gets fixed? We&#39;ll send Dew Painter over to you later.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> WH-WHAT!?<br> You can fix it?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hah...don&#39;t underestimate the Hundred Personas. Our one hundred specializations are not just on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Dew Painter, as that name suggests, can paint anything in any color and is an expert at befuddling the enemy through coloring.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> He should be an expert in sculpting, if I remember correctly. He did say that magical reconstruction is one of his favorite tasks.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> To further improve this figure to match your greatest desire should be no harder than a snap of the fingers to him.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> APOLOGY ACCEPTED.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong><br> So, first I want these knee-high socks to be gone to show off her healthy thicc legs, and I&#39;ll add glasses, a recorder instrument, and a ribbon...and her clothes will be partially off, and her sides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, maybe you hit him a on the head a little too hard... He&#39;s fainted, but he&#39;s still grinning...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> So we were wrong about the first suspect,<br> but we cannot give up yet.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head to the next suspect.<br> Master, Mash. Please lead the way.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Based on what happened with Blackbeard,<br> we&#39;re looking for someone small and cute.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find them soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.<br> Let&#39;s keep that positive attitude.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hope we find them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Someone small and cute... Well, there are a lot of people like that in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that&#39;s all we have to go on...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> She&#39;s shy, so you&#39;ve definitely never met her before.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Please let us know if you see someone fitting that description immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way, who is looking for this person?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is it just you, Asako?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it just you?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> No, this is very important to all of us. I am not the only one looking. The rest of the personas are also on the lookout.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hn...speak of the devil. Take a look.<br> Gozul the Strong is over there.</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong><br> Hnnnngh!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hahaha.<br> Good work! That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Oh crap. This is no time to laugh.<br> I&#39;ll lose my grip if I don&#39;t keep my stomach taut.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You&#39;re as strong as you look! You&#39;re no Grendel,<br> but you still got some potential!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> That ain&#39;t fair, Wulf. Were you all talk when you said you&#39;d end it in an instant? This ain&#39;t a competition of stamina.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> I&#39;m a big idiot who enjoys a game of arm wrestling or two. A valiant match is nice and all, but hurry up and switch\u2013</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong><br> ...(Makes a \u201Ccome at me\u201D gesture)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Oh? Don&#39;t tell me you want me to get in on this, too!?</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong><br> ...(Grin)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Whooo! This guy&#39;s tough! This&#39;ll be GOLDEN! This guy&#39;s gonna go up against me and Wulf at the same time...one with each arm!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Heh, you&#39;re underestimating us!<br> A bastard like you...I love it!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Yeah, so laughable.<br> This guy&#39;s got a hothead.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...But we can get irritated after the match&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> The information you want from us is more valuable than the two of us. We know not to laugh at that!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hm. Looks like Gozul is trying to get those two to tell him the information we need by beating them in an arm wrestling match.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Look at all those bulging muscles...amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Overall combat efficiency aside, Gozul is probably the strongest of all of us when it comes to sheer arm power. I do not think he is at a disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hm. And I see Makul the Quick over there by the halls.</p><p><strong>Makul the Quick:</strong><br> Fwoosh...!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> Hm. What amazing speed.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> But I won&#39;t lose sight of someone in a footrace!<br> And you are in my turf!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong></p><p>Hey!!! Who&#39;s running in the halls!? WALK QUIETLY.<br> No matter how rushed you are, you do not run!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong><br> I will get on Tarasque and chase down rule breakers to the ends of the earth!!!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And Makul&#39;s doing some kind of competition of his own.<br> I see...a hunter&#39;s eyes may have spotted her.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And...oh, there&#39;s Zayed the Base over there.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ungh!<br> Impressive!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As the Roman Emperor, the incarnation of art itself...and obviously versed in dance, too...I am impressed with your graceful, elegant movements!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You are no ordinary person! Surely you must be able to gracefully avoid security sensors like that!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. They possess unique and wonderful rhythm. I&#39;m learning a lot, tee hee.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Wait. We can&#39;t just sit here watching, or all we are is an audience. I need to dance my heart out too.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong><br> ...Wait. Why am I in a dance contest?<br> Dancing is hardly my area of exp\u2013</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s...yes, Zayed. I don&#39;t think you should worry too much about Zayed. Probably for the best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...so all your personas are putting their skills to practical use to collect information on their own.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> That is our strength.<br> Diversity through one hundred specialties.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Someone&#39;s weakness may be someone else&#39;s strength. As such, we have limitless options for moving through the shadows.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> In that area, we believe we are the greatest among the Hassans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what&#39;s your strength...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So what&#39;s your strength, Asako...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Well, I do have a proper skill I&#39;m versed in...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> But for some reason, lately I&#39;ve been in the role of gathering and coordinating the others.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> This is likely because there are just so few of us who can communicate with Master properly.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Speaking of communicating, I realize that she also has difficulty doing so...which is why something like this happened in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hundred Personas?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> No, nothing.<br> I&#39;m just talking to myself.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Now, then.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Even though we have one hundred specialties, we are up against famed Heroic Spirits. None of these competitions will be easy.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Since I have a bit of free time, I&#39;m thinking of helping the others out if I get a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean, \u201Chelp out\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A-are we allowed?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to worry, Master.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> After all, we are us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> All the matches are judged by Hundred Personas.<br> All the matches are witnessed by Hundred Personas.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We are all one. So, even if someone tickles an opponent&#39;s arm, or maybe sticks out a foot to trip a runner in a race...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Those are all just methods we might employ to win the competition.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> It is neither cheating nor intervention from an outside party. We are, after all, doing these things ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I-I-I see...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Then let us go, Master.<br> Help me help myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This gets more confusing the more you think about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So many Hassans, all part of the same one...this must be what gestaltzerfall is like...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> (Pant...pant...)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Ah!<br> We lost! We lost!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> The moment he started using both arms, I shoulda realized it was a battle royale, not an arm wrestling match!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong><br> Why the hell didn&#39;t I watch out for someone creeping up from behind!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Tsk. If only I had one more arm. What, you don&#39;t think I could just GROW one from sheer willpower alone?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong><br> This wasn&#39;t a footrace. It was an obstacle course.<br> I should have paid closer attention to the rules.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ungh. Those unpredictable, unexpected motions of yours are well beyond ordinary! If you&#39;d lived in my time, I would have hired you as a court dancer!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong><br> Yes, indeed. I&#39;m sure you would have been in great demand at every inn.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Now, tell us.<br> Tell us everything you know.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> If you know anything about her movements...anything that could give us even a clue...tell us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...We see. If we put everything we have learned together and consider it, we could best summarize it by saying...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Something fishy is going on with the kids lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The children of Chaldea...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you think that&#39;s true, Hundred Personas?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> It could be possible.<br> It doesn&#39;t seem that far-fetched of a reason for this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Reason...?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Either way, we have some clues now.<br> Let&#39;s go see the children!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just knock...</p><hr><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Oh, a woodpecker is singing \u201Cknock, knock.\u201D<br> We have visitors. Visitors!</p><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Yes? Who&#39;s there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Master?<br> Anybody else with you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Me and Hundred Personas.<br> May we come in?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> ...No.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> No means no!</p><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> If it&#39;s just Mommy and Mash...no.<br> Nobody can come in.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Yep, yep.<br> Nobody can absolutely come in!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Ah, results at last.<br> Now if I may...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh wait, Hundred Personas!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Grr! I told you, you can&#39;t come in!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> I said so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Ah. So you were here all along.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So this girl is the one you were looking for?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...Yes. We&#39;re embarrassed to say so,<br> but that is the me that we were looking for.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> That&#39;s another of the Hundred Personas.<br> Yes, she is another of our personalities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but she seems a little different than the rest of the Hundred Personas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me for saying this, but she doesn&#39;t seem much like a Hassan OR an Assassin...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Of course not. The specialty of that persona is not knowing or being able to do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What does that mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> To know nothing can sometimes be very useful for an assassin.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> This would be utterly humiliating if it actually happened, but...hypothetically, let&#39;s say we failed a mission and the enemy captured us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> If we had a persona that knows nothing, then no matter how much they were interrogated, they could not reveal anything, because they do not KNOW anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s terrible!<br> A personality to use only under interrogation!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> How terrible! Bad!<br> To treat such a cute little girl that way!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We found her wandering the hallway and heard her story. That&#39;s why we brought her here.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You shouldn&#39;t have to do something you don&#39;t want to! You shouldn&#39;t have to be trapped by a boring and painful fate!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> That&#39;s a book you should just leave closed.<br> That&#39;s why we decided to let her stay here.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Here, her only job is to enjoy drinking tea and chatting.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> ...She doesn&#39;t talk much, but she is so cute when she eats snacks! Like a little squirrel!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> I&#39;m grateful you took good care of her until now.<br> But...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Are you going to take our friend away?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Even though there&#39;s so many of you already?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> No one else can fill her role. There is no changing the fact that she is one of our faces.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> We cannot have her stay in here forever.<br> Now, come. We&#39;re going home.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You can&#39;t.<br> We&#39;re not going to let you take our friend!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Right. We just got to be friends!<br> We don&#39;t want to say bye-bye yet.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> We haven&#39;t even learned her name.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...I see we have no choice. It appears we must first teach these children to heed their elders!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-please be gentle with them, Hundred Personas!<br> Let&#39;s just calm things down so we can talk!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Now that the children have had their spankings...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> We&#39;re not giving in! We won&#39;t just do whatever mean thing the adults tell us we have to!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you hurt our friend!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hundred Personas...um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Have mercy on them.</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> I cannot believe Mash and Master are looking at us like that...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> But, it seems there is still some misunderstanding.<br> To restate...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Allow us to clarify.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> You have no job at Chaldea. You are not in charge of being interrogated. You are just a part of us.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Not in charge of getting interrogated?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Matters would be different if we were exclusively assassins as we were in life. But now we are Master&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> There is no situation in which we would be captured.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Then...why were you trying to take them back?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Since we were summoned, this persona never showed her face. Not once.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> This one is still an important part of us.<br> We\u2013all of us\u2013were simply worried about her.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Worried?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Gozul, Makul, Zayed...everyone&#39;s looking for you. You should at least put in an appearance so everyone can stop worrying.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And after that...if you want to come back to your new friends and play, you may do as you like.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> They&#39;re also Master&#39;s Servants. Spending time interacting with others is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hm. Perhaps that is your new role here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;m too embarrassed to join in tea parties like this one.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...&#39;Kay.<br> Then I&#39;ll go back.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Yes, let&#39;s go back.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh.<br> Why didn&#39;t you tell us earlier?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> If she isn&#39;t going to get harmed, and if the people at home are worried, then obviously she should go home once in a while.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> You just need to come here whenever you want to have a tea party!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> When you&#39;ve left all your worries behind, or forgotten them, or just foisted them onto the adults, that&#39;s when we have a great, grand tea party!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> See you again, tiny little Hassan.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong><br> Bye-bye.</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> ...Bye-bye.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I never imagined such a Hassan existed...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m as surprised as you are.<br> She was so tiny and cute.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Surprised?<br> That&#39;s actually our line.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> While we are a conglomerate, we are individuals. We do not, however, have any sort of connection that would allow us to communicate mentally.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it took all of us,<br> and so much effort, to find her.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And that is why she also didn&#39;t know who you are or what your purpose is.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And that&#39;s probably why she didn&#39;t want to leave the children&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this all happened because she didn&#39;t know what sort of Master Senpai is.</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hehe... As a Servant who has spent a lot of time contracted with Master, I can tell you this much:</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As long as we are here,<br> we won&#39;t ever let you get hurt. Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And like the other Hundred Personas, you won&#39;t have to do the sort of dirty jobs you did in the past.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Sheesh. I&#39;m quite astonished.<br> To be honest, I am appalled.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Even though we are a Servant best suited for that kind of dirty work, Master has never once ordered us to do anything of the sort.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> And the fact that we know with certainty that Master would never issue such orders...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Hmph. You are a strange, strange [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F woman}, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Even though it&#39;s impossible to tell with that mask on...I have a feeling she&#39;s smiling as she says that. I can tell from her tone of voice.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s like we just found a new friend here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We should introduce her to the other Hundred Personas, as well as to the other Servants. Oh, and we should give her a tour of Chaldea, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Little Hassan.<br> Is there anywhere you would like to go?</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> ... (Nod)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where? I can take you anywhere.<br> Please do not hesitate to ask!</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> Potty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong><br> Ah! Okay! That&#39;s our first priority!<br> But hold it a little longer, okay?</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong><br> ... (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Asako...do you also specialize in babysitting?</p><hr>', 392);
