Since she was raised up in a closed space and was imprisoned in that space, she truly does not harbour things such as love towards the people of Russia. As far as Anastasia is concerned, the people of Russia are a symbol of barbarism and massacre, while simultaneously, they are nothing more than fear itself.</p><p>However, Anastasia also understands simultaneously that she is a legitimate successor to the Russian throne who was born and raised in the lands of Russia and who draws on the blood of the people of Russia. That standpoint and the lack of a place to put her feelings into are viewed as things that complicate her mentality, and as a result, it results in her showing a cold-hearted expression towards others.</p><p>The normal Anastasia is a mischievous, very mischievous, carefree girl.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Given that she has a feeling of distrust towards others, Anastasia somewhat places herself at a distance away from her Master.

She \u2013 who was born as the fourth princess under the moderate Russian Emperor Nikolai II and Empress Alexandra \u2013 was raised and loved above all else. On the other hand, the world followed a turbulent path in contrast to that moderateness of the Emperor. With things such as his defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the shooting incidents occurring on the masses, the glory of the Tsar was now close to falling to the ground as well.</p><p>However, the Emperor was a man ignorant of the ways of the world, nurtured by the history spun by the Emperors of Russia and not knowing the realities of Russia, while Empress Alexandra on the other hand was a woman who led a life of being on top of the world as a noble.</p><p>It was recorded that Anastasia was a mischievous girl who did mischievous things such as climbing trees, but at the same time, she frequently assumed responsibility of looking after her younger brother Alexei, who suffered from a disease.</p><p>If they were at least not the Imperial House, it seems they would have been given an ordinary peace, but their era was at that moment in the middle of a revolution. And so, due to being swallowed up by the surge of that era that her parents unexpectedly created, it has been decided that Anastasia will lose her life.</p><p>The Emperor abdicated, and the Nikolai family \u2013 whom were to live their lives in incarceration \u2013 were all executed together with their servants by shooting. In order to falsify the incident, their corpses were chopped up and burned with gasoline, and their remaining bones were furthermore poured onto with sulfuric acid and buried into the ground.</p><p>Afterwards, a woman calling herself Anastasia had also came forward, but according to a DNA scan of her discovered remains, her being the actual Anastasia has been completely denied.</p><p>Now, the Russian Revolution was an event that could also be called an inevitability due to that era, but still, if the Imperial House did not even make a mistake in their choices, the Revolution could probably have ended by having the family go into exile in Germany, which was Empress Alexandra\u2019s birthplace, and it may have ended as a bloodless revolution that did not spill any blood at all.</p><p>However, the Empress\u2019 reputation at that time was at its worst. For one can see that she was so completely reliant on a monk who was similar to a shady impostor, and moreover, it was even said that she was sharing her bed with him together.</p><p>That monk\u2019s name was Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin.

So on the night of the first day, he decided to draw a circle of devil exorcism and continued to pray while inside that circle. The monsters were frustrated by the man they could not see, so in the end, they decided to speak out the words \u201CCall Viy here!\u201D</p><p>Sure enough, Viy \u2013 a monster who was viewed as short and stout with eyelids that dangled all the way down to the ground \u2013 came around.3 When its voice said \u201CCome lift up my eyelids!\u201D, the monsters used all their strength to open those heavy eyelids. Khoma thought \u201CI musn\u2019t look!\u201D, but he was not able to resist the temptation and his gaze matched up with Viy\u2019s.</p><p>The moment Viy shouted \u201CHe\u2019s here!\u201D, the effect of devil exorcism vanishes, and Khoma pitifully dies.</p><p>Furthermore, at the beginning of the story, it was alluded that Viy is a legend that actually existed in Ukraine.</p><p>Reference Material: \u201CViy Investigation Notes: A Chat Over Tea About Ukrainian and Russian Monsters \u2013 Revised Edition\u201D by Asano Yoshifumi.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>The day before he was murdered, Alexei revealed to his older sister, Anastasia, of a secret handed down the Tsars.

In the future, I became aware of who her Master was going to be in the Lostbelts, and I secretly laughed at how their eyebags also match with each other (lol).
