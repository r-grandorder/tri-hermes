Abigail does not forget about her prayers and giving gratitude to God. Being as polite as a lady, she strives to be kind to anybody and everybody, whoever they may be. Normally, an intelligent girl full of emotions, one who is frequently surprised and is often smiling. Although it acts contrary to the belief of honourable poverty, she also holds a curiosity appropriate for her age where she shows a strong interest even in foreign topics, novels and theatre. She has acquired a habit where, in under unknown situations, she comes to a stop to level-headedly think of and decide on what to do. But still, it is easy for her to make mistakes as a result of her rashness and of her worrying too much when it concerns her friends and family.</p><p>Abigail\u2019s favourite food is pancakes. Wheat is a valuable item in the settlement grounds, and modern pancakes are seen as a great treat to her due to that.</p><p>Abigail is not very good at dealing with dogs barking.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Abigail has an upfront and straightforward trust for the Master, eagerly striving to meet their expectations. Compared to other Heroic Spirits, she feels a sense of inferiority in that she is no more than a mere child. She is aware of herself as an \u201CAnti-Hero\u201D who carries the deep-seated grudges of the victims of the witch trials on her back, and she has a strong repugnance in regard to enjoying herself when using her Foreigner powers. When she accumulates experience and repeatedly ascends as a Servant, it becomes easier for her disposition as the \u201CWitch\u201D of Salem to manifest to the foreground as well. She openly talks about her wish, and she also shows a whimsy side to the Master where it is like she is testing their ethics. And yet, there are also times where during the evenings \u2013 when her feeling of loneliness would then become stronger \u2013 she would want to behave like a spoiled child.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><ul><li><p>\u201CNice to meet you.

The two people who showed symptoms of demonic possession at the beginning of these incidents were the girl, Abigail Williams, and her female cousin, Betty Parris, who is the daughter of a minister. Those abnormal symptoms spread to other girls as well, and many villagers were indicted by the possessed girls over a period of approximately one year. The outcome of that resulted in a tragedy where as many as 200 people were arrested, causing the village dungeon to become full, and 19 of the arrestees were executed by hanging, 2 died in the dungeon, and 1 person \u2013 a non-arrestee \u2013 was tortured to death. Many mysteries still remain behind the tragedy, such as the girls\u2019 true motives and the main cause that became the trigger for everything.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A 12-year-old girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. Abigail became the impetus for the witch trials in the cursed town of Salem.</p><p>The Outer God \u201CAll-in-One, One-in-All\u201D.</p><p>That is to say, despite being a fiction that was created by one remarkable man, it possesses all the qualifications needed for an insanity that outdo common sense. Namely, for the Class \u201CForeigner\u201D; a fictional god, a being who descended from the void.</p><p>In order to make the impossible possible, the Demon God Pillar Raum \u2013 who escaped from the Final Singularity \u2013 searched for the starting point of the man\u2019s idea, followed the historical incident that became the origin of it, and arrived at the one inevitable girl.</p><p>That girl, Abigail, is a \u201Cpriestess\u201D who serves an Outer God, is a \u201Cvessel\u201D to allow the god to manifest, and is the \u201CKey\u201D that opens the Gate to fiction.</p><p>The Abigail of the FGO Story is a fictitious persona created by the Demon God Pillar Raum and modelled after the one in historical fact. Raum\u2019s objective was to make Abigail a doll that takes over the matter of gathering the deep-seated grudges of those who became victims of the witch hunts in history, all to have (a phenomenon called) an evil god from outer space descend and dwell within her body. In the village, the witch trials were re-enacted, and while victims were born one after another, Abigail was driven up against the wall and lost her sanity, before at last, she was able to house an evil god within her body.</p><p>As a believer of Puritanism, Abigail is a pure girl who reveres God and never misses doing her prayers of gratitude. Sensitive and not knowing the things to be suspicious of, she is no more than a girl of her age.</p><p>The Puritans \u2013 who view honourable poverty as their creed \u2013 migrated across the ocean to escape the oppression from the Church \u2013 whom catered to political authority \u2013 and arrived at the New World. However, they would be caught up to before long, having been completely cornered. The brunt of their objections (protests) would then turn towards their close neighbours.</p><p>Just like how a \u201CHero\u201D will surely rise up in a world of corruption and oppression\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014the Creed of Purity that should have been used by the Puritans to discipline themselves by became a tool to monitor others, and the turbulent colonial livelihood, in which wars and plundering happened over and over again, fostered feelings of suspicion and selfishness.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Before long, it reached the point that the Puritans began a search for insanity \u2013 for \u201CWitches\u201D \u2013 from the bottom of their hearts. \u201CWhat this misfortune and suffering of ours is must be the deeds of the Devil.\u201D</p><p>Sure enough, a Witch materialized in Salem, and the door to the ghastly witch trials was opened. The raging state of affairs that became the \u201CKeyhole\u201D. The girl who projected the people\u2019s desires and became the \u201CKey\u201D.
