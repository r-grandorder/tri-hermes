Be it Sir Agravain, who is strict and severe towards everyone, or Sir Tristan, who always speak one word too many, or even that Sir Kay.<br> An appropriate, considerate man who is capable of gaining deep trusts from the remarkable and known members of the Round Table.</p><p>During victory celebration parties, he would calmly stand still in the corner and express a composed smile as he watches over everyone. Before such a calm and adult-like appearance, no small amount of ladies secretly have their heart swooned.</p><p>During normal times, he is that kind of knight, calm and tender. But in the battlefield, his whole temperament changes. While the bearing of his speech and conduct is as silent as before, he is brimmed with valor and empty of timidity. And yet he is constantly filled with calmness and composure that grasps and understands the battlefield condition.</p><p>There was only one such time when Bedivere lost himself; during the last battle that apprached him and his king...</p><p>Super serious. Ruggedly honest.<br> He follows Merlin&#39;s order of &quot;must not let the the true nature of your silver arm be found&quot;, and even after he is summoned and switched over to Chaldea he still says it is the &quot;arm of Nuadha&quot;. Um, everybody knows it already. Like, just remember.... if the Master says that, he&#39;d go red in the face, tearchoked, and go completely still. Really can&#39;t recommend saying that ever. THe man himself knows already. But even if it is a shadow, an imitation, he must let the secret of the holy sword of the planet stays a secret.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>&quot;Saber, Bedivere.

I was once evaluated as such. No, even now.&quot;</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>One of the member of Round Table&#39;s knight that served under King Arthur.<br> One of its first members, his role was the royal steward and the king&#39;s mediator.<br> He was also the one who was at the king&#39;s side during the king&#39;s last breath.<br> Within the aggregation of Round Table, whose members are heroes surpassing men, he was the &quot;only human&quot; who served under King Arthur.<br> While having only one arm, he is said to be a excelling general while also a knight with excellent swordsmanship.</p><p>He protected King Arthur who was wounded deeply at the Hill of Camlamn to the end, but he turned his back on the king&#39;s order to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake twice----and he finally accepted it the third time, returning the holy sword back to the spirit, the Lady of the Lake-----such is told in the legend of King Arthur.</p><p>One theory states that after that he spent his time in a monastery. Perhaps he prayed for peace to be granted to his king after death, or perhaps so that his king would surely reach Avalon.</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>Nay. &quot;He&quot; did not went to a monastery.<br> Nay. &quot;He&quot; did not pray for peace for his king after death.</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>He is no Heroic Spirit.<br> He is no more than a human from bygone days.</p><p>He, who appeared in the first part, chapter six of FateGO, is an &quot;if&quot;, living, Bedivere who &quot;did not return the holy sword to King Arthur&quot;, and King Arthur passed away without ascertaining the relinquishing of the holy sword. He keeps on living for months and years for the sake of atonement, and for the sake of returning the holy sword, for sure, this time. Eventually, he by sheer strength arrived to Avalon.</p><p>And then, he stood up once again in the face of the domination of holy city by the Lion King and the incineration of Human Order. Merlin grant unto him, a mere knight, the power capable of fighting the knights of the Round Table, but that power is something that shave away at his live. And yet, that power is something that can match even the strength of the knights of the Round Table.</p><p>Namely-----the unreturned holy sword.</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>Perhaps this was due to his achievement during the first part chapter six being recognized. Bedivere was registered to the Throne of Heroic Spirit as a special case of &quot;this time only&quot;. To the Master, who showed him the realization of his wish, he would lend his power without restraint.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Artoria Pendragon (Lancer)</strong></p><p>The &quot;Knight King&quot; alike with mine own king.<br> To say that the sight of her brings not disorder to my heart in the slightest would be a lie.
