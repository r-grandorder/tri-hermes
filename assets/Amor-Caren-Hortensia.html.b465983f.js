Though ever since I came here, I cannot recall many of the details.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Labor hours have started, Master. I expect my entire day&#39;s worth of sustenance taken care off.&quot;</p><h2 id="setting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Setting</h2><p>The God of Love from Roman mythology.</p><p>Psuedo-Servant that uses Caren Hortensia as its human vessel.</p><p>Due to Caren&#39;s innate personality being a perfect match with Amor&#39;s Authority, she was miraculously reborn as the &#39;Fully Merged Deity Caren&#39; (or so she says).</p><p>She was a sacrifice chosen as a Humanitas-aligned Servant when the Incineration of Humanitas took place.</p><p>Chronologically speaking, she is from after Hollow, but before the Aylesbury Geocentricism (Tsukihime). After ending her work as Fuyuki&#39;s overseer, she once again became active as an exorcist in Europe, and it&#39;s around this time that the Deity went into her.</p><p>Her spiritual core is constituted of Eros, the God of Love from Greek mythology, and Amor, the God of Love from Roman mythology.</p><p>When in her angelic guise, she goes by the name of Amor, but unlike what one would perhaps expect, she does not go by the name of Eros in her default, second ascension state.</p><p>Not only has she completely rejected (read: finds unacceptable) Eros, but she has even started disguising herself as Cupid, arguably the symbol for both of these gods.</p><p>As to why she rejected Eros; due to her strong faith, Caren defines &quot;love&quot; as that of &quot;unconditional love&quot;, so while Amor might be acceptable in that regard, she absolutely abhors Eros (sexual love).</p><p>(In Greek philosophy, there&#39;s said to be four kinds of love: sexual love, comradely love, familial love, and finally unconditional love toward strangers. The vulgarity of sexual love has no place in the way Caren thinks of the unconditional love held by God (that of Agape))</p><p>So even though Caren is a Psuedo-Servant of the Love God Amor, at her core, she has rejected both Amor and Eros and serves as the missionary of a much greater form of love.</p><p>Very much a strange quirk for a Servant to have, befitting of the walking contradiction that is Caren, someone who loves causing harm as much as she is susceptible to it herself.</p><p>\u25C7</p><p>Introduced with the 2021 Valentine Event.</p><p>Caren sees chocolate as a sort of &quot;love-indulgence&quot;, and as such, acceptable to sell at whatever steep price is possible.</p><p>She claims that &quot;you can&#39;t put a price on love, can you?&quot; and so only displays &quot;true love&quot; with her Noble Phantasm.</p><h2 id="abilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#abilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Abilities</h2><p>he is able to output Amor&#39;s powers in a variety of forms (arrow, bazooka, bomb, lightning, earthquakes).</p><p>Her appearance is much like an angel&#39;s.

Much like she&#39;s brainwashing or seducing them.</p><p>In her third ascension, she takes on an appearance that is similar to a devil&#39;s, but it&#39;s not like she really is one in her deep within or anything. It&#39;s just that if you change your viewing angle a little bit, she coincidentally happens to look like one. Also, all of her skills drain NP, but this is also just a coincidence.</p><p>Her weapons are the massive God-Bazooka and the heart-shaped familiars of Mister Amor and Little Eros. Eros is abused by her constantly, but seeing as they appears to like it, there shouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p><p>Additionally, in her third ascension she grows a pair of chocolate horns. Not devil ones.

Hortensia is like if the Gods of Love from each mythology assembled inside of one human vessel. By letting this very crazy lore come together with these gods&#39; crazy divinities, our rather quirky Missionary of Love was born. Separate from such mankind-scale love, she is actually a nun with who holds a different love deep within her heart. I have some memories of sending in a variety of design proposal, gradually refining each of the &quot;forms of love&quot; she represents. I had been instructed to make the first ascension easily identifiable as Cupid, so I added and removed a bunch of accessories, scarfs, and other things until eventually settling on the current outfit. I also had been ordered to make the paper bag, and baby stuff that had appeared in previous works, so I made sure that was reflected in her sprites. --Morii Shizuki</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes</h2><p>Item Crafting (\u9053\u5177\u4F5C\u6210), known otherwise as Item Construction or Item Creation.</p><p>Channeler of Harm (\u88AB\u8650\u970A\u5A92\u4F53\u8CEA), known otherwise as Masochistic Spiritualist Constitution or Masochistic Medium&#39;s Nature</p><p>Mana Discharge (\u9B54\u529B\u653E\u51FA), known otherwise as, well, there&#39;s a million variations.
