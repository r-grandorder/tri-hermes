The strength of its existence.&quot;[l]</p><p>Tohsaka puts up a finger as she drinks her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;Strength of its existence...? What? You mean its flimsiness in being unable to bear the existence of the illusion?&quot;</p><p>I sip the tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You seem like you don&#39;t know anything, but you know some interesting terms. ...Well, you&#39;re not right, but not wrong.</p><p>Projection uses your mental image to completely reproduce the genuine object. There is no exception to this.</p><p>You can&#39;t project it if it&#39;s not perfect inside of you. As it is a shadow of the true object, the projection magecraft requires that there be no mistake.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So\u2015\u2015\u2015basically, the projected object has the strength as you imagine it. An illusion is perfect in this regard.</p><p>The closer the knowledge and the image are to the true object, the more perfect the projected object is in real life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm? Wait, that&#39;s strange.</p><p>I projected Archer&#39;s swords. But Kuzuki destroyed them.</p><p>I know Caster strengthened Kuzuki&#39;s fists, but they aren&#39;t strong enough to destroy a Noble Phantasm.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t that mean the Kanshou and Bakuya I projected are inferior to the originals?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, you realized a very good point, Emiya-kun.</p><p>That&#39;s the limit of projection, the strength of the object&#39;s existence.</p><p>Projection is just a projection. It&#39;s not creation. What makes the projection is the image in the caster&#39;s mind. So when a flaw is created in the image, the projected object vanishes even if it has the same ability as the original.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? When a flaw is created in the image...? Isn&#39;t that also strange? You can&#39;t project it if the image is incorrect, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. So the flaw would be created after it is projected.</p><p>...Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s say you project a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Tohsaka nods in satisfaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;But a sword that will not break doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the sword is famed or called &#39;unbreakable&#39;, so it can break if it comes across an illusion greater than itself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Doesn&#39;t it mean my image was wrong once it breaks? I made a sword that won&#39;t break, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong.</p><p>It&#39;s perfect the moment you project it. First of all, a &#39;sword that will not break&#39; is just a name. There isn&#39;t an actual sword that won&#39;t break.</p><p>But what you imagined is a &#39;sword that won&#39;t break&#39;, right? If this sword breaks in real life, what is projected becomes a lie.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This isn&#39;t because the &#39;sword broke&#39;.</p><p>What you imagined is a &#39;sword that will not break&#39;.</p><p>So when it breaks, the &#39;sword that broke&#39; and the &#39;sword that will not break&#39; in your imagination become two separate things.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s because the scales between you and reality tip.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>So, if I sum it up...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015All right.</p><p>So, I imagined a sword that would not break and projected it. But the projected sword broke during battle.</p><p>When that happened, I denied the sword, saying &#39;Hey, this sword broke.&#39; As a result, the projected sword disappeared.</p><p>And that&#39;s because there was an inconsistency between reality and the image, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re pretty bright. Yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p>You projected Archer&#39;s swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how you ranked Archer&#39;s swords, but you did not imagine swords that would break from Kuzuki&#39;s attacks.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But the swords were destroyed.</p><p>At that time, you thought, &#39;these aren&#39;t Archer&#39;s swords&#39;.</p><p>The projected swords were denied by the maker, so they lost their strength of existence and became a fantasy once again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Even projected weapons can break.</p><p>But it&#39;s not the enemy, but you, who make them disappear from this world.</p><p>When the difference between the reality and the image becomes too large to be reconciled, the projected weapon disappears.</p><p>It is because the one who projected the weapon stops believing in the image.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you get it now? So projection starts from the blueprint. You should consider material, properties, and even its history. If you have those down, I don&#39;t think the projected object will disappear right away even if it&#39;s a bit different.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Wouldn&#39;t you start from how it was considered to be made?</p><p>Materials and techniques aren&#39;t enough.</p><p>Let&#39;s take today&#39;s dinner as example. It started when you said you wanted to eat Japanese food, right? So you have to start from the very beginning of the creation.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s stunned.</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka stares at me.</p><p>I drink tea and tilt my head in wonder.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, how did we start talking about this in the first place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...You&#39;re right. I thought we were talking about what our future course of action should be...&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>We were talking about what our course of action should be...</p><p>&quot;Shirou. Do you want to seriously practice projection magecraft?&quot;</p><p>...When Tohsaka derailed the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I remember now. We were so stumped that we started placing hope on uncertain factors.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah.</p><p>First of all, all I can manage to project are swords. That hasn&#39;t helped me too much, so it&#39;s probably not much use.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>Oh, she&#39;s looking at me with those eyes again.</p><p>...I wonder why. She always makes that face when we talk about projection magecraft.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well. Let&#39;s confirm our current situation.</p><p>For now, our enemy is Caster. She isn&#39;t too bad by herself, but we can&#39;t do anything as long as she&#39;s protected by Kuzuki and Archer.</p><p>Plus, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Saber is controlled. The situation is getting worse by the second\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. But Saber isn&#39;t under Caster&#39;s complete control.</p><p>That gives us a chance of victory.</p><p>There&#39;s no chance of victory once Saber gives in.&quot;</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t let that happen.</p><p>She told me to run.</p><p>She told me as she cried. So for Saber&#39;s sake, I can&#39;t let Caster do as she wishes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right.</p><p>So, raise your hand if you have an idea. Shirou, do you have any good ideas?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>An idea that will break the current deadlock.</p><p>If there is a way to oppose Caster, it is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015There aren&#39;t any more plans to consider.</p><p>We won&#39;t use any tricks and just fight them head on.&quot;</p><p>I stare at Tohsaka straight in the face.</p><hr><p>&quot;......So.</p><p>Let me ask you just in case. Are you serious?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Ugh.&quot;</p><p>...This is intense.</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t stunned, but really angry.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sorry, I just said it on a whim. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t thinking at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. For a second, I thought about breaking my alliance with you, you idiot.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know I&#39;m stupid.</p><p>...So what about you? Do you have a plan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? ...Well, I do have one, but can I say it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re timid for once. Just say it if you have a plan.</p><p>I&#39;ll listen to whatever you have to say. Well, I&#39;ll object if it sounds unrealistic.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious that we can&#39;t beat Caster by ourselves, right?</p><p>So we have to increase our force.</p><p>They have three Servants, so we should have at least one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Increase our force...? Then we&#39;re going to go ask other Masters for help?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more like cooperation. Caster is a powerful force now, so other Masters can&#39;t just keep watching, right?</p><p>If they want the Holy Grail, we have to collaborate to defeat the most powerful force. We can break the collaboration after that.</p><p>This is a basic tactic in battle royal, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>So we&#39;ll make an alliance of the remaining Masters since Caster is so strong now, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. We might be able to cooperate depending on how the negotiations turn out.[l]</p><p>Then...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, there are two remaining Masters now. Lancer&#39;s Master and Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>There&#39;s no way to negotiate with Lancer&#39;s Master because his identity is unknown. But we might have a chance with Berserker&#39;s Master, Illyasviel.&quot;</p><hr><p>Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p>The white girl and the statue-like giant I met on the night when it all began.</p><p>She sounded dangerous, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s cruel.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I think she would at least listen to us. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ask for much in return, either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015You idiot. She&#39;s the most dangerous for you.</p><p>She was only looking at you, Shirou. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What do you mean? I&#39;ve only met her once, so that can&#39;t be possible. Quit scaring me like that, Tohsaka.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. We&#39;ll stop the negotiation right then if that does happen.&quot;</p><p>Then...</p><p>Tohsaka averts her gaze and gulps down her tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But we can only bet on Illyasviel for now. If Archer is right about Caster&#39;s identity, Berserker would be her natural enemy.</p><p>They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster&#39;s tricks. Berserker can handle Caster and Archer by himself. We can take care of Kuzuki while he does so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s an optimistic thought. But does Berserker really know Caster?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Archer told me that Berserker&#39;s true identity is Hercules.</p><p>If Caster really is that witch, Berserker might know her through the Argo Expedition.</p><p>It&#39;s just like how I don&#39;t get along with Kirei. Everyone has a natural enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Okay.</p><p>But I&#39;m sure everyone would dislike that priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Then it&#39;s decided.</p><p>But how should we find her? She hasn&#39;t appeared since that night. We should be able to find her because of her large magical energy, right?</p><p>But we can&#39;t find her in spite of that, so doesn&#39;t that mean she&#39;s not in this town?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume not. Illyasviel must be having fun, watching the Holy Grail War from a faraway place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Faraway place? Is she keeping watch over the town like how Caster was doing at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I have an idea of where she might be.</p><p>...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town.&quot;</p><hr><p>She says so with a tense voice.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A villa inside the forest...</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s expression tells me how dangerous the place is.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02</h2><p>...It&#39;ll just end up like today if we fight them head on.</p><p>As we are inferior, we have to execute a surprise attack to catch them off guard.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. You&#39;re Kotomine&#39;s student, right? Then don&#39;t you know a lot about that church?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Well, I have stayed over at the church a couple of times... Oh, I see.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, but there aren&#39;t any secret passages in that church. That was the first time I&#39;ve seen the underground temple. Even if there is one, Kotomine would be the only one that knows about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I give up. ...Damn, I guess it won&#39;t be that convenient. I thought it would be possible, considering that priest.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But as long as we can&#39;t use it, we have to come up with something else. ...Um, this is a what-if, so can you hear me out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure... but do you have an idea?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not good enough to be called an idea.[vr]</p><p>Look, it&#39;s obvious that we can&#39;t beat Caster by ourselves, right?[vr]</p><p>So we have to increase our force.</p><p>They have three Servants, so we should have at least one.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s true... but increase our force...?</p><p>Then we&#39;re going to go ask other Masters for help?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more like cooperation.

All the Noble Phantasms he has are real. ...No, they are all originals of the real ones.</p><p>Gilgamesh is a hero in the oldest myth, and he was a king that indulged in every possible luxury. Then it shouldn&#39;t be strange for him to own all the originals of the legendary weapons.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015\u2015then what? The Noble Phantasms he used weren&#39;t Noble Phantasms, but just weapons...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d assume so. I bet his Noble Phantasm is his &#39;treasury&#39;.</p><p>I think his Noble Phantasm is the &#39;treasury&#39; where he kept all the weapons he collected during his life.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then it&#39;s natural that Berserker couldn&#39;t beat him. Every heroic spirit has a weak point. If he has the originals of every Noble Phantasm, he just needs to take out the one that is the most effective against his enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>If there is a chance of victory, it is that he is not a master of these weapons.</p><p>He is not a &quot;wielder&quot; that has mastered his weapon to the limit, so I think there is still a way to beat him.</p><p>But with all that aside...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. This has nothing to do with this, but why did you call him goldie?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...!? Um, I guess... um, he had golden hair.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you saying? You should have called Saber that if that&#39;s the case. It seemed like you said it with a lot of meaning behind it.

It&#39;s nothing serious like you&#39;re thinking, so don&#39;t worry too much about it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t lie. You wouldn&#39;t call him goldie for nothing. Come on, Tohsaka.

I&#39;m butting in so that I can help you guys a bit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015at?&quot;</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>What did he just say\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Did I mishear you? I think I heard that you&#39;re helping us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, is it hard to understand my point? I guess I&#39;ll rephrase it. You two are no match for Caster. So I will lend you guys a hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m stunned.</p><p>But Tohsaka quickly grasps the situation.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. You really are butting in. Is that really your idea?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s an order from my Master. He wants to cooperate against Caster since he&#39;s alone. Well, we&#39;re just making a quick alliance until we defeat Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s a sound reason. But I think there&#39;s a more reliable guy to go talk to.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is she talking about Shinji and Gilgamesh?</p><p>It seems Tohsaka is trying to figure out if Lancer knows about them\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;No, they won&#39;t do. I don&#39;t want to ally with them.</p><p>I have no complaints about his power, but it&#39;s too troublesome to worry about my back when I&#39;m fighting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh. That&#39;s the correct choice, Lancer. Is that an order from your Master as well?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s wrong as well. I chose you two out of personal interest. You guys are easier to talk to since we&#39;re acquaintances, right?&quot;</p><p>He speaks plainly.</p><p>It seems that fighting Archer and driving his lance through my heart are the same as becoming acquaintances in his mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on, Lancer. I was almost killed twice by you. And you think I&#39;m going to believe you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do believe so. Your commander-in-chief is a good frank woman. Such a good woman is helping you out, so you must be good-natured as well, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm</p><p>&quot;</p><p>I frown.</p><p>...I&#39;m troubled that Tohsaka is nodding at our enemy&#39;s words.</p><hr><p>&quot;So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s why I thought we might be able to cooperate.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh, but let me tell you. It&#39;s not &#39;you guys&#39;. &#39;I&#39;m&#39; the one who thought that you guys would make good allies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t understand the difference.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Aren&#39;t you the cocky one? You brought on the proposal, but you&#39;re the one that&#39;s going to choose?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve liked you since the first time I saw you.</p><p>You&#39;re beautiful, stubborn, and courageous. If I&#39;m to have a female Master, I want someone like you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer looks at Tohsaka with cool eyes.</p><p>&quot;...Humph.&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t like him for some reason.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Fine. I&#39;m up for it. But it&#39;s not decided yet.</p><p>If Emiya-kun can&#39;t trust you, we have to break off negotiations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying.

I thought I ordered you to keep watch outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but I didn&#39;t see any enemies around here. I got bored, so I came to check what was going on in here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, I would assume so. The only enemy we have is Berserker.

We have had nothing to fear since you joined us.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Isn&#39;t that why you came to my side?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows.

So you did not like looking after that little girl? Well, it is true that Servants are dissatisfied with their Masters. It is natural for you to run out of patience with yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, she was perfect as a summoner. But some miscalculations occurred.</p><p>And Caster, let me warn you. Do not consider all Servants to be like you.</p><p>At the very least, Saber and Berserker were satisfied with their Masters. A righteous hero can only be summoned by righteous people.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh, why tell me that now? A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits. You do not need to tell me that.&quot;</p><p>...That is right. Servants are determined by their summoners.</p><p>Summoners with dark shadows in their mind cannot summon heroic spirits who are on the light side.</p><hr><p>In that regard, she and Rider are not heroic spirits.</p><p>A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits.</p><p>As Rider was &quot;one that was beautiful&quot;, she was also &quot;one that was pure&quot;.</p><p>It is ironic how the Servant Caster summoned is a fictional hero.</p><hr><p>&quot;But it is indeed strange once I think about it. You and Rider are ones that oppose the heroic spirits. But you two are still summoned as Servants.</p><p>...Well, the Holy Grail does not differentiate between good and evil. So I guess it will summon anyone with powers, huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Originally, a mixed spirit that had a heroic side would not have been called upon.</p><p>Things went out of order starting with the third war.

You know you will not be able to kill me, so you went after the Master instead. You brought on the negotiation because you know I would not stop even if you killed my Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. You wouldn&#39;t stop even if I killed Shinji. But you can consider it in this situation, right?</p><p>You can save Shinji right now. If you&#39;re a Servant, it should be a hard blow for you to lose your Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah.

I&#39;m relieved as well. I&#39;ve known you for a long time even though you&#39;re like that.

With that aside, how about it, Tohsaka? Do you want to forget about Emiya and team up with us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015&#39;Us&#39;?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s right. You should know that Caster is stocking up power. The Ryuudou Temple is the altar this time. It&#39;s a bit unfavorable for us if she&#39;s taking position there and stocking up magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Shinji says this with both his hands raised.</p><p>That&#39;s an obvious fact.</p><p>If I have to add, it seems Shinji doesn&#39;t know Caster obtained Saber and Archer.</p><hr><p>&quot;You can tell, right? There&#39;s not much chance of victory by myself.</p><p>I beat Berserker&#39;s Master, but this isn&#39;t enough. We can make one that will even beat Caster if you join us.&quot;</p><p>Shinji invites her with confidence.</p><p>To that...</p><hr><p>&quot;I refuse, Shinji.

I&#39;m warning you since I&#39;ve known you for a long time.

I guess I&#39;ll do something about it.&quot;</p><p>She sighs as she says this.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>The sun sets and the hall is filled with darkness.</p><p>...We came here to look for an ally, but the only thing remaining here after turns of events is this empty castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what will we do? We can stay here if we want to go into defense.</p><p>There&#39;s food and beds here.

We&#39;ll get Saber back before Caster controls her. We have to defeat Caster, Archer, Assassin, and Kuzuki-Sensei by ourselves.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I silently nod.</p><p>Since we could not get Illya&#39;s help, that&#39;s all we can do.</p><p>...The sun will completely set soon.</p><p>We&#39;ll have to get out of this place before that and attack Caster before Saber is completely controlled\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015It&#39;s a simple plan.</p><p>The process will change depending on the situation.

I can&#39;t live up to your expectations.</p><p>We have nothing to start out with. We thought for a day, but we couldn&#39;t come up with anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You might not believe me, but we&#39;re here today to die honorably.</p><p>...But I guess we&#39;re still a bit lucky. If you&#39;re here, it means Saber is still opposing Caster.&quot;</p><hr><p>So there&#39;s four enemies now.</p><p>If we pass Archer, we can fight Caster and Assassin head on.</p><p>Our plan is that we would fight Archer together and confront Caster with the two of us.</p><p>...That&#39;s the lie Tohsaka made up.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Caster and Emiya Shirou. The scales tipped to Caster, huh?&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s question is a loaded one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I hate my own personality, but I guess I can&#39;t change it since I&#39;m born with it. I&#39;m inhuman at the very end.&quot;</p><p>Saying so with an emotionless voice, Tohsaka steps forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Shirou. Archer will only attack you. I won&#39;t back you up.

You have your own Master, right? Then you should stay quiet.</p><p>We&#39;re going to be enemies after we beat Caster, so it does no good to be talking. Anything other than planning is unnecessary.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What, we can&#39;t talk because we&#39;re going to be enemies? You have less composure than you look like you have, huh? It should be natural for you to drink until dawn with someone that gets along with you, even if he may be your enemy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;When are you from?</p><p>All that &#39;friends today, foes tomorrow&#39; business is out of style these days.

It sure became a boring world.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Lancer does not learn his lesson.</p><p>I think they&#39;ve been repeating the same kind of conversation for a while now.</p><hr><p>&quot;More importantly, Lancer. You know what your role is, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Yeah, leave it to me. You two are going to fight Caster and her Master, right?</p><p>My role is to fight Archer.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to fight Saber as well in the worst case, but it won&#39;t be a problem if all I have to do is keep them busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>He speaks objectively.</p><p>He isn&#39;t even scared of fighting Saber and Archer at the same time.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Oh yeah, Saber commented on him when we were training in the dojo.</p><p>She said Lancer is the best when it comes to &quot;surviving&quot;.</p><hr><p>She praised him, saying that with his excellent agility and great experience, Lancer would be an impregnable wall if he went into defense.</p><p>...He must have fought many battles from disadvantageous positions when he was alive.</p><p>This man ran through fatal battles like a panther and lived on.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s fine. But our enemy isn&#39;t just Archer and Saber. Caster also has Assassin. In the worst case, you&#39;d have to fight three.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s bad. I don&#39;t like that guy. I don&#39;t even want to fight him one-on-one if I can help it. It&#39;s best to kill such a guy from a distance\u2015\u2015\u2015but there&#39;s no point in worrying.</p><p>Assassin won&#39;t be at the church.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? How can you say so? If Caster won&#39;t go back to the Ryuudou Temple, wouldn&#39;t she call for her guard, Assassin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No. Assassin is a Servant that Caster summoned, but he has his limitations because of that. He is a heroic spirit summoned to that place. He can&#39;t leave the Ryuudou Temple, and in any case, Caster won&#39;t call for him.</p><p>He is a Servant that Caster summoned without letting her Master know.</p><p>She will try to hide Assassin as long as they&#39;re at the church, and I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple either.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She won&#39;t let go of the Ryuudou Temple...? Does that mean...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s because that mountain is the summoning place of the Holy Grail. Do you know? This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but there are only four possible places for the Holy Grail to be summoned into. Two of the places are the Ryuudou Temple and the church.</p><p>By the way, it was summoned at the church in the third war. The fourth one was summoned in a plain somewhere.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Oh. I thought you didn&#39;t think at all, but you&#39;re pretty well-informed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s just that my Master is fastidious. I&#39;m not interested in your doings.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. ...But, I see. So the summoning this time has returned to the same place as the first time, huh?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka starts to ponder.</p><p>Lancer watches her with delight and walks on in the dark forest.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The date has already changed.</p><p>The day should be dawning by the time we get out of this forest.</p><hr><p>...I mentally prepare myself as I walk.</p><p>We will fight Caster again in a few hours.</p><p>...I won&#39;t hesitate, even if that girl would have turned into our enemy by then.</p><p>We&#39;ll defeat Caster.</p><p>I have to tell myself that it is the most important thing right now.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015We head to the battlefield.</p><p>No matter what may be awaiting us at the church at daybreak, we cannot stop now.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-21" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 21</h2><p>...We walk in the forest.</p><p>We&#39;re the only people in this vast place.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t hear any beasts, and the grasses are dead like corpses.</p><p>The endless rows of trees makes me think this forest goes on forever.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s been three hours since we entered.</p><p>Just as our surroundings start to blur together...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Found it.</p><p>...Geez, I&#39;m still stunned even though I knew about it.

Is that a wall?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is a wall. Geez, what&#39;s up with them? They brought that whole thing from their country.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka complains and heads to the &quot;strange object&quot; we can see in the distance.</p><p>I still can&#39;t tell what it is, so I follow her.</p><hr><p>We get out of the forest.</p><p>The endless forest quickly ends.</p><p>No, it seems like the forest is scooped out here with a big spoon.</p><hr><p>The sky curving above us is gray.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015A giant dome.</p><p>It seems more like an underground kingdom than a clearing.</p><hr><p>This is Illyasviel&#39;s dwelling.</p><p>An old castle built within the forest.</p><p>A solitary castle without any visitors, too big for one girl, not to mention too desolate for anyone to live alone in.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Anyway, it does no good to be standing here.</p><p>According to Tohsaka, Illyasviel knows we&#39;re here.</p><p>Then we should go in from the front entrance as a sign that we&#39;re not here to fight.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go, Tohsaka... Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka is looking up at the castle with an alarmed expression.</p><p>Her face is tense as if she&#39;s confronting an enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Is there something wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. There&#39;s someone else besides us here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. This is where Illya and Berserker live.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean.
