Moreover, Holmes occasionally makes use of deduction methods as well. This Skill is no more than one of his reasoning methods.</p><p><strong>Baritsu: B++</strong></p><p>One has learned a martial art of the Orient that is extremely suitable for actual combat.</p><p>Besides making use of striking techniques that had this Skill and boxing combined and incorporated into them, Sherlock Holmes also uses counters and throwing techniques as his specialties too.

For instance, even if there was a treasure chest where its key was lost, said key will turn out to be \u201Cnot lost.\u201D It reaches the point that the key can certainly be discovered in someplace in the world. (But as one would expect, it will not do things such as making the key suddenly appear in the middle of his hand.

At the moment of its True Name Release, an unidentified \u201Csphere\u201D makes its appearance, releasing a dazzling light on the surrounding areas. It weakens the enemy camp and strengthens the allied camp. Even if the opponent is supposed to be unbeatable, Holmes will always discover a path to victory and the truth for the sake of defeating them.</p><p>Holmes does not speak of what this \u201Csphere\u201D is. Is it an object that concretely expresses his Origin, or is it an object solidified as the memory of his once close friend?

It is said that Doyle praised the Holmes played by Gillette with the statement \u201CHe is better than the one in my stories.\u201D Incidentally, Holmes has remarked the word \u201CElementary\u201D towards Watson in Doyle\u2019s short story \u201CThe Adventure of the Crooked Man\u201D, and Gillette got the idea of the phrase from that.</p><h1 id="empty-house-the-adventure-of-the-empty-house" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#empty-house-the-adventure-of-the-empty-house" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Empty House: The Adventure of the Empty House</h1><ul><li>Rank: B</li><li>Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</li><li>Ranges: 0 / \u2013</li><li>Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>A disguise Noble Phantasm.

After all, it is purely the King of the Cavern\u2019s outward appearance that was copied, and regarding his copied power and nature, they do not exceed the limits of the Magecraft Mystic Codes that were being distributed in Shinjuku and used by Holmes.

Watson as a biographical story of the Holmes that existed in real life, or is it perhaps a cross between the two? Holmes himself should at least have an understanding of the truth, but there is never a time where he speaks of it from his own mouth, and he easily dodges the topic whenever it does come up in a conversation.</p><p>\u25C6</p><p>According to the records of the Clock Tower, it is an incontestable fact that a Great Detective called Holmes has existed in the past in London. There are furthermore records where he used the pseudonym Sigerson and proceeded towards the Tibetan Back Regions. In an unexplored region where Mystery still remains, he was also with a certain occultist and attended to her last moments.</p><p>\u201CSupposing the case that he originated from the stories for argument\u2019s sake, there\u2019s a possibility that the stories comprise not only Doyle\u2019s stories but even pastiches too\u2026\u201D, or so it was told by a Chaldean personnel, but one can probably say that this hypothesis clashes with the recorded facts.</p><p>Or maybe it can be thought of in this way: \u2018Though is it also possible for a way of thinking where, as a result of receiving the influence of creative works, the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes became the perfected form of the \u201CGreat Detective\u201D that actually existed in the past\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014?\u2019</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Hand-to-hand combat attacks by means of baritsu.

The 6 lenses he is equipped with are similar to the bees that are associated with the episode where he did beekeeping after his retirement as a detective. The colour I put in for his image was blue, which is falsely yet mysteriously similar to the image colour of his destined rival, Professor M (who was illustrated by Mr. RAITA), and I recall that at the moment of the Professor\u2019s implementation, I was unable to stand up due to being struck with admiration the most out of anyone in the world.
