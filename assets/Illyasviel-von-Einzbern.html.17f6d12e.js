Even attempting to talk about it would be a painfully drawn-out conversation... And I don&#39;t want to talk about it, so let&#39;s forget it.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ... (Tremble, tremble)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?<br> Is something the matter, Illya?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...My...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> My entire body aches!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-are you okay!?<br> Did you injure yourself in the last battle!?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ah, no...do not fret. She did not commit a blunder like getting touched by a gentleman.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> This is something like recoil from her grand attack...or rather a price she has to pay.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> This happens whenever I use Quintett Feuer... Ruby, is there anything I can do so I don&#39;t feel so much pain?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> That&#39;s a tough one... The attack itself is a bit of a cheat, really, forcing magical energy through bodily systems it&#39;s not really meant to be routed through in order to gain an instantaneous firepower boost.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Normally, the blowback you&#39;d feel from something like that would be even more severe, as you well know.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Your body possesses a Spirit Origin stronger than a physical body. That&#39;s why you get off with just a hearty round of griping like an old lady!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Old lady...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I never knew it was such a magnificent attack.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Hmmm, but I feel like its gotten weaker compared to when I shot it THAT time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u201CThat time\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Which time?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Uh...um...well, it&#39;s a long story...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> It was the time when she went up against little big Gilgamesh&#39;s Enuma Elish head-on and won.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ehhhhhh!? Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I swear upon this Ruby&#39;s bewitching form that story is one hundred percent true!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s from volume five of Prisma\u2606Illya 2wei!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Exactly! This blatant advertisement is so bold,<br> even Ruby wants to tip her hat to it!</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> But you know...that was only possible because the other party wasn&#39;t going all-out...or rather, he was just toying with us, which was our saving grace.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-well...even so, that is truly incredible!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I was just so...engrossed in the moment...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> A-anyway!<br> I want to get stronger!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ruby. If I&#39;m stronger than my physical body, don&#39;t you think I can increase my magical energy output?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ah, a girl who pursues pure firepower! Yes!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> HOOOWEEEVERRR...to cut to the chase,<br> the problem is actually on your end.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Eh? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> My only job is to maintain the four systems as pseudo-magical circuits.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The amount of magical energy that goes through them is actually dependent on Illya&#39;s willpower.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Willpower...?<br> I think I&#39;m trying my best...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Perhaps...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re holding yourself back psychologically.</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ah! Way to go! Great, Master!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> You catch on fast, like you&#39;re a seasoned vet of school girls who are innocent and pure of heart!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Putting it that way makes it sound kind of weird...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Now that Miss Illya is just starting to understand euphemisms, teasing her is really fun! Anyway...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The physical repercussions she suffers are serious, and I can only imagine how SERIOUSLY painful they are.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Perhaps she has unconsciously held back her output out of fear of the pain she remembers from the past.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Totally understandable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t push yourself too hard...</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;re worried about me.<br> Thanks, [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But even so...I want to get stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I completely understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But you&#39;re still in elementary school.<br> Why are you so eager to get stronger?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Because...because...if I don&#39;t get stronger...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t...?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> People will say I&#39;m weaker than Chloe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> People will say \u201CChloe&#39;s a much easier character to use,\u201D or \u201CChloe&#39;s NP is stronger\u201D!!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I know...I know I&#39;m weak. I don&#39;t have that much magical energy, and I&#39;m bad at making snap decisions in battle...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But you know what? No matter how underdeveloped I may be, there&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t let slide.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if other people best me...<br> But as the older sister...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let Chloe best me!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um...it&#39;s been a while since I heard such a...um, intense pledge like that. It was almost moving...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t think you are weaker than Chloe, Illya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So please calm down...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s true!<br> Ruby told me everyone is saying that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ruby!?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ahahahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We want to help you, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ummmmm...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heh heh heh...I see you are in a bind.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Eh? Wh-who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hah!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I heard it all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, that dark silhouette...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who exactly are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Oh. Um... Y&#39;know...<br> To be continued and all that...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to say it again: I heard it all!!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;re repeating yourself!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That succubus-like aura...!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Bingo! I&#39;m the big sister who&#39;s better than Illya in every way! The one and only Chloe von Einzbern!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> H-how long have you been listening!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hmm...since someone said,<br> \u201CCongratulations. She&#39;s a healthy baby girl.\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> S-since the moment I was born!?<br> That&#39;s such a big sister thing to say... Wh-why, you!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The \u201Cwho&#39;s the older sister\u201D battle...I still don&#39;t understand the rules.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...sorry to interrupt your sisterly banter, but...didn&#39;t you show up because you had business with us, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh right, right.<br> It&#39;s about Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> She&#39;s been mumbling \u201Cmore firepower, more firepower\u201D to herself every day, so I was worried about her.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> W-was I muttering borderline scary stuff to myself?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Yeah, I seriously considered calling the cops.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ah well, can&#39;t be helped. No matter the era,<br> the weak always struggle to gain more power.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> To support her fervent but futile efforts,<br> we&#39;ve all showed up. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh that&#39;s just infuriating!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Hm?<br> \u201CWe\u201D?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Heh heh heh! Indeed!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Be grateful, Illya. I went ALL over to gather everyone here together, in one place!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Now come on out!<br> \u201CIllya&#39;s Magnificent Strengtheners!\u201D</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> You talk too much, Chloe. Just how long were you going to keep us in the green room?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Well, the only thing to do about this is to slap my dummy younger sister Medusa&#39;s butt once for every second you kept us waiting! (Slap)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Ow! I-I&#39;m sorry...! Sorry to trouble you,<br> but please speed things up...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The three Gorgon sisters are here...!?<br> What is going on...?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Eh? Wh-what!? What&#39;s this<br> \u201CIllya&#39;s Magnificent Strengtheners\u201D about!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I usually don&#39;t work for free. If you can&#39;t pay my price, I&#39;ll have to seize some of Chaldea&#39;s assets.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Nonsense! A lucha match is its own reward, more valuable than jewelry! I will jump even higher than usual, yes!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Yoo-hoo\u2606 I&#39;m here to beat the pulp out of someone!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Again... What the heck!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Look at all these goddesses...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a sight.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> These are the seven great goddesses who have answered my call! Together they&#39;re called the<br> \u201CBully Illya Seven!\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a different name now!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wait, wait. You can&#39;t just collect so many of these UNIQUE people all of a sudden... I don&#39;t have any idea how to react to all of this...!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Illya&#39;s really not much for processing complicated things.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You want to get stronger, right?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Gasp)</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> As the big sister, I knew. I knew that my younger sister Illya was agonizing over her ho-hum firepower.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> A younger sister can&#39;t be mulling over things like that alone. You gotta take action, however impossible.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illya may always get swept away by those around her, but being the big sister that I am, I believe in her. I know my younger sister has a strong will, however undeveloped she may be.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> What you&#39;re saying sounds kind of good, but I&#39;m also sensing a mocking undertone, and I can&#39;t concentrate!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Ah, it&#39;s so lovely seeing siblings getting along like this. In consideration of your sisterly love, we shall play along just this once. (Slap, slap)</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> So you want us to show that younger sister who&#39;s boss with a few love taps, right? I&#39;m a little worried. Do you think I am fit to play such a role? (Slap, slap)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Ow! Um...my dear older sisters...!<br> Please refrain from talking while slapping my butt...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh? Um, I sense an imminent battle...but I haven&#39;t agreed to anything yet...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure why, but when I look at her, I feel both affection and a certain sense of caution...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Perhaps this vessel of mine has some sort of connection to her. Do you think beating her up will help me figure it out?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course you will, yes! The clash of bodies is a kind of communication that transcends language barriers!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, a future cutie has asked us to do this.<br> As a grown-bear, we should fulfill our duties.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> After we beat that girl up, I&#39;ll be sure to beat you three times harder, my darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> What&#39;d I say!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Behold. See how these goddesses all talk and act with such...um, individuality! See how they lack anything resembling solidarity!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Y&#39;know, if I&#39;m honest, I don&#39;t really know how I got them all here together...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Anyway! This is what Illya needs!<br> You need to free your heart! Be more open! Buck naked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Perhaps she&#39;s saying Illya needs to follow the mentality of these goddesses as examples...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s asking a lot.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Ruby does not approve of Illya acting like this lot...but will wholeheartedly approve of her being buck naked!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Um, even so, there&#39;s no need to fight, right!?<br> That doesn&#39;t make much sense, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Oh! [\u2642 Big brother /\u2640\uFE0F Big sister} Fujimaru, help! If you don&#39;t do something, they&#39;ll all beat me up in the name of some weird version of sisterly love!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Good luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> [\u2642 Big brother /\u2640\uFE0F Big sister} Fujimaru, you traitor!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Brace yourself, Illya! Be grateful that I&#39;ve arranged for you to receive the \u201Clove\u201D of the goddesses!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Phew...I suppose that&#39;s it.<br> That was a nice way to kill some time.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong><br> Oh come on! Our dummy of a sister Medusa can&#39;t even be a proper meat shield! What is even the point of you being so gigantic, then!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry!<br> I&#39;m sorry...!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...Um. Good luck, Illyasviel.<br> As a younger sister myself, I&#39;ll be rooting for you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What the heck! She&#39;s already strong! But I have to admit, your Noble Phantasm shined brilliantly. It was like a jewel in the Milky Way!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Mmmm... \xA1Adi\xF3s, hermanita! That was a lovely fight!<br> Let&#39;s meet in the ring next time!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong><br> Awwww, she beat me up!<br> Console me fervently and lovingly, Darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Later.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> ...Sorry about that, missy. Bothering people is practically an occupation for these goddesses. Forgive them, will ya?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> Well, let me just warn you that you shouldn&#39;t get too worked up.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong><br> There&#39;s only so much a single person can bear or do.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> W-we won!?<br> I&#39;m beat...both physically and mentally.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> The only sane advice we got was from that Orion bear, which makes it even sadder.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-anyway, I have confirmed that the seven goddesses have retreated. Good work, Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ugh...my entire body still hurts...<br> I want to go home and take a nice bath...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Illya is not one to skimp on self care!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m impressed, Illya.<br> I didn&#39;t think you would really beat all seven goddesses.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You beat the seven...<br> Hm? Seven?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> One, two, three, four, five, six...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There were only six of them.</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahaha!<br> Fumeow hahahahahahaha!!!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> At the behest of a girl who cares for her younger sister...this feral heart roars with maternal love! If you ask for the aid of a jaguar, then I shall be happy to lend my paw!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The beautiful goddess of love and the rainy season...the time is meow...for Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh... (I forgot I asked this one, too.)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I heard there was gonna be a fight, and I couldn&#39;t resist! Meowhahahahaha! Know that the Seven Goddess Alliance is no cat...I mean, cakewalk!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Jaguar Warrior...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meowhahaha. Good things never wait for you! If there&#39;s a deal, pounce on it! Once it&#39;s weakened, kill it! That&#39;s the law of the jungle!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now come at me! I&#39;m pawsitively pumped!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Come on, Ishtarin! Kuku! Let&#39;s go in with our \u26055-eliminating Delta-Nabla Attack!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry. That just ended.</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...Huh? Where&#39;s Ishtarin and Kuku?<br> And where&#39;s the rest of the goddesses?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> We beat &#39;em all.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Seriously?<br> Little girl&#39;s too strong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Time to beat the leftovers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And now it&#39;s tiger season.</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wait, what was the point of that battle?<br> I&#39;m really confused now...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Tsk. I thought I was getting into a seven-on-one battle, but now it&#39;s a one-on-five deathmatch...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What&#39;s up with me being the lone wolf?<br> ...I&#39;m a feline!!!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But this jaguar will not lose! Just you watch! I&#39;ll show you that the jaguar&#39;s wild nature is going to save human history!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Are...you...kitten...me!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe I lost to someone who&#39;s not even wearing short-shorts! What humiliation!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Why you... Perish, magical girls! One day I&#39;ll be lurking in the darkness and pounce on you to claim my revenge! Brace yourself for cat-astrophe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All seven goddesses have been defeated...<br> This time for real.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When she fled into the jungle I thought she was planning to use guerilla tactics, but instead she just started shouting for us to come at her one by one... Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for the clear-cut explanation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was a grrreat and fierce battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hmmm. Even I don&#39;t want to comment on that goddess.<br> Besides, that tiger wasn&#39;t even a goddess.</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> I feel like whoever tries to give it to her straight is in for a losing battle. Before she saves mankind, she needs to match the setting a little more.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Look who&#39;s talking!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> So...Illya. What do you think?<br> Did you get stronger?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Of course not!<br> I just got really, really, really tired!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird... Knowing you, I thought for sure that getting cornered would give you a powerup!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Quit playing games with my heart!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough.<br> Illya, you&#39;ve fought so hard, and you&#39;re already strong.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash.<br> Ummmm...but, but...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> See? Look how doubtful you are...<br> It&#39;s no wonder you can&#39;t get strong.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Come on, stand up straight! If you put your mind to it, you&#39;re the type who can win against THAT Enuma Elish!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> That&#39;s right!<br> Beat the crap out of that Enuma Elish!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um...perhaps you should tone it down...<br> If HE ends up hearing you...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> You mean that shiny gold guy?<br> What are you afraid of? We&#39;re fine, we&#39;re fine.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> After all, Illya beat him once!<br> To hell with that King of Heroes! Come at us!!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> S-stop...you&#39;re going overboard...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> What about Enuma Elish!?<br> Our Illya would totally kick its butt!!!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh? Well, this sure is interesting.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Chloe:</strong><br> He, he&#39;s here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Chloe, you&#39;ve done it now!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t think he would actually show up!<br> B-besides, Ruby was egging me on!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> System. Error.<br> Language functions...shutting down...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you dare act like a machine to get out of this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hurry and think of an excuse, Illya!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> U-um...you see, Mister Kid Gil... The term kicking one&#39;s butt is just an expression...a turn of phrase...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...Why am I making all the excuses!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Ahaha! Oh please.<br> I don&#39;t understand why everyone is so scared.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t get mad over a little joke like that.<br> I&#39;m not the big me, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Everyone&#39;s being rude.<br> Kid Gil is rational, and he listens.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, um! I-I-I&#39;m not saying that the big shiny gold you is an irrational tyrant, you see...!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Aha! Listen to you, big sister Mash! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m praising you! For both statements!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hmmm? Something&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> There&#39;s something different about him.<br> Different than the usual Kid Gil we know...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hello, mirrored big sisters. This is the first time we&#39;ve actually spoken to each other.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> ...Yep. It appears we are connected in quite the strange twist of fate.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You are...<br> Are you THE Kid Gil we know...?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Nope. And I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...???</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> The way he gets all profound kind of reminds me of him...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> There&#39;s no hidden meaning behind my words.<br> And a bit of small talk is nice. It&#39;s fun.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh, but dear me. Big sisters, you&#39;re not my type, so this is no fun. Not one bit.</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Chloe:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Yep. Let&#39;s just go ahead and battle.</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Chloe:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean, Kid Gil?<br> Why do we need to fight...?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hm? Isn&#39;t this pretty much where a story about Illya wanting to get stronger leads?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> You said if she gave it her all, she could overwhelm even my Ea. I sure would like to see that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Now, please.<br> Try to \u201Cblow me away.\u201D</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> U-um...if I dare ask...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Are you mad?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I am not mad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s definitely mad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone, RUN!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Oh, please don&#39;t flee.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Oh crap...chains!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hey...! Lemme go!<br> Bound in chains is NOT a good look for a kid!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> That sorta thing really isn&#39;t in my\u2013never mind.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Illya, battle me.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> If you flee, I will kill Chloe.<br> Oh, and if I win, I will kill Chloe.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wha...!?<br> That&#39;s nonsense, Kid Gil!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Hmmm. You&#39;re really slow to make a decision, even when you&#39;ve only got one choice.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illy... Ungh!<br> The chains are tightening...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Chloe!<br> Are you serious, Kid Gil!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I&#39;ve taken a slight interest in that heart of hers.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re a Servant, please hang on and survive even if your ribcage gets caved in, Miss Chloe.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hey...you...!<br> Quit joking around...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> No more! Stop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You really are a different person.<br> Different than the Kid Gil that we know...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You may mince your words a lot, and we still don&#39;t know what you&#39;re really thinking...but...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> The Kid Gil we know never did anything cruel!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I...will never lose to somebody like that!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Finally. Sheesh.<br> The lady took her sweet time with her costume change.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t want to do this, but I guess I can make a bit of a costume change myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh...?<br> Th-that can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Honestly...I reeeally hate to do this.<br> But for a few minutes, I&#39;ll act immature...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...and get serious about playing. I&#39;m going to school you on how to properly use your energy and your life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He...uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> H-h-he...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He grew up!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ungh... Ack...!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Quintett Feuer!!!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ohhhhhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-amazing!<br> What a massive magical energy discharge!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-huh!?<br> Her output&#39;s still increasing!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Haha... I see... I see!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So this is the purpose for which you use your energy and your life!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> (Pant, pant)<br> ...Hah...hah...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I-I won!?<br> Ooohhh...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Illya!?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m fine.<br> I&#39;m just out of energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think we would really beat Gilgamesh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I believed in you, Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Heh...hehe...<br> Thank you, [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister} Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I believed in you, Chloe.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> See? I told you so.<br> Illya&#39;s amazing when she gives her all.</p><hr><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> That was an amazing shot, Illya! It was every bit as powerful as you could be in your heyday!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> It surpassed my expectations.<br> Even I was a bit surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...indeed...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I suppose a girl&#39;s dream can truly take her to the stars. Ah, my apologies. That may have sounded a bit pretentious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Kid Gil?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m Kid Gil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s alive!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He shrunk!</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Huh!? What happened to that shiny gold guy!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;m beat. I shouldn&#39;t be tampering with my own Spirit Origin when I&#39;m not used to it.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I will not pretend to be an adult anymore. I was given the opportunity to manifest in this form, after all.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You pretended!?</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> He totally played us. That kind of intensity can&#39;t possibly be argued away as just a session of pretend.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> And he&#39;s unscathed! I gave it my all,<br> but it didn&#39;t even scratch him?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, the chains binding me disappeared without me noticing.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Ugh! I don&#39;t believe it!<br> I was played for a fool!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Now, now. Please give me some credit.<br> See? Illya got stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That... You&#39;re right. Her output was definitely exponentially higher for her final shot.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> But...why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She did it for Chloe.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Eh?<br> For me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Her mind was made up.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Um...what do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Master seems to understand.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> The reason Illya&#39;s output was so-so was because she never had a real reason to unleash her power.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> She&#39;s not a hero, so she doesn&#39;t have a mission, honor, or pride... Without a defined cause, nobody can get stronger.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Why does she want to have power?<br> For what purpose does she wield her power?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> I just pushed her so she could remember, with that awful bit of theater.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Illya wielded her power just now...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> To...save Chloe...</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, she was strong that one time because she wanted to save the person most dear to her, Miyu. (Touched)</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I get it...<br> I didn&#39;t want to get stronger...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I wanted to be able to protect the people I care about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If protecting someone special is what gives Illya strength...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That is a wonderful power.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Simply measuring your power against Chloe&#39;s doesn&#39;t suit you.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Your conviction and your heart must be pure and sincere... They must be beautiful, like a single flower blooming in an empty field.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> Please never forget that.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Yep...<br> Thank you, Kid Gil!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> You&#39;re a different Kid Gil than the one I know...but you are still you!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> (Sigh) Kid Gil ended up stealing the show.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> But I did a lot for Illya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though I did question whether the Magnificent Strengtheners were really necessary...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though in the end, Illya&#39;s Noble Phantasm was strengthened, so all&#39;s well that ends well.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> But it still isn&#39;t strong enough to beat Ea!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Is that really what&#39;s important right now!?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong><br> If this was your true power, then way back, when I lost to you, I must have really been playing around!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Wow, he complimented AND dissed me in the same breath!</p><p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br> He may be small, but he&#39;s still the King of Heroes! I guess that difficult personality of his sticks around even after he grows up.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Argh. Honestly...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Say...what...you want...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Illya!?<br> Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Every...single...limb hurts like it&#39;s about to fall off...and I&#39;m sooooooooo tiiiiiired...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> I guess that doesn&#39;t change, does it.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Ungh... Chloe...take me to my room...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Zzzzzz...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> And she fell asleep!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Honestly.<br> My little sister&#39;s such a handful.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Heave-ho.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> Chloe...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll protect you...always...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong><br> ...Yeah, yeah...big sister...</p>', 428);
