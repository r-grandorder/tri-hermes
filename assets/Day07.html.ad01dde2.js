I wonder if Sakura&#39;s awake?&quot;</p><p>If she is, she&#39;ll probably be preparing breakfast.</p><p>I&#39;d better get ready quickly and head to the kitchen, or Sakura will finish it herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m going ahead, Saber. Come to the living room in a bit.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t have the guts to look inside her room, so I retreat after calling out to her.</p><p>It&#39;ll be troublesome if I see Saber sleeping.</p><hr><p>&quot;And my dad collapsed.</p><p>He was like, &#39;your father is sick in bed, so don&#39;t you think you should settle down?&#39;</p><p>Isn&#39;t that rude? He makes it sound like I&#39;m a wandering cloud.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee complains while eating.</p><p>It seems Fuji-Nee didn&#39;t come over last night because her father collapsed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Senpai, what is this wandering cloud?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s describing Fuji-Nee. It&#39;s an airy person without a definite character.&quot;</p><p>I answer without hesitation.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re wrong! A wandering cloud is an idler!</p><p>It&#39;s what you call a person who does nothing but go around town to mock people.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura and Saber nod in comprehension.</p><p>I do not even need to mention which part they agree on.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, Sensei. Is your father sick?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. My family is famous for not getting sick. My dad sumo wrestled with one of the younger guys and hurt his hips.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sumo...? What is this &#39;sumo&#39;, Taiga?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? It&#39;s kinda hard to explain in words. It&#39;s a type of martial art where you push, push instead of pull, push and push. You can&#39;t use weapons, and you can&#39;t use a fist. You also can&#39;t kick.</p><p>You basically grapple with your opponent and win by knocking your opponent down to the ground.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. So is it a pure contest of power?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. And you don&#39;t wear any clothes. You and your opponent grapple pretty much naked.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-Naked...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. Well, your weak point is covered by a mawashi. Oh, that&#39;s a sumo wrestler&#39;s loincloth, by the way. If you don&#39;t understand, ask Shirou about it. He knows more than I do.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee says something absurd as she sips on her miso soup.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So, Shirou. What is this loincloth?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s easy to explain, but I&#39;m a bit hesitant to talk about it.</p><p>I&#39;m talking to Saber, and we&#39;re eating right now.</p><p>Why do I have to talk about loincloths during a meal?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t know. Sumo is out of my area of expertise, so ask someone else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re lying! You have a loincloth too!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I don&#39;t! I had to do sumo because your grandfather made me, and I only borrowed one then!</p><p>First of all, that happened years ago!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahahaha, you&#39;re right. You kept losing because you were small back then. My gramps told you to do a different sport because you wouldn&#39;t give up until you won, so he made you start archery.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee is laughing cheerfully.</p><p>...Man.</p><p>Fuji-Nee is in high spirits this morning, so she&#39;s louder than usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Fuji-Nee. It&#39;s almost time. You&#39;ll be late unless you leave here before seven o&#39;clock.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, it&#39;s fine today. Morning club activities are cancelled starting today. ...Well, I still have to leave early because there&#39;s a teachers&#39; meeting.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? The morning practice for the archery club is cancelled as well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. Oh, I see. You didn&#39;t hear about it, huh? There was an incident yesterday, and some people in the track team got injured during practice. but they got injured during practice. I guess it&#39;s because of lack of sleep, so morning practices will be cancelled for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. But they cancelled all the practices because of one injured person?</p><p>Lack of sleep is that person&#39;s\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s their own fault, unless...</p><hr><p>&quot;Fuji-Nee. How many people were injured?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hmm. It&#39;s between ten and twenty students.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That many?</p><p>What about the people in the archery club?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, nobody in our club got hurt, but a few people looked tired yesterday.</p><p>...And it&#39;s been dangerous recently, right? We can&#39;t just ignore the mental strain it might be causing, so I guess the school&#39;s trying to decrease the burden. I don&#39;t know about the clubs being a mental burden, but it&#39;s true that they physically tire you.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee shrugs and holds out her bowl.</p><hr><p>&quot;Can I have another bowl, Sakura-chan? I just want it half-full.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. You&#39;re not eating a lot this morning, Sensei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. My stomach is hurting because I know there&#39;s a lot of work waiting for me at school, so I don&#39;t have any appetite.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee pretends to cry.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>It seems the tiger at my house wants us to believe that two and a half bowls of rice isn&#39;t her normal serving.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re full of energy in contrast, Sakura-chan. You&#39;re on your second full bowl.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m still growing. I get hungry quickly, so I have to push myself and eat extra.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura puffs up with pride.</p><p>...Well.</p><p>I don&#39;t know about that being part of the growing thing... But maybe all the gluttons around her are influencing her.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Sakura does not have sufficient strength as an archer. It is good to take in extra energy.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods as she keeps eating.</p><p>...Is it just me, or is she missing the original topic?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-sakura-and-lunch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-sakura-and-lunch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 Sakura and lunch</h2><p>It&#39;s past seven o&#39;clock.</p><p>Fuji-Nee left for school, and we&#39;re cleaning now.</p><p>Sakura has time as well, so we relax and do the dishes.</p><hr><p>With the two of us, it doesn&#39;t take long.</p><p>...I was keeping an eye on Sakura because of her health, but she really seems okay now.</p><p>It looks like her fever&#39;s gone, and she&#39;s full of energy.</p><hr><p>&quot;U-Um, Senpai...!</p><p>I-I have something to tell you, so could you spare me some time!?&quot;</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>Sakura stammers a question, looking as nervous as if she were breaking into somebody&#39;s house.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sure. We still have time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-Okay. ...U-Um, well. I made, um, some lunch for you...&quot;</p><p>She looks down as she hands me a lunchbox.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not my usual lunchbox, and it seems Sakura prepared it for me.</p><p>It has a cute shape, and it&#39;s wrapped in vivid colors.</p><p>The taste is guaranteed if Sakura made it, and I appreciate the fact that someone made lunch for me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh, thanks. ...Wait, did you wake up early to make me lunch?&quot;</p><p>Sakura was done with cooking breakfast when I came to the living room this morning.</p><p>I admired how early she got up, but it seems she actually woke up earlier than I thought.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, yes. Um, I woke up early, and I didn&#39;t have anything to do, so I thought I&#39;d make lunch. ...Um, and I want to ask you about something\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? Why are you all formal? Do you need to consult me about something important?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, it&#39;s nothing big...!</p><p>It&#39;s not, but...... umm... oh, yes! S-Senpai, you don&#39;t make lunch that often. You like cooking, so I&#39;m wondering why!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Sakura. It&#39;s not like I like to cook.&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know about a guy&#39;s hobby being cooking, so I wish she&#39;d keep it as something I can do.</p><p>Oh, wait. We&#39;re talking about why I don&#39;t make my own lunch.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I know it&#39;s cheaper to make my own lunch. But the guys in my class crowd around it if I do make it. Half my lunch is taken away before I know it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura nods in satisfaction.</p><p>...To be accurate, it&#39;s the girls that take most of my lunch, but I don&#39;t say it because it&#39;s too pathetic.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, so I only make lunch when I can use the student council room. Then, I can eat alone with Issei.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?</p><p>It&#39;s open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it&#39;s quiet there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s a good idea.</p><p>The archery range isn&#39;t locked, and the club members rarely go there during lunchtime.</p><p>Mitsuzuri might be there, but she&#39;s not so cruel as to eat someone else&#39;s lunch.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s a good idea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes!</p><p>It is a good idea! Then, um\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t know about an outsider going in there. I guess we have to ask Mitsuzuri for permission.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-It&#39;s all right! The archery range is part of the school, so any student should be able to use it when the archery club isn&#39;t using it!&quot;</p><p>Sakura presses her point.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmm, you&#39;re right. I guess it&#39;s fine if I&#39;m not causing anyone trouble.&quot;</p><p>I nod to myself.</p><p>Then.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but Sakura is making a victory pose with a big smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...Hmm. Maybe some of Fuji-Nee&#39;s energy transferred to Sakura.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-02-lunchtime-interval" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-02-lunchtime-interval" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 02 Lunchtime Interval</h2><p>We walk up the hill.</p><p>There are more students around us than usual. It must be because there&#39;s no morning practice today.</p><hr><p>&quot;We still have time. It&#39;s been a while since we had a morning where we could take it easy.&quot;</p><p>Sakura is walking happily besides me.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but she&#39;s in a good mood.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is normal for me, but... I guess it has been a while since I went to school with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The archery club practices every morning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But participation isn&#39;t required, right? Most people only go once every two days, so you should skip once in a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? U-Um, would you walk to school with me if I skipped practice?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Of course. We&#39;re going to the same place, so we&#39;ll be walking together either way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, then\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><p>No, I can&#39;t do that. I&#39;m not that good, so I can&#39;t afford to skip a day of practice.&quot;</p><p>Sakura sticks her tongue out at herself.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Are you sure about that? Not to speak ill of anyone, but you&#39;re the best in your grade. You have great form, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any trouble, even if you skip a day or two.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m still inexperienced. My thoughts trail off if I let my guard down, and I often don&#39;t see the target.</p><p>I&#39;m lazy at heart, so I tend to slack off unless I push myself to train a little every day.&quot;</p><p>...Hm.</p><p>If that&#39;s how she feels, who am I to disagree?</p><hr><p>I part with Sakura.</p><p>My class is on the third floor, and hers is on the fourth.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t fall asleep during class. People tend to get sleepy when they&#39;re full.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahaha, you don&#39;t need to worry. I&#39;m not full anymore.&quot;</p><p>Sakura goes up the stairs.</p><p>I wave goodbye to her and head to my classroom.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s lunchtime.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Shinji is absent, and so is Issei.</p><p>...It seems Issei is being treated at the hospital after the incident at the Ryuudou Temple.</p><p>Now that I look around, I see that there are more people absent.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But the number of absentees shouldn&#39;t get any higher, at least.</p><p>The Servant that was sucking the life force out of people in this town has been eliminated.</p><p>There should be no more unexplained comas.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah. The people Caster harmed will get well and come back soon.&quot;</p><hr><p>I pull myself together.</p><p>There are four Masters remaining.</p><p>Two, if you don&#39;t count Tohsaka and Illya. I can&#39;t let my guard down until I know what kind of people they are.</p><hr><p>&quot;&quot;Oh.&quot;&quot;</p><p>We speak out in unison.</p><p>I bump into Tohsaka the instant I go out into the hallway.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, what do you mean, &#39;oh&#39;? Isn&#39;t that a rude thing to say? Or do you have a guilty conscience?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, the same goes for you, you were surprised too.</p><p>...And what was up with the phone call last night? You were being selfish, telling me not to come and to come.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well... Yesterday was an exception. You skipped school the day after the Master at Ryuudou Temple disappeared. Of course I thought something happened to you.</p><p>...Um, I told you about the Ryuudou Temple, so it&#39;d trouble me if something happened to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I&#39;m surprised.</p><p>Did Tohsaka feel responsible because she told me about it?</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Thanks, Tohsaka. You were worried about me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not true! I just want to know the details of what happened, since I gave you the information!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? But I told you over the phone yesterday, right? Both Caster and her Master are defeated. There&#39;s nothing at the Ryuudou Temple anymore.&quot;</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Tohsaka looks serious all of a sudden.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka? Did I say something weird?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, you did. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you, but let me confirm. You&#39;re absolutely certain that you defeated Caster?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Humph. Even I could tell that.</p><p>Saber completely eliminated Caster. ...Caster&#39;s Master is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...He was already dead when we got there.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. There&#39;s something I want to talk about regarding that. Can you come to the rooftop?&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-rooftop-tohsaka-rin-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-rooftop-tohsaka-rin-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 Rooftop Tohsaka Rin(II)</h2><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Caster hasn&#39;t disappeared?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct. You defeated Caster two days ago, right?</p><p>But the coma incidents happened again yesterday.</p><p>...The people who had their magical energy sucked out yesterday are in a worse coma than before.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No way. We definitely...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. You wouldn&#39;t lie, and I don&#39;t think you made a misunderstanding. ...But Archer and I saw a shadow that looked like Caster when we went to the scene of the crime yesterday.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......I see. Then Caster&#39;s still alive and collecting magical energy from all over town?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m not certain, but it seems so. But I can tell that the atmosphere at the Ryuudou Temple has changed.</p><p>You two defeated Caster. But she still exists. That&#39;s all I&#39;m sure of right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka looks unhappy.</p><p>...This explains why she feels different from yesterday.</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is probably getting doubts about this war.</p><p>A Servant disappears if its Master is defeated.</p><p>A Servant cannot avoid death in this world if it is completely defeated.</p><p>But Caster still exists, in spite of taking both these penalties.</p><p>She is a &quot;violation&quot; that completely overthrows the fundamentals of the Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. So, what do you think?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. You think it&#39;s strange, right?</p><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll forfeit from the Holy Grail War. But don&#39;t you want to clear up this thing about Caster before you start fighting for the Holy Grail? You want to put off fighting other Masters until after that, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re right.</p><p>This Holy Grail War is suspicious. It seems different from the one I heard about from my dad. I think there&#39;s something different going on where we can&#39;t see it.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Different, huh?</p><p>I don&#39;t have the liberty to think about such a thing because the Holy Grail War itself is beyond my comprehension.</p><p>But if a legitimate Master like Tohsaka feels that way, it must be true.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then Tohsaka...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I won&#39;t follow the rules of the Holy Grail War until I&#39;m convinced. It can&#39;t be helped if I&#39;m being used, but I don&#39;t like not knowing the harm I may be imposing on others.</p><p>You don&#39;t like such a thing, right? So I&#39;m not going to be fighting other Masters until I get this cleared up.&quot;</p><hr><p>She declares her stance.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s eyes show her determination, and it seems to be asking for my stance.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. Can I take that as a truce offer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you would accept it. If you won&#39;t fight me until this case is settled, I won&#39;t hurt you either.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka asks me silently with her eyes.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even need to ask.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s my line. I won&#39;t fight you as long as you don&#39;t come attacking me.</p><p>...And even if there comes a time when we do fight, it&#39;ll be fair and square. Until then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I want to cooperate with Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then it&#39;s decided. I expected you to agree, but I&#39;m glad to hear it all the same.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka holds out her right hand.</p><p>I realize that she&#39;s wanting to shake hands, and...</p><p>&quot;Y-Yeah. P-Please give me your best regards.&quot;</p><p>I try to suppress my face from turning red as I shake her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, our contract is set. Please give me your best regards too, Emiya-kun.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Tohsaka firmly shakes my hand.</p><p>Her hand is soft, much more delicate than mine.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I-I&#39;M AN IDIOT!!! WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING AT A TIME LIKE THIS!!!!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Emiya-kun? You&#39;re sweating all of a sudden. ...It seems your heart&#39;s beating faster too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!? N-No, it&#39;s nothing, I just have a cold. I&#39;ll get well if I eat! I&#39;ll get better if I eat, so let&#39;s eat lunch!&quot;</p><hr><p>I quickly let go of Tohsaka&#39;s hand.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s expression turns wicked.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ohhhh. I suspected it when we last met, but it looks like my hunch was correct. You seemed like you had some experience, but you actually don&#39;t, huh?</p><p>It&#39;s surprising, or should I say it&#39;s just as I expected?</p><p>...I see, I see. I seeeeee.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka Rin stares at me from head to toe.</p><hr><p>&quot;W-What? Come out and say it if you want to say something. I-It&#39;s not good to stay quiet!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Noooothing. Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s just that I just figured out a bit more about you. Oh, I won&#39;t say it, so you don&#39;t have to be frightened.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! I-I&#39;m not frightened! Go ahead and say it if you want to!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, can I?&quot;</p><p>She grins.</p><p>Man\u2015\u2015\u2015how can such an evil smile exist in this world?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t say it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, I can&#39;t hear you?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry. Please don&#39;t mention it. I think it&#39;ll be shocking if I hear it. I think I&#39;ll suffer more damage if I hear it from you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? Then I guess I won&#39;t say it\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka withdraws with an expression of victory.</p><p>And the instant I regain my peace of mind...</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re the type that masturbates to the girl you like, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, you said it, you devil!!!&quot;</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04-the-two" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04-the-two" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04 The two</h2><p>&quot;So. I think people get mad when they&#39;re told the truth.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka ponders as she eats my lunch.</p><p>She came to the rooftop empty-handed.</p><p>Which, of course, meant that she didn&#39;t have her lunch.</p><p>Then it was only natural for her to target mine.</p><hr><p>&quot;Just eat. ...Man, why do you have chopsticks when you don&#39;t have your own lunch? Do you always carry them around?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? I just brought these with me when I left my classroom. You had your lunch last time, so I thought I&#39;d have you share some of yours. I came prepared just in case you had boxed lunch.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hey now. I think you&#39;re putting thought into the wrong areas.&quot;</p><p>Bring some food before you bring chopsticks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about minor details. You brought two people&#39;s worth of food, so it turned out fine.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>No, this isn&#39;t two people&#39;s worth of food.</p><p>It&#39;s just that Sakura made too much.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh well. It&#39;s true that I won&#39;t be able to finish it by myself. Oh, don&#39;t just eat the vegetables. Eat some meat as well. I&#39;ll get an upset stomach if I just eat meat.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What? I don&#39;t want it because that&#39;s too sweet.</p><p>Don&#39;t tell a girl to eat meat. I&#39;m keeping track of how much I&#39;ve eaten, so if I&#39;m not eating it, that&#39;s a sign that I&#39;ve had my share.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Liar. I bet you&#39;re the type that doesn&#39;t hold back when you go eat yakiniku. I&#39;m suuuuuure of it. You&#39;ll be scarfing down beef ribs while I&#39;ll be munching on my salted fish.</p><p>You won&#39;t show any consideration for my money. In fact, you&#39;ll try to bankrupt me. And after you&#39;re satisfied, you&#39;re going to tell me, &#39;Heh, I went easy this time.&#39;&quot;</p><p>I try to get back at her for what she said earlier.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well said, Emiya-kun. I find it scary that I can&#39;t deny that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...No.</p><p>You&#39;re the scary one, Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;But this lunch sure is strange. There&#39;s a lot of food here, but the wrapping and all is really feminine. Do you like to cook, Emiya-kun?&quot;</p><p>What a coincidence.</p><p>I think I heard the same exact thing this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, it&#39;s not like I hate cooking, but Sakura made today&#39;s lunch.</p><p>Oh, Sakura is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Tohsaka? What&#39;s wrong? Did you bite on a lump of sugar?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh geez... I did it...&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sighs and puts away her chopsticks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thanks. You can eat the rest by yourself.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka gets away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Well, it&#39;s fine if she&#39;s full already.</p><p>I was nervous eating lunch next to Tohsaka. Now I can enjoy a little peace of mind.</p><hr><p>I head back to my classroom.</p><p>It&#39;s a few minutes before fifth period starts, and the hallway is filled with students going back to their classrooms.</p><hr><p>In contrast, the stairs are quiet and empty.</p><p>Not many students go to a different floor to eat.</p><p>There...</p><p>I bump into Sakura.</p><hr><p>She looks away awkwardly as soon as she sees us.</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>What could be wrong with her?</p><p>She was so energetic this morning, but she looks depressed now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I call out to her.</p><p>But before I can say anything else...</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sakura. It was bad timing on my part.&quot;</p><p>...Tohsaka steps forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... No, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Even if Senpai and Tohsaka-Senpai are together, it has nothing to do with\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re misunderstanding. I went and invited him because I had to talk to him about something. And he didn&#39;t skip out on you, either. He just didn&#39;t realize it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Hmmm? What do you mean? It&#39;s not like I made a promise with Sakura\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot. She made lunch for you, so that means she wanted to eat with you. It&#39;s natural for Sakura to be mad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>H-Hold on.</p><p>We never made any promise to eat together\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?</p><p>The range is open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it&#39;s quiet there\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>And...</p><p>...When I look, I see that Sakura&#39;s lunch is untouched.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...That&#39;s right.</p><p>What was I thinking!? Tohsaka&#39;s absolutely right to call me an idiot...!</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Sakura! I&#39;m so stupid...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No, it&#39;s fine! See, it&#39;s not like we made a promise, and I just thought it might be good if we could eat together\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not good! Let&#39;s go, Sakura! We&#39;ll still make it!</p><p>We can eat quickly in the archery range and\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I grab Sakura&#39;s hand and start running.</p><hr><p>But.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll make it. What can you do in three minutes?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s calm analysis stops me.</p><p>...I panicked because I felt guilty for breaking the promise, but Tohsaka is one-hundred-percent right.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine, Senpai. We have to go back to our classrooms, just like Tohsaka-Senpai says.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh... But Sakura...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Please don&#39;t worry too much about it. That was enough for me. Thank you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to say when she makes a face like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then I&#39;ll be going. You two will be late if you don&#39;t hurry.&quot;</p><p>Sakura goes up the stairs with her lunch in her hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;d better get going too.</p><p>Go to the Chinese restaurant in the shopping district after school. Wait there, okay?&quot;</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>Tohsaka leaves a strange message before she leaves for her classroom.</p><hr><p>Fifth period ends and the room empties out quickly.</p><p>It&#39;s not even two o&#39;clock yet.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew. I don&#39;t feel like it, but Tohsaka told me to.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s nothing I can do here, so I guess I&#39;ll go to the shopping district.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-05-shocking-mapo-tofu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-05-shocking-mapo-tofu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 05 Shocking Mapo tofu</h2><p>There&#39;s only one Chinese restaurant in the shopping district.</p><p>Koushuuensaikan: Taizan.</p><p>It&#39;s an ominous dungeon in the shopping district, with no windows to show you what&#39;s inside. Most first-time customers run away after seeing the place.</p><p>The manager, a favorite of the neighborhood association, is a strange little Chinese man nicknamed &quot;small manager.&quot; Batsu-san has a tendency to fill every dish with red pepper.</p><hr><p>In other words, the food&#39;s hot.</p><p>Really hot.</p><p>Imagine being stabbed in the tongue and then having salt rubbed into it, and you&#39;ll be on the right track.</p><hr><p>This restaurant&#39;s infernal seasonings have given me a general distaste for Chinese food.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t help that the manager keeps adding &quot;aru&quot; at the end of every sentence.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>And now I&#39;m entering this terrible dungeon willingly.</p><p>The manager will bring a menu as soon as he sees me.</p><p>That&#39;ll be the end of it.</p><p>At the very least, I&#39;ll have to order something that uses sweet vinegar.</p><hr><p>It&#39;ll turn out horrible if I order something like twice cooked pork, and mapo tofu is out of the question. That stuff is dangerous. It&#39;ll melt my tongue. I hear the judge of hell pulls out your tongue, so such awful food could easily come from there. The manager traveled abroad to train his cooking arts, so maybe he trained with the devils.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s almost two-thirty.</p><p>I promised to be here right after school, so I can&#39;t hesitate any longer.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right, I&#39;m going!&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know why I have to get pumped up to go into a restaurant, but here it&#39;s necessary.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what Tohsaka was thinking when she said we should meet here, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;s regretting it now.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Wait.</p><p>&quot;Hm? You&#39;re finally here, Emiya? I came early, so I have already started eating.&quot;</p><p>The priest is eating mapo tofu.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m speechless.</p><p>Why is Kotomine here?</p><p>Why is he eating mapo tofu that looks like a boiling pot?</p><p>And why is he eating it so fast?</p><p>He&#39;s sweating, but he never stops for a drink, spiritedly moving his hands as if they will never move again if he stops.</p><hr><p>Actually... Is he just being stubborn? He&#39;s eating it way too fast.</p><p>Or is it that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.</p><hr><p>Then this is bad. This restaurant and Kotomine are both bad.</p><p>That food has dangerous amounts of spice. It can&#39;t be explained any other way.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t just keep standing and sit down.&quot;</p><p>The priest talks as he keeps eating.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I take caution as I sit across from him... Well, I&#39;m not too sure what I&#39;m on guard against.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I watch his movements.</p><p>...Amazing. He only has about two more mouthfuls left.</p><p>I watch in amazement when Kotomine suddenly stops eating.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Our eyes meet.</p><p>Kotomine watches me with his usual oppressive eyes and...</p><p>&quot;Do you want some\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want any\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I reply with all my might.</p><hr><p>The priest frowns a bit before he finishes the mapo tofu.</p><p>...Huh?</p><p>Did my reply disappoint him?</p><hr><p>...The only one waiting for me is Kotomine.</p><p>It seems he asked Tohsaka to invite me here.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So, what do you want? Isn&#39;t it unusual for you to come talk to someone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I heard that you have already defeated two Servants. I came to commend you on your achievements.&quot;</p><p>...He&#39;s lying.</p><p>Even if it is true, he should have picked a better restaurant.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I&#39;m sorry, but I think your words are good enough.</p><p>I&#39;m not fighting for your sake. There&#39;s no reason for you to praise me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm. I guess there was no need for banal flattery.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Then let me cut to the chase. You heard from Rin that Caster is still alive, correct?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. Caster still exists, and she&#39;s collecting magical energy from the people in town, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I do not know if it is related, but there was another Servant at the Ryuudou Temple on the night you defeated Caster.</p><p>I believe it to be Assassin, judging by the appearance and combat style, but I am not certain.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Assassin... Then Assassin was also at the Ryuudou Temple? But Saber said...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;She did not sense him, right? Assassin is not a strong heroic spirit, but their class has the special ability to conceal its presence. Covert action is their area of expertise. Even Saber should not be able to sense Assassin if he hides his presence.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Then that means Assassin was at the Ryuudou Temple on the night we defeated Caster.</p><p>Was he hiding near us, trying to find an opening to attack\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand. But why are you telling me all this? I thought the supervisor doesn&#39;t help one particular Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am merely sharing information with you. I have told you all I know. In exchange, tell me what you have experienced over the last few days. ...There is something strange about this Holy Grail War.</p><p>Something is different from the last war.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you do not wish to tell me, I will not force you. Just take my words as a warning.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No, I&#39;ll pay your price. After all, you came out and gave me information that I needed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Hah. You have a strong sense of duty as always, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>The priest smiles in satisfaction.</p><p>...Heh. It seems he knows every move I&#39;m going to make.</p><p>But I&#39;m not going to fall for his tricks that easily.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll talk. But first, I have a question.</p><p>How do you know such a thing?</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t know that Assassin was at the Ryuudou Temple unless you had a Servant.&quot;</p><hr><p>No, he shouldn&#39;t know even if he does have a Servant.</p><p>Neither Saber nor Archer, Tohsaka&#39;s Servant, could tell.</p><hr><p>&quot;It is simple. My Lancer was defeated by Assassin at the temple. As his Master, I needed only retrieve his last sight.&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>The priest simply states something absurd.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said that I am also a Master. You said it too. That I would not know unless I had a Servant.</p><p>Well, you are certainly correct.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015what\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But that ended last night. Lancer has been eliminated, which means that I am not a Master. I am no longer your enemy.</p><p>Well, is that all you want to ask me? Then it is your turn to talk. Tell me who you met and what you saw over the past couple of days.&quot;</p><hr><p>The atmosphere becomes heavy in an instant.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t allow me any questions.</p><p>He wants answers.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...I have a lot of things I want to ask him, but I have to answer him first.</p><p>In as much detail as possible, I recount what happened to me after making my contract with Saber four days ago.</p><hr><p>...The story lasts for about thirty minutes.</p><p>I haven&#39;t done much as a Master.</p><p>The information I provided is mostly useless.</p><p>But the priest takes great interest in Matou Zouken.</p><hr><p>&quot;Matou Zouken\u2015\u2015\u2015I thought he had withered away, but he is still active? I guess it is true that he is a blood-sucking monster.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? That old man is a blood-sucking monster...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The magecraft of the Matou family is absorption. I hear that Matou Zouken, a magus from six generations back, was a prominent bug user.&quot;</p><hr><p>...?</p><p>Using bugs... That doesn&#39;t mean his familiar is a bug, right?</p><p>Or... another way to use bugs is...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. By bug user... do you mean like guys who use bugs as a medium for poison? Like, putting in hundreds of poisonous bugs in a pot, and using the last surviving one as a curse...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that is wrong. From the start, cursing is outside of the Makiri&#39;s area of expertise.</p><p>The results of their magecraft always return to their bodies.</p><p>Cursing others would only result in mutual destruction.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then he&#39;s using bugs as familiars?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. Matou Zouken is merely a monster who feeds on the blood of others.</p><p>I hear that he kept his youth by transfiguring his body and sucking blood, and that he has lived for a few hundred years\u2015\u2015\u2015but...</p><p>Based on what I heard from Rin&#39;s father, he is now on the verge of death, and can no longer walk in broad daylight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...He can&#39;t walk in broad daylight? ...Well, I did meet him both times at night\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>He sucks on people&#39;s blood to prolong his life.</p><p>And he can&#39;t walk under the light of the sun. That&#39;s just like\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Kotomine. Is Matou Zouken a vampire?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heh. He is more like a parasitic insect. His nature and personality are like those of an insidious slug.&quot;</p><p>He insults Zouken.</p><p>It seems Kotomine really hates that old man.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You said he&#39;s been alive for a few hundred years. Then was he ever a Master?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, Matou Zouken was never a Master. He is like a counselor for the Matou family\u2015\u2015\u2015but he is a monster that lived for hundreds of years. He might have devised a plan to become a Master in a way we do not know of.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then the one who made a contract with Caster after her Master was killed is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Who knows? But he is not someone you can let your guard down against.</p><p>If he has taken the stage, he must believe his victory is certain. That means that the Matou family&#39;s Master has the support of the worst devil in Makiri history.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Shinji said he hasn&#39;t given up.</p><p>And he has the backing of Matou Zouken.</p><p>He lost his Command Spell, but that old man might be able to give him a new Servant.</p><hr><p>&quot;You have been a great help. All these abnormalities make sense if the Makiri elder is in action. As the war&#39;s supervisor, I shall try to suppress the damage.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine nods to himself and relaxes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Supervisor, huh? You&#39;re not one to talk when you were secretly a Master until yesterday.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not put it like that. I have no wish. I obtained Lancer because I wanted to give the Holy Grail to a more appropriate desirer.</p><p>But that is over now. It is for the remaining Masters to decide.</p><p>Well, personally, I would like either you or Rin to obtain the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I frown.</p><p>The priest is serious.</p><p>He just said that he doesn&#39;t need the Holy Grail.</p><p>In fact, he clearly told me that he wants either Rin or I to obtain it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why? You became a Master because you want the Holy Grail, right? Don&#39;t you have a wish you want granted?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see. I do not have a wish, but I do have a goal. My goal is not a serious matter, and it is meaningless even if I achieve it myself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>A goal that is meaningless if he achieves it himself...?</p><hr><p>&quot;What are you talking about? If you want to tell riddles, find somebody else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Consider it a friendly warning. We are the same, you and I. As we do not have clear wishes, we cannot seek salvation.</p><p>I simply thought it would be easier for you if you quickly realized it.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>I feel like he has grabbed my heart in his hand.</p><p>The priest&#39;s words seep into my mind like a curse.</p><hr><p>&quot;Kotomine, you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I constrict my wavering eyes and glare at him.</p><p>And then\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Here&#39;s your mapo tofu-aru!&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015The second and third plates of mapo tofu are placed on the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>Kotomine picks up his spoon.</p><p>I&#39;m sure of it.</p><p>He ordered more servings beforehand.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Our eyes meet.</p><hr><p>Kotomine stares at me with oppressive eyes and...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Do you want some?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No.&quot;</p><p>I answer him with a straight face.</p><hr><p>I leave Ensaikan: Taizan.</p><p>...It&#39;s because Kotomine had no intention of talking anymore and started eating the mapo tofu.</p><hr><p>As I leave the restaurant with a heartburn...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Emiya. I have withdrawn from the war, but you and Rin are still Masters.

Aren&#39;t you sitting down?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Here&#39;s your drink, Shirou.

They don&#39;t have it back home, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever seen it.

It was only a short while, but thanks, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Her voice is clear.</p><p>Smiling resolutely, Illya announces that her dream has come to an end.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&#39;thanks&#39;? Why? It hasn&#39;t even been an hour yet. We can go to Shinto if you&#39;re bored with the shopping district. That place is far better than...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. This is the last stop, after all. It was fun, but the shopping ends here. The sun&#39;s going to set soon, so let&#39;s go back to our previous relationship.</p><p>I&#39;m a Master who came to kill Shirou, and you&#39;re fighting me for your own good. Our relationship was set in stone before we met.&quot;</p><hr><p>How can I respond to that?</p><p>Illya yearns for ordinary life more than me, but she casts away her wishes far more readily.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. Then when we leave this park...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, we&#39;ll be enemies.

If I continued to protest, you would likely use your Command Spell. I shall trust her, as you have trusted her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saber.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But I will not see her. I do not think I can stay composed in front of her, and I am sure she will be on guard if I am there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-Yeah, you&#39;re right.

I should have been prepared for this.&quot;</p><p>Saber lets out a sigh and goes to the guest room.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I see.</p><p>Saber was my father&#39;s Servant in the last Holy Grail War.</p><p>Then\u2015\u2015\u2015it&#39;s natural for her to know of the relationship between Kiritsugu and Illya.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hello. So this is Shirou&#39;s house.&quot;</p><p>In contrast to her energetic voice, Illya enters timidly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s have some tea first. I&#39;ll show you the living room, so follow me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. Oh, this hallway has a wooden floor. Your house is Japanese, just like I heard.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks around as she walks.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I guess this Japanese-style is unusual for her since she&#39;s living in a castle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here you go. I thought about making English tea, but that&#39;s boring and I&#39;m sure you have better ones at your place. I made some Japanese tea, so tell me if it&#39;s too bitter and I&#39;ll water it down for you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hand her the cup.</p><p>I used the best tea I had, so it should taste good. The only potential problem is that it might be too bitter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, thanks, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>She sits Japanese-style and nervously takes a sip.</p><hr><p>&quot;Uh...&quot;</p><p>Illya freezes.</p><p>...I thought so. I was trying to be considerate, but I guess milk tea would&#39;ve been better.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s bitter, right? I&#39;ll go make another one, so you don&#39;t have to drink it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015\u2015no, that&#39;s not true. Um, it was very delicious.&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know where she learned the manners, but Illya bows.</p><p>And she slowly starts to sip on the tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...Well, if she wants to drink it, I shouldn&#39;t stop her.</p><p>The Japanese snack, on the other hand...</p><hr><p>...Seems to be well-received, so I&#39;ll sit here and keep her company.</p><hr><p>Once we finish the tea, Illya asks me if we can explore my house.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m fine with that, but there&#39;s nothing interesting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just want to check it out. I knew this place had low magical value when I came in here, so all you have to do is show me around.&quot;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s her reply.</p><p>So I end up giving her a tour of my home, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm. This place is smaller than I thought. One side of the corridor is glass. It&#39;ll be troublesome when you get attacked here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This is Shirou&#39;s room!? No way, a person can&#39;t live here!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;This is your yard? Japanese magi must have it tough. You can&#39;t grow anything in such a small garden.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know this. This is called a dojo, right?</p><p>My grandfather told me you people are savages that slash at each other bare-footed.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No! I don&#39;t want to see inside your storage room! You have servants to take care of that!&quot;</p><hr><p>...She complains a lot.</p><p>But it seems she&#39;s having fun.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s next!? We haven&#39;t gone over there! Let&#39;s go, Shirou!&quot;</p><p>She urges me.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Fine, fine. Then let&#39;s go to the back. It&#39;s dirty because we haven&#39;t used it for a few years, but don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p>Illya runs across the hallway in joy.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Phew.&quot;</p><p>But...</p><p>I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s so happy about, but I&#39;m glad I&#39;m showing her around if it&#39;s this fun for her.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>Illya must be getting tired, as she loses her spirit halfway through the tour.</p><p>Illya silently looks around the rooms.</p><p>Once we&#39;ve seen everything, we return to the living room.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s all. Well, there&#39;s also the outbuilding, but you&#39;ll have to excuse me for not showing it to you.</p><p>Saber is sleeping there right now.&quot;</p><p>Illya looks downcast.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. So this is all?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Illya? What&#39;s wrong? Are you tired?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m a bit tired. There&#39;s nobody here, after all.&quot;</p><p>She looks like a normal girl of her age.</p><hr><p>...Illya is acting like Illya, and not like a strong Master.</p><p>&quot;I came to take revenge. But it&#39;s sad that the person to take revenge on isn&#39;t here anymore.&quot;</p><p>She murmurs to herself, tears silently trickling down her face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? That&#39;s strange. I think I&#39;m crying. There was nothing sad or scary.&quot;</p><p>Illya tilts her head in wonder, as if it&#39;s a really odd thing.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s probably a reason for it.</p><p>There&#39;s no one in this house.</p><p>The target she has a grudge against.</p><p>She only wanted to kill him, but the chance has been forever lost.</p><p>...Illyasviel von Einzbern.</p><p>She has a reason to kill me and Kiritsugu.</p><p>It&#39;s because\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go, Shirou. The sun&#39;s going to set soon.</p><p>We&#39;ll have to fight unless I leave this place before nightfall.&quot;</p><p>...Illya is smiling.</p><p>What can I say back to her?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Yeah, you&#39;re right. Then I&#39;ll see you off to the park.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. You sure know how to treat a lady.&quot;</p><p>She smiles innocently.</p><p>Her silver hair fluttering behind her, Illya runs to the front door as if nothing has happened.</p><hr><p>...And I part with her for the third time.</p><p>My legs are heavy on the way home.</p><p>I slowly walk through the streets, as if for the first time.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I have so much to think about.</p><p>Foremost in my mind... I&#39;m finally realizing how important Illya is.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Father. Illya is\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Should I fight her as a Master?</p><p>Or should I convince her to forfeit?</p><hr><p>&#39;Makiri and Einzbern have deep tenacities.</p><p>They have desired the Holy Grail for over 500 years and 1000 years.&#39;</p><hr><p>That&#39;s what Kotomine said.</p><p>Is there a way to separate Illya from people who have sought the Holy Grail for so long?</p><p>...No, even before that.</p><p>I have no idea how to quench her desire for revenge.</p><hr><p>I return to my house.</p><p>The sun is about to set, coloring the town with its reddish glow.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015All right. I have to pull myself together.&quot;</p><p>I slap my cheeks.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to deal with Shinji and Illya sooner or later, but defeating Caster, the one still attacking the people in this town, takes priority now.</p><hr><p>I won&#39;t let an event like the one that took place ten years ago take place again.</p><p>That&#39;s why I decided to become a Master and fight alongside Saber.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12-temptation-afternoon" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12-temptation-afternoon" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12 Temptation(Afternoon)</h2><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>I see Sakura&#39;s shoes.</p><p>Considering the time, I bet Sakura&#39;s already back from her club.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m home...

You&#39;re working way too hard, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>I go past the living room, trying not to wake her up.</p><p>And...</p><p>I bring a blanket from my room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Here.

The only thing following her is her cold and silent silhouette.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She walks faster.</p><p>Staying here is dangerous.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t believe she&#39;s overthinking.</p><p>Nobody is following her. First of all, she doesn&#39;t have the sense to realize it even if she is in danger.</p><p>She is only human, after all.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hey, what is this?&quot;</p><p>But she can&#39;t stop shivering.</p><p>The unpleasant presence gets stronger.</p><p>...This is just like the times she woke up at night as a child.</p><p>She would wake up to go to the bathroom, but would sense someone crouching in the corner. Instead of moving, she would pretend to be asleep until morning came. This unease is how she felt then, as if the whole world has abandoned her.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Haa...... Haa.......

Ahahahaha.&quot;</p><p>Something&#39;s funny, so sounds of laughter come from her throat as if from someone else.</p><hr><p>She is merely running.</p><p>Her usual route home seemed too dangerous.</p><p>So she ran along the roads that felt safer to her, and...</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah. Ahahaha, hahahahahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Finally.</p><p>She realizes that there is no place to run.</p><hr><p>Worms. Worms. Worms. Worms.</p><p>Some appear from between the grasses.</p><p>Some fall down from the tree branches.</p><p>The first one drops on her right eye and...</p><hr><p>...It uses the snout larger than her eyeballs to crawl into her eye socket.</p><hr><p>&quot;[block len=12]......!!&quot;</p><p>The scream is not heard.</p><p>She crumples to the ground.</p><p>Pain shoots through her heels. It hurts. It hurts, as if they&#39;ve been chopped off with an axe.</p><hr><p>; &quot;[block len=12]&quot;</p><p>Since that&#39;s impossible, she tries to move her toes, only to find that she can&#39;t feel them.</p><p>In its place, many new things enter her body from the cut heel.</p><p>She tries to see what they are with her remaining left eye.</p><hr><p>She cannot see what they are anymore.</p><p>Indescribable horrors swarm over her body.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Aha, it&#39;s eating.&quot;</p><p>Her mind somehow does not see what they are eating.</p><hr><p>The worms dive in.</p><p>When she was small, she once saw maggots swarming on a sponge.</p><p>This is just like that.</p><p>Although inchworms chewing through an apple might be a more apt comparison.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hii\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015aha, but it&#39;s not weird.&quot;</p><p>But the realistic image and the scene before her do not seem related.</p><p>Because such things cannot be.</p><p>Such things cannot be happening to her.</p><p>It&#39;s almost midnight.</p><p>She has to hurry home, ready the bath, ouch, laugh off all the fatigue, that hurts, let her hair dry, it hurts, watch some videos, return to her room room room room it hurts she wants to return to her room return return return return please, please stop,</p><hr><p>stay up till three o&#39;clock, it really hurts, anything, please stop, please stop it hurts it hurts it hurts</p><hr><p>wake up with an alarm clock, go back it hurts go to work go back go back go back.</p><p>Ah\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015so this has to be a dream. She wants to go back to her room, this has to be a dream, go back, go back, but her feet are gone, so she cannot walk baaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh</p><p>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!</p><p>&quot;Die, go away, no, stop, stop, please, please, take me back to my room, please, pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase, no, why, why, are you eating me......!!!!?&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015The meal ends in under five minutes.</p><p>It was too gruesome a scene to be called a meal, but if one defines having a meal as absorbing nourishment, then this was certainly a meal.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015hm.&quot;</p><p>The lying body stands up.</p><p>The female body has turned into an old man&#39;s body.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015mm. I can never get used to this.&quot;</p><p>A hoarse voice echoes through the park.</p><p>The worms have disappeared.</p><p>They have finished their meal and have returned to their nest, the old man&#39;s body.</p><p>In other words\u2015\u2015\u2015they replaced the woman&#39;s body, the one they fed on.</p><hr><p>Someone else is watching the spectacle.</p><hr><p>Between the crisscrossing tree branches...</p><p>A white mask is floating.</p><p>The mask made from human skull is smiling like a buffoon.</p><hr><p>The owner of the mask does not even need to be mentioned.</p><p>It is the seventh Servant\u2015\u2015\u2015the one born from within the fake Servant. He is the heroic spirit who defeated Lancer, Assassin.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Impressive. So your previous body was not your own, either?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Oh? Were you watching, Assassin? Yes, my body has perished a long time ago. I am just an old fool who has to leech off of a whole body. My body cannot handle walking under the sun like everyone else&#39;s.&quot;</p><hr><p>The laughing figure is indeed Matou Zouken.</p><p>It took him a few minutes to attack and take over a woman&#39;s body.</p><p>The speed is incredible, even for a master magus.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So you did not care who it was. All you require is a full body, no matter whose it may be. You merely mold the body to the shape you want.</p><p>What&#39;s inside your body are worms in any case. The worms will function as your organs... It is indeed a mimicry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh my. In only one day, you have grown quite talkative. Do you remember your wish now?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015Of course. I can only be summoned by people who share my desire. Your craving for eternal life has summoned me here. What I wish for is eternity.</p><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The black shadow wavers.</p><p>The emotionless skull stares at the aged magus.</p><hr><p>&quot;This raises a question. You are already immortal. You have lived for over five centuries. Then, is your wish not already granted?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Hah.&quot;</p><p>The old magus lets out a cry.</p><p>Who would know that the cry is not a laugh, but a cry of anger?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015Yes, Matou Zouken is almost immortal.</p><p>He will live as long as there are bodies to infest and his soul remains alive.</p><hr><p>But\u2015\u2015\u2015there is only pain.</p><p>Matou Zouken does not wear his current form by choice.</p><hr><p>Turning his body into something inhuman and mimicking human form.</p><p>There is a limit to this magecraft.</p><p>It is like a machine. A machine can run forever in theory, but its parts rust over time.</p><p>Parts rust. Cogwheels slide out of place. Programs become obsolete.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015No, no. I am not immortal, Assassin.</p><p>My body rots. It will rot no matter how many times I get a new body. It will rot no matter what I do.</p><p>This new body has begun to rot already.</p><p>Can you begin to understand the discomfort and disgrace of rotting alive\u2015\u2015\u2015the despair upon learning that your body is not human?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Why does it rot? Are the worms not able to make a proper body?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Haha, that is not true. The worms are lively. They have no problem as a body. From the start, I became a parasite in grief over my aging body. They serve perfectly as a body.</p><p>I chose this method to prolong my life forever while retaining my humility.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I am even more confused. Is that all you can manage, even with the power to perfectly preserve your body? First of all, why are you taking the form of an old man?</p><p>If you are able to shape the flesh into any form, you should be able to take any appearance.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is a good question. Then let me ask you. Let&#39;s say something that lost its original body tries to reproduce its body with its powers.</p><p>In that case\u2015\u2015\u2015what do you think restores the body to its original form?&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015The body records itself. Even after it is burned or cut, the body is able to restore its original appearance, because there is an internal blueprint.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. A body&#39;s composition is recorded in its genes. But it is different in my case. I lost my body, the place where my composition was recorded. I can no longer use that blueprint to recreate my body.</p><p>In that case\u2015\u2015\u2015what do you think records my body and gives it form?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>It is obvious.</p><p>The soul.</p><p>It is not the law of the physical world, but something of the higher order, the record of all the bodies within the concept of the astral world.</p><p>...Yes, if one has the soul, one should be able to reconstruct their body even if the original body and genes have been lost.</p><p>So in other words, this old magus is...</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015I see. You keep your soul alive, while taking the bodies of other creatures as your own\u2015\u2015\u2015so that is the trick behind your immortality.</p><p>That must be why you cannot turn yourself into anything else. What you are keeping alive is your soul, not your body.</p><p>So that is why you cannot take any other form but that of Matou Zouken?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. I am not taking form as an old man because I want to.</p><p>...Look, this is the only form I can create. And it is a poor creation that rots away unless I exchange it periodically. I used to be able to last fifty years before I had to exchange my body, but I have to exchange it every few months now.</p><p>...Who can understand the pain I feel as I rot away? Do not misunderstand, Assassin of this generation. Do not call such a thing immortality\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>Irritation can be heard in the voice of the old magus.</p><p>It has been three days since Assassin&#39;s summoning.</p><p>He finally sees the true nature of his summoner.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand now. So what is rotting is not your body, but...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes, my soul is rotting.</p><p>Time even affects ethereal bodies. Therefore, my physical body will rot. It is natural for my body to rot if my soul, the blueprint of my body, is rotten.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm\u2015\u2015\u2015so that is why you seek the Holy Grail.</p><p>...No wonder you are angry. Such eternity must be more painful to you than those who have no idea of eternity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly.</p><p>...My body rots. I need to be freed from this pain, from this poison violating deep into my bones...!</p><p>The Holy Grail exists for that purpose. I have persisted for that purpose.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Right. I do not want to die. I want to live. It is dreadful to think that I will disappear from this world...!</p><p>To escape this fate, I have lived for hundreds of years, devouring the flesh of thouands...! Do you understand, master of the mountain? I hate myself for turning myself into worms. I hate being the only one who rots away. I hate all humans for being given bodies as a matter of course\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The white mask looks down at the rotting old man.</p><p>...How can he say he hates humans that live peacefully?</p><p>It was his spell, used to escape that peaceful life, that gave him this pain.</p><p>The undending torment of this magus, the decay that melts his bones and flesh, is the result of his own action.</p><hr><p>But the pain overrides such trivial matters as blame.</p><p>It must not matter who is evil or what the cause is.</p><p>Because\u2015\u2015\u2015this is just a speculation, but Matou Zouken must be insane already.</p><hr><p>The pain and fear of experiencing one&#39;s own decomposition must be unbearable for normal human beings.</p><p>Nobody should be able to endure it, no matter how strong their mind may be.</p><p>Because one will die.</p><p>The body dies if it rots for over an hour.</p><p>But two hundred years!</p><p>Only this old magus would understand how rotten the mind is of someone who has his body rotting away.</p><hr><p>Matou Zouken has gone insane.</p><p>No matter his mental state, if there is nobody in the world who can identify with him, he will be labeled insane.</p><hr><p>&quot;A centuries-old obsession, eh? I cannot understand, but\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The old man&#39;s monologue can be summarized in one sentence.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015He does not want to die.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015He does not want to die.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015In short, he does not want to die.</p><hr><p>It is merely that a wish anyone would have became clear for this man.</p><p>He sacrificed many people, clinging to the simple yet foolish wish.</p><p>He prepared many things and sacrificed people to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>No.</p><p>This old magus&#39;s very existence is made possible by those sacrifices.</p><p>That is reason enough for the masked assassin to pledge his loyalty.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not understand, but you are appropriate to be my Master.</p><p>Very well. Let us both aim for eternity, as we are both beings who were not treated as human.&quot;</p><hr><p>The skull waits.</p><p>The Servant in a black coat bows to the rotting old magus.</p>', 2292);
