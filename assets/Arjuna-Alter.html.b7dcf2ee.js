A hell on this Earth, inhabited by giant spiders that could detect life and gleefully devour it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>...Ah.</p></blockquote><p>The man finally understood his predicament. Not because of his acquired knowledge, but through his instincts as a living organism.</p><p><em><strong>No human should be here.</strong></em></p><p>He should have honed his instincts a little more, however. After all, no stray dog or cat, not even a single rat, has tried setting foot on this block.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>Ah, ah, ah.</p></blockquote><p>The man doesn\u2019t even have the mental capacity to scream.

Two. One.</p><p>Just as the spider is about to sink its fangs into the man.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>Huh?</p></blockquote><p>A slash, then it dissipates.</p><p>Standing in front of him is a being even more terrifying than the spider.</p><p>Beautiful and ruthless, destructive yet sublime in form.

The man most likely couldn\u2019t even see the thread, seeing as he wasn\u2019t a mage.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>(Don&#39;t tell me...those creatures understand the concept of hostages?!)</p></blockquote><p>Recognizing that Arjuna Alter had protected the man, the beasts promptly decided to hold him hostage.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Gghh\u2026!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>Ahh, get away from me! Get away! Save me! Save me please...!</p></blockquote><p>The man&#39;s voice cracks. <em>Abandon him</em>, his rational side whispers.</p><p>Arjuna Alter had seen through the man&#39;s true nature with his Clairvoyance.</p><p>\uFF0A\uFF0A\uFF0A</p><p>The man is undeniably evil.

He won&#39;t hesitate to look down on those he perceives to be inferior to himself. He won&#39;t get his hands dirty, besides hurting the feelings of said people. The only thing he gets out of this is a bit of vanity and self-satisfaction. But it was as if the man lived for that meaningless reward.</p><p>The man is well resented, but he will never be killed. <em><strong>After all, his actions are not heinous enough for someone to kill him over.</strong></em> So he will continue to survive and live a slothful life.</p><p>It&#39;s not like the man is a villain unparalleled in this world. People like him exist everywhere, enjoying themselves as if it is a given right. His lifestyle will not change until the day he dies. Regardless of what happens to the man \u2015 the future of the world will not change whether he lives or dies.</p><p>However, if the man lives, the people around him may feel a bit sad. If he dies, he dies. Nothing more to it.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 But does that mean I should leave him to die?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>(...This is bad.)</p></blockquote><p>An evil that doesn&#39;t kill others, and only hurts others. An evil that will never be judged as a sin. Can I overlook such a matter?</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. No one will be distressed if he dies in the process.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unleash your Noble Phantasm already and clear the surrounding area.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It needs to be done to correct this Singularity. The more time I waste here \u2015 the greater the risk I&#39;m putting Master in.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s right, Arjuna Alter thinks. Focus on the big picture. Don&#39;t mix up your priorities. I am Ritsuka&#39;s Servant \u2015 and my priority is to protect the Human Order.</p><p>Redirecting my thoughts, I tried to clear my mind. Thinking it over, I tried to cast my other thoughts aside.</p><p>But I feel resistance. I mustn&#39;t forsake the evil staring me right in the eyes.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>Eeek...!</p></blockquote><p>The Demonic Beasts began pulling the man by the thread, perhaps out of frustration. Most likely the man instinctively knows that he is being dragged to his deathbed. As well as the fact that the being who took a glance at him is allowing this to happen.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>S-save me! Please, save me...!</p></blockquote><p>On countless occasions, the man abandoned everyone who begged him for help. They were purely related to social and economic matters \u2015 but he didn&#39;t hesitate to abandon them. It&#39;s only when one is on the receiving end of being abandoned that they can experience it for the first time. Being seen as &quot;worthless&quot; by people, society and institutions \u2015 can be as painful as one&#39;s innards being gouged out.</p><p>I tried to destroy evil. I tried to create a better world. Why was that?</p><p>Because evil seeks to harm good. Because evil seeks to destroy good.</p><p>I want to be an ally of virtue. I want to be on the side that is good.</p><p>That is what I wished and fought for. To not allow even a single evil to exist in this world.</p><p><em><strong>Is it right then, to forsake evil?</strong></em></p><p>Arjuna. No, Arjuna Alter. You consumed the power of the pantheon to become a god, and now you become a man once again.</p><p>Is your choice the right one?</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 The razor-sharp inquiry is suddenly thrust upon him.</p><p>Arjuna Alter takes a deep breath. Then he remembers.</p><p>Before I met Master, before I became a god. Long, long before all that.</p><p>I chose to fight and protect the weak. I chose to go down this path during my childhood, back when I was still alive. I decided to do so, without telling anyone. Regardless of my many mistakes, numerous destinies, and past karma that have led me astray \u2015 that is the one thing I should never have forgotten.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>...That&#39;s right. It \u2500\u2500\u2500</p></blockquote><p>Every time I gaze upon Master&#39;s fierce eyes, I can bring myself back to that beginning.</p><p>Ah, what is this?</p><p>Beyond good and evil, beyond righteousness and wickedness, beyond all that \u2015 was a very simple and important emotion.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p><em><strong>It leaves me with a bad aftertaste, leaving someone behind.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 That&#39;s all there was to it! I shouldn&#39;t have thought about it in such a complicated way. Clear and simple, just like Master. It doesn&#39;t matter if the person is good or evil. I decided to save the person, so my goodness is unwavering. Whether the person being saved commits evil or not is their responsibility, not mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>You over there.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>...Huh? Me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Yes. As you can see \u2015well, I say that, but you probably don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. In any case, it appears your life is in my hands. So please assist me to the best of your ability.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>Okay...?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 Ah, that was just a joke.</p></blockquote><p>The surrounding area was crawling with spiders, almost like they forgot their purpose of leaving the block.</p><p>Yet, Arjuna Alter does not hesitate. He no longer has any doubts. Everything has neatly settled into place.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>I will focus exclusively on exterminating the Demonic Beasts. Can I leave that individual to you, <em><strong>my Master?</strong></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ritsuka:</strong></p><p>Of course!</p></blockquote><p>My doubts have now been cleared! Let&#39;s settle this once and for all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p>His arrows, his sword, his brilliance, vanquished the Demonic Beasts left and right. He fired over one hundred slashes and shots, and though the battle was fierce, he remained firm and unwavering. Although it was a battle that was impossible for him to lose in the first place. Arjuna Alter completely annihilated the Demonic Beasts.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>......</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Forget what happened here, and go back to your everyday life. Go!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Man:</strong></p><p>G-got...it...!</p></blockquote><p>Forgetting to thank Arjuna Alter, the man leaves, almost tripping over his own feet in the process.</p><p>What will happen to that man? I do not know. Will his memories be erased by mages deployed to the field? Or will he still remember the events of that day? Will he repent and start to do good deeds, or will he continue to do evil without remorse? Or will he choose to <em><strong>strike a balance between the two</strong></em> like most humans are wont to do?</p><p>Frankly speaking, I was fine either way.</p><p>I had long since freed myself from the role of deciding between good and evil.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 There we go. Comms are back up and running! But judging by your vital signs, it seems you&#39;ve already wrapped things up?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Yes, it\u2019s over. The Singularity should be corrected now.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Let\u2019s see...uh-huh. Yup, looks like it. Arjuna Alter, with some minor injuries, and Ritsuka-chan, without a scratch. No abnormalities in mental status, too.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>I would consider that a complete victory.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Hahaha, you\u2019re not wrong there! Alright, it\u2019s time to bring you back now. Good work, you two!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ritsuka:</strong></p><p>Roger!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Good work, Master.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ritsuka:</strong></p><p>...Did something good happen to you?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>No, not really. It\u2019s not that anything good happened to me. But \u2015 sometimes, it&#39;s the smallest, most trivial of events that helps everything click into place. I feel as if I have finally found the light of my soul. Now then, let us go back, Master.</p></blockquote><p>[Ritsuka nods.]</p><p>Sin, punishment, redemption, salvation; they all exist.</p><p>Good, bad, righteousness, evil; they all exist.</p><p>But I get the feeling that I, as my present self, should fight to transcend all these concepts.</p><p>I believe in what I stand for. I believe in myself who chose to believe in Master.</p><p>I was once a god. I fought disastrous battles and performed disastrous deeds.</p><p>I will never forget what I did. But \u2500\u2500\u2500</p><p>Ultimately, it is a relic of the past.</p><p>As necessary as it is for me, it is unnecessary for Master.</p><p>The answers I have found are incomplete, missing, and inadequate as a life story.</p><p>If I must be honest, I need a more fulfilling answer. Something obvious and clear as day.</p><p>...but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s nothing but a bluff for me.</p><p>Continue to worry, struggle, and agonize. Even if there isn&#39;t an answer out there, I\u2019m sure the path to reach it will be neither false nor meaningless.</p><p>\uFF0A\uFF0A\uFF0A</p><p>[Back on the Storm Border.]</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Oh?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>Hm, you\u2019re Arjuna...or his Alter, rather.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>I suppose so...</p><p>...You&#39;re the boxer form of...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>Incorrect. I am Santa Claus.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>I see...you know, I\u2019ve always thought this.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>Yes?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>You live a rather carefree life. I envy you for that.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>......</p><p>Is that so...? Is that so...?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>I mean, I don&#39;t think you would parade around as Santa Claus if you weren&#39;t carefree.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>I see what you mean...I suppose that&#39;s one way of looking at it.</p><p>......</p><p>Alter of Arjuna.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>Yeah?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>You wanna be Santa Claus?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>...We should probably take a break from that kind of rehashing, in my opinion...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>I see...that&#39;s a shame.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 Yeah. But I&#39;d be more than happy to help you hand out presents to the kids.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>Of course, I\u2019ll be sure to contact you when that time of the year comes around.</p></blockquote><p>I brush past Karna as he walks away.</p><p>\u2500\u2500\u2500 What a surreal conversation.</p><p>I try to hold back a spurt of laughter. I must look like a freak, laughing out in the hallway for no apparent reason whatsoever.</p><p>Get yourself together, get yourself together...</p><p>As I repeated that mantra in my head, I was dealt the final blow.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, Alter of Arjuna.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Arjuna Alter:</strong></p><p>W-what?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Santa Karna:</strong></p><p>You think I should include Ashwatthama with the kids?</p></blockquote><p>I burst into laughter in the hallway, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all.</p><p>It was a very human laugh \u2015 you could even call it the light of my soul.</p><p>For my soul laughs and shines bright.</p>", 191);
