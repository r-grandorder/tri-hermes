It&#39;s true that there are many Servants who just want to cause destruction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Most Berserkers are like that.<br> I didn&#39;t realize you could use a Spell that way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As expected of the great Emiya, a true veteran who&#39;s been through many Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. Well, when it comes to Holy Grail Wars,<br> I know more than your average Servant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Ahem. All right Fujimaru, this is a good chance. I&#39;m going to give you a proper lecture.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Of course, Dr. Roman has already taught you what you need to know about combat.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> So this time, I&#39;ll teach you about something you won&#39;t see in the stats, a Heroic Spirit&#39;s...attributes.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits can be divided into four main categories.<br> &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Star.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Those under the &quot;Human&quot; category are people born after AD, and praised as heroes after their death because of their great deeds in life.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Some of them were actual super humans when alive, but most of them were only glorified after death.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Andersen, Shakespeare, Robin Hood, and Lady Nightingale would all be examples.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Next, the &quot;Earth&quot; category.<br> These are heroes spoken of in local folklore\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (...This feels like another long talk.<br> Fujimaru, is he always like this?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sometimes he gets this way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. He&#39;s normally quiet and serious, but from time to time he gets very nosy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He sort of talks too much.<br> That&#39;s our Emiya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> His attribute is &quot;talky mom.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see... Talky mom attribute, eh?<br> We&#39;ll just have to let him talk till he&#39;s done then.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The fourth category &quot;Star,&quot; is where things get important.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The &quot;Star&quot; is a special category. It represents mankind&#39;s hope and symbolizes overcoming hardship.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> This category might seem powerful as it has no weakness against the other three, but its true nature lies elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> There&#39;s another category equal to the &quot;Star.&quot;<br> That&#39;s the fifth\u2014</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...We were interrupted just as it was getting good.<br> Fujimaru, prepare for combat.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They must have smelled us.<br> They&#39;ll make contact in 20 seconds!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right! Preparing for combat immediately!<br> Initiate anti-wild beast combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For our next topic, I&#39;ll explain what makes each class unique. We&#39;ll start with the Archer class,</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Archers, as the name implies, use a bow as their primary weapon.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> While inferior to Saber and Lancer in close range combat, they excel at providing long range support.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They also have a skill called &quot;Independent Action.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Even without a link to their Master, they can function for a while on their own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But they won&#39;t be able to maintain the physical body.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lack of energy source aside, wouldn&#39;t they be forced back to the Throne without an anchor to this world?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Normally, yeah. But with Independent Action,<br> they can ease up the &quot;force exerted by the World.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> After all, there are many stories of snipers camping out 3 days and 3 nights just to hit their targets.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Think of it as a skill that allows them to function for a few days apart from their Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What&#39;s important is that the skill differs from Assassin&#39;s Presence Concealment. It does not conceal your movement.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Stealth operations thus require the appropriate skill, or backups from their Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Archer, I hate to interrupt Fujimaru&#39;s lecture, but as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> An enemy attack, right? They always pick the worst timing. It&#39;s so hard to have class outdoors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...I probably shouldn&#39;t mention that Archer&#39;s loud voice is telling the enemy exactly where we are, right?)</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Lastly, a word about what it means to be a Master.<br> I&#39;ll tell you how to get along with your Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re still keeping this up!<br> Man, you don&#39;t know when to quit, do you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> I&#39;m here lecturing because the people at Chaldea won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I heard how you became a Master, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You&#39;re no Mage, and you have no experience.<br> You became a Master by accident, yes?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Even if no one else can do your job, that&#39;s still absurd.<br> I should at least teach you how to act like a Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Senpai. Emiya&#39;s right,<br> none of the adults left at Chaldea are any good...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I do feel bad, you know!<br> I am devoting myself fully to medical work as well!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Enough. We&#39;re talking about Servants.<br> They are Heroic Spirits from many different eras.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Basically, a Servant will be more powerful than their Master. You understand that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.<br> No one needs a familiar weaker than they are.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Correct. But it&#39;s wrong for a Master to unduly respect or fear their Servant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> They have achieved great things, but within the confines of the contract, that means nothing.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The Master and Servant relationship is defined by the contract, but mentally it&#39;s best for them to be equals.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Listen. Even a godlike Servant got their start the same way as you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Anyone who lives in the modern era, uses the wisdom their ancestors left behind\u2014</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Servants are no different.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Even Heroic Spirits achieved deeds with the help of others when they were alive, and that&#39;s why they choose to contract with you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> In other words, being summoned and relied on isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing for a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For example, how would you feel if something you left behind could aid the people of the next era?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...That would be kind of nice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It would feel like the proof that I lived.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.<br> Servants feel the same way.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> The deeds you did, the things you left behind nurtures the next generation\u2014All Servants take pride in that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t matter if the Servant is good or evil.<br> Servants and Masters are mentally equal.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A Servant aiding a Master, is simply a matter of duty.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> That is what it means to live on this planet.<br> What you do will surely help someone in the future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Someone in the future...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Ahem, Mr. Emiya?<br> I hate to interrupt the speech, but...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Sigh) Very well.<br> I&#39;ve said what I must.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> So, what is it this time? Golems? Skeletons?<br> At this point a wyvern wouldn&#39;t surprise me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, um\u2014<br> Honestly, we shouldn&#39;t be seeing any of these here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-It&#39;s an army of female soldiers! I have no idea why!<br> Gorilla-like women...In other words, GoriWoms!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re heading straight for Emiya!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> My bad luck with women is following me here? Aah!<br> It feels like someone&#39;s doing this deliberately!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And future generations would know this as the great Amazonian Migration. The end.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> ...Doctor, was this your doing?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Nope! Wasn&#39;t me!<br> Definitely not! No way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, I think that&#39;s the last attack.<br> Emiya, feel free to continue.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> (Sigh) Never mind.<br> I think I&#39;ll call it a day.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It was rude of me to assume you needed those lectures.<br> Fujimaru already has many wonderful Servants.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> With Mash Kyrielight at your side, you won&#39;t be easily defeated.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> You have a long journey ahead of you.<br> You&#39;ll learn through experience, not words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do the best I can.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Good. Go at your own pace, and don&#39;t rush.<br> You&#39;ll do yourself no good pushing too hard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash is the only one with talent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, sometimes you can be just brutal, you know that?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Emiya.<br> No, Servant Archer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was wondering.<br> Why are you being so nice to us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Other Servants are interested in Senpai&#39;s skills.<br> You&#39;re the only one who cares what Senpai thinks.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple.<br> Now that you&#39;re my Master, I need you to succeed.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It&#39;s business. A form of advertising.<br> I want people to know that my Masters succeed.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If word gets around, the next time I&#39;m summoned I can ask for a higher price, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, in other words, it&#39;s for your own benefit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is for us, and for yourself too?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> For one thing, it would damage my reputation to leave an inexperienced young [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A true Servant helps their Master grow, and thus enhances their own reputation.</p><h2 id="unlimited-blade-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unlimited-blade-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Unlimited Blade Works</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived at the Massive Cavern in Fuyuki.<br> Emiya, what&#39;s here, exactly?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I sensed this presence when I came to &quot;this&quot; Fuyuki before. I&#39;ve been waiting for the right timing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right timing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Presence?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> A tough foe I&#39;ve a particular attachment to\u2014<br> Or an impassable wall, you could say.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you&#39;re aware that I can&#39;t use my Noble Phantasm yet, of course.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;ve sealed it away, until you&#39;ve grown strong enough as a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why. I thought that was weird. Your Noble Phantasm manifests the landscape in your mind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No catalyst is necessary.<br> You simply need to be there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yet you couldn&#39;t use it. That&#39;s because you were waiting for Fujimaru&#39;s growth, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;m well-aware that it&#39;s nosy of me, but there is an order to all things, you see.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want you to become the kind of Master who relies too much on Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fujimaru has grown as a Master.<br> Enough for you to use your Noble Phantasm, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can finally use Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Yes. You&#39;ve done well so far.<br> But first, there&#39;s one more thing you have to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks, but that&#39;s overprotective!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just have to ask you to resign yourself to it.<br> I get too attached to those I like.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> It might look different, but this is still the Greater Grail.<br> The Holy Grail War that happens here...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> Its strongest Servant awaits within.<br> You will defeat it for me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong><br> If you can do that, I&#39;ll have nothing left to teach you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Within...Does he mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...What was it again?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Come on, get a hold of yourself!<br> Berserker!
