Ganu, they said...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Come to think of it, I have records of a Clock Tower mage becoming an apprentice around 1000 AD.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Did they assign someone from a relatively recent time period as liaison?

The Tunguska explosion, otherwise known as the Tungus explosion.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That is correct. It was an explosion that occurred over Tunguska in 1908 A.D.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Back in the day, it was not confirmed to have been an explosion...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But it was a dreadful light.

As such, we felt it prudent to classify it as something other than a Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a Lostbelt either?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. After all, there is no storm wall present.

That is,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> the simultaneous mass summoning of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits that becomes possible by running the Storm Border&#39;s magical furnaces in parallel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In other words, that&#39;s right\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Large Scale Plan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Storming the enemy&#39;s turf with a flood of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits, while keeping them continuously materialized.

It&#39;s actually 150 kilometers away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently at the southern edge of the Special Territory, so to reach Koyanskaya&#39;s signature in the center,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> we&#39;ll have to cross a considerable distance.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...hm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to force our way across using the Border, but this time we need to do more than just get there.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> First, I&#39;d like to get a better grasp of the area...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And if we&#39;re surrounded, why there&#39;s been no hostile responses by now\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Get the picture?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no hostile signatures within the surrounding area. You can bet that I&#39;m constantly sweeping for them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But outside of the Border&#39;s search range, I couldn&#39;t even begin to guess.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We need to send out a separate investigation team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...which means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to gather info about the surrounding area...right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You got it.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> You should also secure additional assets. Who knows if there are any stray Servants out there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Meaning, get out there and get more firepower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep. Gathering intel and securing more assets. We&#39;re back to square one once again.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I said before that the blitz operation would be a test run for our assault on the seventh Lostbelt,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> but at the same time, it would have lessened the burden on everyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unfortunately, that&#39;s no longer possible. I&#39;m really sorry about this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mash, and Ibuki-Douji out on field recon...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course it&#39;ll be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash is with me again this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I may not be receiving power from the Storm Border, but if necessary, I can use the Black Barrel independently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For a moment, I think I can briefly amount to several Servants in firepower.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This time we have Ibuki-Douji with us.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Oh, you mean me?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Ibuki-Douji, Ibuki-Douji...I&#39;ll have to remember that. You&#39;ll have a hundredfold spiritual power with me around!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> A hundredfold spiritual power...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> In other words, the strength of a hundred people! Divine Spirits have a weird way of putting things!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Woah, you scared me!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t load your eyes with such subtle magical energy! It reminds me of the hellish Mystic Eye resistance training I went through!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Is that really something you did...? What kind of training did you do...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s try this again. Commencing the new operation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll gather information about the Special Territory, and invite additional Servants to join us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Not many stray Servants would be able to maintain their existence in this place,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> we don&#39;t know if we can set up a summoning circle, and the Servants we can summon are going to be limited...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like you to seize any chance you get.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll probably be able to perform simple summons for a few minutes at a time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be sure to take the situation, as well as your own limits into account when you fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that\u2014commencing operation!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be careful out there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash!

That is correct.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As you say, Daji was a Beast.

One who slew an evil dragon.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You&#39;re the hero of Kiev!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Nikitich...hmm.

This is as dependable as it gets.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> As expected of a dragon slayer.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...but aren&#39;t you a bit more bloodthirsty than normal? Are you okay? You&#39;re sure you&#39;re not a Berserker?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No worries, she undoubtedly is of the Rider class.

Taigong, Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We are in pursuit of one who we believe to be the monarch of this special territory.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Her name is Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She is the juvenile Beast IV, and possesses the ability to nonchalantly cross the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, her movements have stopped at present for some reason. She remains stationary at the heart of this area.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know the details, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> in the worst case scenario, she may be plotting to emerge into her fully developed form.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We would like to eliminate Koyanskaya before that happens, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So\u2014we would like you to lend us your strength. What do you say?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s the idea.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In fact, I have been waiting for you all to arrive.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Chaldea, I am glad you are a bunch of good-natured folks, just the way I heard it.

Whew!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Are you really going to flatter them out of nowhere, Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hahaha, it&#39;s not flattery, Nikitich. It&#39;s lip service.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what they call flattery?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You won&#39;t get any flattery from me. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Might is everything, that is, if you wish to be a bogatyr of salvation.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Clothes only get in the way.

Shouldn&#39;t she pick one or the other!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then that white wyvern is probably a transformed version of her legendary horse!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be careful, that&#39;s not a normal wyvern! Consider it on the level of a Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Challenging the unreasonable and doing the impossible is what makes a hero!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Now, I challenge you!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> The wingless declare aerial battle impossible, and so on!

As usual, you exaggerate, Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those without wings can no more fly than a lost child can walk, yes?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We&#39;re all adults, so this should be handled accordingly.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unable to fly?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unable to do the impossible?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Then someone should help them, Nikitich.

It&#39;s a lovely Baku!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Right, that&#39;s my Si Bu Xiang. She usually gets like that when things aren&#39;t serious.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong><br> Mo. Mo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Pleased to meet you, Si Bu Xiang.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong><br> Mo. Momo.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My, it&#39;s rare for her to take to humans. I had thought she was much more shy than this,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> but does her personality change as a Noble Phantasm? How very interesting.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Well.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Si Bu Xiang aside for the moment, let me address all of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We have been present in this region well before you arrived.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Of course, as a Heroic Spirit on the side of the Human Order, the objective is to seal off the thing at the center of this domain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We have more detailed knowledge of the area. Please make use of me as a guide.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unfortunately, we were not endowed with any knowledge of Chaldea&#39;s inner workings.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Only that you are an organization resisting on behalf of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The trials you&#39;ve overcome to date. The current state of Chaldea, and knowledge of the six Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t the faintest clue about them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I&#39;d like you to share that intelligence with me first\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would be very much appreciated. We need all the information we can get!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please, whatever you have to share!</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I see. Is that how the Lostbelts have been all this time?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Six in all. The number fits as well. This makes more and more sense.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Things have become far clearer thanks to your knowledge. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Mm, ahem. Now that things are out in the open, it&#39;s somewhat belated...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> but as commanding officer, I feel it necessary to point something out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Fujimaru, and Kyrielight as well, aren&#39;t you both a bit too forthcoming for field investigators?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> &quot;No intel whatsoever&quot; is one thing, but to lay so much of our own bare in so one-sided an exch\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mmph. Mmppthph.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Let&#39;s stop there. Fujimaru and Mash are hardened veterans in this area.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> You want to be able to trust in and have faith in this guy. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll be forthcoming with our secrets without a second thought.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it feels for me. You two are the ones up close and personal with them, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Ah, well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m quite pleased you&#39;ve nibbled onto sharing intelligence, sure.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> &quot;I do have important intel I&#39;d like to present. But only after taking care of some loose ends.&quot;</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s the sort of bargain I had in mind here.

The quickest route there...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> will require crossing an ultra-exceptional unit&#39;s nest.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As the name would imply, an ultra-exceptional unit is...a hostile entity boasting ultra-exceptional combat prowess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It will make those high level units from earlier look like child&#39;s play.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Which means...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Combat is unavoidable.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In order to guarantee your safety once we arrive at the location I mentioned,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I want to preemptively strike this exceptional unit.

Not too sure myself.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AMXK5tc.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let&#39;s summarize, shall we? This time, about the &quot;hostile life forms that exist in this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I believe you have already encountered them, but broadly speaking, there are two types.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Firstly, there are the mass-produced units who are born in succession, as a species.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ones resembling Yaga and Kali may be those...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Those are beings unique to their respective Lostbelts...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, that is true. You called them Yaga and Kali?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I believe you&#39;ve also encountered the giants of Scandinavia, have you not?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These mass-produced units are commonly known as Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Sometimes, rare variants of a higher class do manifest...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But for the most part, you can consider them the rank and file.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, Lost Familiars is a term I came up with on my own. Please feel free to use it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They fall under the category of &quot;species that inhabit this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Next up, you have these ultra-exceptional units formed via recreation! The Ivan recreation we just fought falls under this category.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They fall under the category of &quot;an individual threat, unrelated to any species&quot;...Lost Weapons.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hostile life forms that belong to a species are termed &quot;Lost Familiars&quot; and individual hostile entities are termed &quot;Lost Weapons&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> How about it? Simple enough, no?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So far, there are six familiars and six weapons. Six species and six individuals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I wonder how many of them she intends to collect? There are but seven Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No. That would be unlike her.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyway! We have done all that needs doing here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We should have whittled her forces down.

His fondness for fishing is so well known in China and Japan that his name is associated with anglers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As expected of Taigong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But this time, my job is fox hunting\u2014beast hunting.

It&#39;s not as clear cut as that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I guess this isn&#39;t the time to be modest. Alright, I&#39;m gonna say it!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My usual self is, um...how should I say this?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even manifesting with the Saint Graph of a Grand Caster wouldn&#39;t be odd, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Err.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z5rfLVI.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Seriously?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> What happened?

I wonder if it&#39;s possible to be a Grand Rider as well?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyhow, it&#39;s not something strange. But for some reason, I&#39;m just a normal Rider here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In addition, since I&#39;ve been constantly using fangshu to twist the rules and avoid getting forced out...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My power has been considerably drained. Ah, I&#39;m ashamed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Being so serious about beast hunting... you&#39;re a professional Beast slayer indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Unfortunately, he&#39;s currently manifested in a normal Saint Graph. With that said, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s very reassuring.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No matter the state of my Saint Graph, there&#39;s probably only one thing that the Human Order wants from me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My job this time is to finish off that Beast IV candidate who&#39;s doing as she pleases everywhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm, what a mess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Human Order and Lord Yuanshi Tianzun sure are working me to the bone!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...O-oh.

I&#39;m sure they were there, but I thought it was a machine or...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s a living thing. Or at least, the one we came across in this region was.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The tiger part is living. It even roars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So, basically...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Koyanskaya&#39;s battle strength in this region is essentially made up by what she acquired from the Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Essentially, yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The six species of Lost Familiars are active in small numbers around the patrol routes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The Lost Weapons, who are ultra-exceptional units, exist for base defense and to be dispatched in abnormal situations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was a reproduction of Ivan the Terrible just now, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. He was indeed placed very effectively.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Since they have full control over the leylines, they keep reappearing every time we strike them down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> An inexhaustible supply of Familiars...and you&#39;ve been fighting them all alone?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like being totally surrounded by enemies while deep within their territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m amazed you were able to survive...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s thanks to my speedy escapes, I guess!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Seems like you&#39;re barely scraping by.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m confident in my ability to escape. Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If they&#39;re struck down thoroughly enough, it&#39;ll be fine for a while. It&#39;s not to the extent where we have to lament the futility of fighting them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...But they&#39;re in control of the leylines. It&#39;ll be difficult to set up a summoning circle then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Unfortunately so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> With that said, each location doesn&#39;t have a connection that transmits information to Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They&#39;re also cut off in terms of magical connections. The base&#39;s Lost Weapons are all in a state of complete autonomy.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Much like Koyanskaya...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Basically, we&#39;re unlikely to be noticed unless we&#39;re near the &quot;castle&quot; in the center.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> &quot;Castle&quot;, huh\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I caught a fish!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The unexpected Strong Style!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fishing, you&#39;re just grabbing it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your whole body is soaked! A-are you okay?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No problem.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gzmGgQr.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Bububububububububu.<br> (Water droplets splashing around)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> That will dry me off.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Hahahaha...and I&#39;m soaking as well. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Judging by those ears, Nikichi has to be some type of animal incarnation, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> And she&#39;s adept at shaking herself dry too!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (Oh. You&#39;re cutting in there, Divine Spirit Ibuki-Douji!)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Oho, you&#39;re interested in my ears?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nikitich, um...are you a Beastman?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> (She&#39;s not?)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m not, but my wife was a strong, beautiful she-giant, more beast than man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So those beast ears are your wife&#39;s...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe your Saint Graph reproduces her features?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> That&#39;s so sweet. I wonder if you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit that receives blessings from the love between you two.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see! So that&#39;s why you&#39;re in the form of a woman!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Or it might be, a little.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> O-oh? So your ears and form are indeed because of your wife&#39;s blessing\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Which is it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well then. I have a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What kind of principle is this region employing to force out Heroic Spirits of the Human Order\u2014?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...It would be easy to talk about it here, but I&#39;d like for you to wait a while.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm. And what is your reasoning for that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s necessary for you Chaldeans to receive some prerequisite knowledge.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In order to do that, we need to gain an understanding of this area. Specifically, there are two places I&#39;d like to visit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s easier to show than to explain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And above all \u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, your understanding about Koyanskaya should change a lot.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> At the same time, you should also learn why Nikitich and Ibuki-Douji aren&#39;t forced out as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...Seems like you&#39;re putting on airs, Heroic Spirit Taigong. Or should I say, Grand Candidate Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A presentation should be effective, shouldn&#39;t it? I tend to be particular about those sort of things by nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And well, there really are some things in the world that just can&#39;t be described adequately with words alone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I came to terms with the region myself. How you guys will feel about it though...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure about that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I understand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash. What do you think about his statement?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If there&#39;s something you want to show, I&#39;ll have a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A picture is worth a thousand words, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Hm. Shall we move then?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Alright. But we&#39;ve got to finish eating the fish first.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Let&#39;s bake them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Sorry, Nikitich, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to make smoke.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You can use a technique then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Huh. That&#39;s your reply!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> There was a technique for roasting fish amongst your sage and dao arts, wasn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> The seasoning is perfect! More salt, pepper, and others can be added just by wishing for it.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Fine adjustments can be done as well! I&#39;ve already skewered them all!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, yes...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Wow, that smells great! The fish will be cooked in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How convenient...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So these are sage arts?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh no, it&#39;s actually one of my originals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I quite like fishing, so I thought it would be useful to have a technique that allows me to eat the fish as soon as I catch them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As expected of Taigong, the man associated with anglers\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Ah, that&#39;s a bit embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> The fish is ready. Let&#39;s all eat our share before we leave!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You can&#39;t fight if you&#39;re hungry. Besides, you all look as young as chicks.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> And so you should eat! Hurry and eat!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Eat and make up for the exhaustion in your continuous battles! After that, we bogatyrs go to battle once more!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Y-yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be digging in!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s begin our meal as well then!

It&#39;s rare to find a horse (?) that speaks so fluently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But Chaldea also has one who&#39;s polite and well-spoken.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I see. Being polite is certainly a good thing. Ah. That&#39;s right, Mash.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> My horse is kind of lewd, so watch out for him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> He likes women.

But I wonder...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s just my intuition, but I think that\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s a being that lives rooted in fact, and not in Mystery, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s how it looks to me too.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> It has a grounded feeling for a Phantasmal. In fact, it looks just like part of the food chain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start with the conclusion.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These are not something that originally lived here in Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And they&#39;re nothing like a Phantasmal. They lack any of their usual traits, such as high magical energy.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, they are the most common creature in this territory. There is nothing here to prey upon them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An apex predator...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are forming a pack.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Small groups of them come together to form a large herd.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In this canyon alone, let&#39;s see...several hundred of them belong to a single herd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In this environment?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s odd. I don&#39;t know if they eat meat, plants, or both, but there doesn&#39;t appear to be any feeding grounds nearby.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is just a colony.

Your guess was correct, as expected.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both the war-beasts and the Dead Zones are for the purpose of killing mankind.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The question is, why is this the case?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In a completely blanked world, where the Russian Lostbelt has disappeared,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> this land of Tunguska is still full of life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This two-faced Special Territory, existing similarly to a Lostbelt while being completely different.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A land overflowing with unknown plants and animals exulting life. A wasteland of endless battles slaughtering life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And generally speaking, a grotesque biosphere that doesn&#39;t recognize any existence related to the Human Order, and refuses any connection to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A world that despises humanity despite not rejecting them, but also overflowing with violence against them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What is this place, exactly?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Allow me to state my conclusion. There can be no mistake, this place is\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014somebody&#39;s inner world. A Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> (Chewing happily)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A Reality Marble...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...the ultimate achievement in magecraft.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A superlative magecraft technique creating another world inside the real one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The effect varies depending on the user. But it allows things normally impossible in reality to occur, as a commonality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits sometimes use them as Noble Phantasms, but magically speaking, their value is absurd!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Somebody&#39;s inner world. The embodiment of their mentality.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Without a doubt, another world apart from the one we know.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is what this place is.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The world\u2014of Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A paradise safe from outsiders...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A hell of human-killing weapons walking the earth...</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gDQNGMZ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If this is how her spirit is...if it is what shapes this world, then...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFSG5Az.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Refutal of the existence of mankind, and scathing cynicism towards civilization.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The hypothesis makes sense if you take into account what Koyanskaya&#39;s said and done up to now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Your conclusion is probably the correct one. But there&#39;s still another question to answer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Normally, a Reality Marble can&#39;t be maintained for a long period of time, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Were it used in the real world, that would be the case. But there are ways around that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When it&#39;s deployed inside the body of a single being!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The whole Special Territory, the outer shell included, is most likely Koyanskaya herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She extended her Saint Graph ad infinitum, and enshrined herself within the old Tunguska forest area.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see...that make sense.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> For a while, I thought this was a variant of a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In any case, we&#39;d be better off thinking of this as a Reality Marble from here on.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> After all, the theme is far too consistent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> On the one hand, abundant life!<br> On the other, boundless carnage!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And both of them rejecting humanity!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...far too straightforward for a Singularity using a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way that vixen would be so up-front about her wishes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And it&#39;s too unnatural to be reached as a what-if history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I have to object to that one. If it is an alternate history, then there should be one without humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If that is the case though, it still doesn&#39;t account for the arbitrary Dead Zones.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...good guess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ll prove why I think it&#39;s so unnatural. Please think back, everybody.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you recall the animals you saw at the canyon in the Life Zone?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXHO3i3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The new species, parents and children\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MUzpv2j.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those were not parents and children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Siblings.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All life here is related, in a manner of speaking. The insects, animals, plants, even the war-beasts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The plants...and the war-beasts...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Miss Da Vinci. You still can&#39;t perform a genetic analysis, can you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, we don&#39;t have any real equipment, so that&#39;s to be expected. Wait. Wait a second here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Are you saying you can do that yourself? Unassisted?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hahaha...well, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing, you see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I had a lot of time to kill before meeting you all, and so I made use of many fangshu.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I can say this definitively, okay?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OByH2a8.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZzBJ92e.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The creatures of this world don&#39;t interbreed. Not the animals, not the plants, and not the war-beasts.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They don&#39;t grow, they don&#39;t accumulate experiences, their genes don&#39;t intermingle, and they don&#39;t evolve.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All the organisms in this realm are...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Siblings, born from a single mother.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We have observational and collected data, on everything!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Reproductive organs are visible! Like on the fish from before...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They&#39;re just for show.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But there is a life cycle itself. One called the food chain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Birth, life, death.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Eat and be eaten, kill and be killed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The difference is\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> All the life comes from just one source: Koyanskaya, ruler of this territory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Everything, everything here is created in a fixed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The same natural cycle of the food chain.The same cycle of brutal, violent slaughter.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both of them are equally the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nothing more than what is created by Koyanskaya, and what eventually returns to her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This world is definitively in a closed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In some ways...even moreso than a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aWJgice.png" alt=""></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Even if that&#39;s the case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> These animals and plants have lives, don&#39;t they...?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, they most certainly do.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Philosophically speaking, I couldn&#39;t say. But from a purely biological standpoint,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> all the organisms in this Special Territory have lives of their own.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are alive. Therefore death also exists here, and the cycle of life and death continues.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But as for right now\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They have no egos or sense of self.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Like I said earlier, I had a lot of time to kill, and I can assure you I&#39;ve tested it many times.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They have no ego. They have no self.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I suppose that means that there&#39;s no need for life that grows, evolves, or inherits traits from before.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> At the very least, for the shadow of Daji\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014for Koyanskaya, the ruler of this territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;ve called her a &quot;shadow&quot; several times now.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Her scent is a little different from Daji herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya is an alter ego of Daji, the Golden White Face. A bunrei subvariant,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> or perhaps an exaggerated form of her as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> My word. What was she thinking when she built this world...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No egos or sense of self...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8XNK6QZ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It all...somehow makes sense again...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But if this is a Reality Marble, then that would be the case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Regardless of how twisted it is to us, if this is how she perceives the world deep down,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> that&#39;s the way her mental landscape would be shaped.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...that being the case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can&#39;t deny the possibility that Koyanskaya will do something outside of the information we&#39;ve collected up to this point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is a Reality Marble, after all. The laws of the natural world mean nothing here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After we rendezvous, we&#39;ll join forces and make our way to where she is at the center, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Be on guard, right?

Where are you on that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably a chant. There&#39;s definitely magical energy in his voice and words.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m not well-versed in the sage arts, or in ideological magecraft, but I can tell he&#39;s invoking some crazy stuff!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> I-I&#39;ll say. I heard him mention something about the Xians!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He proclaimed himself as such. He&#39;s declared himself a Xian-class made manifest into the present world!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Xian?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Xians are...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> if memory serves me, Divine Spirits of Chinese mythology?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Gods themselves, rather than Divine Spirits\u2014In other words, like the Norse Skadi or the Twelve Gods of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A higher-order existence that belies mighty Mystery, endowed with an overwhelming Saint Graph higher than any other spiritual level.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Really? Taigong&#39;s bringing out the big guns!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...Mm, Hmm. I should say so. From my viewpoint, it&#39;s no surprise.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If Taigong&#39;s adventures in &quot;Investiture&quot; are true, then he is a man with combat strength on par with a Xian!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> He killed Gao Youqian, a later Grand Marshal of the Four Sages, with a single blow. He even defeated Wen Zhong, strongest sage of the Shang Dynasty.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Wow! Taigong&#39;s image seemed a lot more like a military strategist...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Where he uses tactics, he&#39;s famed for his strategies. As a Daoshi, a prodigal on the level of a Xian.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If so, it&#39;s most reassuring. But I still think his chant is at least a little alarming!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since despite having a connection there, it&#39;s a declaration upon the highest mythological existence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To me, that sounds like a pretty risky chant. Is this normal for him?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It might mean he has to push himself this far to subdue Daji!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> !</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Adz1Xn.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014I stand on earth as the embodiment of Yuxu!\u2014I stand on earth as one who executes the divine investiture!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014Come.

There&#39;s no question she was the Golden White Face, true?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Undoubtedly so, she was a thousand-year fox spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Lady N\xFCwa had decreed a hasty eradication for the Shang, but that demon went on to torment the people according to her evil nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The beast fatale, a powerful and ferocious thing bearing nine tails. For that was Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Then I came here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I was certain the reason for my coming to this world was to eradicate the beast fatale.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> To consign the shadow of Daji to death, in accordance with Lady N\xFCwa&#39;s wishes from the Empyrean realm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or so, I had come to earnestly think\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What other purpose was there!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you mean,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tamamovitch is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> not a Tamamo...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you recall hearing from Tamamo-no-Mae herself that she isn&#39;t Daji.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hm?

The Director seems to have settled down, so shall we move on?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s straighten things out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Firstly, we are certain\u2014she is not some alter ego or bunrei of Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nor anything along the lines of a figure exaggerated to the height of a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I am adamant on that point. Despite that, and towering over these facts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Koyanskaya is imitating the Golden White Face, that much is certain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We have enough on which to base this, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> We&#39;re counting on you this time, Heroic Spirit Taigong. This is no place to formulate a plan on shaky grounds.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let me try to redeem myself for that mistake. Yes, my arrival should somewhat be evidence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Her personality and behavior, the differences in effect my arts had on her. Not to mention,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> the tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> And what a tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> (Shaking)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Speaking first of the amount of magical energy in her possession, it&#39;s strange for her not to have already reached a mature form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The alter ego and familiars we&#39;ve fought have made use of that much power.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yet she has not yet reached maturity. But why is that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Because the model case for her self-evolution is the Golden White Face, whose nine-tailed form is her ideal body\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Therein is my rationale.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Oho...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aiming to be the new nine-tails...Yes, that might be convincing reasoning.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...On top of that, and this is just a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The tails she collected could very well be the Lostbelts themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagas or Kalis could&#39;ve stood in as tails?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She used the Lostbelts to gather her tails?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The process of turning the life forms of the Lostbelts into her familiars would render each existence\u2014every piece of foreign intelligence into tails.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Wh-What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We might be jumping the gun here. Would you care to explain?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it seemed from the alter ego, with a ludicrous mass to her Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> From what I could tell, it currently weighs hundreds of thousands of tons. A mass like a gargantuan monster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A giant monster...!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s not so easy to gauge at a glance, like power from the amount of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But that mass is her weight of existence!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it possible that she&#39;s been extracting the information of the six Lostbelts via her Lost Familiars, making it into tails, and expanding?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Six Lostbelts?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We counted five tails before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you&#39;re talking about the alter ego that emerged at Olympus, it wouldn&#39;t be so strange for it to have five tails.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Her main body may still only have five tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> One of them was lost in Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fight at Britain&#39;s Lake District.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Since Muramasa said that one of the spiritual cores was destroyed there by M\xE9lusine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Although, even with the Beast Saint Graph...it stands that her growth stage had already reached the count of six tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Still, these assumptions notwithstanding...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A Saint Graph of so huge a mass will takeproportionate effort to utterly kill and burn out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s equivalent to destroying six Lostbelts, but it will take spending a good amount of resources.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hrm...so we need firepower of that degree?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;m disappointed we haven&#39;t finished the Excalibur Cannon. I even prepared new sunglasses for the occasion...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;ve only now noticed?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Your expression looks strangely better, Taigong. Could it be you still have a card yet to play?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Say it, Taigong.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re afraid to reveal anything after you made such a terrible blunder.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Even so, I think you should reveal anything you&#39;ve kept secret!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I-I&#39;d hate for you to talk about me like some kind of schemer...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Yes. Yes, I do, after a fashion!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There&#39;s definitely a way to stop Koyan!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Wow, there is!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If you have the means, then it&#39;s uplifting!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I was honestly conflicted since she can generate unlimited war-beasts and Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s turned out that she can mobilize them one after the other, right? In such a situation...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Continuing to head for the center of the territory will only play into her hands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I honestly wondered if we should abandon that strategy, and considered leaving the territory with all our power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That made me hesitate\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Morningstar! Reset the Border&#39;s course for the center of the territory!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Already laid in! I knew that would be in line with your habits, Commander!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...No, hold on. Wait first for your commander&#39;s orders before you act, all right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As for me, I don&#39;t want to run away from this. I need to go to Koyanskaya&#39;s castle.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The first Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm was a total dud, and the second not much better.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But I promise, I will lead you to the solution!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is a way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Mm. If you say as such openly, can we rely on you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Please leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I removed certain properties of the Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm based on targeting Daji&#39;s shadow...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But there are countermeasures for any monster, no matter how mighty or huge beyond reckoning!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s still a juvenile body. There are ways to plan for it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even if you don&#39;t know what it is, measures and countermeasures are always possible.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Though, I don&#39;t know for sure how well it will work\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014the means are there.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="serious-face-serious-face" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#serious-face-serious-face" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Serious face!

Farewell, humans.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Truth be told\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I am a little surprised.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You are aware that you&#39;re inside a Reality Marble, right? I can spawn as many familiars and as many beasts as I see fit.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> In fact, I did just that. And you all had no other choice but to scamper away.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The difference in strength between us is as clear as a financial statement. The fact that you boldly waltzed in here regardless means\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> That you&#39;re here to show off some fresh idea?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No, no. First comes gratitude.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Thank you for starting this with a dialogue. And we too are surprised.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Of course, we are surprised that you&#39;re here to converse with us like this. But also surprised by PB&#39;s existence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> To think you would create an entity capable of human speech in this domain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I figured that you\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That you loathe everything about humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes. That I do. However, disgust and appreciation are entirely separate matters.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> They will receive some respect from me, regardless of what lies inside, so long as the business they conduct is satisfactory.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, such a case is extremely uncommon. Hence, PB.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I would also like to thank you for conversing with him as an equal.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> PB happens to be a favorite of mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (An extremely uncommon case...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (I wonder who that is...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (It&#39;s hard to imagine it, but I am curious...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fooufoou...)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> An extremely uncommon case, is it? I see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s rather disappointing that I&#39;m not this person, Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh my\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Have you come to refer to me as Koyanskaya? I could&#39;ve sworn you were using another woman&#39;s name to refer to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I must have unwittingly insulted you.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Taigong L\xFC Shang formally offers his apologies, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, dear\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Those heartfelt words of apology are touching indeed. However\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> As one hand reaches out to me, the other reaches for the gun hidden behind you, am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> For that is how humans hunt. For that is the hidden nature of man. Isn&#39;t that right, Mister Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is no hidden nature. To miscall one is to disrespect them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have heard that a fellow Chinese hero committed this same folly before, though he was of a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I cannot speak on his behalf...but we truly have given you a hard time.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...very well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I accept your apology. Courtesy is one of the few virtues that humans possess.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> No matter what may come after this, I will not desecrate the dead.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> One of our few virtues. That may be so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We humans may have reigned as primates on this planet, but the cost of maintaining our culture and civilization is beyond imagination.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We snuff out many lives just by living and going about our business.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If monsters consuming far beyond the speed of their own reproduction are to be humanity&#39;s true nature. If that is to be our sin...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> then the virtues brought about by civilization, society, and cultural exchange are far too small in comparison.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes. Those few accomplishments hardly make up for that true nature.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Apes who transformed their ecosphere from a circle of circulation into one of consumption...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> No, that would be an insult to apes. As far as they are concerned, humanity may as well be alien life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You who feel guilt towards the higher order of animals that call this planet home, yet mark them for consumption all the same without exception.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...well, the fact that the opposite is also true is what makes humanity incorrigible though...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> They truly are loathsome, considering both their virtues and vices.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Seeing how you&#39;ve traversed this world, I&#39;m sure you already know.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The reason I exist?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of what I do behind the Alien God&#39;s back while I supported its invasion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You long for humanity&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Fufu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want to witness the extinction of humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh, spot-on\u2606</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> My objective, my ideal, is without a doubt the &quot;total annihilation of humanity&quot;.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But if I were asked whether I wish to annihilate them with my own hands, I would say no.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the hard work to the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I could not care less about Pan-human History and the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I simply want to watch and enjoy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> A swarm of conceited, paltry egos screaming, whimpering, and floundering\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Being whittled away without ever achieving anything, until the last of them dies in tears.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> To see that with my own eyes is my wish. Aesthetics, shall we call it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> After all, I wouldn&#39;t be able to make an assessment otherwise, would I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of how empty, small, and revolting the last thing humanity leaves behind is.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Creatures who will expire in a few millennia despite gaining wonderful technologies and knowledge.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Multiplying without caring for their brethren, without healing the earth\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> An ecosphere where the ignorant strong ultimately trample on the ignorant weak.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I will record its final moments and put it on auction for everyone else in this universe.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> &quot;Just how much worth does this civilization have?&quot;</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it just exciting? I wonder what its final price will be?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> A trillion? A hundred million? Ten thousand? A thousand? No, I can only hope to get any value out of it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> In the end, trash is trash. Is there someone who would pay even a single yen for it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Stare silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Silently bite lip)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...H-Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good grief, this is\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Aha!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> From what I&#39;ve heard, you&#39;re an extremely heartless fiend.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I thought I could find common ground with you after seeing what life was like in the Life Zone,</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> But you&#39;re just\u2014just\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> How do I say this? You&#39;re just mocking the failures of others, hu\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> No, I won&#39;t say that. In any case! Even a starving dragon has better things to do!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...who is this person?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m a bogatyr of Kiev. I came here to save the land of Russia.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> And I&#39;m Ibuki-Douji. I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, have I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Thank you for the courtesy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I did check, but it was too much of a hassle to ask for each name, so that helped.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Mister Taigong. And dignitaries of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Shall we wrap up our conversation here?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I am tired after what happened with Cernunnos, but you played nice with PB, so...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I was touched by that, and so I ended up playing along with this conversation.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But this is as far as that goes.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It is true that our relationship thus far has been that of &quot;friends&quot;, but let&#39;s end that here too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Friends...how come?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh dear...to think you hadn&#39;t realized.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Your priority is to excise the Fantasy Trees. My priority is to collect life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> We were never enemies.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I was living it up in the Lostbelts as a tourist. In that regard, we are cut from the same cloth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> But not this time. You all came to this world to kill me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Words were unnecessary from the start. That peculiar Heroic Spirit over there threw me off pace, but...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Humans should be as humans.Beasts should be as beasts.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Let us slaughter one another without any mutual understanding, shall we?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> You had plenty of opportunities to escape.You had plenty of time to learn your lesson.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Is it barbarism or arrogance? In either case, that was a bad call for those calling themselves primates.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It will no doubt be a fitting end for ones who have erred repeatedly like you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I shall only respond to ephemeral actions with ephemeral games.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Oh\u2014there is no need to cry out the Beast&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> For it is out of spite that I name myself before humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...magical energy levels, rising rapidly!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is where the real deal begins.

Implosion.Defiled remains that warped space and time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That is how this beast came to be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not due to legend, not due to history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But a conglomeration of prayers and roars begotten by disasters, nature, and man.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A Nature Spirit entirely unrelated to the Human Order despite possessing a natural Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The disaster that befell this land triggered her genesis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She smiles a wicked smile amidst the flames, with that unsightly form of hers. The Saint Graph composed of screams and anguish felt pleasant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same. It&#39;s all the same. Death by disaster and death by plunder, it&#39;s all the same.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014It&#39;s just all so fun. The beast smiled as a matter of course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The voices of the animals who continue to fall prey to man were like raindrops washing the filth off her body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Humans don&#39;t keep their promises. They never do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Killing in the name of survival, using it to live. All of it is so that a better cycle may be established.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The animals born on this planet were aware of it from birth, as inhabitants of this planet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That this is the way nature works. That the longer a species lasts, the more life they consume.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But humans have forgotten that promise. They have forgotten their responsibility.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Of all things\u2014they coexisted with animals for purposes unrelated to the advancement of their species.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Then, for what purpose?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For what reason did the earth suffer such bloodshed?For what reason did so many species go extinct?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no answer. Of course there isn&#39;t. Humans never had any semblance of a purpose in the first place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> She feels no anger. Neither does she feel any sorrow.This Saint Graph was borne of a disaster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There is no point siding with either humans or animals.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, she did feel it was awfully inexcusable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Coexistence not for the sake of proliferation, but for the sake of happiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Procreation not for the sake of preserving the species, but to share joy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Cherishment. As a living being, that love is a paradoxical one.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In nature, love is what those who nurture their offspring possess.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But, for the beast\u2014for me, emotions nurtured for the sake of rapture are nothing short of incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You who have scarred the earth. You, borne of an earth cleansed of life.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;O beast of curses.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Those who rejoice at your birth may be few.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;However,&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;you may at least have a name.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yaskaya.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Did someone name me?Or was it a name I gave myself?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ya...skaya...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yan...skaya?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Koyanskaya. Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Koyanskaya\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I understood, at that moment, that these feelings were evil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They defy the law of nature. It is still too early for life to possess them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even a divine being would fail to rein in these feelings.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> These feelings will surely warp all life born on this planet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just as there were humans who loved animals,and were felled by those same animals.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Just as there was a god who loved humans,yet was renounced by those same humans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014I see. Then I shall take on that form.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In 2017, the seat of the fourth was vacated, and so I incarnated in its place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If to cherish is to be evil, then I shall abide by that logic as an Evil myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I shall follow in the footsteps of the god who was once denied that love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Without a biological father, without a biological mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nothing to inherit from a father, nor born from a mother, I became a solitary existence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To what end?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014To understand true love, of course. A mother&#39;s love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, I lack a mate. On this planet, my existence is one of a kind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therefore\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I decided to adopt children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I travelled the Lostbelts, rounding up grotesque children befitting the grotesque me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The children I adopted were brought into my tails where they would offer up their souls and genes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It did not come naturally to me. It was based on a legend handed down to this Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;The nine-tailed fox gave birth to many lives from its tails. Evil spirits from all over Japan were born in that moment.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A legend of one endowed with the traits of a beast, just like me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A nine-tailed beast. A Golden White Face.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I imitated its nature. I decided to obtain nine tails and nine children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, I was particular about the children I chose. They must not be from a land dominated by the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> For I do not belong to the Human Order. Because I reject humanity\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Therefore, neither should my children be a part of human history.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I looked to the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Worlds far removed from the Human Order, living yet dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Grotesque creatures that can only live in such worlds are the ones worthy of becoming my children.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The first.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The second.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The third.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The fourth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The fifth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014The sixth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I birthed many lives using the information I acquired as their basis.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Before I knew it, a forest had formed.Before I knew it, a river had formed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They will not be killed by humans.For not a single human will be born here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They have no need of an ego.They have no need of self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Under the guidance of the law of the jungle, within the ceaseless circle of life,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> the animals will live as they will, then die, then live, then die and then live\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And someday\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> May I\u2014</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Ooohhhhh!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong></p><h4 id="i-can-do-this" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-can-do-this" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I.

There&#39;s no doubt that Koyanskaya is a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The fact that she&#39;s an Alter Ego is proof of that, since they&#39;re modelled after a &quot;different aspect&quot; of a preexisting Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That is, of course, assuming Taigong is correct. Though I do believe he&#39;s certain of it, considering he&#39;s made this sort of assertion...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Well, I guess I am.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is the answer I grasped from the spiritual core of her Saint Graph. It was a technique with plenty of irksome activation conditions,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> but I did manage to trigger it. I mean, it scared the daylights out of me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, Fujimaru was the one who gave me the final hint.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did I do something...?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...since when did you take up magecraft?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It&#39;s called fangshu. You could also refer to it as sage arts.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is rather unlike Western magecraft in terms of versatility. It requires a lot of effort, but depending on how you set it up, well. You see,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> quite a lot of things can be done with it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Huh. Like eavesdropping on a lady&#39;s secrets?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I had a look at your true nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Let&#39;s give you an example, Miss Koyanskaya. You\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> don&#39;t give a damn about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Heh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...w-wait. That can&#39;t be right.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That atypically savage cruelty! It is a show of sadistic obsession with humanity!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I-If she doesn&#39;t give a damn, then why would she...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s precisely because she couldn&#39;t care less that it becomes a routine for her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure she does hate and loathe humanity. But not to the extent that she will act personally to cause human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She will mess with it, at best...of course, that in itself will result in a lot of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But when push comes to shove, finding amusement in witnessing humanity&#39;s downfall is all the interest in it she can muster.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s because the truth is that she couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...s-so what&#39;s the truth? What do you have to say for yourself, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Oh dear, giving us the silent treatment?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Grngh.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014In 1908 AD, a massive explosion occurred in the Tunguska forest zone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Light and heat came as a result of the great explosion. A shockwave. Those final moments that came all too suddenly...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure there must have been animals who believed it was gunfire brought about by human hands.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But the truth of it was that their lives were snuffed out by that explosion.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Those grudges against humanity simmering deep within you. They are, simply put, residual thoughts that clung to you...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nothing more than a texture.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That is why you cannot bring yourself to be serious about human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Anyone who lays eyes on this ecosphere will understand what you long for.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You have something that takes precedence over human annihilation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you understand it too, don&#39;t you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s probably because of that incompatibility\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Honestly. The Human Order&#39;s Counter Force, I take it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I have perused the records of the Seventh Singularity. It was truly repugnant.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It had the gall to prepare all these Heroic Spirits to use against me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Or is that diversity, by any chance, Pan-human History&#39;s greatest asset?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, I do feel sorry about that. After all, it has been over 10,000 years.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We have all the right people in the right places on our side. A whole assemblage of specialists to ward off calamities.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It would appear so. I was on the receiving end of that, and I lost.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Good grief. I suppose I reap what I sow and am getting my just deserts. My fault for incurring a needless curse and dragging my feet.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I knew that if I wanted to kill you all, I would&#39;ve had to do it in person.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...oh well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve suffered a loss or anything. So I hold no regrets and feel no bitterness over that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...the fourth Beast.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Now that Primate Murder is no longer with us, I figured I&#39;d be able to take root as the fourth Beast,</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> but that turned out to be an ephemeral dream.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Could it be that this planet has it out for me?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I yearned to be a Beast, but I couldn&#39;t make it. My dreams were shattered and I ended up being trampled by all you fine people from Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m about to lose it with all this frustration and wrath\u2661</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Alrighty. Now that it&#39;s come to this, I guess I&#39;ll self-destruct and blow up the whole territory\u2606</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Woah, woah, woah! That&#39;s bad news! You may be saying it cutely, but I know you&#39;re serious, Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This woman is the type of lady who embodies the spirit of dragging everyone down with her!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If I may offer a suggestion\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Shall we put an end to this? This Beast candidate and Alien God apostle business. All of it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This hounding Chaldea and human history business too. We&#39;ll put it all behind us.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I hereby propose a third option, one that does not demand the death or extinction of either party.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I invite you to accept this, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> After all, you couldn&#39;t care less about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Do you not think it&#39;s absurd to stake your life over something you couldn&#39;t care less about?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...I see. You have a point.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> Old man!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> N-N-No, that&#39;s not what I meant. I am definitely not referring to how my feelings have changed or anything!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I simply came to this conclusion as a result of valuing my own life! The entirety of this domain is Koyanskaya, is it not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> If she self-destructs, we&#39;d have nowhere to run! In that case, reconciliation ought to be a viable path!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Besides\u2014besides,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...this is not a Lostbelt. It&#39;s not a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Our interests aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. There&#39;s no reason why we ought to be killing each other...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to come to blows...if we can settle this through dialogue.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru? No, young Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Not a ruthless magus by birth, but an ordinary person bearing a heavy burden forced upon him by circumstances.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> You, of all people, should understand this...probably...far better than anyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014Director Gordolf\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Yes...Yes!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Hnn. I get it, Goffie.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Waging a war to pulverize the enemy can be such a pain in the ass!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> There must&#39;ve been a better way to phrase that!That just now was probably one of the three high points of my life, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Sorry, sorry. Looks like being straightforward isn&#39;t a strong point of mine.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> But I was serious about that, okay?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> The effort outweighs the reward, and all that remains are piles of corpses and rivers of blood. That&#39;s what a war of eradication is, no?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> That&#39;s what this proposal is, avoiding it, right? I didn&#39;t say anything wrong, did I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> \u2014Now this is a surprise.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Although I believe His Excellency Gordolf harbors double or even triple the grudge against me, does he not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I do! The mistakes I made at Chaldea, the countless crimes you committed! I will never forget them!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But that is irrelevant! I will punish myself for my own foolishness!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And you can settle your sins on your own!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> How cold of you. You were third-rate to the very end, Your Excellency.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I speak of you as a magus, of course.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Well, losers can&#39;t be choosers. Do what you will, whether that&#39;s killing me or sealing me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It&#39;s a half measure, either way. Even if you get rid of me, a second and a third\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No. I&#39;m telling you we have a third option in store.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Pan-human History is cruel, that is a fact. There&#39;s never enough tickets to board the ship.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I have a good eye for this, so I&#39;m well aware of all that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Chaldea has no other path except that of killing these nonexistent lost probabilities, then moving forward.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> But that does not apply here. That is because your world does not belong in human history to begin with.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s right, you really ought to accept my proposal.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> There is no need to kill each other. It&#39;s a simple matter.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t get it. I have already planted my roots in Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> It is the cradle for my eclosion into a mature Beast, and it will remain immobile once it has been laid out. Until I eclose.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Yet here I am. Utterly defeated.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> As long as I don&#39;t reach maturity, I cannot move a single inch from here.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The Human Order. Pan-human History. Even if you reclaim those silly things...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> This world of mine, sitting in a corner of Siberia, may cause an error in the restoration of the Human Order and get in your way, you know?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> ...Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That makes sense. As for the details of reclaiming and restoring Pan-human History,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> there is room for argument. However, that remark of hers remains a possibility we cannot deny.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> So what do we do? Should I lop her head off, after all?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Should we pull a do-or-die move and try beheading her?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Hmm, did you not get the message? I meant this girl&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> If my Master orders me to behead her, then I\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s head.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Taigong, didn&#39;t you say you can do something?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> You heard him. Calm yourself, Dragon!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> ...fiiine.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Wait a minute, you&#39;re up and about already? You&#39;re a tough one, Nikichi.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nikitich, what about your injuries\u2014</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> You see, Mash used the salve that was in her shield on Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong><br> Mo. Mo.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> Heheh, she&#39;s pissed.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> But that&#39;s what I like about you, big sis Ibuki.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> If I may, folks\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This world is a Reality Marble\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> These are sceneries shaped by your mindscape, Koyan.

I see, that is indeed a possibility...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So why not elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014That&#39;s right. Elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> A place not of this planet.

That sounds about right!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> This is the third option I am proposing. To temporarily freeze her in space and time, then launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Needless to say, we will set the technique such that it will automatically undo the space-time freeze once you have reached a safe haven!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> No, no, hold on just a minute! What are you prattling on about? Space-time freezing and space travel and\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Especially the former.

Common sense dictates that having an entire swath of land travel through space is impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> However, this is a Reality Marble. In the end, it is but the inner world of one life form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So, what does this imply?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That if we stop this forced expansion towards the surface occurring at this moment, and revert it back down to its original, humanoid size...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I&#39;m certain the mass itself won&#39;t change. But the size is, well, crucial.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless, it is beyond my power to launch her into space like this.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll tinker with this space a little and shrink her down further. Down to palm size, to be more specific.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> And then I&#39;ll launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Now, about the space-time freeze, the fact that this is a Reality Marble works to our advantage.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Rather than meddle with space and time itself, we will merely slow the processes of a singular life form down to their utmost limit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> We will have her enter a state that is similar to a space-time freeze!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> What do you say, Miss Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> What do I...\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Humanity will, of course, be nonexistent beyond this planet.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Humanity will be nonexistent, but you are free to either aim for Beasthood or expand your own world.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Or you can be a little braver and bestow your children with self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The problem right now is that the planet&#39;s atmosphere is encircled by the branches of the Fantasy Trees\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case, we just have to open up the sky.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes. Please do so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In other words...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We will cut down the Fantasy Trees and restore the Human Order, prime the timing for just ahead of the Human Order restoration,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> and launch this world into space during that process\u2014Right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Spot-on! Now then\u2014shall we begin?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Hold on a minute here! Hold on, hold on, I said hold on! I&#39;m being left behind as a spectator again!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Space-time freeze!? Space travel!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> And we&#39;re not launching a rocket or a space shuttle, but a whole Reality Marble into space!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> That&#39;s a funny joke you&#39;ve got there...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Or not! Calm down, ladies and gentlemen!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Even if you shrink her down, that&#39;s little more than window dressing! Taigong himself has said that her mass wouldn&#39;t change!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> The sheer energy it would require to launch an area of this scale into space! If reaching another celestial body is the objective here, you&#39;d need light-speed travel!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Even a generous donation of three magical energy cores from the Storm Border wouldn&#39;t be enough to cover it, alright!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is possible. There is a precedent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Would you all happen to be familiar with the story of Noah?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Noah...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You know, the one with the ark...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> Oh, so close! I&#39;m so close but I can&#39;t put my finger on it!

Even if it should prove impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless, I will require your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> I will require you to stay put as I cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> How does that sound, Miss Koyanskaya? Will you accept this proposal?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...of course I won&#39;t. Have you gone mad?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I don&#39;t give a damn if you&#39;d like to wallow in narcissism and self-pity, but don&#39;t drag me into it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I still have a means of dragging you all down with me. If accepting your silly proposal is all I have left, I&#39;d much rather play that card.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No. You&#39;ll accept, Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Because this transaction will benefit both sides, right?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> ...Jeez, I must&#39;ve cozied myself up to your rabble a bit too much. I would&#39;ve never guessed you&#39;d take advantage of my sole principle.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Very well. I&#39;ll go along with that plan.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> The first Beast lies beyond dialogue.The second Beast lies beyond parting.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> And the fourth Beast will find a mutual answer, without ever taking up arms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> \u2014Congratulations, you have successfully subdued a Beast. This fox&#39;s tail lies tucked between her legs.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> Of course, that&#39;s done with great reluctance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I must once again ask you to channel your magical energy into me\u2014as much as you can muster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Take all of it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> OK, give it your best shot!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> Rejoice, Taigong! For I will applaud you while we&#39;re at it!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> I&#39;m just basing this on my gut instinct here, but this is one of those techniques that&#39;ll make you go splat if you fail, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Ahaha. How sharp of you! I&#39;ll be counting on everyone&#39;s support.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong><br> Leave it to me, mysterious slit-eyed man!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Eh~...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine.

Why did you choose to spare me?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong><br> I am not the Golden White Face.I am not the Evil you fell for.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yes, that is indeed most disappointing.

It is true that she did loathe humanity,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> so I used that as a starting point and, well, I cajoled her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Still, truth be told, she didn&#39;t seem like she cared much for humanity, did she?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Both in words and actions.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> As for her not caring, that is the truth and yet an untruth, both a lie and a fact...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She loathed humanity, and in fact, she had been looking forward to its extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Nevertheless.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Considering her history\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> she must have loved them, in truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> People. Humans. Humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> No matter how many forests they burn, no matter how many species that drive to extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Even if she should conclude that our existences are incompatible, the primates known as humanity...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> are no more than a species that lives among nature. One that she loves.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...and there are animal species that seek to deepen their bonds with humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> She did not deny that, she did not pluck that away either. And she did not ignore that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> In other words, she loved humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> ...and that makes her grudge all the more fierce. Her words and deeds longing for the ruination of humanity are nothing less than indisputable truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> The existence of the Dead Zone, an aggregation of hatred and bloodlust directed at humanity. The acquisition of her aptitude for human slaughter and the manifestation of her authority.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> They are all genuine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You do remember, don&#39;t you? She had even grown great horns indicative of her status as a fully developed Beast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She did have those horns\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s right. We did confirm the formation of large horns on her head.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Nod silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Thus, we can conclude this!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> \u2014Koyanskaya harbors a love for humanity within her!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Yet at the same time! She also harbors hatred and bloodlust! To the point she herself has grown sick of humanity!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoou...!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> Love in spite of hatred. That dichotomy is by no means uncommon.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> It is not one exclusive to Beasts, for we humans often possess the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong><br> You may or may not be aware of it though.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Beasts we have encountered so far...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> have at least had such an inclination.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying that Koyanskaya</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> no longer wished to hate anymore?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No longer wished to hate\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.

And so it was that she left L\xFC Shang.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Thus the days went by\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And the Shang dynasty, no longer favored by the heavens, collapsed. When the Zhou dynasty rose in its place, L\xFC Shang</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> was granted Qi as his fiefdom for his meritorious achievements as a tactician of the Zhou.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then his former wife appeared before him and sought reconciliation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> L\xFC Shang then poured water from a bowl and said this,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Return this water to its bowl. If you can do this, we shall reconcile.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Needless to say, the spilt water won&#39;t ever go back into its bowl\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That which has passed will never return.What a heart-rending story.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> What actually happened?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well, about that\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hahaha.

Festivals?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Do you perhaps mean those?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The bogatyr Dobrynya Nikitich won&#39;t be coming back anymore, and since we have no choice but to consider him dead,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> we must wed his young wife, who continues to wait for him, to a new husband. Not content with making such an absurd proclamation,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> they even went as far as to plan a wedding resembling a grand festival!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Do you mean those accursed and abominable things!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> No. That would be strange. Jeez, how far back are we talking?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But wait, hold on.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The hero has set out indeed this time. To save the Human Order, or rather, to save the land of Russia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hm? Heroic Spirits...don&#39;t leave the Throne entirely, do they?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh well. Umm, the point is\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In which case...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not again. Another incident with Nikitich&#39;s wife while he&#39;s away!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Repeating the same thing over and over. What are you even getting at?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Good grief. I&#39;ll be damned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nonetheless...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If Russia is in danger, I must save it, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nikitich, ever the young warrior. After all, Nikitich can handle most anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...aside from parenting, that is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, in 1908\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In 1908, Dobrynya Nikitich was summoned in Russia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As a bogatyr of the Sun Prince, he is not wholly unrelated to the goddess of the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The luminous goddess of the Orient gently celebrated that newborn life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> O grotesque life, there is nothing to be afraid of. O screaming life, there is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Even if you fall short of the sun in the heavens, you were born of the light. Therefore, you are a child of mine,&quot; she said.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah. I see, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And so went Nikitich. To the heart of that great explosion\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Overcoming all obstacles and enduring all hardships.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Distorted by the power of the fragment of rock that scorched the land of Tunguska,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> there lay an incomprehensible creature. Uncertain of whether it was a dragon or an insect, he cut it down. And atop the scorched and fallen trees\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Nikitich met you, a newborn child.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Gave you a name...gave you flesh...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> You were together for a while, but in the end, Nikitich was little more than a shadow. A Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the end, I couldn&#39;t raise you. I came up short.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t accept your curses,I couldn&#39;t accept your screams.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Bearing witness to your end was all I could do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Forgive me. Forgive me, Yaskaya.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll forgive you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s you. My beloved spouse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;You can find out for yourself someday.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> &quot;Yaskaya might just forgive you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Is that so? Is that so?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I doubt that.

Miss Sion, when you say home turf,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> do you mean to say that the Alien God will deploy a Reality Marble-like domain, much like Koyanskaya did...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That this prediction is your other worry?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, did I mention that I only had one other worry?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had every intention of keeping it a secret. I didn&#39;t even let Captain in on it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Come now, anyone could have ventured a guess from your tone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You made no comments on the contents of Chaldea&#39;s operations, yet you had some rather strong opinions on our operational methods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It was all so that you could herd us into resolving those worrisome predictions only you foresaw, one after another.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And now the greatest &quot;obstacle&quot;, Beast IV, has been ousted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I had figured that Beast IV was your final worry...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> However, now that you claim there is &quot;one more&quot;, I may have misunderstood that last one.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There can&#39;t be that many factors that exceed Beast IV.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, is it not natural to assume there is but one factor left?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Spot-on, broadly speaking. As expected of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There is only one factor left I wish to sort out before we confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What might that be? To shed light on the Alien God&#39;s true identity and nature?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. That can only happen when we do confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This &quot;last worry&quot; of mine is something far simpler.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be helped if you don&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, this is a matter even you have overlooked, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I mean, I can&#39;t help but laugh. There&#39;s just no way you could&#39;ve seen this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since it slipped past even SHEBA&#39;s eyes, this is a problem neither of us could have done anything about!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...welp, this is hardly the time to be cachinnating in despair.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the transport of the Saint Graphs to you, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> On the off chance something happens, I&#39;m certain you can carry them to the Border, unlike me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Right now, Chaldea Base is in an extremely perilous state.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I cannot guarantee your safety with my Thought Acceleration and Memory Partition alone once ten minutes have passed.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Please hurry over to the Border and deliver the graphs to Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> You cannot guarantee my safety...would that mean your personal computing power is unable to ascertain the future?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, why not use TRISMEGISTUS II, the far more powerful computing unit?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can&#39;t use it. The machine behind me is just a paper tiger.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already moved its contents elsewhere, and they&#39;re currently being rebooted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> \u2014! Then moving the Saint Graphs means...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s exactly what you think it means. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re quick on the uptake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...just between you and me. During this mission,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Chaldea should have suffered heavy casualties according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...it even went as far as to conclude that &quot;the end result is defeat&quot;. Does this ring any bells, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> ...of course it does. Reading those logs earlier chilled me to the bone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Beast IV was harbouring a minus when it eclosed. It was the curse it incurred in Britain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> That curse drove Koyanskaya into a corner, forcing her to undergo &quot;rapid maturation&quot;...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yet their defeat was inevitable. And by that, I do not mean they were unable to defeat the Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> They were destined to be annihilated the moment [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] set foot in that domain and fought at its epicenter.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Correct. Beast IV was ready to annihilate the entire domain. &quot;The hunters shall die with their prey&quot;\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That was the nature of the trap it had set up.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If survival means victory, Chaldea should have lost. However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. The Heroic Spirit Taigong and Director Gordolf&#39;s personal feelings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> And a decisive word from the Master, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Those miracles were what stopped Koyanskaya from self-destructing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> \u2014And so &quot;mutual slaughter&quot; turned into &quot;peaceful dialogue&quot;. As a result, there were no winners or losers.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yep. A wonderful ending. Just what I expected of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction, Chaldea will be annihilated today.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A truly inevitable doom.

Isn&#39;t the Wandering Sea supposed to be impregnable!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> The gravitational sphere means that thing, right? That pseudo-black hole from Olympus, right!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong><br> The Wandering Sea&#39;s a goner if that thing gets dropped, you know!? What&#39;ll happen to our base!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is everyone here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Chaldea personnel are all accounted for! Everyone&#39;s on board the Shadow Border!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holmes and Sion aren&#39;t here yet though\u2014oh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I apologize for the delay, but the situation is dire. I will explain later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I have the Saint Graphs. Let&#39;s leave at once.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I would like nothing more than that, but where is Sion Eltnam!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I will blame her later for failing to foresee this while prattling on about &quot;predicting the future&quot;,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> but she is now Chaldea personnel! We cannot leave her behind!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Hmm. I&#39;d love to have her hear that line just now, Director Gordolf.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> But let&#39;s prioritize our escape for now. Miss Sion has also suggested as much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> It appears she will be joining us later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> &quot;I will keep the Five Gates firmly sealed. Such is the responsibility of one who has rented the Wandering Sea.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She said it would take her 20 minutes to do so.\u2014I take it you understand the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mister Holmes. That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to go get her...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that, Fujimaru. This is what she said to me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Chaldea should give priority to escaping. I&#39;ll be sure to catch up with you.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, not right away. But I will be sure to make it in time for the final battle.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, that&#39;s why I left the Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Everything so far is, dare I say it, just as I calculated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I may look like this, but I am still a gamer. There&#39;s absolutely no way I&#39;m going to die before I get to see the ending, lololol.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Those were the words of an alchemist of Atlas. I consider them to be truthful.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Here we are as proof of that, well-prepared and boarding the Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Da Vinci and Captain are already on the Storm Border, ready to depart.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> From the start, she knew this would happen.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> In which case, she should have made preparations for her own escape as well.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> H...Hmm. You do...have a point...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I&#39;d been wondering why we were suddenly told to pack...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But I suppose it&#39;s high time the enemy also got serious, considering there&#39;s only one Lostbelt left.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> This would have happened to us, sooner or later...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Yes. We would have had to leave the Wandering Sea at some point. That is why the Storm Border came equipped with living quarters.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She intended on making the Storm Border our base from the start.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> She said that Chaldea ought not to be affiliated with any faction, not to be under the protection of the Wandering Sea,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> but an organization composed of those who live in the present, dedicated to preserving the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...not affiliated with any faction...an organization composed of those who live in the present...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> ...hmm. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s exactly it, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Meuni\xE8re! Fujimaru! Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Board the Shadow Border at once! The other personnel are already on board!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2014Roger that!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Perpetuation, Seren, line disconnected. Gate of Progress, Eren, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Preservation, Genon, line disconnected. Gate of Servility, Fusilka, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gate of Rebirth, Ganu, line\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How may I help you, Professor? Did you perhaps forget something?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u2014Actually,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> what brings you here?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What would bring a magus of the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot; before a magus of the modern era?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> You find it strange? This is, after all, our final meeting.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I believe a direct, face-to-face greeting is common courtesy, no matter the era.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh...that&#39;s right. That is the case.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Unfortunately, our institute has been standalone for quite some time...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The culture of meeting in person has all but died out. Replaced with meeting via screens, mirrors, threads, and the net.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I, too, am a heretic at the Atlas Institute. The techniques imparted by the Eltnams...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Spiritron threads that directly hijack and access the brains of others...Etherlite, as it is called.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And perhaps because my doting father spoiled me every chance he got,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to find meaning in &quot;skinship with other people&quot;.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As a result, I&#39;ve become a positive person who refuses to use the all-too-convenient Etherlite technique.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So your concern is most appreciated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I am grateful for this opportunity to exchange words with you in person.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You&#39;re in THAT era, are you not? Shouldn&#39;t the cost of communication be absurdly high?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> It is indeed. It consumes enough magical energy to wipe out an entire continent.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> But there was no other use for it regardless.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I have received permission from my mentor to splurge at least once for the future&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Mentor...would you be referring to one of the magi who created the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot;?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had heard Ganu no longer has anyone left. But it turns out there were two remaining, including you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> When it comes to these strange tales,</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> the Gate of Rebirth ought to remain cut off from your era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> In any case, the Wandering Sea of 2017 will now vanish.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Whether or not I exist has nothing to do with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, so you won&#39;t scold me despite that my renting this place led to the island&#39;s decimation?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Of course not. There is no such thing as decimation for the Wandering Sea. In the ancient past\u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> they built a workshop on a lone island in a distant sea to isolate themselves from the reach of both gods and mankind.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Thus, the entire zone vanished from the universe.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Drifting astray in space and time. Or you could say it went missing for eternity. No one can observe or interact with it.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Except\u2014for these Five Gates.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> The Wandering Seas that manifest in each era are merely shadows cast by &quot;the Wandering Sea that once was&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Even if the Wandering Sea of 2017 should collapse, that will only be the case for 2017.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> It will have no effect on either the past or the future. Nor will it affect the true form which has vanished.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. I once thought that individual workshops lie beyond the Five Gates\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But they are in fact Time Gates, are they not?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gates that allow communication between the Wandering Sea prior to its disappearance and any era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Correct. I too was once a magus who lived in the Common Era. Much like you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I was beckoned by my mentor through the Gate of Rebirth and became a denizen of the other side.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> You called yourself a heretic of the Atlas Institute. In other words, there is no place for you in this world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> The number of magi endowed with the teachings of the Wandering Sea are few.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I am aware. It is said that applications are permitted only once a year, and only one applicant is selected.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Yes. However, there are not many who meet the standards required to join us.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> But if one manages to be present when the gates open, if Mystery and fate align with them, anyone could make the grade.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> At present, the gate to the Wandering Sea is open\u2014Sion Eltnam.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. While I am grateful for your words, I still have something I must do here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rest assured, I will ensure the gates are closed. Please feel free to return, Fabro Rowan.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For you and the Wandering Sea, the Alien God may be an irrelevant matter far in the future...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But for myself, [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], and Chaldea, this is a problem we must solve no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So now is not the time for me to go there. If the gates are fated to open only in this very moment...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I must conclude it was simply not meant to be. I&#39;ll try my luck with something else next time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Thank you for all your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> I see. Then I will leave the cleanup to you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> ...one last thing.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> We did not offer shelter to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> We offered you an opportunity, Sion. For that bizarre plan of yours.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> May you have a good journey, Sion Eltnam. Proceed as you wish...no, proceed as you have foreseen.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong><br> Girl born of the black earth. Like a lone bird soaring across the underworld.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...? What an odd metaphor...I have nothing to do with birds or the underworld...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, I suppose I&#39;ll find out someday. I&#39;d better get started on my work!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There is no beauty in simply being destroyed. None at all! If we are to be destroyed either way, then self-destructing is the way to go. Self-destruct, it is!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now then\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see how durable the manifestation of the Alien God is!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> Wowow, the surface portion of the Wandering Sea is getting sucked into the gravitational spheeeeere!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong><br> This is it, Captaaiin! If we wait any longer, we&#39;ll lose out on speeeed!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> I know!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Tomarin, Kawata, Octavia, Chin, Kayan, Elrond, Marcus, Meuni\xE8re,</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, Fou, Gordolf, and Holmes are confirmed aboard!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Storm Border, scrambling! We will hereby leave these waters at full speed!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> T-That is fine and all, but what about that Olga Marie!? Won&#39;t she chase us!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t we launch a preemptive attack!? I mean, look at her. See how defenseless that little girl looks!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> No, the ship&#39;s armaments at present are not enough to damage the Alien God!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> If she chases us, then so be it! We&#39;ll outrun her!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> All hands, take your seats!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Professor! Shipboard inertial protection at maximum output!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Bow, transfer the temporal flow of the dimensional drilling to the stern. We&#39;ll use the gap recoil to accelerate!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> This is going to be the fastest takeoff we&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ll leave the steering to you!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong><br> Yep, got i~t. I&#39;ve already done the calculations, so we&#39;re good to go~.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Fire four Triton Engine units in parallel! Storm Border, taking off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...what happened...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...did we pull out...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Yeah. No pursuit from the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The ship has now left the North Sea and is headed towards the center of the Eurasian continent.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We will continue to hold course eastward and head for the Pacific Ocean.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> Da Vinci, Holmes. Do you have any other questions?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What happened to the Alien God? As we left, there was this intense flash of light...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That was the Wandering Sea&#39;s...no, Sion&#39;s counterattack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like how the Alien God compresses ultra-dense matter to create a gravitational sphere,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> she compressed the Wandering Sea to an infinitesimal degree, released it, and launched the resultant energy at the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Did the Alien God not pursue us because of that damage,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> or did it not realize we escaped? I can&#39;t tell for sure.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> I see. So she did not simply take it lying down, as expected of an alchemist of Atlas.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But what do we do now? Sion Eltnam will be back, won&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Without her, we can neither maintain the Storm Border nor plan our operations with TRISMEGISTUS II, can we?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Fear not, TRISMEGISTUS II has already been ported over to the Storm.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the major end-of-year cleanup was for!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s nothing short of romantic having a massive computer inside an airborne warship!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sion\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Thank you for the &quot;we thought you exploded with the Wandering Sea&quot; reaction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Apologies, but while I may look like this, I&#39;m actually a vam\u2014no, let&#39;s just say I have a unique constitution.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I shut the Wandering Sea gates and activated the self-destruct sequence! Then I rendezvoused with the Storm Border on my own.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, I suppose you could call it existential probability manipulation. Please consider it in the same vein as Yu Mei-ren&#39;s dispersion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I see. Alchemists who live in numbers do not see self-destruction...no, self-sacrifice as a good thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> What ought to be prioritized is not the subsequent result, but the calculations occurring in the present.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> I take it...all your actions are done with self-interest in mind?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. The good you do for others is good you do yourself, as they say!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Lead with that, damn it! What an effective way of painting yourself in a positive light!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make me worry for nothing! I, no, I am an ironhearted commander, so it&#39;s not as though it hurt me.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> But you should consider the feelings of the other personnel, seriously! We don&#39;t want to see any more sacrifices!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh. Is that so, folks?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep. Reflect on that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For real.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s right, I think everyone else feels the same way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m very glad to see you return safely. Good work on the dismantling of the Wandering Sea, Sion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u2014Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> ...well, I knew all along though. Sion&#39;s sturdier than the average Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> More importantly, let&#39;s go over our plan now that we&#39;ve calmed down.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> From now on, Chaldea&#39;s operations will be conducted from the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Storm will fly haphazardly across the earth so that we won&#39;t be spotted by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> We will make landfall only for refuelling and maintenance.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> The Storm may be an outstanding vessel, but even it will reach its limit eventually without a port.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong><br> One more large-scale operation&#39;s the limit. I&#39;d like you to keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Understood. There&#39;s only one Lostbelt left either way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Once the decisive anti-Alien God technique is complete, Chaldea will assault the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> \u2014We will engage U-Olga Marie, the self-proclaimed &quot;Alien God&quot;, in combat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong><br> Will that do, Commander Gordolf and [\u2642 Mister /\u2640 Miss] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> M-Mm. So we&#39;re finally in the endgame.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong><br> Very well, let&#39;s do it! But only after we&#39;ve made every preparation possible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> While the tuning of the Holy Sword is no doubt important, we mustn&#39;t forget to analyze the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Is the Alien God really Director Olga Marie? What is up with that form?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right now, &quot;defeating&quot; her is the only option we have. But as we deepen our understanding of the enemy, other options may present themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just like they did with Koyanskaya. Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In that case, we&#39;ll have to get used to our new surroundings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let&#39;s split up and work to make the Storm Border a better base than ever before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It looks like Sion&#39;s built us a new facility too, no? Things are sure to get busier from here on out~.</p>', 3222);
