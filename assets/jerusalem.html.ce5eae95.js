I think that the better substitute for this word in this context might be &quot;learning&quot; (enrolling in a course = learning new stuffs?)</p></li><li><p>2 Both Mashu and DaVinci didn&#39;t specify whether or not &quot;Demon God Pillar&quot; they mentioned refers to a single or multiple entities. Dialogues here indicate that this Chaldea still hasn&#39;t heard the name &quot;Solomon&quot; as the culprit yet. If you can find a footage of London&#39;s Demon God Pillar&#39;s fight in Arcade you will see that Solomon&#39;s silhouette there is that of a shadow servant : this might be an indication that Solomon/Goetia&#39;s debut in Mobile FGO doesn&#39;t occur here at all and this is why this Chaldea still have absolutely no f***ing clue who the heck their culprit might be. They might still think that &quot;Demon God Pillar&quot; is/are the actual mastermind(s) so this might be the reason words like &quot;King of Magecraft&quot; doesn&#39;t make any appearance here either</p></li><li><p>3 Again, this statement from DaVinci supports the above theory.</p></li><li><p>4 &quot;This time for sure&quot; gives either post-part 1 or maybe even post-part 2 vibe. Georgios also claimed that he did this PRECISELY because he&#39;s a saint.

Anyway it seems to have personal connections with Ozy so this shouldn&#39;t be Goetia.</p></li><li><p>8 [Demon Beast Brilliance] -- I&#39;ve seen some translations on this. To translate it as &quot;Kaku&quot; (as how it actually sounds) feels too cringy for me. The last character (the one that reads &quot;Kaku&quot;) is a character so f***ing rare the only time I saw it in other contexts is from Tokyo Ghoul, and even in that context the author still use it to signify the color &quot;red&quot; which doesn&#39;t match any definition in any dictionary... Its definition in dictionary is &quot;To shine (brightly, vividly)&quot; so I decided to just change it into a noun instead hence &quot;Brilliance&quot;. There&#39;s actually another word very common that reads &quot;Kaku&quot; (but written in a totally different Kanji character) -- &quot;A core (n.)&quot; and personally I think that &quot;Demon Beast Core&quot; is a far less silly/confusing name but since I have no clue whether or not this is the author&#39;s actual intention I chose to stick to &quot;Demon Beast Brilliance&quot; instead.</p></li></ul>', 940);
