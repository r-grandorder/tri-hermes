It is because she has a fierce will burning brightly inside of her heart.</p><p>Even if she was a queen who was pushed up to the throne as a puppet, Nitocris is still a child of god, and she properly possesses the self-awareness of being a Pharaoh \u2013 a ruler who reaches for godhood. Therefore, she massacred the influential people who tried to turn the Pharaoh into an influential tool. The reason why she killed them was not only because she wanted vengeance for her brothers, but because the splendour that is the Pharaoh should not be defiled by the lower classes, and that is surely no doubt for the sake of further continuing the existence of the Pharaoh for a millennia and beyond\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Nitocris comes into contact with the Protagonist as an \u201Callied partner\u201D.</p><p>The wish Nitocris wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201CFor my brothers to live peacefully in the Eternal Paradise.\u201D For Nitocris, who became a Heroic Spirit, she does not know if her assassinated brothers had made their entry onto the road that leads into the \u201CEternal Paradise\u201D located in the afterlife of ancient Egypt without any problems and as they should have as expected; therefore, she has no choice but to wish.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CLower your head.

A figure who lived around the 22nd Century BC. Strangely, Nitocris has the same name with an ancient Queen of Babylon.</p><p>Her throne, which became the seat for puppet pharaohs due to the hands of influential people who made light of the gods, was smeared with blood more often than it being something that give praise to the splendour of the gods. However, Nitocris, who became the Pharaoh, cannot stop forgetting the regrets of the preceding young kings \u2013 of whom they were her brothers \u2013 that were altogether murdered by the hands of the influential people, and the throne of the Pharaoh, worthy of splendour, was played with by the lower classes; she could not forgive that.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201CPunishment, for disrespectfully playing with even the seat of the Pharaoh, who serves as a ruler and is worthy to be god.\u201D<br> \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201CPunishment, for committing treason in vain by putting your hands on my beloved brothers.\u201D</p><p>Although she obediently abided with the enthronement for a short while, Nitocris advanced a \u201Cplan\u201D in secret to kill the influential people altogether. She opened a banquet in order to gather them \u2013 the treasonous people who showed irreverence \u2013 into an enormous basement that was constructed by her, and in the middle of their intoxication, she filled the basement with a massive amount of water drawn in from the Nile River, killing every single person through drowning, thus having accomplished her revenge.</p><p>Afterwards, it is said that Nitocris chose to promptly commit suicide without making arrangements for her rebirth that is to come after her death as the Pharaoh.</p><p>Although she was said to be the last pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, there is no discovery of a positive proof that Nitocris clearly existed, even up to the present day, so she is also viewed as \u201Ca queen in legends\u201D. However, the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th Century BC wrote down her existence in the \u201CHistories\u201D, written as the world\u2019s first history book.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>A magic queen who held the throne in an ancient Egyptian dynasty, even if only for a short time. Beyond her gentle smile, Nitocris possesses absolute confidence as a pharaoh. The \u201CWas\u201D sceptre held in her hand is a symbol of Royal Authority, while simultaneously, it is the same sceptre held by the ancient Egyptian gods; it is also a Magecraft Mystic Code that possesses a powerful Mystery. The gods blessed her to have a strong will and pride. Gifted the power of the sky, and gifted the power of the Underworld, she was bestowed enough power to conduct her revenge. Was it a section of the Nile River, as written down by Herodotus, that she really used to kill her bitter enemies whom she invited to the basement, or was it a torrent of evil spirits overflowing from her bronze mirror of darkness, given to her by the gods, that killed them? After her death, Nitocris did not proceed towards the \u201CEternal Paradise\u201D that is in the afterlife of ancient Egypt. Consequently, she committed suicide without even making arrangements for her rebirth.</p><p>Was it the blessings of the gods, or was it because of the people\u2019s thoughts?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014For later on, Nitocris would be engraved onto the Throne of Heroes.</p><p>Nitocris materialized as a Servant, or so she thinks. The previous pharaohs whom died some time ago before herself \u2013 her beloved brothers, did they really make their entry onto the road that leads into the \u201CEternal Paradise\u201D? She at least does not know since she herself did not arrive there. If it is the case that they are at least Pharaohs, let that thought be true.

Hey, I personally thought I completed her design in a simple and well-coherent manner. As a matter of fact, in the middle of this work, there was a revision to the design of her Third Stage Ascension as her rarity was changed from 3\u2606 to 4\u2606, and at that time, I received a draft plan of her design from the Director, so between you and me, it resulted in her Third Stage design as you see now. (Her original design has little skin exposure.) However, she was blessed with a role in Chapter 6 of the FGO Story, and there was also the influence coming from \u201CChaldea Radio\u201D that Ms. Tanaka Minami \u2013 the voice actress in charge of Nitocris \u2013 is responsible for, so she grew into a character who is loved by everyone, which was much more than what I had thought; every time it gets to this topic, I believe that \u201Cit is nice to be able to receive a design that you can do.\u201D (Shimaudon)</p><h2 id="material-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Material Images</h2><p>(Lib will add after publish)</p><h2 id="dialogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue</h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Occassion</th><th style="text-align:center;">English</th><th style="text-align:center;">Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Summoned</td><td style="text-align:center;"></td><td style="text-align:center;"></td></tr></tbody></table>', 76);
