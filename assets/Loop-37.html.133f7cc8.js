No wonder, living on top of a mountain would certainly give your legs a good workout.</p><hr><p>\u201C......Huh?\u201D</p><p>I strain my eyes.</p><p>I never thought I&#39;d see this red silhouette here.</p><p>\u201COh, Emiya-kun. Were you going to visit Issei?\u201D</p><p>\u201COh, Tohsaka. Sure is brave of you to go inside enemy territory.\u201D</p><p>We exchange appropriate greetings.</p><hr><p>\u201C? You&#39;re exaggerating. It&#39;s not soccer, and I&#39;m not playing an away game.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThis is Issei&#39;s home base. He may be no match for you otherwise, but here, the crowd would be cheering for him.\u201D</p><p>The temple has Issei&#39;s parents and family. There&#39;s also Kuzuki-sensei and Caster.</p><p>Caster and Issei may not get along well, but Tohsaka is still their common foe.</p><hr><p>\u201CEntering an enemy magus&#39; stronghold puts you at an overwhelming disadvantage, if not a death wish\u2015\u2015\u2015Right. I guess my lessons really did have an effect on you.\u201D</p><p>&quot;Well done!&quot; Tohsaka nods.</p><hr><p>\u201CActually, you might have hit the nail on the head.</p><p>It&#39;s not just Ryuudou-kun. It seems the rest of his family doesn&#39;t much care for me, either. My father and grandfather seem to have had a hard time dealing with the people of this temple, too.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, that&#39;s just how it is, isn&#39;t it?\u201D</p><p>A magus family remaining on good terms with generation after generation of chief monks would be unusual.</p><hr><p>\u201CThe two of us were like this even before coming to Homurabara. I wonder if this isn&#39;t fate that was decided before we were born.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThen let&#39;s end this ominous cycle of destiny at your generation.\u201D</p><p>I give a warning to Tohsaka, who looks to be getting more serious about her rival. If the Tohsaka vs. Ryuudou feud does become a family affair passed on through generations, she might just try to get a head start now.</p><hr><p>\u201CAlso, it&#39;s way unusual to hear you talk about shrines and temples. Weren&#39;t you a parishioner of the church in Shinto?\u201D</p><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015You&#39;re mistaken, Emiya-kun.</p><p>Sure enough, I had a senior fellow apprentice that was somehow a priest. But the moment I realized he was supposed to become a representative of God, any desire I had to practice religion in that church vaporized instantly.\u201D</p><hr><p>Ahh, I see.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s house is completely Western-style, and so is her lifestyle. Moreover, since she&#39;ll even be studying abroad after graduation, I never even thought religion might be different.</p><p>But if someone like Kotomine was a priest, indeed, I doubt she would ever enter the faith. Even I&#39;d be hesitant about it.</p><hr><p>\u201CThis line of work certainly doesn&#39;t lend itself well to being accepted by any religion to begin with. I don&#39;t go around proclaiming to be an atheist, though, seeing as it would just attract unwanted attention and distrust.\u201D</p><p>\u201CAlways best to avoid standing out, huh?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFortunately, in this country, it&#39;s easy to pretend being a believer of any faith, and no one&#39;s going to scold you over it, either.\u201D</p><p>Because almost everyone in Japan would just visit a shrine on New Year&#39;s, pay respects during Bon and Higan, and yet also celebrate Christmas.</p><hr><p>\u201CAnd also, since truly powerful, skilled in the supernatural Buddhist practitioners that can guess my identity do appear from time to time, being unprepared is not an option.\u201D</p><p>\u201CUnderstood, I&#39;ll be careful\u2015\u2015\u2015But really, seeing you at a temple...\u201D</p><p>Come to think of it, Tohsaka being here is all sorts of wrong.</p><p>The serene and tranquil look might be more suitable for Sakura and Saber, though.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Are you still complaining, Shirou?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWell, I guess it can&#39;t be helped...\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehe, it may not look like it, but I&#39;m actually a shrine maiden around New Year&#39;s.\u201D</p><p>......Eh?</p><p>Tohsaka? A shrine maiden?? That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard of it.</p><hr><p>\u201CHere, at the Ryuudou temple!?\u201D</p><p>\u201CWhat a farce that would be. When Issei sees me as a shrine maiden, he&#39;ll think I&#39;m a succubus violating his god&#39;s holy precinct! It&#39;ll cause a massive uproar. It&#39;s a different shrine within the city limits, of course.\u201D</p><p>That&#39;s a relief.</p><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015But why a shrine maiden?</p><hr><p>\u201CThey&#39;re related to the Tohsaka family, so it&#39;s necessary to send someone from the family as a shrine maiden... I bet it&#39;s that kind of a tradition?\u201D</p><p>\u201CSort of like High Priestesses of the Kamo Shrine\u2015\u2015\u2015No, it&#39;s just a nice part time job to make some extra cash around New Year&#39;s. They give preferential treatment to those with experience.\u201D</p><p>I was expecting some grand backstory, so I was a bit crestfallen. Indeed, Issei did tell me that almost all of the shrine maidens you see around New Year&#39;s are part-timers.</p><hr><p>\u201CThus, Shinto shines and Buddhist temples are no big deal to me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHmm... part time, eh? I guess you have it pretty tough, too.\u201D</p><p>I just blurted it out without thinking.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really sense any malice behind it, but I think I just saw Tohsaka&#39;s eyebrow twitch.</p><hr><p>\u201CI can still manage without getting into a permanent job. Why don&#39;t you try it out? A New Year&#39;s part time job, that is.\u201D</p><p>\u201CMe?\u201D</p><p>That light blue Shinto priest hakama getup, huh.</p><p>That&#39;s not that far from the archery club uniform, so it wouldn&#39;t feel that weird to wear\u2015\u2015\u2015in fact, if anything...</p><hr><p>\u201CIf I had to choose, I&#39;d say that putting on a jacket, waving an orange stick and acting as a guard or guide for visitors seems like a better fit for me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CThat does sound like it would suit you better. Leaving that aside, since this place is under my jurisdiction, I can&#39;t exactly ignore it. I come here sometimes on patrol.\u201D</p><p>Finally, she tells me the reason for her visit.</p><p>As she says, this is an important site in the ley lines, so Tohsaka wouldn&#39;t be able to neglect it just because there&#39;s a temple built on top.</p><hr><p>\u201CI see. How about a prayer while you&#39;re here?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI don&#39;t have any business at the main building, I just need to check out the pond in the back and the underground cave... What are you going to do?\u201D</p><hr><p>She&#39;s inviting me to go with her.</p><p>But if I did go, I think I&#39;d be a hindrance.</p><p>I shake my head, and Tohsaka doesn&#39;t seem to mind.</p><hr><p>\u201CAh. Alright, then please go distract Ryuudou-kun so we avoid a clash.\u201D</p><p>\u201C...Well, if you met with Issei here, yeah, that would definitely cause a clash.\u201D</p><p>Tohsaka passes under the mountain gate with a bitter smile.</p><p>Before crossing the grounds, she looks back at me.</p><hr><p>\u201C\u2015\u2015\u2015Do you want to see me in my shrine maiden outfit?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI&#39;ll be honest, it&#39;s relevant to my interests.\u201D</p><p>\u201CHehehe, then look forward to it.\u201D</p><p>Giving a smile that fills me with anticipation, Tohsaka leaves.</p><p>Tohsaka in a shrine maiden uniform... I&#39;m definitely interested.</p><hr><h3 id="emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emiya-residence\u30FBstart-of-night-things-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Emiya Residence\u30FBStart of Night Things to do</h3>', 99);
