I could not take it any longer,<br> so I already spoke to him!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> When I asked Lord Tajima-no-kami directly why he has been spending so much time in the simulator, he said...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Haha.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> You need not concern yourself, Assassin of Para\xEDso\u2013no, Lady Mochizuki Chiyome of the Kouga clan.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> All that I do, I do for Master.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> And that was all he said...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Got it. Then let&#39;s go talk to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Permit me to accompany you! Lord Tajima has always been a great help to me ever since my arrival.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I heard what&#39;s going on! I&#39;m coming too!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Lady Inferno\u2013I mean, Tomoe.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Lord Tajima has been very kind to me as well.<br> If he is in trouble, I must do whatever I can to help him.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Please, Master, allow me to accompany you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s all go together!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll keep an eye on the simulator from here!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Thank you, Lady Mash. That will be most helpful.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Very well then! Let us activate the simulator!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> These virtual spaces the simulator presents never fail to amaze me.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> From the look of these wooden buildings...I would say we are in the Far East, circa the sixteenth century.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I believe you are familiar with this era of history, are you not, Master?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> ...Could it be...?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I-I think it is. I have not seen it myself before...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...but this place does seem very similar to the one I saw in Chaldea&#39;s archives.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It does, doesn&#39;t it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is the Toke castle town from a parallel Shimousa.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Can you hear me, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to the simulator&#39;s log,<br> Mr. Yagyu should still be in that area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This area was randomly generated, so there may be some external interference steering it towards\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s possible, but extremely unlikely.<br> Hey guys! Miss me?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Looks like you&#39;re having fun in there.<br> Hehe, I think I&#39;ll help you out too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Aaand done!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> You&#39;ve given us a kind of protective effect. I imagine it&#39;s something similar to an Assassin&#39;s Presence Concealment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Good eye, Diarmuid! That&#39;s right.<br> You guys are pretending to be spies now, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Then you need some way of, well,<br> concealing your presence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This might not be quite as good as an actual Assassin&#39;s skill, but it still ought to help keep you hidden.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, maybe it won&#39;t do much against a swordsman of Yagyu&#39;s skill...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but it should at least be better than nothing, right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This&#39;ll be a big help!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hehe. Go ahead, really heap on the praise.<br> It&#39;s okay, I can take it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I just wish we could use this all the time...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ahaha, good point. But I&#39;m afraid this exploit only works in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, if there&#39;s a Heroic Spirit with that kind of ability around, then it&#39;s a different story. But in the meantime, this is what we&#39;ve got, so good luck, guys!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Yes, my lady. I will do my very best to see this mission through.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> All right, now we need to figure out which way Lord Tajima went, so we can\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah. Wait! Something&#39;s not right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Huh, that&#39;s a surprise...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Enemies! How did they find us with our Presence Concealment exploit!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Hmm. This could be a problem.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> We shall just have to eliminate them before we proceed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird. It shouldn&#39;t be possible for these enemies to bypass my exploit...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll look into this, but for now you&#39;re just going to have to take them out! Sorry about this, guys!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nothing we can do now but fight!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Yes, Master! I shall cut a path through them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Yes, Master! I&#39;m ready!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...That would seem to be the last of them, Master.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> The people of this town are paying us no mind. That&#39;s better than having them \u201Cfreak out,\u201D of course, but still...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> It is a little unnerving, isn&#39;t it.<br> Is this normal for the simulator?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pretty much. The simulator&#39;s all set up for combat and not much else right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. This way, enemies don&#39;t attack NPCs,<br> and the NPCs don&#39;t even react to them.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Live and let live, hm?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> So if Lord Tajima is not here, that must mean he did not come to do battle with these enemies.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> But then, what did he come here for?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Perhaps he just enjoys sampling different foods from various eras and places?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll go look for him!<br> Excuse me!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> I have returned!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> And I have located Lord Tajima-no-kami, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Way to go, Chiyome!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Great job!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Hehe...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> I mean, all in a day&#39;s work!</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> So where is Lord Tajima?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Well, it would seem he was hiding right under our noses. He is staying in a room at the inn right on the main street.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Assuming you mean the large street you&#39;re on right now, it looks like there are no more than one or two inns around here.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Is that it? The one right over there?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s it.<br> How clever of him to hide where we would least suspect.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Haha, so he chose to stay in the town rather than the castle, did he? He certainly is a shrewd old man.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Lord Tajima-no-kami is staying in a room on the second floor. I will scout ahead and see what I can learn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Yes, Master.<br> I shall return shortly!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Lady Chiyome never fails to impress me with her skill as a kunoichi. It is hard to imagine there were spies like that all over Japan during the Warring States period...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> So you are from a time before that of Lady Chiyome and Lord Tajima, Lady Tomoe?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Does that mean there were no ninja back then?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> No, there weren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> We did have spies, of course, but I don&#39;t think I had ever heard the words \u201Cninja\u201D or \u201Cshinobi\u201D before.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I lived very, very long ago. It was a dreadful time,<br> where brute strength ruled over all.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Although...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...if you go back even further, perhaps to the Heian period, that would be an even more dreadful\u2013</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> What was that sound?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Eeyaaaaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Masteee\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Chiyome!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did he find her!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> That came from the second floor of that inn!<br> Then...!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> What an amusing turn of events. I never expected to have a Kouga Mochizuki kunoichi make an attempt on my life while I am staying at an inn.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It would be a waste not to make use of this second-floor room. Come, bring Master and the others and join me here.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I have already told the madam to prepare enough meals for all of you. Come, there is no need to be modest. Sit. Eat.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> We have an assortment of fish from Nansou today.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> The horse mackerel sashimi is excellent. Usually it is cleaned on the ship when it is caught, but I am told they brought this mackerel here on their fastest horses while it was still alive.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> The sillago has been made into tempura.<br> The grated daikon makes for a perfect palate cleanser.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> The sweetfish has been grilled with salt, and its simple flavor goes together wonderfully with freshly cooked rice.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> And the mountain greens were all picked today.<br> Go on, Master. Please, enjoy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh...thank you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Oh my, this feast looks truly splendid...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Lord Tajima, is this...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Is this why you have been using the simulator every night? To sample delicacies from all manner of time and place?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Mmm, this is quite good. This butterbur sprout tempura has an especially rich flavor. If only I had some wine to go with it.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Ah! You are supposed to wait for the rest of us, Lord Diarmuid!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Om nom nom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is yummy. Come on, Tomoe, join us.</p><hr><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Not you too, Master!?<br> Gnnnnnn!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> W-well, if you insist, Master... Although, it, um...<br> I am afraid it might be wasted on me...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Lady Tomoe...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Is something wrong, Lady Tomoe?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> My, um, tongue is, well... It is very sensitive to the heat that flows through my veins, you see...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> I think it may even burn with a fire of its own, somehow...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> All that is to say...there are times when I can appreciate flavor, and times when I simply cannot...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And I&#39;m afraid today is, well...the latter...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> There is more enjoyment to be had in food than merely in its taste, Lady Tomoe.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Come, try this.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> This is...tokoroten jelly...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> It has been chilled quite well.<br> Go on.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...If you insist, Lord Tajima,<br> then I will not refuse.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Try eating it all in one bite.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> It... It is so...refreshing...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...This particular simulation happened to arrive at a time and place similar to my own.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> At first, I dismissed it as merely a fleeting illusion, but what is this body if not an equally fleeting shadow?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed, I can find no difference between this simulator and myself as a Servant, so I have rather enjoyed indulging my nostalgia in this manner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagyu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So you&#39;ve been using the simulator to go on a gourmet tour?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, the reason you&#39;ve been setting the area randomly is because\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You wanted to enjoy traveling for its own sake, not just to get to a destination, huh? I like that. I like that a lot.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I hope you can forgive me. It was not my intention to drag you along on this old man&#39;s whim. I must apologize to you, Master, and to all of you who assisted [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> D-do not be ridiculous, Lord Tajima!<br> Please, do not bow your head in shame!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> Chiyome is right! Many of us Heroic Spirits have enjoyed using the simulator!</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> You have nothing at all to apologize for.<br> You only need to tell someone before you use it!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Thank you for your kind understanding.<br> Very well then, let us return to Chaldea Base at once.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> But first...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...there is a monstrous creature I must slay before I go.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...there is a monstrous creature I must slay before I go.</p><p><strong>Tomoe &amp; Chiyome:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Lord Tajima.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Come, outside.<br> This room would be a poor stage for a battle.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Now then, where to begin...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there something else going on in the simulator?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there some kind of enemy you need to defeat here?</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed there is.<br> It is exactly as you say.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Five days ago, I noticed the foul stench of a monster not of this world within the simulator...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...but I can find no other trace of it anywhere.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I could not trouble you with this matter until I had proof, so I have been wandering the simulator tracking its scent.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> All while enjoying your gourmet tour...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Quite.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s weird. Maybe the simulator got infected with some kind of virus?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, maybe that enemy data we saw earlier is connected...!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Indeed.<br> They reeked of the monster&#39;s stench.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...Master, my fellow Servants, I must apologize to you once again for the trouble I have caused.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I was hoping I could find this monster so as to be of service to you, Master, but I suppose this is my comeuppance for trying to play detective.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> Then, you did do this all for Master...</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> We are all [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady] Fujimaru&#39;s Servants.<br> That makes us comrades in arms.</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> And if you cannot rely on your comrades,<br> Lord Tajima, then on whom can you rely?</p><p><strong>Tomoe Gozen:</strong><br> So, please, do not bow your head in shame.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> That is very kind of you, Lady Tomoe... Truly, Lord Kiso Yoshinaka was blessed to have you as his wife.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, guys? Sorry to interrupt, but I just did a quick scan of the simulation, and I can&#39;t seem to find this thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s no sign of this virus anywhere.<br> I have no idea where it could be hiding out...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Oh, that? Worry not.<br> It will show itself here soon.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> From what I can tell, it appears to be targeting Master.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Show yourself, monster.</p><p><strong>Sinister Voice:</strong><br> Well, well...</p><p><strong>Sinister Voice:</strong><br> Well, well, well! It seems there may actually be something to this so-called master swordsman&#39;s vaunted intuition after all.</p><p><strong>Sinister Voice:</strong><br> And yet, even now that you&#39;ve found me, there is nothing you can do about it. Oh woe, oh tragedy. Mmmmmm, if only you could see how foolish you look.</p><p><strong>Sinister Voice:</strong><br> Long time no see, Yagyu Tajima-no-kami Munenori.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Caster of Limbo!?</p><hr><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Well now.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> I have seen you in Chaldea&#39;s \u201Cday-tuh-base,\u201D<br> but I never expected to see you in person.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> You are the sorcerer who caused such chaos in a parallel world. I see. So you have been using your sorcery to make an attempt on Master&#39;s life?</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Indeed I have.</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see... One, two, three... Four Heroic Spirits of Humanity, hm? To think you would come submit to my spell like lambs to the slaughter!</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Hehe. Hehehehehe. Hahahahahahahaha! As though any ordinary Heroic Spirit could hope to match me without karma!</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Go on then, try my pentagram on for size!<br> You will be the first Servant to be remade!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Lord Tajima!</p><p><strong>Tomoe &amp; Chiyome:</strong><br> Lord Tajima!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yagyu!</p><hr><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> You&#39;re mine!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...!? I think he just implanted some kind of complex curse into Yagyu&#39;s Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> This may not be quite as powerful as the Curse of Annihilation, but, mmm, you Servants will still make serviceable vessels for my karma!</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahaha!<br> How the great Yagyu Tajima-no-kami Munenori has fallen!</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> You were a sight to behold when you abandoned your lord and gave in to your monstrous side, but now that you have lived out your life in Proper Human History, you are but a rusted blade!</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> Heh.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong><br> And here I was expecting a truly dreadful inhuman monster. How disappointing.</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Mm? Mmmmmm!?</p><p><strong>Carnivorous Shadow:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t anyone ever tell you sour grapes are unbecoming, Tajima-no-kami!?
