Goredolf requests Sion to make it quick before anything else happens since they have more questions than answers.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/g0bt6g7xonha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Now, first is the info from the analysis.</p><p>The enigmatic facility that our investigators, Fujimaru, Mashu and Kadoc entered into is a research facility that exists within our world.</p><p>It is a facility within Area 51 in Nevada that investigates secretly brought in objects that come from space.</p><p>While we couldn\u2019t inspect all the small details, Mashu\u2019s Ortenaus recorded the information and TRISMEGISTUS II calculated a 99% match that it was a Area 51 research facility.</p><p>Meaning that the facility \u201CSubject: E\u201D was in, was a place that originated within Pan-Human History.</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc and Da Vinci agree that it wasn\u2019t unusual for the operating room to be the center of Traum. Da Vinci wonders what kind of person the Master was. Da Vinci assumes too far and says that the facility might be in Nevada within CHALDEAS.</p><p>Mashu gets an idea and poses the question if the cosmic hallway was a path to another world. Da Vinci explains that it could be the use of Substitution Magecraft, a magecraft that can theoretically swap two people regardless of distance assuming they were the same person.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru Ritsuka:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Substitution\u2026Switching\u2026.</p><p>Then that means that the moment the Earth was bleached\u2014-</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>CHALDEAS swapped its surface with Earth\u2019s surface\u2026right?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/2adablpzonha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Regardless of its minusculeness, CHALDEAS duplicated the soul of Earth since it was an \u201Cidentical existence\u201D.</p><p>Size is not a problem here. If their information load and soul structure are equivalent, then they can be swapped.</p><p>Frankly, the execution method is more bewildering than the state of the Bleached Earth.</p><p>Destroying all of civilization in a second without harming the planet is impossible.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>But, without hurting it, it\u2019d have to swap with \u201Csomething that\u2019s already bleached\u201D...?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Right. It demonstrates that for CHALDEAS, <strong>our world is unharmed</strong>.</p><p>Meaning <strong>if we restore the relationship between CHALDEA and Earth, then your guys\u2019 future will tread on its correct path</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/956qw362pnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>Kadoc wonders that since the time has stopped in the year 2017, if everything were to be restored, everything would flow normally again. But CHALDEAS simulated the world 100 years in the future, and deduces that the facility would be from 2117, but wonders why the equipment is from 2017.</p><p>Sion had the same question. Sion explains that according to the data, Subject: E\u2019s death was a few days ago, meaning it died presumably in 2117. However the contradiction of Subject: E\u2019s death and the technology used within that operating room is unexplainable.</p><p>You seem to guess that the equipment could not be advanced past the year 2017. Sion says that it is correct. Sion explains that CHALDEAS could have run into an issue regarding the inability to upgrade operating technology, since Area 51 shut down in 2001 funds being suspended.</p><p>Sion also explains that Subject: E\u2019s biological composition is similar to a human\u2019s body structure, yet TRISMEGISTUS II \u201Ccould not declare the corpse as an \u201CEarthling\u201D\u201C. Sion reports that she found the information needed from TRISMEGISTUS II\u2019s analysis of the situation.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/gfezybh8pnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Analysis 1. \u201CSubject: E&#39;&#39; is a human from CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth.</p><p>Analysis 2. If the Bleached Earth is CHALDEAS\u2019s surface, then the humanity of CHALDEAS has been wiped out.</p><p>Analysis 3. The equipment within the research facility of CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth were all antiques, and all technological advancements in those 100 years from 2017 to 2117 have become malfunctional.</p><p>This can be inferred with the remaining buildings that stand on the Bleached Earth.</p><p>If there were machines still operational on this Bleached Earth, it\u2019d be a 100 year old antique.</p><p>Something like a motorcycle that utilizes a simple combustion engine and the like.</p><p>That is all the facts that can be inquired from \u201CSubject: E\u201D.</p><p>With that, if we\u2019re thinking, why \u201CSubject: E\u201D became a Master, why were they able to summon that many Servants, and they were able to produce a \u201CColossal Singularity\u201D then it was\u2014</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tpovkz7apnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\u2026.Revenge. CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth was bleached.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to grasp the how, we know why it was bleached.</p><p>CHALDEAS\u2019s Earch was bleached so that it can be substituted with the surface of our Earth.</p><p>\u201CSubject: E\u201D knew that. That\u2019s why those Servants had \u201Crage\u201D appended to them.</p><p>Their world being destroyed\u2026meant, the retaliation towards Pan-Human History.</p><p>\u201CSubject: E\u201D self-consciously knew that they were the last of their kind.</p><p>Being the \u201Clast person\u201D was identical to being \u201Crepresentative of humanity of CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth\u201D</p><p>\u2026No. If not for that, then it\u2019d be impossible with those numbers.</p><p>No one has the power to summon that many Servants.</p><p>The will of all mankind who died on CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth made it possible to summon a tremendous amount of Servants.</p><p>It would mean that there were a bizarre amount of Command Seals.</p><p>They were Command Seals from those from CHALDEAS\u2019s Earth who possessed potential of being a Master.</p><p>And that corpse\u2026was an insignificant \u201Cperson\u201D who had to carry humanity\u2019s future on their back, just like you.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/2ju233ybpnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>Goredolf tells the crew to not feel guilty for something that wasn\u2019t their fault or was out of their control. Goredolf requests for the group to establish a timeline of everything that has happened so far.</p><p>First, Goredolf talks about Fujimaru\u2019s arrival and assumes that CHALDEAS is already simulating the future 100 years from now that can never be observed. Muniere disagrees and says that by the time after Fuyuki, CHALDEAS was still just like Earth and hadn&#39;t yet bleached itself. Muniere states that there was no future after 2016 via SHEBA regardless of whether it was the Incineration of the Human Order or Earth\u2019s Bleaching.</p><p>Muniere presumes that Earth\u2019s Bleaching happened after the events of Part 1, but when they were dealing with some unique matters in 2017.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Then, that would mean Solomon\u2019s Incineration of the Human Order was an unforeseen event, otherwise, CHALDEAS would have induced this situation at the end of 2016\u2026 That\u2019s what I think.</p><p>Solomon\u2026no, Goetia unexpectedly became upset with Marisbury\u2019s plan.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it mean that the CHALDEAS and Earth\u2019s substitution plan was delayed because of Singularity F?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ji0s4gkepnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I understand now. In that case, the explosion in the Control Room wasn\u2019t in Director Marisbury\u2019s plans.</p><p>So it was the main factor for creating this mysterious scenario we\u2019re currently handling.</p><p>Olga Marie. The moment Lev Lainur dropped her in CHALDEAS, something went wrong there.</p></blockquote><p>Sion explains that we now know \u201Cthe purpose of CHALDEAS\u2019s creation\u201D which is to create this scenario that the group sees before them. However, the question now is, who or what is being benefited from this? This is something that Sion nor TRISMEGISTUS II has the answer to.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/fpoqj9qgpnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Goetia desired life without death, a planet without death. Kirishtaria desired the advancement of humanity.</p><p>According to Mr. Daybit, he wanted to destroy CHALDEAS and Earth in \u201Chonor of Earthlings\u201D.</p><p>While we couldn\u2019t accept those, we can understand the reasoning behind each of them.</p><p>However, we are unable to grasp behind \u201Cthe Bleached Earth\u201D. An unseeable ulterior motive.</p></blockquote><p>Kadoc states that Marisbury cared about the advancement and prosperity of humanity, and was a genuine mage. Da Vinci agrees that King Solomon wouldn\u2019t have been summoned and the reason for the bleaching would be more plausible if Marisbury was the opposite. She goes on to say that maybe Marisbury\u2019s plan is like Daybit\u2019s where it\u2019s extremely logical.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/r07zd2xopnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>Da Vinci asks if they\u2019ve arrived. Nemo states that they\u2019re entering Antarctica. However, the ship makes an impact against a barrier and Nemo orders the crew to change course. Sion states that nothing has alerted that there would be a barrier.</p><p>Goredolf asks for Da Vinci\u2019s advice on all of this. Da Vinci states that this barrier is a standalone and has no involvement with the Antarctic.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This is different, everyone. This is most likely\u2026the Wall of Human Order.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/w2r0jdatpnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ka1g0fwupnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I know this protection. The Heroic Spirit, Galahad\u2019s Noble Phantasm, \u201CLord Camelot\u201D.</p><p>That wall acts similar to that power. Antarctica is being protected by the Preservation of Human Order.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/y2v3josypnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>After some time, Nemo went all around the barrier and reported that it encompasses all of the Antarctic. A Dimension Punch or Imaginary Numbers Sail is null in this case. Nemo personally feels annoyed by this barrier since no matter what they do, <strong>they\u2019ll be repelled back</strong>.</p><p>Goredolf consults Da Vinci and Sion about this. Sion wonders whether this is some sort of humiliation game, and Da Vinci is out of ideas since this barrier rejects everything.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/3izuer41qnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Indeed. With the elimination of the seven Lostbelts, CHALDEAS has become the Foundation of Humanity\u2014the Celestial Sphere of the Human Order Preservation.</p><p>That wall does not protect CHALDEAS, but a checkpoint that rejects foreign entities.</p><p>Antarctica is not obstructing you all. <strong>You all are repelling Pan-Human History yourselves</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Nemo Marine redirects the visual cameras towards \u201CRomani Archaman\u201D.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/mzfd9k93qnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Beyond this point lies the domain of the \u201Cperfect\u201D Pan-Human History. You all cannot enter right now.</p><p>\u2014I did not expected this as well\u2014</p><p>All the battles you\u2019ve had now were excessively handled with things that are not of Pan-Human History.</p><p>The Servants outside the seven classes. Ruler. Alter Ego. Avenger.</p><p>As a result of abusing impossible classes, Pan-Human History has deemed you all as foreign entities.</p><p>This distortion must be corrected in order to approach CHALDEAS.</p><p>Those cannot be carried over into the future that lies beyond 2017. \u2026No, that\u2019s incorrect.</p><p>They can\u2019t be carried over with your current cognisance.</p><p>Fujimaru. The gears within you aren\u2019t synchronized.</p><p>Ask yourself why these impossible elements exist.</p><p>How do their weapons and methods support Pan-Human History?</p><p>Once you comprehend and accept it, this foreign contamination will no longer linger.</p><p>Turn this ship around, Novum Chaldea.</p><p>Your distortions. There will be a space for confronting your unattended sins.</p><p>Ordeal Call (Beckoning Duty that Ought to be Fulfilled).</p><p>Four\u2026no, three confrontations must be completed for the truth of the celestial sphere to shine down upon you.</p><p>\u2014-The parting shall inevitably arrive. Now go obtain the spirit required to usher in that moment.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/dyvv3vp5qnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>Romani Archaman leaves and Sion reports that TRISMEGISTUS II is stating the same thing. We are the cause of that barrier occurring there. She admits that we all are criminals walking around. Mashu seems to agree with the idea that abusing such classes would exclude them from the Human Order.</p><p>Mashu also believes that being a Demi-Servant is also wrong in that fact, but her duty is to prove that her being is needed within the Human Order.</p><p>Goredolf, as he thinks for a moment, knows that once people know about this, then they\u2019ll be criticized or blamed. He thinks about how he could help them in the way only he could.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/7a26uaq7qnha1.png" alt=""></p><p>Da Vinci recaps by saying that the Chaldea established by Marisbury was evil, but later became good. The remaining staff including Romani Archaman rose to prevent the Incineration of the Human Order. Chaldea, from that point onwards, became a different organization. An organization that preserves the future imagined by humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I mean. If we\u2019re the problem, then as always, we\u2019ll solve it with our brains and brawn\u2606</p><p>That man said that \u201Cthere are distortions\u201D.</p><p>Then there must be a Singularity equivalent somewhere that is under the influence of this problem.</p><p>We must detect it and prove our innocence. After that, we tackle Antarctica.</p></blockquote><p>No one has any objections to this plan. You don\u2019t object to this either and excitedly agree to this. Kadoc looks at you in the background with a delighted expression.</p><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/ymtcrhcaqnha1.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Alright! The Storm Border will now commence its worldwide exploration.</p><p>Think of it as preparation before the confrontation of CHALDEAS. We can supply ourselves endlessly.</p><p>Aside from that, this is undoubtedly an unprecedented exploration into the unknown.</p><p>Our battle up until this point has accumulated distortions. The sins of the Human Order we must confront.</p><p>It irritates me to use that man\u2019s words, but let\u2019s use it for simplicity&#39;s sake.</p><p>Operation Name \u201COrdeal Call\u201D! What lies ahead after overcoming these trials is our final destination!</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.redd.it/v61ynlbbqnha1.png" alt="Ordeal Call Prologue END"></p>', 77);
