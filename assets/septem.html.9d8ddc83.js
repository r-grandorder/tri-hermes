Kyau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning. Did you sleep well, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, like a log.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Glad to hear it. I&#39;m happy to know that you got plenty of rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that right? Senpai, you must rest as much as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As you can see, Fou is also fired up. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had more than enough sleep and breakfast.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know what it&#39;ll be like beyond the Rayshift. No telling when or how much we can rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So as much as possible, please get enough sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Staying up late is prohibited, since your magical energy is linked to your stamina.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, umm\u2013about that dream...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you see something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dream? Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, not really...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I saw anything special. It&#39;s just...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Da Vinci says that Masters and Servants under contract see the same dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what that means...But if you didn&#39;t see one, then there&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go to the command room after breakfast. The Doctor&#39;s eagerly waiting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, good morning, everyone. Although by that, I mean just you two and...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yawn! Oh, &#39;morning...The tech department is analyzing the Grail you&#39;ve retrieved as we speak.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That half-asleep genius, and myself. Please pardon the work crew for not being very reliable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re already set to Rayshift. This time you&#39;re headed to 1st Century Europe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Specifically Ancient Rome, the great empire that grew from Italy to control the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm? Ancient Rome? Really? That sounds like fun! I sort of want to go, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You have analyzing to do, I believe. Please partake of Roman pleasures some other time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, darn it. I don&#39;t care which one,but I always wanted to chat with a Roman Emperor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Especially Emperor Caligula or Nero. I bet we&#39;d have a lot in common.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I feel the same...No, we can&#39;t. You also have work to do reviving Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem! Is that clear, Fujimaru. Your teleport point is the Imperial Capital Rome.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The name of the Roman Empire&#39;s capital is also Rome. It&#39;s geographically similar to the last time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The exact location of the supposedly existing Holy Grail is unknown. There may be historical changes as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Neither can be determined. Sorry, the observation precision seems unstable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not a problem. Either way, Senpai and I will locate it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, that&#39;s the spirit. You really are reliable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Similar to the last mission, you&#39;ll reach and correct the singularity. Also, find the Grail, and either obtain or destroy it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Humanity&#39;s continuation is on your shoulders. I hope you&#39;re successful this time, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And...That you come back safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Yes. We&#39;ll make it back to Chaldea, I promise.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m counting on you, Senpai. I&#39;ll need your strength for this mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s rather your strength we need, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s...The fact is, running this mission requires your judgment and leadership.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No doubt, Servants will be summoned during the 1st Century Rome as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If possible, call upon their power. Of course, you won&#39;t get help from hostile ones.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, I have one question. May I ask it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hostile Servants and neutral Servants. Is there a way to distinguish them upon detection?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It would be best if we had the ability to distinguish them from our observation data.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For example, the ability to see if approaching Servants are enemies or possible allies\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I am sorry. Unfortunately, that&#39;s impossible right now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if we combine Sheba and Trismegistus, the best we can do is to detect lifeforms and energy readings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The ability to distinguish hostility, that lies within the realm of psychology.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For now, you can&#39;t quantify that with numbers. I&#39;m sorry, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, we can speculate from the situation. I&#39;ll warn you if there&#39;s over 70% chance of hostility.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As for non-Servant readings of local humans, I will try my best to detect them as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay, Doctor. I&#39;m sorry for asking too much of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I realize it was logically unreasonable. But, even so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was to reduce the danger, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was it to avoid fighting?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Strategically speaking,it&#39;s best to avoid unnecessary battles.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But no, I knew it was an unreasonable request. Please forget it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, forgive me. I know I&#39;m putting you in unreasonable danger...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To the best of my ability, I&#39;ll support and back you up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can promise you that much at least. Mash, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you.... Well, let&#39;s start the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Dr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quit being so gloomy! I&#39;ll back you up mentally, as well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s...It&#39;s just the sudden shift in mood is a little...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Program start!</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation.</p><h2 id="section-1-windy-hill" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-windy-hill" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Windy Hill</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Ahh. We&#39;ve successfully teleported this time, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The feel of the wind, the scent of earth\u2014the vast blue sky.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s strange. I&#39;ve seen it on film so many times,but just standing here, it&#39;s so much more vivid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re breathing deeply.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Was I? I-I see. I&#39;m sure I was doing it without thinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So Rayshifting makes you nervous?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Rayshifting makes me nervous. But, I don&#39;t think my state of mind has anything to do with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I mean, I feel overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In France, it was one shock after another. So now it&#39;s like I&#39;m finally able to face this landscape.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...Kyu, kyu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You tagged along again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you just pop out of Mash&#39;s chest?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyu! Kyau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Looks like Fou will be tagging along again. He prefers the outside world to that cramped base.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can agree with that sentiment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Battles can be scary, but it makes me happy to discover new worlds like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...But &quot;that&quot; is visible in the sky in this era as well, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That ring of light. It&#39;s the same as the one that was over France.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I mean it looks the same. Not that I&#39;ve examined it precisely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder what it could be? It&#39;s such a huge\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ring of light, huh? As usual, we can&#39;t get a good look at it from here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it is an intriguing phenomenon. I will continue to investigate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way, is that...Oh? Weren&#39;t you suppose to be in...Rome?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Uh, we&#39;re in the hills.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right Senpai. We&#39;re in the hills.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No Senpai, I don&#39;t believe this is the ancient Roman capital. We&#39;re in the hills.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird, I confirmed it from here as well. That&#39;s not the capital.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that I fixed your teleport position...Uh, looks like that&#39;s a suburb of the Roman capital.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Was there an error in the coordinates? Is the era correct?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The era&#39;s correct. Definitely the 1st Century where the singularity exists.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> During the reign of Nero Claudius\u2013fifth emperor of Rome. That&#39;s for certain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Still, this is strange. Why are we so far from the capital?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Despite the poisoning of Empress Aggripina last year, Nero isn&#39;t in his dangerously declining years yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An era where the emperor is loved, and the city of Rome is prosperous...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...that&#39;s what should&#39;ve been awaiting you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No Doctor, it&#39;s just rolling hills. All it needs is some sheep to complete it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There must be some reason for this. Do you see anything unusual in the surroundings?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I hear it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A battle somewhere?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you hear something?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I think it&#39;s the sound of a large battle. It seems to be coming from over the hill.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A large battle? A war, maybe? No, no, no. Impossible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There were no full-scale wars near the Roman capital in that era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That means\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a historical anomaly. That must be it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get to that noise!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No doubt about it, they&#39;re in combat. One side is overwhelmingly larger than the other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The larger force wears regalia of crimson and gold. The small wears the same, but a different design.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Crimson and gold were colors especially liked in Ancient Rome. Mash, anything else that&#39;s distinctive?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A woman. Several groups of the smaller force are being led by a young woman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s practically taking on the enemy forces herself. The overwhelming avalanche towards the capital, all by herself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An extremely strong individual. A Servant, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I am not getting any readings on Servants. You don&#39;t sense it either, do you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Correct.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s certain. That woman is a human of this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is just personal speculation\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But she reminds me a bit of Jeanne. I&#39;ve no basis for it, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of Jeanne? The saint who rose to defend the sacred?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm, who of this era was like that...I can&#39;t think of one. My knowledge is lacking.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any case, an impossible war is going on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s help that woman.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We must stop the city from being overrun.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I agree with your firm policy, Senpai. Even Fou&#39;s fired up.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyuu! Kyu kyu, kyu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You aren&#39;t facing Servants or monsters,but they have great numbers. Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Sheathe your swords! It&#39;s over. You there! Are you reinforcements from the capital?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I thought the capital was sealed off...No matter, I commend you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter if you were once my enemy. I am merciful, so past mistakes are water under the bridge.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> More importantly, I praise the way you fought just now. For a girl to brandish a weapon larger than herself...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Umu, I must say I like you! You showed such indescribable, aberrant beauty!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Very good, I shall allow you to fight by my side. Revel in the ultimate honor!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Still, you people sure dress in a strange fashion. Aren&#39;t you showing a little too much? Are you foreigners?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We are beyond words for your generous praise.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, yes. You may enjoy wallowing in the sweet sounds I utter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re reinforcements, just passing by.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What perfect timing! Do you serve Boudica,perhaps? Her moves are beyond shrewd.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> At any rate, this victory belongs to us. I will reward you handsomely!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh, uh, sorry.... I couldn&#39;t help myself just now.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to wait for your reward. Since I have nothing but this sword at the moment.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It will all be taken care of after we&#39;re back in Rome. Now then, follow me!</p><h2 id="section-2-all-roads-lead-to-rome" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-all-roads-lead-to-rome" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: All Roads Lead to Rome</h2><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> By the way, you people. I don&#39;t doubt that you&#39;re foreigners, but where are you from?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Surely not...Britannia. The Far East...doesn&#39;t seem likely, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re from the future.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What? If that&#39;s true, we&#39;re going to have a problem. You have my sympathies, but did you fall down the stairs perhaps?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough small talk. We still have many enemies to deal with, the second wave is coming.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Damn those restless United Empire fools! How dare they interrupt my beautiful voice!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go! You! Very striking-looking girl,I order you to serve as my shield!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Uh, right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, now we&#39;re the ones under command somehow!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Somehow we&#39;re out of the danger. You ended up saving the day again.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not uncommon to be outnumbered in war, but being on the inferior side is no fun. So tiring!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not over yet. I can sense more coming!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Servant, Mash, Fujimaru! I&#39;ve detected a single Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m sensing it. It&#39;s almost...there it is!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013My beloved younger sister&#39;s child.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Uncle!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No...No, no, let me call you this now.

Uncle? Is that what she said?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what I heard. A human living in this era, and a blood relative\u2013of a Servant?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s look into that later, Mash. No question about it, that&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, are you ready?

Then let us forget this confusing talk of Masters and Servants.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You are the mage&#39;s pupils, and the mage speaks from a distant land.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> And? You also said your goal\u2013is to aid me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. You aren&#39;t wrong about that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The center of the world, and the world itself. The name of the greatest empire that rules the world is Rome.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In this era, there should be no threat to the city. The Grail&#39;s influence must be upsetting events.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If I am right, this era&#39;s singularity is probably the existence of the great Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An empire that greatly influenced later generations. Stopping its destruction would fix the singularity.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Mm, Mm Mm...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...S-Sorry, I don&#39;t quite understand. Please speak a bit more in my range of understanding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry, he can be a bit too theoretical...I&#39;ll explain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We seek something called the Holy Grail, a magical item with special powers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s causing a great many disturbances just by being here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The odds are great that the Grail is the problem eating away at Rome now.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I see. This Holy Grail is damaging my Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It must sound astounding to you...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, neither strange nor weird. This Holy Grail. It strangely...Worries me...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Never mind, a needless concern of mine. It&#39;s just a nightmare I had once.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Right. Come with me,let&#39;s talk freely in my home.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Wait, what? Is there something wrong at the market?</p><p><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong><br> H-Hey! What&#39;s this! What are you people doing to my shop!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How dare you do this to my Rome, and my people! Are they enemy spies? Either way, it&#39;s unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, we should go too! The townsfolk are being attacked!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2013Now then. My Rome is currently endangered.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My great empire&#39;s territories are now, vexingly enough, ripped apart and scattered all over.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> On one hand, there is the true Roman Empire that I rule over. The area centered around this capital, Rome.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> On the other hand, there is an alliance controlled by multiple &quot;emperors&quot;, that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The United Roman Empire. That&#39;s what they called themselves when they stole half of my empire.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The United Empire is still a mystery to us. No matter how many scouts we send out, none ever return.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Even the location of the capital where these fake emperors gather is unknown to us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple emperors, you say?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. In my eyes, they&#39;re just a group of treacherous bandits.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> And...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...No, it&#39;s not worth mentioning. Just rebels spreading their vicious lies.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> They call themselves emperors, but they&#39;re just pretenders.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You look troubled.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s fine. You saw one of them before.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Caligula, the enemy general. The man who singlehandedly slaughtered my forces before you arrived.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> He&#39;s one of the traitors who calls himself &quot;emperor. &quot;As well as being...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...my uncle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t he be dead already?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, dear formless mage. That is correct.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Even our Court Mage was killed by Uncle Caligula, but if he was still alive you might have gotten along well.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Our mage boasted that he had overcome death. In truth, he showed me some impressive spells.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But...He was killed by that one &quot;emperor&#39;s&quot; sword.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A master of spells who shouldn&#39;t have died, yet died easily.... It shouldn&#39;t be possible, yet, he did.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To easily beat a mage of this era...That&#39;s no ordinary human. It&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That must be causing the historical anomaly. One of the &quot;emperors&quot; got hold of the Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s highly likely that is the cause of this era&#39;s singularity.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Honestly, the United Empire is very strong. Violent battles are occurring all over and the people suffer.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;ve dispatched all my serving viceroys and generals, and thrown nearly every troop at them. Yet the United Empire&#39;s power is undiminished.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Recently, an expeditionary force of theirs pressed in on the capital. They even managed to get inside.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I only had a few of my troops to defend us.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I hate to say it...But it showed me that this situation is beyond my ability to break by myself.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Therefore. I order you, no, I implore you!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Become my generals! Then Rome and I shall assist you in obtaining this Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Such a heaven-sent proposal. It seems we have a common cause.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. What do you think, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s cooperate.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ah, I see! I see! That&#39;s a quick response!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do we get a salary?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Of course. As soon as the United Empire is beaten,I shall give you what you desire.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I shall grant one of you the title of viceroy, as well as reward for the work you&#39;ve already done.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Rest well tonight. I shall prepare quarters suitable for a viceroy for you.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh yes, will the invisible mage require them as well?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about me. Supplying a room for those two will be enough.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By the way Your Majesty, have you ever heard the name Lev Lainur?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Lev? No I haven&#39;t, who is he?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A mage of our era. He betrayed Chaldea and all humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a chance he&#39;s in this era. Although, I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s revealed himself or taken any action.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A mage from a foreign land? ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard there is a powerful mage in the United Empire. It&#39;s only a rumor, but someone saw that mage on the front lines.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s possible. Your Majesty, I have a request.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Speak.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d like Mash and Fujimaru to be deployed as close to the front lines as possible.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind, but...Will Fujimaru be all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Lev Lainur is our enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We owe him some payback.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The Director will be avenged.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. We can&#39;t let him go after the way he killed the Director.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Very well. Nero Claudius will honor your request.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I shall pray to the gods and divine ancestors of Rome that your enemy be defeated.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But first, how about a feast before you rest!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Not as grand as usual due to the war, but it will still be a feast where I spare no efforts.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, do you drink? We have something special imported from the Orient!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, uh, no drinking for me thanks...</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Your Majesty! The eastern city gate is under attack by a mid-size United Empire force!</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> I think they&#39;re remnants of that expeditionary force! Our eastern gate can&#39;t hold them back!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Grr. Just as I was about to have a rare pleasant feast.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Go Mash, Fujimaru. Looks like your time has come.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be unusual if another Servant shows up as an enemy general. Stay on guard!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood.... Senpai, shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you Viceroy Fujimaru. Show those skills you demonstrated before!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The feast can wait! We&#39;ll look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy forces sighted. They&#39;re in battle formation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re facing human forces, not Servants or monsters. Take it easy on them you two.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Got it. Master, your commands please.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The sun is setting, but it seems the attack isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m worried about the enemy&#39;s numbers. Keep an eye on Fujimaru&#39;s stamina and magical energy consumption.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes Doctor. Master, try not to exert yourself too much.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s getting dark, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The enemy isn&#39;t letting up. As expected in the age of close combat, they all have incredible stamina!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Still, this is where you need to make your stand. Don&#39;t let your guard down, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. The enemy is retreating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There didn&#39;t seem to be any Servants among them. They were all human soldiers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No mages that could be Lev, huh? Anyway, good job. It&#39;s gotten really dark.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head back, Senpai. If there&#39;s a night raid, we&#39;ll be in for another battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You should rest while you can. Didn&#39;t I tell you as much this morning?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, you did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sleepy yet...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha! Then I think I&#39;ll go back to my room and sleep.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have to check Magi\u2606Mari&#39;s blog too. She should&#39;ve updated her diary by now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-Why are you looking at me like some sort of pitiful creature? What&#39;s wrong with internet idols?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re truly the ideal &quot;idols,&quot; untainted by the hand of the media, TV networks, or even morals!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t the outside world destroyed?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ve noticed a vital point. The outside world has definitely been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means Magi\u2606Mari and that HP will no longer be updated...Is that what you think?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fool! Magi\u2606Mari is a supreme idol who has transcended beyond this world&#39;s circumstances!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Well actually, she&#39;s been recreated as an auto-generated AI from her original data.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, it&#39;s not my place to comment on the hobby of a 30-year old bachelor, but please do your job.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Otherwise, I&#39;ll be forced to delete that &quot;secret&quot; folder of yours.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> C-Come on now, it&#39;s a joke! I&#39;m always checking your surroundings and finding data!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, get some rest you two. The Emperor&#39;s also waiting for your report.</p><h2 id="section-4-burning-mountain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-burning-mountain" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Burning Mountain</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good morning Your Majesty, I actually have an important favor to ask of you.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, ask me anything! I am quite generous!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In order to stabilize our activities in this era, I&#39;d like to go to Mount Etna.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A leyline crucial to our mission exists in that volcano.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Etna, huh? The Court Mage used to go to Etna a lot too. Hmm, but why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We need to set a terminal point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So we can bolster our troops.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I see. I&#39;m not sure I understand, but I&#39;ll grant you permission.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If you go to Etna, will it be for me and for the sake of my Rome?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Your Majesty. Of course.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Very well. While my investigation of the United Empire prevents me from going\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You may do as you wish. Be prepared for enemy soldiers along the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...We arrived more easily than expected. Isn&#39;t this a vital region to the United Empire?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait Doctor, it looks like something&#39;s already swarming around the leyline!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ghost-type monsters? If it&#39;s naturally occurring, that&#39;s quite a leyline!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s eliminate them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Secure the leyline!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger Master!

Oh, could it be that this time it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He must be busy with Sheba&#39;s maintenance, so I guess he doesn&#39;t have the time.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ve completed the summoning circle.

Thank goodness there were fewer battles than I expected.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? No, wait, I am still detecting some magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did it get drawn by the energy that was leaking before the circle was established?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Oh...oh...oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, the opponent is a non-physical type. Your battle commands!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013No sign of any nearby enemies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This time we&#39;re safe for sure. Let&#39;s head down while keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Foooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> United Roman Empire...They seem to have taken in Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who is the mastermind anyway? Is it Lev Lainur, or perhaps\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I still can&#39;t pick up anything, but if there&#39;s a Servant here it&#39;d be hard to avoid combat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Servants are being implemented in wars without hesitation. This is clearly unusual.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you weren&#39;t here, the emperor would&#39;ve been killed for sure.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Please do your best, I&#39;ll proceed with my analysis.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do your best, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ah, you&#39;re back, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I know you only just returned, but I&#39;m thinking of launching an expedition to Gaul.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s to aid and give encouragement to my fellow subordinates. Of course, if I don&#39;t go there&#39;s no point.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;d like Fujimaru and Mash to join me. Well? Will you come?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What should we do, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The emperor&#39;s given me details of the situation. Gaul seems to be a front line in the war with the United Empire.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a chance that the Servant with the Grail could be rampaging there. Lev could be there too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think you should go with her. Naturally, it&#39;ll be dangerous, but\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll do our best and be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right Senpai, I agree.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s decided!

[\u2642 The boy who looks like a rookie. /\u2640 The girl who&#39;s doing her best. ]Are you the guest commander I&#39;ve heard so much about? I guess looks can be deceiving.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Thank you for travelling so far. I&#39;m Boudica, general of the Gaul expedition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Boudica\u2013?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes Boudica, the &quot;former&quot; queen of Britannia, and this huge fellow here is...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Another champion who was invited to the battlefield. You should be pleased, this garden of battle is full of oppressors.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The oppressors are committing atrocities as they approach. It is time to rise up. Let us battle side by side. You who dare defy this unparalleled tyranny.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right. His words baffle me, but I have a feeling...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> H-Huh? Whoa, that&#39;s extremely rare. Spartacus hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Let me correct myself. He hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight, without then pouncing on them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...Doctor, this giant over here is. )</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> (Fouuuuuu...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Y-Yes, he&#39;s definitely a muscle. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (I mean a Servant. That&#39;s what the reading says. Definitely a Servant. Let&#39;s leave it at that. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (He doesn&#39;t seem to have hostile intentions. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I can&#39;t translate what he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s looking at us, but what does he mean by &quot;You who defy tyranny&quot;\u2013? )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (My guess is he&#39;s a Berserker. Yes, he must be...Maybe...)</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Warrior of the rebellion, give me your name. Let us revolt together against the inhumane empire and shout in triumph under a free sky.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> My name is Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did he ask for your name just now? Is that what it was?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Neither do I...He&#39;s got this extremely carefree smile, but that&#39;s all I&#39;m getting...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? He&#39;s smiling while saying all that? His Madness Enhancement must be incredible.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That being said, I suppose this proves that even in this era, stray Servants do exist.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For some reason, unlike hostile Servants, there are also those who have free will, stand by their era, and fight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It has been confirmed in two eras. I am sure it will be the case for all the singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we count Fuyuki, this makes the third time\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At any rate, this is encouraging. This way we know we&#39;ll have allies even without summoning.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Ummmm, are you the Invisible Mage?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh excuse me, let me introduce myself. I am Roman, and...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I am Mash Kyrielight,this is Fujimaru...The viceroy.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;ve heard your names before, news of you travels even out here. They are the honored guests, aren&#39;t they, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Mm. D-Did you say something? It seems I am a little tired. Boudica, take care of our guests.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Tell them about the situation here in Gaul. I have a terrible headache. I&#39;m going to lie down for a bit.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Understood. Leave these youngsters to me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m counting on you. Fujimaru,you must be exhausted, too. You should get some rest.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> I bring news! An enemy scouting party has been discovered!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...Can we pursue them?</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> We can&#39;t catch up to the enemy soldiers&#39; speed! At this rate, it&#39;s possible they&#39;ll get away!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, you&#39;re right. A group of them are leaving the camp and making off with intel on us!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think we should strike,Mash and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sometime we can&#39;t let them go.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013So that&#39;s the story. I think we&#39;ll be in your care for a while.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh? From a foreign world? I see, I guess such things can really happen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you for your understanding. Boudica, was it? You&#39;re a Servant too, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Doctor.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, you don&#39;t have to hold your tongue. Yes, I &quot;should be dead&quot; already.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I see you find that strange. How did Queen Boudica become a Roman general, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. In the history that I&#39;m aware of, you\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never forgive Emperor Nero or Rome. I even swore it to the Celtic gods.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...And then I materialized. To this era right after my death, of all things.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I thought maybe it was my chance for revenge,but when I saw Rome overrun by the United Empire...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> My body moved on its own. Not for Nero&#39;s sake, but for the people who live there.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...Or did I feel guilty towards the Londinium fellows, whom I brutally murdered for the sake of my vengeance.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really know myself. But when I think about it, I&#39;ve always been like that.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I think fighting to protect something is just my personality. That&#39;s what seems most natural to me.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> So my apologies to Nero, who wrongly sees me as a &quot;worthy living opponent,&quot; but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you keeping your Servant status a secret?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you keeping your death a secret?</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, because somehow she&#39;s more dangerous than before. If she becomes overly concerned about me, who knows what she would do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Understood. You&#39;re a proper Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A hero whom others aspire to be. The symbol of strength used to suppress villainy and save others.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Nyahaha, I was just doing it on a whim...Although if that&#39;s how I look to you, who am I to disagree?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t many Heroic Spirits who could put it like that. Queen Boudica, your pride is dazzling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai. Um, are you keeping up with the conversation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think so. Sorry, I&#39;ll explain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s okay. I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right. Ms. Boudica is, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s a Heroic Spirit, a Servant. She was killed by Nero&#39;s army just before this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She was the Queen of Britannia, which was overrun by Rome. Now she stands with Nero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I do have a question, though. I mean, why\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that difficult. I dislike the United Empire more than Nero.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You feel the same way, don&#39;t you Spartacus? You intend to fight a legion of oppressors.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous to say this, but she isn&#39;t the enemy. You don&#39;t consider yourself to be Nero&#39;s ally, do you?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Hahaha, the walls of the colosseum have fallen. Soon, all of this land shall become my colosseum.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You see?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (I wonder if she possesses a special skill. Like Madness Comprehension...or something? )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Anyway. Both of them are Heroic Spirits and Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just like in Orleans, right? In a singularity, multiple Servants will materialize.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But not all of them are enemies. Some have wills of their own and stand on the side of justice.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You&#39;re embarrassing me. I&#39;m not all that.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong><br> Hahaha! Behold, this muscular body is proof of the uprising. The oppressors shall know any injuries inflicted are my strength.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There, you see? Spartacus is embarrassed, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, did you understand what he said?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I got the gist.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? R-Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not one bit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t think so. I didn&#39;t catch any of it either...</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> \u2013All right, shall we get started then?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I don&#39;t doubt your skills, but...Ah, actually, maybe I do.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Right now, the United Empire controls most of Gaul. Not even we can drive them out.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> The ruler of Gaul\u2013One of the &quot;emperors,&quot; is strong.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing excessive about him, body or mind. He&#39;s a top-notch hero in both looks and skills.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Do you have the strength to fight him head-on? Or should I use you as back-up?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> My apologies, but could I put your abilities to the test?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? I thought you were a rational queen, but it turns out you&#39;re a hero who &quot;speaks&quot; with her sword!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Ahaha, now you&#39;ve got the idea. So, shall we?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Just try not to die. When we&#39;re done,I&#39;ll whip up something delicious for you.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Of course I mean Britannia cuisine, not Roman. \u2013So, let&#39;s meet face to face and cross swords!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> My True Name is Boudica, class Rider! Be careful, because my chariot is extremely strong!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Ah.... I must say, I am happy to be proven wrong about you.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You showed me how competent you are. Thanks,I know you must be exhausted from your travels.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> My defense and Spartacus&#39;s offense matches pretty well. You held your own against us, I underestimated you!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> As for you...Mash? You&#39;re a shield-wielding Heroic Spirit, right? I really like you.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s twisted to have a weapon solely for defense, but it&#39;s far better than one solely for killing.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I mean, how can you be so reliable when you&#39;re so slim?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Reliable?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, when you wielded your shield and stood your ground...It was like you&#39;d taken root.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> If Lord Nero is the violence of fire, then you&#39;re the riches of the earth. I think you&#39;d be compatible with any Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, good answer. Indeed, indeed.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hmm, hmm. (staring)</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hmm, hmm, hmm. (staring)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Now that I look at you carefully, yes, I see. So that&#39;s what it is. If that&#39;s the case, you should have just told me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Things are getting complicated, aren&#39;t they? Even we...Ah, I just noticed. How adorable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Come here. Come on. There, there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah\u2013W-What is it, Boudica? Augh...What&#39;s with you all of a sudden...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a little sister to me. Maybe both of you are. There, there.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;m so proud of you, coming from a faraway time period. You&#39;re so strong. There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s like an aunt...or big sister.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Boudica&#39;s chest is mashing Mash...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, y-your chest...I can&#39;t breathe...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Mmm, good girl, good girl!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You called yourself Nero&#39;s ally so I was on my guard for a bit, sorry!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> But now I&#39;m in a great mood! All right, tonight I&#39;ll make you something wonderful to eat!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Your big sister here is really good at cooking Britannia cuisine. You&#39;ll eat it, won&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Thank you...Senpai, how about you? Are you hungry?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Famished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know, right? Actually, me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m just completely exhausted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah...I-I know, right? I&#39;m exhausted from traveling, too. I&#39;m sorry!</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Yes, yes! Eat, eat, and then go to sleep! That&#39;s the key to having plenty of energy!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Even if you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll force you to eat! Then after dinner\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Of course, we should take a bath! I&#39;ll even wash your back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I hate to admit this, but Roman baths are the best in the world. It goes to show that even Nero can be useful.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It feels amazing. Even Spartacus calms down when he&#39;s immersed in hot water.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um...I think you can let go of me now...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Berserkers calm down when they&#39;re immersed in hot water...This is a discovery Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No...</p><h2 id="section-7-take-back-gaul" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-take-back-gaul" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Take Back Gaul!</h2><p><strong>United Empire Soldier:</strong><br> I have a report, Your Majesty.

What did you say your name was?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t fall silent. Even if it&#39;s on the battlefield, be eloquent.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Or do you intend to fight without giving me your name? Is that the way of the current Roman emperor?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Now then, speak. Who is the one who would force me to take up arms, what is your name?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2013Nero. I am the fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My name is Nero Claudius. I will take you out pretender to the throne!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I like how you announced yourself. Otherwise it would all be so dull.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You, guest commander! Thank you for coming from a distant land.

In other words...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Gaius Julius Caesar.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Wh-What? That&#39;s...the name of the ruler who preceded our first emperor...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But...You&#39;re dead...How can this be?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already met Caligula, I presume? Then you should already know.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> We&#39;re &quot;genuine. &quot;Both myself...and him.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Ugh.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Try to relax. You are beautiful, truly beautiful. Your beauty can match any other treasure in the world.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> You, Demi-Servant, you too are beautiful. Very nice indeed. Nice body, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I admire your courage, strength, and beauty. Therefore, I shall tell you one thing.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> The Holy Grail is located in a castle within the United Empire&#39;s capital. More precisely, in the hands of our Court Mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mage\u2013Can you tell us the name of that person?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I can&#39;t. Your reward ends here for I have no reason to tell you more.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Now, Emperor Nero, your hardship is not something I wish for.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> But I have my own reasons to fight. I want that Holy Grail for myself as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> They say once a Servant has obtained the Holy Grail, they can get any wish granted\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> This is rather greedy as I am already dead, but I must fulfill the promise that I made.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> ...Well then. It&#39;s time for me to be serious.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a while, so I needed exercise. The poor golden sword also needs occasional use.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> &quot;Serious? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This presence\u2013Please be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His magical energy level is rising? No, he&#39;s unleashing what he&#39;s been holding back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I guess our opponent has gotten serious! Or rather, he didn&#39;t fight seriously until now!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I came, I saw. Now, I must conquer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mm, mmm...Did we...get him?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I can detect his readings are getting weaker. You&#39;ve won. Congratulations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your sword was very powerful, but as long as I have Senpai&#39;s instructions I can block it.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> Hmm, being taken out by beautiful women isn&#39;t so bad.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> It&#39;s not feasible for me to act like a mere soldier anyway. Seriously, I was helpless against that person&#39;s weirdness.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That person\u2013?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, the true emperor of this era. That person is surely waiting for your arrival in the capital.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not an emperor to be exact, but none of the past &quot;emperors&quot; can stand up against that person.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> When you see that person&#39;s name and face,I wonder how you&#39;ll react? I can&#39;t wait.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong><br> I am not being sarcastic. You are beautiful,no matter what expression you may have\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> He&#39;s gone...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What&#39;s this...Is this some sort of magecraft...or...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Servant death.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What did you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Like Senpai said, that Servant has lost his life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s left this world.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What did you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Like Senpai said, that Servant is gone from this world.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant disappears when facing death. Their temporary body dissipates, and their experience is sent back to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t quite understand...What that bastard, no, &quot;that man&quot; said earlier.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He is a Servant. A deceased human transcended into a different form.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I made you personally kill the once great ruler Caesar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nero\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, nothing. Umu! I commend you for defeating one of the &quot;emperors. &quot;</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Now Gaul is truly under my command. We have shown the United Empire what we can do!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Just as I wished, just as my people wished, the Rome blessed by our ancestors and gods is returning to us!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I will bring Rome back into my hands! Until then\u2013Until then, no matter what, I cannot afford to stop here.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...So Caesar was defeated.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Yes, it seems that way. I only used him because he had a wish for the Grail.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> This shouldn&#39;t cause many issues. I can summon as many new Servants as I want.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> If there&#39;s an issue, it&#39;s this foolish Berserker. Isn&#39;t it obvious that Berserkers are fools?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I was surprised he would defy my orders. Is blood thicker than water? What a joke.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> For my destiny...My beloved niece Nero...is irrelevant...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Beautiful child...Nero, you will be loved, loved, so loved...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Therefore...In my destiny...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Hmph, I regret not having a Command Spell. However, I have quite the spell ready for you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You will kill your niece with your own hands. Then,drowned in regret, you will destroy everything else in this era.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That said\u2014You likely don&#39;t have enough intellect left to regret.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> My, my, Servants truly are inconvenient beings.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> No matter how legendary you are, or how much superhuman strength you possess, in the end you are just mere familiars.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> With the power to change the world at will, yet that freedom is not allowed. Talk about irony.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Say, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Well then.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh, excuse me. Come to think it, you are a Servant too.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> \u2014Heh, that&#39;s why you must obey me. If anything called destiny exists for you, I am it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> The utter annihilation of this era. The death of Emperor Nero, the collapse of ancient Rome, the death of humanity.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> That\u2013is my duty, bestowed upon me by our king.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Then, it is time to replenish our lost personnel. The summoning ritual is almost finished.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> This is different than the incomplete one in Chaldea. I can truly summon Servants at will.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> We were created as such. With this summoning ritual,I stand at the end of this world.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Servant, Lancer. True Name, Leonidas. I will serve you from here on.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Oh, a Heroic Spirit from Thermopylae. Not bad. Use your full powers to eliminate Nero Claudius\u2013</p><h2 id="section-8-the-trip-back-home" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-the-trip-back-home" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: The Trip Back Home</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Did you hear what that farmer said just now? The traveler we passed yesterday said the same thing.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That &quot;an ancient god has appeared. &quot;Could it be true?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wonder. It&#39;s an interesting phrase. If he said&quot;ancient god,&quot; could it be from the Age of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be precise, it&#39;s the fourth time we&#39;ve heard it. None of them seemed to be lying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> &quot;An ancient god appeared on an island in the Mediterranean. &quot; For a rumor, it&#39;s very specific.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Well, Gaul faces the Mediterranean. It&#39;s not unusual to hear such rumors...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But after hearing it over and over, I&#39;m intrigued. Though we&#39;re on our way back to Rome now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, it is intriguing, huh? I mean, I&#39;m extremely intrigued.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It may have to do with the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...I don&#39;t know about that. Caesar said their Court Mage has possession of it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s Lev Lainur or not,but is it possible that he moved to the Mediterranean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And is claiming to be a god. It&#39;s a likely story.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, well, he could be a real god.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think we might&#39;ve misheard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, we&#39;ve heard it multiple times for sure. Senpai, have you forgotten?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An island where a god lives, huh. Ah, that sounds so romantic!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An ancient god in the 1st Century! The supposedly gone Divine Spirits returned to the land once more!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Question Doctor, is materialization of Divine Spirits really possible?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s difficult. So much so that it&#39;s nigh impossible. At least, it&#39;s not possible with Chaldea&#39;s system.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Divine Spirit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, a Divine Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Divine Spirit, not Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It is different than a Heroic Spirit. It is said to be a higher being than elementals.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Divine beings are mentioned in many legends of this world. Sometimes as a natural phenomenon, or symbols of authority.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They are what you may call God, or gods. Just think of Divine Spirits as a term to define them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re already gone from the face of the Earth. Perhaps they never existed in the first place?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to understand with magecraft developed after Anno Domini. After all, we can&#39;t observe them in our time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When you pray to the gods in times of trouble, they don&#39;t give help that easily do they?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Maybe that was a bad example. In any case, they &quot;do not exist. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, several pieces of supporting evidence exist. Hence we predict Divine Spirits exist in a higher dimension.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At the very least, they won&#39;t do anything directly. No, they can&#39;t do anything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyways, it&#39;s impossible. The world has long been that of humans and civilization.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if there was a kind god, realistically they wouldn&#39;t be able to regain a lost future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re the only ones who can possibly save the world and its future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s get back to an earlier topic. Whether or not a Divine Spirit can materialize as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They can&#39;t. That&#39;s the answer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if &quot;they&quot; were inclined to do so. Even if technology reached realms of True Magic, it&#39;s disadvantageous.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In theory, it should not necessarily be impossible though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, the god of the Mediterranean\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably not a god from somewhere. Probability of a materialized Divine Spirit is quite low.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, there might be that one in a million chance if it&#39;s a god that fell from its throne.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This is pointless. Umu, if it&#39;s on our minds so much, fine!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It would be a good idea to verify. Fortunately, we&#39;re facing the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Your Majesty! Rear ranks are being assaulted by an unknown monster!</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> We can&#39;t hold it down! At this rate...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Mm, perfect timing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I am detecting traces of magical energy. It could be the Holy Grail that&#39;s causing the monster to spawn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s quickly deal with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Be careful, but be quick.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. Commencing battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013The battle has ended. There are no reinforcements.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahh, how awful. To think that spirits of the dead would materialize on their own.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m used to it. So, uh, what were we talking about\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Right, that Mediterranean god! Personally, I&#39;d really like to find out about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure? Don&#39;t you need to return to Rome?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what this ancient god may be, but what if it&#39;s truly one of the gods?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s not impossible, right? There are Roman legends.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> For instance, Romulus the founder and first king of Rome became the newest god after he disappeared in lightning.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Things like that occasionally happen. Ancient gods. How amusing.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Further, assume they are gods of Rome. If the United Empire&#39;s &quot;emperors&quot; took that god away, we&#39;d have bigger problems.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want that. That&#39;s the one thing I absolutely cannot stand.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see, Your Majesty&#39;s words are reasonable. As guest commanders, we&#39;d be happy to accompany you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Aren&#39;t you enjoying this too much, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true! I just can&#39;t hide my overflowing curiosity as a researcher!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fu...Kyu, kyu. Fou.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on Nero, say something...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nero? Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Hmm, what? No, I&#39;ve decided. A triumphant return from the sea might not be so bad!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Then, we&#39;ll continue our journey back through the sea. I&#39;m rather tired of traveling on land!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (She spaced out just now. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Right. This must be what Boudica was talking about. )</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There&#39;s something I&#39;m worried about. Something about Nero.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It happened right after you got here. I wonder if you noticed.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> She occasionally spaces out. She been like that ever since the United Empire showed up.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I think it might be just me, but when it happens,I feel a slight trace of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s a human from this era, not a mage. Still, I definitely feel it.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I asked her about it, but she doesn&#39;t feel it at all.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Can you guys keep an eye out? I mean, about her.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> As the governors of Gaul, Spartacus and I must to continue protecting this place.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> About her...If possible, I&#39;d like to rely on you all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. You are...worried about Nero aren&#39;t you.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t worry about her at all! ...It&#39;s not something I want to do personally.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> For better or for worse, she&#39;s the symbol of this land. If something happens to her, it would be a war lost.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to lose another war. That&#39;s the only reason I care about her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Well then, that&#39;s that. Mash, we still have time, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Before you leave, I will teach you the best of Britannia cuisine!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;d be happy if you learned it and made it your specialty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, that&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You&#39;re so cute, you should start training to be a bride!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh, geez, so cute! Come here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Wah! Again\u2013Your breasts\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There, there. Good girl, good girl.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You stay cheerful forever. Don&#39;t get too hurt, and don&#39;t be too reckless.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> You really are an adorable girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes, well, I-I am Senpai&#39;s...Um...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> There, there! I am so happy to see you grow into such a fine lady!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Yeah, I definitely sensed a trace of magical energy in Nero. But that might just mean she has the potential to be a mage. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I wonder what it is. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Hmm, we don&#39;t have enough info...)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> All right, then it&#39;s settled! Let&#39;s go, we must first hurry and procure a ship!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Before that, Master look, the enemy army remnant. I feel their presence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, I have detected multiple lifeforms. I am getting hostile readings from the United Empire troops in Gaul.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;d leave them be if they&#39;re fleeing home, but if they&#39;re headed here it can&#39;t be helped. Let&#39;s defeat them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s more or less taken care of. Now then, let&#39;s regroup and head out to the sea.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s good to travel by sea. Fujimaru,let me show you my brilliant sailing skills!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Right? Right? Heh, heh, such a honest fellow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m a bit worried.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No need to be embarrassed. Heh, heh, you&#39;re bad at hiding your feelings, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The emperor is amazing! Whatever you say, she interprets it in a positive way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><h2 id="section-9-secret-of-the-ancient-god" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-secret-of-the-ancient-god" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Secret of the Ancient God</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, that was some nice wind!

I could tell by your vitals.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The soldiers couldn&#39;t leave the ship either. Oh, poor men!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since the emperor offered to take the wheel herself, I thought she had impeccable skills.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But wait, maybe, just maybe!

Doctor, this is different from what we talked about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-Yeah, I guess everything has an exception. O-Oh this is unheard of, a Divine Spirit Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Furthermore, one of &quot;the&quot; ancient Greek gods! That&#39;s an authentic god!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is that possible? She is actually standing before you. Even so, there&#39;s no way she can remain &quot;as a god. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s the same for Heroic Spirits. Her power must&#39;ve been downsized.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gods no longer have &quot;Authority&quot; on this land.

Allow me to inform all of you clueless people.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Not all gods are powerful. &quot;Myself&quot; and I are quite &quot;feeble&quot; beings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Based on the readings you are quite an individual...So does that mean you&#39;re not hostile because your combat abilities are low?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> There are goddesses who are never asked to fight. For instance, you over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You mean me?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> You are one such, no? Your power is not to kill, but to protect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It is.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Hehe, I do like honest girls. I&#39;d like to pamper you like I do to my &quot;little sister. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Oh, I just got a shiver. )</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> (I had a shiver, too! )</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Wait. I&#39;m detecting another presence on the beach!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How dare they interrupt an emperor and a goddess. Who are they? From the United Empire?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No, they&#39;re just ghosts. But they are closing in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s drive them off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s ask them to leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes Senpai, commencing interceptive combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Anyway! Stop leaving me out of the conversation!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I get the gist of what you&#39;re saying. That goddess isn&#39;t our enemy, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmm, in that case, isn&#39;t it simple? Ancient Goddess Stheno, come to Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I am Rome. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I shall accept you as a new god. Let us defeat the United Empire together!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Well now, how dazzling you are,as much as Apollo. But I&#39;m sorry, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I am not suitable for combat.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve taken on the form of a Servant, I do have some skills and basic functions, but...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I don&#39;t possess the power to fight valiantly like my younger sister.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I said I don&#39;t have the power\u2661 You&#39;ll get stabbed in the back if you don&#39;t stop being insensitive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Sorry, I get it. She&#39;s more of the type of goddess who hunts her prey, I guess.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> But, you are a hero who came all the way here.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I should give you a reward. Though back in the day, I would&#39;ve incited Medusa\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Incited?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I heard nothing</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Incited?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you say incited?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Ahem, hehe. Never mind! I&#39;ll give you a goddess&#39; blessing.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> As you walk along the coast, you&#39;ll find an entrance to a cave. All the way in the back...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I prepared a treasure. It doesn&#39;t exist in nature, it&#39;s something special.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give it to you because you&#39;re fun. Haha, I don&#39;t usually reward someone like this.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Well, a goddess&#39; blessing...That&#39;s really...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s interesting. It could be the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t match up with Caesar&#39;s information. That said, I think there&#39;s still a chance...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care what kind of treasure it is. I try to love everything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right then, let&#39;s head for the cave now!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s so dark, and clammy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not exactly comfortable in here, is it? It&#39;s hard to see ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, is something wrong? Your face...no, I mean your voice sounds funny.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been deceived. Forgive me,multiple magical energy signatures up ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re not Servants, but a type of monster. Does this mean...that goddess...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Set us up? Oh, hahaha...</p><p><strong>Skeleton Soldier:</strong><br> (clank, clank, clank)</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on here? This cave is full of skeletons!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s hope they&#39;re just skeletons...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Multiple signatures incoming! I think a lot of skeletons are coming...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mm, mmm, mmm! Sword-wielding skeletons aren&#39;t treasure by a long shot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please give me your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Phew, I&#39;m getting a little exhausted...I want to go back and rest...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But what do you know? Looks like we reached the back of the cave while fighting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting a unique signature there. This amount of energy\u2013No, that&#39;s not possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Doctor? Could the Holy Grail really be here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No...no, it&#39;s not the Holy Grail at all! It&#39;s a Phantasmal,not a dragon, but a powerful mystical beast!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> GARRRRRRRRRR!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s so huge! Oh, but that lion has a cute face!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a chimera, a legendary beast of ancient Greece. This is not a product of magecraft, but a true mystical beast!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why would a thing like this be here? Oh, I know why. That goddess.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s powerful and has considerable toughness, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger. Master, commencing battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Haha. Welcome back, did you enjoy your special reward to the fullest?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m tired...so exhausted...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sure...Consecutive battles in a closed space will wear you out beyond belief...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m totally wiped out...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, I think you should rest immediately...Should we return to the ship?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is nothing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure? Senpai, at times you display extraordinary endurance...</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Really, you&#39;re so lame! I could&#39;ve taken on a big cat like that without breaking a sweat!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, I&#39;m sensing two enemies. Either lizards, dragons, or maybe idols...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, we&#39;re going to take them out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s Elisabeth!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know, I know!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But she&#39;s dangerous, Senpai. I have a feeling that she might screw everything up!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I agree...Let&#39;s pretend we don&#39;t notice her,so we can get away with it Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s beat them up!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the right choice. I&#39;m sure they will bring up some absolute nonsense!</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What, that reaction again! You ugly, weird deerlet!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, a weird person told me I&#39;m weird!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s the weird one.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hmph, I guess that cave was really tough. Well, it can&#39;t be helped with the Puppy&#39;s ability.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Who the hell are you, appearing all of a sudden and talking nonsense?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Who the hell are YOU? Oh, I&#39;m not sensing any magical energy...wait a human? You?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Not sure why you&#39;re so surprised. You are rude and insensitive. I would have slashed you already if you didn&#39;t look so cute.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m Nero Claudius, the emperor of this era.... Um, why are you looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Are you kidding me? The real Nero?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The real...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What do you mean by &quot;real? &quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is worse than France! I&#39;m even more confused about what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Anyway, when I materialized in this world I dragged these two with me.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t feel like I&#39;d be able to complete the Heroes&#39; Cave on my own.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> So I had these two serve as my testers for the cave, that&#39;s all I think?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hmph, it was a totally boring dungeon. Oh, but a live show in an underground cave is a new concept, right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahaha!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> So you know Elisabeth. What about this one?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh no...we&#39;ve never met. Although, I know she&#39;s a Servant\u2014</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Ahahaha! All right, let&#39;s introduce ourselves!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I am Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I tag &quot;woof&quot; at the end of my sentences. My hobby is cafe management. My favorite food is carrots.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Hmm. That&#39;s pretty inconsistent even for me. Woof woof.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> She talked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She did that on purpose, too. Woof!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Neutral, huh? I&#39;m glad she&#39;s not a hostile Servant. Or maybe I should say I&#39;m glad she&#39;s not our ally?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I was laughing because it was fun. I&#39;m a laughing drunk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, s-sure.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I&#39;m Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine! Can I speak in cat language?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What&#39;s the Tamamo Nine?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> No? How about dog language?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Hehe! Your reaction was better than I thought. It requires technique to communicate with her.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Thank you, Tamamo Cat. But why weren&#39;t you in the treasure chest?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> You were supposed to be the last trick. After they dealt with the chimera, you should&#39;ve come out.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Now I&#39;ll get my carrots as the reward!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Did you eat the chest? Oh my...okay. I understand.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> H-Hmm. Their conversation seems to be working out...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> She&#39;s a goddess after all. She doesn&#39;t even flinch at that oddball.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, well. Though this island has been somewhat fun,I guess we came here for nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sound like it&#39;s not your problem...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahahaha! It happens! Don&#39;t look so depressed. Why don&#39;t we return to Rome for now\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it looks like we can&#39;t! There&#39;s a Servant over there!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? (\u2190Servant)</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Indeed. (\u2190Servant)</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Oh? (\u2190Servant)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doc? (\u2190Demi Servant)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, that didn&#39;t come out right! There&#39;s another Servant besides you guys, it&#39;s coming from the sea!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> My!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> My! My...actions...are...fate!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Sacrifice your life! Sacrifice your flesh!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Uncle?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? Who? Nero&#39;s uncle?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> He seems to be pretty &quot;tangled up. &quot;That&#39;s how one should deal with Servants, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> \u2013That&#39;s just bad taste.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Beautiful...You&#39;re beautiful...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You popped out of nowhere and now you&#39;re hitting on girls? W-What&#39;s with you, I know I am an attractive idol and all.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But acting like a lowly beast is the worst! What kind of royalty are you?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Beautiful...Really beautiful! You are beautiful!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I want to take it, lust over it, and tear it apart. Your purity, your divine beauty, everything!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> I want to trample all over you with my entire body! I...love...you, my beloved sister&#39;s child\u2013</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> \u2013Nerooooo!!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. You are a beast. You are no longer my uncle!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My uncle is dead. I still can&#39;t stop thinking about his regrettable death.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But still, if you appear before me after being lost in death...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Then I shall sing a requiem for you. Know it&#39;s my duty as your niece, and as a proper emperor!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, this is going to be a Servant battle. Your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> Nero...Nero...My...beautiful...niece...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> You...are...so...very...beautiful...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong><br> More so than...the goddess...of the moon...More than...the radiance of...the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Uncle...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve defeated the enemy commander, Caligula. I&#39;ve slaughtered yet another pretender to the throne!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What a splendid job. Thank you Mash, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was nothing.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, it was definitely something. Now I&#39;ll have to think up another reward.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You really are kind, Fujimaru. But no need to worry, I am the emperor of Rome after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Anyways, you guys have saved me so many times.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I can assure you that the reward for the defeat of the United Empire&#39;s shall be grand.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I won&#39;t send a monster and say, &quot;Here, it&#39;s your reward. &quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Are you talking to me? You, not a Servant, but a mere human?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> The queen of this era seems to be brave.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> You might actually be a proper hero. Oh, how I wish you were a man.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, I am not a queen or a hero. Listen well, I am\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2013I am, the Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Yes of course, that&#39;s what I shall call you. The Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> As a special gift, I&#39;ll give you a real goddess&#39; blessing. This time it won&#39;t be a monster.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> It is also my thanks, for taking out a Servant who was not a hero.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> Your enemy, this so-called United Empire, and the gathering ground for their &quot;emperors&quot;\u2013</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong><br> The United Empire capital. I shall tell you its exact location.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is...an unexpected reward. Good thing we got into the cave, eh guys?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Dr. Roman didn&#39;t do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The cave had nothing to do with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Y-Yes. T-That&#39;s right. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ... (\u2190Did nothing)</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> ... (\u2190Did nothing)</p><h2 id="section-10-triumph" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-triumph" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: Triumph</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be long until we&#39;re in Rome again. Good work on the way back, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Why won&#39;t you go by horseback Fujimaru? I know, I should&#39;ve provided a chariot.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I apologize, the few soldiers left in my unit are brilliant, but none of them fights on chariots.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Your Majesty, should I provide a chariot for the next expedition?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll need one anyway. After all, next time we&#39;ll be attacking the United Empire capital!</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Sir!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, yes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your Majesty, we seem to be under attack. Enemy brigade up ahead. Multiple signatures.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s strange...We&#39;re running into the same amount of enemies as before.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Even though we already regained control of nearby Gaul.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me they&#39;re attacking from the sea! If our scouts haven&#39;t noticed, then...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The scouts were discovered and killed. We might be dealing with an elite battalion.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, that explains it. But if so, that would mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s as I feared. I&#39;m detecting even more enemies now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Brave soldiers, please be safe. I&#39;m going to do what I can.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Good luck to you too, Miss Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your orders please, Master. Commencing battle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Those soldiers just now\u2013They&#39;re not like the ones we&#39;ve run into before.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Not that they looked much different, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> True, rather than human soldiers, they feel like Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yet they&#39;re not really Servants per se. Doctor, do you have an idea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can think of several possibilities. Not good. Things like this are typically related to Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And I don&#39;t mean typical Noble Phantasms. The type that&#39;s designed for use on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In which case\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master, I&#39;m sensing the presence of a Servant. There&#39;s one...no, several hundred!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same presence from before. But I can only tell that one of them is an actual Servant.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Enemy attack! Several hundred enemy soldiers!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Is this an ambush? Where did several hundred enemies come from?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s not an ambush. I chose to defend this place, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> You people trespassed into my stronghold. So I shall defend it.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I will crush any and all enemies more valiantly than any attack, and far stronger than any defense.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> This is how we Spartans fight. You will soon experience it for yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Did you just say Sparta? Then you are\u2013</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Servant, Lancer. My True Name is Leonidas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s not hiding his True Name. Just like last time,this is far different than a normal Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Leonidas? You introduce yourself as King Leonidas of Sparta?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Precisely. It is an immoral war, but I&#39;m still going to destroy you.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What! You are the legendary Leonidas,the guardian of the Hot Gates!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So the &quot;emperors&quot; aren&#39;t the only ones who came back? Hmm, then what about Boudica?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Stay focused on the battle!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> U-Umu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We met Elisabeth, too, remember?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ah, now that you mention it. Hmm, but then is Boudica...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Is she also dead? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Or was she alive? I told her, &quot;This time, surrender yourself to Rome. &quot; Thinking that was the case...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Never mind that Nero, there are many enemies. We must strengthen our defenses!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> U-Umu, our unit is quite small. I hope we&#39;re able to defend...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we defeat the main Servant, the remaining hundreds should be gone. In that case\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s a Servant battle. Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Just as I thought, huh? In a battle with nothing to protect...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> He vanished? So he wasn&#39;t meant to exist in this world after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He was a formidable enemy. Just what you&#39;d expect of the ultimate defensive Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No signs of Servants or humans around us. No Phantasmals, either.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s head back to Rome! Mash, Fujimaru, you can hold your heads up high!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, you in particular Mash. Your skills aren&#39;t as good as mine, but they are quite good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-Not really...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Haha! Hold your head up high with pride! This is our triumphant return from Gaul, after all!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Phew...At last, things have settled down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was an unbelievable crowd. It was like a festival. Senpai, you got squished pretty hard, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But you didn&#39;t seem that uncomfortable. Maybe you like that sort of thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can&#39;t be helped if it&#39;s a festival...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see, I see, at festivals, everyone becomes friendly, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Haha. I bet you didn&#39;t mind at all. That&#39;s what you call a victory wine!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ah unseen mage, you speak as though you&#39;ve actually tasted some?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha, I have a vivid imagination. Which has led me into all kinds of situations.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mash, you protected us well. Do you not like being touched?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> As expected, the great warrior of shield swore loyalty only to me. It makes me like you even more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-Thank you. It&#39;s nice of you to say that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you looking at me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad that she likes you</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes...Well, no. Nothing. I have nothing to say.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Your Majesty! The special expedition force is heading back to Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What\u2013? Those people are coming back?</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, both generals are alive and well! But now they are tied down due to a massive attack by the United Empire!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s not good. I&#39;m sorry, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Senpai, your orders please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go help them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Orders are orders.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Understood.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> We&#39;re completely surrounded. Nothing but swarms of enemies around us.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yeah, we&#39;ll probably lose the soldiers Nero Claudius provided for us. I&#39;d like to avoid that if possible.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Find a way out of an impossible situation\u2013</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> People like you and me can get through it on our own, but it would be too harsh to force them to do that.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What should we do? ...Huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Reinforcements, huh? Though I heard Boudica and Spartacus were in Gaul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You must be Jing Ke. I recognize you from your description. Looks like we met up with them, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We made it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought it was all over</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I was a little nervous when we broke through the enemy&#39;s line, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They are human forces. The degree of risk is relatively low.</p><hr><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> You look unfamiliar, but you don&#39;t seem to be an enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No we&#39;re not, we are reinforcements from Rome. You guys are\u2013</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Let&#39;s talk later. You&#39;re Servants, too, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Then, let&#39;s find a way out together. My hope is to bring as many soldiers back to Rome as possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. Master, massive enemy troops ahead. Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have destroyed the enemy forces and sustained only minor casualties. Good work Senpai!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Thank you again, looks like I didn&#39;t lose my borrowed troops.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I&#39;m Assassin, Jing Ke. Like you, I&#39;m a guest commander under Nero Claudius.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I was drawn by the prospect of killing multiple&quot;emperors,&quot; but now I&#39;m being treated like a general.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Of course...My main activities are reconnaissance and assassination.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> It&#39;s his job to do the actual work on the battlefield. Lu Bu\u2013...hm...where&#39;s he gone after chasing those enemies?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...Hm. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be back eventually.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jing Ke. The legendary Chinese assassin? No wonder you&#39;re obsessed with killing emperors.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Huh\u2013?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Mash and Fujimaru,I see that you are visitors from another era.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I understand your circumstances. That said, it doesn&#39;t change what we must do here.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> We are here to slaughter the &quot;emperors. &quot;Me and Lu Bu.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already killed three enemy &quot;emperor&quot; Servants. It&#39;s going to be a competition with you guys.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Sure. Competition...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We are not losing to you.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve killed only two so far...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so depressed. You still have a chance to catch up.</p><hr><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> As soon as we&#39;re back in Rome,Nero&#39;s full-scale invasion of the United Empire will start.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> And there comes the race. We count heads of &quot;emperors,&quot; or enemy generals.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Our team or your team, which one gets more\u2013Heh, now I have something to look forward to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Well. Something to look forward to...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...I can&#39;t, Senpai. I can&#39;t maintain the conversation. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. Me neither.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You just have to do your best</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (H-Hey, Senpai! )</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> \u2013So they failed to eliminate Lu Bu.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...What should we do, Lev Lainur?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Don&#39;t forget that I have the Holy Grail. I told you before, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I&#39;m capable of summoning Servants at will. No matter how powerful they may be!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Servant Rider, huh? Hmm, I guess, that&#39;s my class?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So? What should I do, Master?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Eliminate Nero Claudius immediately. Destroy this era, and crush the foundation of humanity.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll lend you my troops. Use them as you see fit.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Got it. In short, you want me to start a war, right?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...Exactly.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> War. War, hmm. War, huh? I guess I&#39;m very good at that.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All right, if you insist I&#39;ll borrow your troops\u2013</p><h2 id="section-11-attack-the-united-empire" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-attack-the-united-empire" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Attack the United Empire</h2><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013That sums up Nero Claudius&#39; army.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> All the details are in the report. Look it over later.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> One comment from me. Think of the enemy commander, Lu Bu as a disaster.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> The same goes for Spartacus. It&#39;s no use confronting them head-on.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> That said, these disasters can be dealt with. The two Berserkers are like automatic machines.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It should be easy to &quot;lure&quot; them. Luckily, they didn&#39;t materialize as other classes.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Guess our luck is turning. Were my Luck parameters that high?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Luck that&#39;s already played out is nothing but reality. Meaning that reality is working in your favor, nothing more.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Oh? You can look at it that way too, I guess.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter either way. I want to see her face.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Nero Claudius. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What kind of king is she? No, what kind of emperor is she, I should say.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I will make your wish come true. No matter what.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Thank you, but I kind of feel weird.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I&#39;m what you may consider a curveball as a Heroic Spirit, so my &quot;memory&quot; is a little different too.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It seems a little bit off, that you became my teacher.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Those are my words. Can you imagine being sent back in time, and becoming a vessel for a Heroic Spirit I have no connections with.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> What happened to me in my own era? Did I switch with this Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Or did the time in &quot;my era&quot; stop, and I&#39;m here as myself, integrated with this Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> ...I have no idea what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> But you came here anyway. As my new teacher.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Right, Mr. Zhuge Liang.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong><br> No. Well, as a Heroic Spirit, that may be true.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> \u2013I am Lord El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The true Roman Empire Army has started its attack. The United Empire is being invaded.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jing Ke already came back with intel. A city resembling Rome indeed exists in the specified location.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the place Stheno was talking about. This is the real blessing from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Boudica and Spartacus of Gaul, along with Lu Bu and Jing Ke.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An army commanding five Servants, including me. That is the true Roman Imperial Army led by Emperor Nero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a force that no standard army can match. Yet the United Empire force won&#39;t send in their Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No sign of Lev Lainur either. Everyday, we advance further.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We certainly have the upper hand now. The Imperial Army is marching toward the enemy capital with unbelievable momentum.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In the meantime, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> will do this\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai? Fou?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you keeping a journal?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...Senpai, Fou, yes that&#39;s right. To tell you the truth\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Doctor asked me. To keep a journal, like a military record.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, I&#39;m the one who asked. To take advantage of the fact that you became a Roman viceroy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What do you think about &quot;Novus Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;? This title is an homage to the book written by Caesar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That sounds interesting, right? Though you do have to cover the part where a god showed up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you planning to publish this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that be breach of confidentiality?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I suppose you&#39;re right. Well then, let&#39;s talk about something serious!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s assume you guys could save the world. I thought about what would come after that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if the world is saved, the tragedy of Chaldea will never be reversed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words\u2013there&#39;s no guarantee for our salary.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You understand the rest, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. You mean prevention is better than the cure,but why are you the one avoiding physical labor, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s a joke, it&#39;s a joke. Why would I count my chickens before they hatch when the world&#39;s about to end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s happening in Rome is exactly like a war. In order to grasp the situation correctly, I just use the best means.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand its purpose now. In that case, I will dispose of this journal right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Regarding the war record, I will deliver it to Da Vinci later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good! Look how well you&#39;ve been trained! Damn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash is right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a waste to throw it away.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mmm, what? What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Fujimaru always seems to be having fun. You should let me in on it, too.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Hey! You know this is not the time to be fooling around. We&#39;ve detected the enemy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, multiple signatures. I am not picking up any Servants, it&#39;s a regular military force.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmmm. I was just about to have a lovely conversation...what a disappointment...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. First, we&#39;ll get rid of them. What can mere United Empire troops do to us!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I shall take in those who surrender! Pledge fealty to my Rome, and your life will be spared!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Your Rome, I see.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we should go too. If we can crush the leading units, we can demoralize their troops.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t overdo it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s all. Already, the United Empire is without clear leadership.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> All we encountered are small random skirmishes with independent enemy units.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> It&#39;s safe to assume that the situation looks positive.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu! In other words, my army has regained its true power, right?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, I have Mash and the others, as well. These traitors have no chance against my forces!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Carelessness could be fatal, Nero Claudius. Life can be extinguished without you even knowing it.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> The United Empire defense is still formidable. That&#39;s also why we only run into weaker units.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> U-Umu. Jing Ke is so cautious.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Have you forgotten? I assassinate others for a living.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Plotting is my specialty and at the same time, it&#39;s what I&#39;m most wary of.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu...</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! Enemy troops are ahead! Also they are behind us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Behind us?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I believe General Lu Bu was in the rearguard,Spartacus as well. We can&#39;t leave them like that\u2013</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> This is not good.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Once the fight starts, those two will probably chase the enemy to the ends of the earth...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we placed them in the rearguard. To capture the capital as planned...but it backfired.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We can&#39;t lose those generals! I&#39;m sorry, Mash,Fujimaru, I am counting on you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. I just need to stop the rear enemy troops, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I am relatively good at fighting defensively. I want to emphasize...&#39;relatively. &#39;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t over do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve crushed the enemy forces, and destroyed all the monsters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We somehow made it\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not yet! Multiple signatures! What&#39;s this? The enemy forces are even stronger than before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Another battle! Master, your orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did we stop them? Looks like the rest retreated. Good job, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We were able to save Lu Bu and Spartacus. Dear me, let&#39;s take a breather.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> From now on, let&#39;s protect our rearguard as well. The enemy seems to understand how our army works.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did you sense any Servants? I couldn&#39;t detect anything from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There were no signs of such during the battle. Except for the four in our own forces. Oh wait...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jing Ke often extinguishes her presence. So to be precise, that&#39;s three Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s Assassin&#39;s Presence Concealment skill. I can&#39;t detect her from here, either.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think an Assassin is involved. In this case\u2013</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> It must be directed...There must be an enemy general who&#39;s adept at commanding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder if it&#39;s one of the &quot;emperors. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. But we will find out soon.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Wh-What&#39;s this sound? A beast howling?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s a Servant&#39;s presence. It&#39;s possible that an enemy Servant has appeared.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> A big gun like Mash and the others? An enemy commander? In that case, one of the &quot;emperors&quot;\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> First, let&#39;s draw back our men. Humans don&#39;t stand a chance against that, they&#39;ll be slaughtered!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Right, gotcha! So the instant we move Boudica to the rear, this happens?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head to the front. Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have them in my sights. That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up multiple magical energy signatures. All belong to that of necromancy, but with this number...perhaps a Caster?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple non-human, hostile creatures. We haven&#39;t confirmed the source of the roar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may be a Berserker. Master, we should eradicate this group of hostile creatures.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Pay attention to Servants!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Looks like a Servant was summoned in the enemy vanguard. Was it that Court Mage&#39;s doing\u2013</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> No, it couldn&#39;t have been. In that case, was it you?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. All I did was gallop my horse.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> I thought they&#39;d be on their way by now. I never thought it would be this soon.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Have you heard the rumors about the Mediterranean goddess? They say that aside from her, there are two female monsters.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> So you see...It hit me.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> A Chained Summon. If such a thing could be possible.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like battles that rely on luck.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t say that. You&#39;re the one who created that opening in their vanguard.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get ready now, while he&#39;s buying us time.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> About?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> If he materialized through the chained summon,then most likely he&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Yes, I think he&#39;s Darius III. The fearless Persian King and my forever rival in life.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> However, right now, I feel that I know that as a kind of future.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. I fought him once, and will fight him again.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> And I want to fight him again. But not right now.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> Right now, it&#39;s Nero Claudius. I want to talk to that person.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="2-light"></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Amazing, I can almost feel the air vibrations over here!

Good job, Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re really getting hang of fighting Servants. Your experiences are coming in handy, well done.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no Doctor, I think it&#39;s because of Master&#39;s precise orders.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Commander Fujimaru, Commander Mash,a message! It&#39;s from Her Majesty the Emperor.</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> There&#39;s been an ambush in the rear, both General Spartacus and General Lu Bu have left the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, no! So the enemy deployed a two-front attack?</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> The two generals have defeated the enemy forces, but they&#39;ve broken away in pursuit of remnants!</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong><br> Then another force launched a surprise attack from both sides. General Boudica fell into the enemy&#39;s hands and was taken prisoner!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is...Mmmm, this is not good at all...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2013Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmm? Oh, I seemed to be deep in thought. I have made my decision.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Seemed? )</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Our forces were outmatched in the previous battle...I will accept this as a stern truth.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> My generals are just as capable as the enemy&quot;emperors. &quot; But two of them left the front line, and one is captured by the enemy.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> There is nothing we can do about those two. No, it was my mistake.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It might take a little bit of time, but I&#39;m willing to believe Lu Bu and Spartacus will return to us.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Therefore, at this point\u2013We will save Boudica!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Fortunately, Jing Ke found the location of enemy fort. We will charge in, destroy the fort, and save Boudica.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, something wrong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I just feel uneasy. The one who captured Boudica is supposed to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not something a regular human can do, but why are they barricading themselves in a fort?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that far from the United Empire capital. So it should be convenient to get back there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy is trying to lure us in. Is that what this means?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If they just want to destroy our force, the approach I mentioned earlier should be &quot;better. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We have at least two Servants. They should understand that too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they cut off Lu Bu and Spartacus in such a spectacular manner.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Humans and Servants, I think the enemy has a good grasp of the clear difference.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now, Fujimaru. It&#39;s time for a decision.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to rescue Boudica.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. I knew you&#39;d say that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re too optimistic. We&#39;re at war.

Please be careful, they&#39;re very close.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up two signatures from here. You&#39;re looking at a battle with multiple Servants.

It&#39;s hard to pick one, hmm.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> \u2013All right, this is what I&#39;m gonna do.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> My name is Alexander. To be precise, that&#39;s Alexander III.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> So, he&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> Lord El-Melloi II. Due to certain reasons,or should I say fate, I am his strategist.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I am not a true Heroic Spirit.

You aren&#39;t the enemy Servants?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong><br> I&#39;m a &quot;drop out,&quot; I don&#39;t have a Master. Alexander, however, is a different story.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> I guess I didn&#39;t get along with my Master.

Arrogant to carry all the burden like so!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Even if all the Gods of Rome descend and tell her to surrender to the United Empire, she&#39;ll never back down!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How can I back down! Such is my life to believe in this philosophy, such is my fate!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I won&#39;t back down, I will rule and I will prosper gloriously. I am, without a doubt, Rome itself!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> Splendid! That&#39;s exactly what I wanted to hear.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> You pass. Go forth and become a ruler. No, an emperor! You have the right to do so!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong><br> A rose that attracts glory and prosperity!

Glory to Her Majesty, the emperor!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...I see, the founding ruler.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why she&#39;s acting like that. Such a gloomy face is sure to affect the troops&#39; morale.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Emperor Nero? She doesn&#39;t look so gloomy.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Even as we speak, she&#39;s encouraging the troops on the battlefield. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Well, she is acting cheerfully. But she&#39;s not as radiant as normal.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Well, right now we&#39;re fighting human soldiers, and the boss is hiding in the palace. It should be fine, but...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> If that big one shows up again, we&#39;ll have a problem.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> The morale of the United Empire troops is strangely high. The soldiers were all ready to sacrifice themselves.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> More so, each capital civilian is acting like a soldier, and attacking our troops whenever in sight.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I am sure this is the charisma of that Holy Progenitor. The soldiers and people are acting like moths drawn to the flame.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> It&#39;s true they seem to be acting that way.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> People of the United Empire are blind. Though that may be proof that they&#39;re under proper leadership.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> However, our troops have high morale as well. Nero...is acting no different than usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m...not sure about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand a little bit. It&#39;s her determination,or just general aura about her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It feels...a little bit lacking right now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it came as a shock for her. The founder of the nation, King Romulus, is actually the enemy leader...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Romulus?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought he was some mythological figure...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, the founding-king, Romulus. The great hero who founded Rome upon the Septem Montes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A great figure that deserves to be called the Progenitor of Rome. At any rate, he&#39;s the son of the War God Mars.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So that means his Divinity level is quite high,since Mars is the equivalent of Ares the Greek God of War\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;ll get back on track. Either way...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter if he existed in history or not. Just like I&#39;ve explained before, Heroic Spirits are the heroes people dreamt of.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, Emperor Nero must have dreamt of Romulus, as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A dream of the shining hero who created Rome. I&#39;m sure it was quite a shock when that person turned out to be an enemy.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> It would be like if I was betrayed by the Celtic gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Something like that. Maybe also adding in being betrayed by your beloved husband.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> My husband is the best husband there is. If the world turned inside-out, he still wouldn&#39;t betray me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was just an example, but it looks like it&#39;s time for you to go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It isn&#39;t a Servant, but I am getting magical energy signatures. Might be some kind of monster.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> ...I will search for a route to infiltrate the palace.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Then I will protect the soldiers and the Emperor. Mash, Fujimaru, can I leave this to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sure.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Thanks, I&#39;m going to go save our silly emperor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t expect too much from us.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Oh, but I will. Mash, you&#39;ll figure this out, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. Senpai gets things done when the need is there.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well then Master, commencing battle with the enemy creatures.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Mmm, so it&#39;s you.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Mash? Oh, the restroom? I guess this happens too.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s just you two seem to be joined at the hip, so I thought you&#39;d be together during those times too, sorry.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I made a fool out of myself, didn&#39;t I? I can&#39;t believe I&#39;d lose it like that.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Although I panicked a bit during the incidents with my uncle and Lord Caesar.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> This time, it hit home. Just a tiny bit, mind you...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> &quot;Could it be? &quot; I thought. Could it be that my path was mistaken?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Needless to say, that&#39;s not possible. I myself am Rome...its fifth emperor.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But when I heard our founding ruler&#39;s voice,though it was for a brief moment, it did cross my mind.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> &quot;Could it be? &quot;</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The other day, I put up such an act, and now I&#39;m being completely pathetic.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But it crossed my mind. Could it be possible?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Would it be better for me to just bow down to the Holy Progenitor? No, let&#39;s say it. I will say it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I wanted to. That&#39;s how I really, truly felt in my heart!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The Holy Progenitor! With all of his faults, he founded this nation!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> If my path is wrong, if that is indeed the case, then I want to entrust everything to him as an &quot;emperor&quot; of the United Empire!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do that. That is the one thing I cannot do. The Holy Progenitor is definitely mistaken.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Look at his people, look at his soldiers. Not a single one of them is smiling!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No matter how perfect the reign may be, how can there be a nation without laughter!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Which is why I...I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re not wrong. Stay on your path!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re in the middle of a battle right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I know. Oh, I know!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. I forgot something important.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No matter who the enemy might be, I must not stray from the path. I shall finish what I started.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Thank you, Fujimaru. I feel like my eyes are wide open now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m back, Senpai....

That might just be true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think she&#39;s a lot like the sun.

The enemy&#39;s noticed us\u2013They&#39;re not human.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nor are they Servants. They&#39;re probably monsters created by magecraft.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Ugh, monsters huh? Whatever they may be, I am no longer afraid!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s enemy lifeforms...Commencing battle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Here you are, my beloved child.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Umu, I am here! O proud founder of our great nation, King Romulus!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Splendid radiance. In that case, should I call out your name, &quot;Emperor? &quot;</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, there&#39;s no need. Call me what you did just now\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Whether it&#39;s the past, the present, or the future. I am the one and only Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Holy Progenitor, O King Romulus! I hereby challenge you with my warriors, my swords!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> I&#39;ll allow it, Nero Claudius. Show me you can trample over Rome&#39;s love with your love.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Behold. My spear\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> \u2013&quot;Rome&quot; is here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> An enemy Servant is approaching. Speculated class is Lancer. Battle commencing. Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> ...Your love, is so dazzling, Nero.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> My eternal crimson and gold empire. I entrust it all to you and your heirs.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget. Rome is eternal.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><br> Therefore, the world must always be eternal. Remember that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve defeated the enemy Servant, Lancer Romulus. Victory is ours.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> We won? In that case...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Umu. Rome shall be restored to its former glory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s true, more or less, but we still haven&#39;t found that Court Mage. We&#39;ve got to search for the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Hmm? But the United Empire has already met its end. Isn&#39;t that right, Unseen Mage?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s certainly true, give or take. But unless we secure the Holy Grail, our purpose will be\u2013</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Wait, someone&#39;s there. Though it&#39;s not a Servant.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> ...Well, well. To think you took out Romulus.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Nice work for a &quot;mere&quot; Demi-Servant. Have you become more powerful since I last saw you at Fuyuki?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> However, a Servant is still a Servant. Sorry,but you&#39;ll never surpass the power of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Is that the Court Mage? Then that golden chalice he has is\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s the Holy Grail. It looks similar in shape to the one we saw before...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Who could&#39;ve thought a Court Mage would ignore his king&#39;s crisis. I guess betrayal is second nature to you now, Professor Lev?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Actually, perhaps this is the real you? You seem more energetic than when you were at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Save the small talk for later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hand over the Holy Grail!</p><hr><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I see. Looks like you&#39;ve learned to talk back, [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl].</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I hear you did quite a bit in France. Thanks to that\u2014 I really got yelled at!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve been back at the Temple already, but I got sent back out!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> As a result, I am here to do some clean-up.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> My plan was to give the Grail to a fitting fool,then enjoy what would unfold. But you ruined that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. Find a human, or a Heroic Spirit who wants to plunge an era into madness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then if you give them the Grail, that era would surely drive itself into madness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what happened in France, but this time\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, the Holy Progenitor Romulus, did not wish for the downfall of mankind. That&#39;s why\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You have no other choice but to interfere yourself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite ironic, Professor Lev. In this era,the only betrayer of mankind is you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Shut it trash. I never had any hope for humans in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You either, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You think you can stop me, Lev Lainur,just because you defeated a few Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not going to go like before!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s true you&#39;ve changed. You&#39;ve grown quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You&#39;ve grown more stupid that is! Don&#39;t you know that if you try to resist, you&#39;re going to suffer that much more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are you after?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> I believe I told you, I already long completed my objective. This is what you should be asking, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> &quot;Why did you destroy humanity? &quot;</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Although, even if you did ask me, I have no reason to answer you.</p><hr><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Besides, I think you people misunderstand something. Recover the Grail, repair the Singularity,protect mankind\u2014</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Protect humanity? \u2014Idiots. There&#39;s nothing you can do.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in struggling. The end is certain. You&#39;re insignificant, worthless!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> You will perish in sorrow! Allow me to show you the favor of our King!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What&#39;s that creature! It&#39;s ugly! You&#39;re uglier than anything of this world!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Haha! Hahahaha! That&#39;s right! That ugliness will be your undoing!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...This signature, this amount of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not a Servant, not even a Phantasmal! Could that be\u2014could that be an actual &quot;Demon&quot; from legends?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Lev Lainur &quot;Flauros! &quot;</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> One of the Seventy-Two Demon Gods! The Demon God Flauros\u2013 This is the true favor of our King!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How disgusting...You are the reincarnation of evil!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A giant pillar of flesh protruding out of the ground? A large amount of magical energy...Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Flauros. He did say Seventy-Two Demon Gods. In that case, the King he speaks of is\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, there&#39;s still not enough information. That&#39;s impossible, Demon Gods do not exist!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou! Kyu, kyu, kyu, kya!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know the details, but that thing is dangerous. Here it comes! We&#39;ve got to take it out!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve defeated the enemy lifeform Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let your guard down!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> ...Impossible...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> A mere Heroic Spirit...Do you really think you can repel one of the &quot;Gods? &quot;</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> No, this is simple miscalculation. That&#39;s right, that must be it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> It&#39;s been too long since I left the Temple. My cells are starting to die off.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> But, I am entrusted with the mission to incinerate the future. It&#39;s not as if I didn&#39;t have a contingency plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is something else coming?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Watch out! I&#39;m detecting the Holy Grail&#39;s activation! Mash and Fujimaru, Something&#39;s about to happen!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> ...By sacrificing ancient Rome,I have managed to summon the strongest hero.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Rejoice, Emperor Nero Claudius. This one is truly fit to bring the demise of Rome.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Rome is the world, and the world shall never come to an end!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Even pride is nothing more than ultimate stupidity if misdirected, huh? See with your own eyes, the end of your world!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> We&#39;ll pull the bottom out on humanity! We&#39;ll destroy one of its seven foundations!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> \u2013By the esteemed words of our King!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Come forth! Great hero of destruction, Altera!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Kill. Destroy. Incinerate. With your power,burn Rome and this Singularity to the ground!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Hahaha! It&#39;s over, Romani Archaman! Your dream of continuing Humanity is nothing but a dream!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> This Servant is the ultimate destroyer! Altera is a Heroic Spirit, but her power\u2013</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> \u2013Silence.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? Lev Lainur&#39;s signature has disappeared!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He...He was cut in half by the Servant he summoned! Her True Name is Altera. She&#39;s probably a Saber.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Altera has the Grail! It&#39;s being absorbed...huh? She&#39;s absorbing it...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I am\u2013</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> A warrior of the Hun.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> And, its King.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I am the King of Destruction, the one who destroyed the western world.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Destruction\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a bad...feeling about this! Mash, something&#39;s going to happen. Even I can tell!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huge spike in her magical energy signature! This must be her Noble Phantasm\u2013an Anti-Fortress level at that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Deploy your Noble Phantasm, hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> This is what you people said.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> That I am the divine punishment itself.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> \u2013The Scourge of God.</p><h2 id="section-15-scourge-of-god" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-scourge-of-god" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Scourge of God</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I thought I was going to die.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. With the release of an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm so close, I&#39;m amazed that you&#39;re not dead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Thank you, Mash. You too, Boudica. That was great timing.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...To be honest, that was too close.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I ran in to raid the palace from the entrance, only to sense this vast amount of magical energy, so I rushed to release my Noble Phantasm&#39;s True Name as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t have blocked that with my Noble Phantasm alone. Thank you, Boudica.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Likewise. But, what are we going to do now.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Lu Bu and Spartacus were rampaging around the palace entrance and unfortunately got hit by that light.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> We can&#39;t count on them any more. We&#39;ve gotten this far...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Altera was the name, right? She\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Already started her advance from the Untied Empire&#39;s capital. Judging from the direction, she&#39;s heading for Rome.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> In that case, is she planning to burn my capital to ash?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d imagine so. Plus, she has that ability.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if you&#39;re left alive, with the capital destroyed, Rome will disappear as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or she might come to kill you after she destroys the capital.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Either option is rejected. I have no intention of allowing Rome or myself to fall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then we have to defeat Altera. But can we...even stand up to her?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Her magical energy is tremendous. It reminded me of the sacred sword in Fuyuki...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And we had a powerful Caster helping us back then. Now...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You can&#39;t do it, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I would like to think otherwise. Fujimaru and Mash have saved me multiple times.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You were talking about gods and the like, I&#39;m certain the gods and fate are on our side.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s why Fujimaru and the rest of you came here. My wish shall see its fruition.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Rome will be saved. My people and my Rome will be left for future generations. I&#39;m sure of it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The Holy Progenitor said so as well. I heard it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The world must be eternal. Rome must continue on eternally.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Even if its name will someday be forgotten, the many seeds Rome planted will continue on in different forms.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The eternal empire will continue to exist. Even if its emperor, state, and name changes.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It is the innate truth that mankind will continue to thrive. The tree of life that is humanity.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2014Fujimaru. I am sure that is the &quot;Humanity&quot; you are trying to protect.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...Emperor Nero. I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I see. Honestly, I don&#39;t either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understood it a little. At least I think I did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if something&#39;s clear and defined fades, as long as the world exists, its memes will remain.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How about thinking more romantically? Nero&#39;s words gave me strength.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s confident that we can fight Altera. That&#39;s why the world won&#39;t end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sounds good to me. Although there&#39;s no real basis for it\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it makes you feel like we should at least try. Fujimaru, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> \u2013Let&#39;s put our faith in Nero.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Got it. Then I will put my faith in your words Senpai.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I&#39;ll join in, too. I&#39;m tired of things getting destroyed.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> I hate that one called Altera far more than Emperor Nero.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get what&#39;s going on, but I think it&#39;s safe to believe in Nero Claudius&#39;s luck.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Oh, hey there Jing Ke, where did you disappear off to?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> I was observing\u2013Altera. It looks like she&#39;s slowly advancing.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> We can catch up if we leave now. That is, if you all want to.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We just came to a conclusion on that. Nice timing, there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well then everyone, time to head out! Let&#39;s get the Grail back and save the world!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...At least that was the plan until a second ago. I am picking up a major magical energy signature.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It must&#39;ve be drawn to the power of the Grail when it connected with Altera\u2013Phantasmals, it&#39;s the wyverns!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Wyvern? What&#39;s that? A monster out of a fairy tale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s a dangerous enemy! Master, your orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now I&#39;m picking up multiple magical energy signatures. Is she attracting monsters just by walking?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Is she summoning them? I don&#39;t know the details, but they&#39;re closing in fast!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Wyverns again? I never thought I&#39;d be fighting dragons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re used to it. Lord Nero, Senpai and I will take the front!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So reliable! Umu, I&#39;m leaving it to you!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I really want to say &quot;good work,&quot; but more are coming. Several times more than before\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Wh-What? Several times? That&#39;s pretty wild.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> ...Guess it can&#39;t be helped. We&#39;ll take those on, Jing Ke are you ready?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong><br> Monsters aren&#39;t my specialty. But I should take on non-human enemies for a change.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> W-Wait, Boudica, Jing Ke, what do you mean take them on? You&#39;re coming with us.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Exactly. You go on ahead already.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> What are you saying\u2013</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong><br> GuOOOOOO\u2013!!!!!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong><br> Go! You stupid emperor! Never mind this,go protect what you call your world!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...Apologies. My worthy rival, Queen of Britannia.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right everyone. No time to look back,we&#39;re close to where Altera is\u2013</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> ...Are you going to stand in my way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let you advance any further.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ll stand in your way. I can&#39;t allow you advance further, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You said that you would destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand. Why would you say that you were going to destroy the world?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> The world is brimming with beauty. Flowers, songs, gold, love...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, above all, this Rome, this world is filled with my love.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> And you&#39;d destroy it? Don&#39;t you find that wasteful Altera, or whoever you are?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I am\u2013</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> A warrior of the Hun.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> And its King.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> A King of Destruction, who will bring destruction to the western world.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That again?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> How sad Altera, but even that sadness seems beautiful to me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just leave you like this. I feel a great pain and contradiction in your life.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Perhaps your power exceeds mine, but know that you cannot defeat me in love.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I know not of love, I know not of beauty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, those words are different from before. It seems like she&#39;s not responding automatically.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This reaction\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see, she&#39;s going out of control by becoming one with the Grail! This isn&#39;t good, talking is not going to end this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Magical energy signature rising. You have to stop her before she unleashes it again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is the last battle for Rome\u2013Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Prepare for anti-Servant combat! Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> In this world...There are things that cannot be destroyed, even...by my sword.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> I was called, the Scourge of God...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Even my...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Sword of Mars...can&#39;t...I see...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Well that...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong><br> Makes me...a little happy...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Altera is gone. Perhaps fate will arrange for us to battle again one day.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> But...is it over? Have you obtained that Holy Grail\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;ve obtained the Holy Grail. This concludes our mission.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much, Nero Claudius.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Mash, your toes are looking faint! Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to vanish too!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Fou...I see, you&#39;re all going to vanish...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Farewell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We must go now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> ...I had a feeling. My intuition is pretty sharp, you see.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to disappear like Altera,my uncle, and the Holy Progenitor.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> Boudica, will you, as well? Jing Ke, Lu Bu, Spartacus?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This era will be restored. Your memories of fighting the United Empire will no longer exist.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> That&#39;s a sad thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it is...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> I will no longer doubt you. I believe you, but this is a problem.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> It&#39;s unfortunate, I haven&#39;t given you any reward.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> You could have been more than my retainers. Something more\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> No, no sense in saying it. Fujimaru,you will find yourself heading to Rome.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> All roads lead to Rome, for Rome is the world. Both the Holy Progenitor and I believe so.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> So I will not say goodbye. Only thanks.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong><br> \u2013Thank you. I offer you the thanks of my soul and a rose for your efforts!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Welcome back and good job you two. You retrieved the Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was that for the best?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;ll explain. The Grail is the law that decides how magical energies in a dimension is used.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Think of it as a world&#39;s rules. It normally doesn&#39;t have a form, but Lev crystallized it into one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can&#39;t analyze its workings, but we can seal it away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I fiddled with Mash&#39;s shield a little, and created a space for the Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My shield can do that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes. The best place for a relic is in a relic, I figure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It can only hold one at a time, so I yank it out after each retrieval. Got it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahhh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ok, Grail&#39;s retrieval is confirmed~\u266ATry your best to search for the next one!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is our second Grail and we&#39;ve also achieved our original goal of finding Lev.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But Lev is\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t learn anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Altera killed him,and we never found out what his plans were.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You mean why he betrayed mankind and tried to...destroy it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We still don&#39;t know anything,but still have five singularities left.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Lev spoke of &quot;Gods. &quot; In other words,there are other enemies out there just like him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What that means at this point, we don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All we can do is recover the Grails one by one, and restore the Singularities.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave the next Grail to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a long way to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good answer. I&#39;m counting on you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have that much time, but for tonight try and rest well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You walked a long way. You&#39;ll want a good massage, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You look down Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Thinking about Nero?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Our parting with Nero was so sudden. I feel bad about leaving her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even if it ended up never happening, in that last moment, she was alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She defeated the people she respected, and said goodbye to her rivals\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She was left all alone in that huge empire with no one to rely on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was this battle hard for you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you think Nero feels lonely?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014No, I don&#39;t think so.... I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was a hard battle, yes. We almost died many times, and I&#39;m still scared of fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But\u2014it was a fun journey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Partially thanks to Nero&#39;s glamour, but...It was a lot of fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it was fun for Nero, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It was a fun Empire, just like Nero.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;ll never forget that sky and land, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> By the way Senpai, about what the Doctor said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What did Roman say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The massage?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, you need to take care of yourself. Shall I give you a massage?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know several effective methods shiatsu, deep tissue...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sounds good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll pass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Come on, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ahem. I really wanted to try it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s all. Um, well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I tried it once before, and they said it really hurt...Oh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> T-That shouldn&#39;t happen anymore. I practiced after that. In my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where are you going? Oh, you want a massage in your room, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai?</p>', 2410);
