Everyone and everything dead. But by happenstance, I was spared.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> All was sacrificed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The King of Knights, Gawain, Mordred, Kay... Merlin escaped to paradise...or was he driven there?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The Round Table collapsed. Camelot is a land of ruin. Yet I survive...somehow.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> After my death, I ascended to the Throne of Heroes, gaining a second life as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And yet I feel as if I am still struggling to live in my homeland...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> This is merely an analogy...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Let us make a play about the end of Britain.<br> Oh, please do not be vexed.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> As a playwright, this is the only way I can express myself.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Lord Mordred plays the role of demise.<br> The knight of rebellion is truly the epitome of the end.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> That knight gathered all rebels to her banner, splitting Britain in twain, and laid waste to the Round Table itself...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Bringing our play to its conclusion.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> King Arthur shall play the role of the sacrifice.<br> And so I beg your indulgence.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The king was, to be sure, used as a sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The one at the center of Britain&#39;s tragedy, but retaining her composure as the King of Knights through it all... There won&#39;t be a dry eye in the house.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I suppose it may have ended differently,<br> but I confess that I would not know.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Now, for you, Sir Lancelot.<br> Your parts in this play will be mixed.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Your character witnesses the Round Table&#39;s split, and you will also take on the task of informing the audience of the play&#39;s conclusion.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> You, the sole witness, watch in agony as the tragedy unfolds before your eyes.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> You walked the path of the knight, and were charged with passing on the idea that knighthood itself had not perished.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Whether you succeeded in doing so... Well, I imagine that is a question you can answer better than I.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s quite the merciless view of things.<br> Such could only come from the mind of a playwright.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...In that case, I am a man past his time, yes?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Quite upsetting, but I&#39;m grateful, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Yes...yes...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> After overhearing your agony,<br> I simply dissected it as an author might.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> While I do so, might I beg your assistance?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I shall, to the extent that I am able,<br> and if Master approves.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Then let us be off! With Master in tow,<br> our destination is the Mist City, London!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> London?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, why&#39;d you drag me here!?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> My apologies, Master.<br> I thought you knew why we were here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What the hell, Shakespeare!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Oh, nothing, nothing. I just thought it might be amusing to bring the knight to this evil version of the city, is all!</p><hr><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Anyway, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> What am I supposed to do here?<br> Sightsee?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> When one calls upon a knight, it should be for battle, or to save a princess.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> As I see no princess, it seems battle is to be the order of the day!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Before partaking in a bit of nostalgia for your homeland, it is time for battle! Look ahead... It seems we are about to be beset by foes!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I hesitate to say that I understand,<br> but I shall fulfill my duties as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> To battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> That was a fine warmup.<br> Now, let&#39;s proceed.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I know this is rather obvious, but this place is very different from the Britain I remember.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mordred didn&#39;t seem to mind.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Well, that is Mordred. She was never the most refined among us, and could be downright uncouth about things like this.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I can only imagine she was barking like a dog,<br> trying to scare others out of her territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, yeah. It&#39;s been about a thousand years.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I see humanity has come a long way to be able to build so many structures of this sort in this benighted land.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I understand progress is progress,<br> but it is still somewhat jarring.</p><hr><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Yes, this place was in constant strife. It had no chance to thrive, being ever ablaze in the fires of war.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> The people of this land...they put all their hope in the King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> They all believed that the one chosen by the sacred sword would be able to save the world.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> And yet, ultimately,<br> Britain&#39;s fate was destruction.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The best you could do was try to mitigate the damage for future generations.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Now that I reflect back, that is probably true.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> They should have simply given up and accepted their destruction in peace.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> That is my opinion as I look back on it now, playwright.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> But for those who lived during that time...the knights who lived in that era...well, there was no way any of them could accept such a thing.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Yes, I suppose that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> And that is why we fight now to prevent our own destruction!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> It would, I suppose, be fair to say that I am simply watching, cheering, and writing.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...Master, is there nothing that can be done about this writer?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Were he a warrior, I would have him account for his words with his weapon... That would resolve so many things so very easily...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> NO VIOLENCE!!!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Have you forgotten the true nature of what it means to be a Servant!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahaha...<br> Whatever do you mean...hahaha...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Had I been summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, it is Master who would have been doing most of the fighting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Yes.<br> My job is to wave a flag around to cheer you on.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I&#39;m relieved, then, that you&#39;re not involved in a normal Holy Grail War, Master...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Doubly so, knowing that had you been in such a situation, Shakespeare might have been your Servant.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> But then again, I wonder what kind of Holy Grail War he would be summoned to?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...Would they make him write a new book or something?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...Anyway!<br> We&#39;re heading towards the main event!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Main...event?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Yes, yes.<br> The main event.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The last Knight in a foreign land...the divider of the Round Table: Sir Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> The individual whom you are to fight...is behind that bolt of lightning!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> ...Are you a Knight of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Impossible...impossible...impossible!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Why...why of all places, would you be here!?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> That&#39;s obvious.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I am the embodiment of destruction, a Servant who manifested through the aspect of annihilation.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I will destroy it all.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Through my Rhongomyniad,<br> thunderous clouds shall engulf all things.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...I will not allow it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Why not, Knight of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> A fog surrounds your name in my memory as I am now,<br> but I still sense that you once served me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> So sense my intentions, conform to my will, and obey my words. That is what it means to be loyal.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> My methods and actions may have been mistaken, but I still believe my intentions were true and just.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> At times, true loyalty may require a knight to bare steel against his lord.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> This rings all the truer when I face one who calls herself the embodiment of destruction! I can justly say that a person like you is no lord of mine!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> If you are the Wild Hunt, the King of the Storm, I am...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> The Knight of the Lake, who faces the storm down with his silent blade.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> If that sacred sword of yours moves as quickly as you flap your lips, you will make a worthy opponent.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Come to me, dead spirits who gather here.<br> I will turn this demonic city into a charnel pit!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Just as dawn will always break the dark of night,<br> so too must a storm end.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> I am merely a remnant. Were this not the end of the world, I might simply have made a mark on history and disappeared.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> My king, you are...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Stop right there, Knight of the Round Table.<br> I am not the king you know.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> This shining sacred spear is all that allows me to exist as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Even so, I am no more than a remnant of that person. There is no need for you to bow to me.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...No matter what form you have taken, you are my king, now that you have come to your senses.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Well, I didn&#39;t come to my senses.<br> It is only that I have remembered something.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> The plains that I remembered are long gone,<br> as are the people we vowed to protect.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> But I still sense something. There are some human activity that has rooted itself in this city.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong><br> Traces of the dream of a utopia... A dream that existed here long ago, and still exists today...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t for the guidance of the playwright, I might not have known what to feel in the face of this fate of mine.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Shakespeare, was this your doing?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Hahahahaha, of course not!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I could never have summoned such a perfect likeness of the King of Knights!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, to think that she would manifest as a remnant, destroy London, and then simply disappear...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> ...would be a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> And so I felt compelled to bring the most capable of all knights to this place.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Ah, &#39;tis passing strange... These dreams of mine are no sooner formed than forgotten.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good eye!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> A capable knight...?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Ah, to be referred to as such embarrasses me.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> In any case, I will accept your praise with pride!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Lancelot&#39;s the best knight!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Thank you. I shall cherish those words forever.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> No matter the dire situation I face,<br> those words will give me strength.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I must be honest. To think that the most capable knight is FRENCH is more than a little troubling.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Fortunately, modern man that I am, I consider myself to be quite open-minded when considering a nation&#39;s troubles.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> So even though the critics of your country first called me \u201Cvulgar\u201D and \u201Ccruel\u201D...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I offer my forgiveness now!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see how that has anything to do with me!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> I&#39;m really just venting here.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> Well, at least in modern France, people know my true worth, so all is well...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong><br> But know this: an author carries his grudges forever!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> By the way, you said it was all a nightmare, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Hm... No, it can&#39;t be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing. I just remembered somebody...a dependable mage who has a deplorable tendency toward the ridiculous as well.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> If his hand is at work here, there&#39;s nothing for it. Annoying as it is, I can only accept it.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> After all, he is sneaky as a snake in the grass.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> Only our king could ever command that man.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> He WOULD do something like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ahhh...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ah-CHOO!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hmmm, did I catch a cold?<br> Or maybe someone&#39;s talking about me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hopefully all that annoying stuff is done.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And so, thanks to the Knight of the Lake, the remnant of the King of Storms in London vanished...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And now his debt to the Round Table is paid in full.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yep. All&#39;s right in the world.<br> Happily ever after for everyone.</p>', 170);
