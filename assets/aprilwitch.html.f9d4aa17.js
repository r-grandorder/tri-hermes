I need nothing.</p><p>&quot;No, no, surely you jest. If there is a thing you want, or something you want to do, say it.

We will leave quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, look at this. What a wonderful tea set.&quot;</p><p>Honeydew lamented how her companion&#39;s irresponsible untidiness created so many problems for her, while Juniper was thirsty and spoke selfishly.</p><p>Juniper drank many cups of black tea and left the room untidy, while Honeydew grudgingly cleaned up after her.</p><p>April did nothing.</p><h2 id="page-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#page-6" aria-hidden="true">#</a> \uFF3BPage 6\uFF3D</h2><p>A quack doctor came to visit.</p><p>She did as she was told during the medical examination, and her hair and blood and nails and meat and flesh, anyway, many parts of her were collected, and at the end she was told thus.</p><p>&quot;You are sick. You should be hospitalized as soon as possible. It would be best to do it today.&quot;</p><p>While writing something in his medical records, the quack called out to her, saying that she was practically a living specimen.</p><p>I am not ill at all. I am a witch.</p><p>&quot;Then that is the name of your disease. You have witch disease. Even if your flesh looks healthy, your heart is sick. You are abusing yourself, staying in this dim, stagnant room.

Above all, I do not want to be injured myself.</p><p>I no longer wish for the world and myself to meet.</p><p>The quack did not listen to April&#39;s entreaty.</p><p>The quack became hair and blood and nails and meat and flesh, anyway, he became all sorts of parts and left the room.</p><hr><p>An invisible dog arrived.</p><p>Although its nails made a scratching sound on the floor and it could be heard breathing, it had no appearance.</p><p>Its fur, rustling more than summer cypress. It gave off the unpleasant odor of eye mucus.</p><p>She guessed where it was and picked it up, but it snapped at her violently and eventually got away. April had no choice but to leave the dog alone.</p><p>On one stormy night, the dog was afraid and howled towards the other side of the door for a long time. She did not know who was there, but someone was. In the first place, other than on April 1st, no one was supposed to be able to get near the room. At least, no one alive.</p><p>Later, on a night when it was snowing heavily, the dog which had been sprawled by the hearth sprung up and howled at the door like fire. Leaving only the faint sound of the snow, someone left.</p><p>----And then, exactly a year later, at dawn.</p><p>Click, click, came the sound of the tip of a cane on the entranceway&#39;s stone.</p><p>The dog faintly showed itself, and stood quietly in front of the door.</p><p>April asked the dog.</p><p>Will you forgive the person who is precious to you?</p><p>The dog whined quietly and pushed at the door with the tip of its nose.</p><p>She opened the door slightly, and saw the dog off with just a little regret.</p><p>This was the one time that the witch April lived with a familiar.</p><h2 id="page-7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#page-7" aria-hidden="true">#</a> \uFF3BPage 7\uFF3D</h2><p>An artist whose works did not sell arrived.</p><p>The artist tore out his hair and screamed in hysterics.</p><p>&quot;I want to make a picture that no one has ever seen.

In order to paint that picture, what kind of paintbrush is needed?</p><p>&quot;I need a rare paintbrush! Unwavering as iron, as flexible as flame. With true colors on the tip of the brush.&quot;</p><p>How much canvas would be sufficient?</p><p>&quot;A vast one! Of course, not just large. It must be knitted of threads of faith and atonement. Every time the brushtip flashes like lightning, it will extend to the ends of the sea!&quot;</p><p>Having said this so fervently, the artist suddenly became timid and clung to April&#39;s knee in a panic.</p><p>&quot;Forgive me. Punish me. There is no way such a thing could exist. It was the nonsense of megalomania. It was wrong to even wish for it.&quot;</p><p>While comforting him, April spoke.</p><p>Even if it does not come true, is there such a thing as a wish that it is wrong to wish for?</p><p>The artist nodded with moist eyes, reverently left a kiss on her hand, and left.</p><p>I will stake my life on painting my ideal picture----so saying, he left.</p><hr><p>The vampire princess Mei arrived and rested her red wings.</p><p>&quot;We are similar&quot;, Mei said.
