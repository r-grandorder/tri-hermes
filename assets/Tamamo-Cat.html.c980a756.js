C-Cat!<br> Don&#39;t surprise me like that!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh, sorry about that. My bad. My bad. I just can&#39;t keep my surging wild nature in check. You gotta understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E-Even so, it&#39;s unexpected...<br> Come on, Senpai. Tell her to be more careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you hungry?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say that&#39;s one of the reasons!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you want to sharpen your claws?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Let&#39;s just say that I always want to sharpen them!</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> But as expected, Master understands me the best!<br> In this case, now we really gotta go on that hunt, no?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh! Nice design. That squirrel is really cute.<br> Climb up on my paw if you like. Rather, get on it now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Wahahahahahahaha! That tickles! That tickles!<br> \u2014Gotcha!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?<br> Nnng, Gyagyaaaaaaaaau!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Wahaha! I got this cute little guy now! If you don&#39;t want me to squish him, then you&#39;ll join us Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no! Fou&#39;s been taken hostage...<br> Senpai, Cat may not look it, but she&#39;s got brains!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yep. Cat&#39;s pretty smart sometimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Well, she is a &quot;cat&quot; after all...</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I&#39;ve seen this coastline before, Master.<br> What sort of evil land is this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A goddess once lived on this island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the island Stheno lived on.<br> Don&#39;t you remember?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Hmm.<br> I don&#39;t remember at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> An evil god lived on this island.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I knew it. I can feel it.<br> I mean, this island is pretty gloomy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, Senpai. Why are we really here?<br> Is there something on this island?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Now now, I already know what you&#39;re thinking,<br> Mashy-Mash. This place is the nature&#39;s treasure vault, full of carrots.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> And here&#39;s proof of it. Look.<br> There&#39;s a whole group coming out to meet us.</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong><br> Caaaaaaaaaaaat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-Are they enemies?<br> Doctor, check for enemy lifeforms!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> &quot;The line you are calling cannot be reached. Since it&#39;s lunch time, any work outside of Grand Order will be declined.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> DOCTOR!<br> Everybody is too relaxed this time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Woof! We have control of the coast. On to the shore!<br> I&#39;ll catch salmon in the river and animals in the forest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Cat went into the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve stuck together this far.<br> Let&#39;s stay together. After her, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Get...out...!<br> This river...is my...territory...!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Are you nuts? Nature belongs to everyone.<br> It&#39;s just like a beef barbecue: first come, first served.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> ...Hmm? Beef...? First come, first served...? Beef... Beef...beef...I&#39;m recalling memories of Matsusaka beef...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Drool.<br> Hey, are you the 5-star ranked beef?</p><p><strong>Asterios:</strong><br> Evil! You are...evil!<br> But...Euryale is also...a little...like that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Take your eyes off her for a second, and she gets us into trouble. Master, what should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on! We have to back up Tamamo Cat!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle is over.<br> That was one crazy, out-of-control fight...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Darn it all! The beef got away.<br> I wanted to become friends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I think maybe Asterios only came here to look for Euryale...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Except, Stheno was the one who lived here.<br> Well, it&#39;s hard to tell them apart...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> But we&#39;ve taken the river.<br> It&#39;s time to hunt! I think I&#39;ll help myself to a salmon!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> You must admit, that salmon was a worthy opponent.With wet scales that sparkle like gems... I can&#39;t even!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow! One swipe! You&#39;re good at that!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Oh stop it Master! You&#39;re making me blush!<br> But that&#39;s because salmon hunting is what cats do best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You only want one?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Yes. I only take what I need.<br> That&#39;s the nature&#39;s code.</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s time for the main event! Hunt the cows in the ranch! I&#39;m taking some potatoes with me too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow! I didn&#39;t know... I wasn&#39;t expecting a plain like this when we came out of the forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!<br> Watch out, Master!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Sorry. But that&#39;s your first and final warning. Normally I&#39;d give you four chances, but this time is special.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> You&#39;re sheep thieves, aren&#39;t you?This is the ranch that I&#39;ve taken great pains to develop.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Can you understand? Starting my own ranch has been my dream, my salvation for all the suffering I went through on the throne.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Simply put, I will kill anyone who ruins my dream.Besides, I got a house full of wives to take care of.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mistake. We&#39;ve only come here to hunt\u2014<br> Er, I mean... Maybe it&#39;s not a mistake?</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! This is the first time we&#39;ve met.<br> It&#39;s nice to meet you, King of the Sling!</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> I don&#39;t particularly like that nickname.It makes me sound like I&#39;m some kind of con artist.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m gonna grab a carrot! But before that,<br> maybe I should turn into a giant, like in the tale?</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> No need. I&#39;m not fighting Goliath again. You there,<br> beautiful little beast. After I punish you, I&#39;ll make you my wife!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, another Servant battle!I don&#39;t think this is a hunting trip anymore!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Ugh, sure I don&#39;t have to pay rent here, but perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have picked this island.</p><p><strong>David:</strong><br> Oh, well. I can set up shop anywhere I like.<br> Farewell, all! Just don&#39;t go overboard with the plundering!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> That David...<br> He was really powerful for no reason, woof...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> No matters. The prize is in front of us!<br> I will get my paws on that five-star beef!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> \u2014Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ya rang?</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Listen. If I get carried away, I want you to stop me.<br> I&#39;m a fierce fighting dog, not a seeing eye dog.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I&#39;m only going to take one cattle.<br> Alrighty then, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And, she&#39;s back.<br> She brought back exactly one cattle.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Yep. It was a good fight.<br> Now I&#39;m done hunting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...umm, you only took a salmon and a cattle, right?<br> When you said hunting, I thought it&#39;d be more...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> What? Of course! These are just the ingredients.<br> My ultimate goal is to make dinner for Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You can cook?</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> What are you talking about? I may not look it, but I&#39;m a great cook. I&#39;m actually a multi-purpose maid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree with Senpai.<br> I mean, you? Really? Ahahaha.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Here! I&#39;ve made garlic steak,<br> pumpkin terrine, roast chicken with diavolo sauce,</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> pumpkin pudding and pumpkin pie, and four kinds of canape that I whipped up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You really are a good cook...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> I never lie, you know.<br> How does it taste, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want you to always cook for me from now on.</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Nyahaha! I&#39;m so pleased you like it. No worries,<br> it&#39;s my way of repaying you for what you do every day.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> This is getting embarrassing, so I&#39;m going to close with that. \u2014Now then, I think I&#39;ll have a carrot for my reward!</p><h2 id="the-ring-of-carnage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ring-of-carnage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Ring of Carnage</h2><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Be patient, I have a long story to tell. That Tamamo-no-Mae is one horrible Servant.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Now she&#39;s turned over a new leaf... I think? But when she was fully matured she was really terrible.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> When a demon fox gains a tail, its power will grow exponentially. When it becomes a nine-tailed demon fox, its power is immeasurable.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> When that happened to her, she became afraid of herself. Thinking that she would never get married like that, she ripped off her tails.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> One of those tails became me, Tamamo Cat.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Okay, here you go, Master!<br> Today I&#39;ve made a magnificent lobster!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Looks like you sauteed and simmered it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that&#39;s an amazing American-style lobster!</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Here you go.<br> Puting some lemon on it makes it even more delicious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow... So this is the essence of human civilization...<br> Through cooking, we&#39;ve distinguished mankind from beast.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just so you know, a cat made this. Hmm? ...Everyone,<br> I am sorry to bother you when you&#39;re having fun...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you kidding me? A pointless enemy attack at a time like this? And inside the apartment even?</p><p><strong>Monster Shadow:</strong><br> Loooooooobsterrrrrrrr\u2014!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It appears that they were attracted by the smell of the food! Since they&#39;re here for that, they&#39;re pretty tough! For some reason\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sh-Shadow Servants!?<br> What&#39;s worse, they&#39;re all Berserkers?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Precisely. They&#39;re the shadows of the Servants who are always hungry!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> These guys are more powerful than what we&#39;ve faced so far! Be very careful!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And save the lobster!<br> I want some, too! Very badly!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> ...Uh-oh.

It&#39;s time to get serious! No more messing around from now on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Lobster chop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Lobster slash!</p><p><strong>Shadow Servant:</strong><br> Guh! Ghee\u2014Aaaaaauuuuuugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy Servants eliminated.<br> Master, we successfully defended the lobster.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty good with that lobster, Mash.<br> I&#39;m sure you&#39;d make a pretty handy wife in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Wife!<br> No...well...uh...I have no experience in cooking...</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> Cooking and fighting are very similar!<br> They both smell of blood, and are both just as exciting.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong><br> The greater the battle with the ingredients, the better it tastes. It&#39;s the same in relationships too. The one who wins gets to eat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oohh... That&#39;s an interesting take.<br> Very informative. Please tell me more, Professor Cat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Fujimaru, are you sure you don&#39;t want to stop this?
