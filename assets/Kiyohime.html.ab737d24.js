Since the game character of Kiyohime already is here and there with black hair and Japanese clothing, I thought about trying to make her completely different, and tried a more Western design covered with a yandere atmosphere. At the beginning there were lots of design ideas in which she was dressed with something like a j\u016Bnihitoe, but I told the boss about opening fully the thighs after drawing while balancing the numbers and it resulted in the current shape. Actually, when I listened to one battle voice that has been stored, I thought it was definitely charming but it was helplessly put on hold, but\u2026 At that time I thought that was awful but thinking about it now I feel there wasn\u2019t any problem (lol) (BLACK)</p><h2 id="tl-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TL Notes</h2><p>[1]: Samadhi is a state of mind in which you&#39;re super-concentrated on something.<br><ruby>Zanmai<rt>\u4E09\u6627</rt></ruby> also refers to &quot;being immersed/absorbed in something&quot;.
