Gather information to<br> investigate the event and start recording all your<br> progress doing so. Preservation intensity: AA.</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0C:</strong><br> Hereon, the log on the subject&#39;s situation, as well as<br> all of our inputs and statements will be recorded.<br> Thank you for your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0B:</strong><br> Sorry, kinda busy here! You handle the announcement<br> to the crew!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Senpai. Have you heard the announcement just<br> now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something about an abnormality?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Da Vinci and Sion were called...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I speculate it is some sort of technical difficulty,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but the announcer&#39;s tone made it sound like quite a big<br> deal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So I want to see if there is any way I can help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Same here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s at least take a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> \u2014Is something wrong with PAPERMOON?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> So it would seem.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> And we were about to ask our puzzled operator-slash-<br> manufacturer over there for more details.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hmm... I&#39;m the one who should be asking the<br> questions here...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> By its very nature, it&#39;s not something that should be<br> causing anyone any issues.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, really?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yeah. The PAPERMOON might be an exceptional<br> measuring device, but using it is extremely simple.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There&#39;s no uncertainty in its measurements,<br> even when operating in harsh environments.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s absolute, otherwise it couldn&#39;t serve as a perfect<br> compass in Imaginary Number Space.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In the simplest possible terms, it&#39;s the reflective<br> surface of the moon, displaying everything as it exists.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Formed or formless. Real or imaginary numbers.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No complex processes or calculations necessary.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, but what about all the black box mechanisms<br> inside that you haven&#39;t mentioned?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Even I&#39;ve never tried tinkering with those out of fear of<br> what would happen if I broke anything.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> This thing was gifted to Chaldea a long time ago,<br> so a fair share of skilled engineers have had a go at it<br> over the years,</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> but until I built the Border, the consensus was...</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> \u201CThis is amazing, but I can&#39;t think of any use for it.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Mystic Code from the Atlas Institute. What else<br> did you expect?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It was a present to Chaldea, but its blueprints and<br> inner mechanisms are still top secret.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A few of its microcomponents are of my family&#39;s<br> patented technology,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> so only I can realistically make fundamental changes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s complex...despite its simple functions?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Yes. Well, less complex and more overly customized<br> for one user.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> How do I explain this one? Here&#39;s an example.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Suppose you have a jigsaw puzzle composed of 100<br> million blank white pieces.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You glue the complete puzzle together, frame it,<br> and hang it on your wall.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It is practically a simple poster of the color white.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But it&#39;s still made up of 100 million small pieces.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Glued together, they gained the simplicity of a solid<br> block of white.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This simplicity drops its chance of being taken apart<br> to practically zero.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Still, the only way to define it is as an amalgamation<br> of 100 million puzzle pieces,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and the only way to see how it&#39;s made is to find and<br> remove each piece... Makes sense, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. I feel like I understand the main gist...somehow.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Eh, it&#39;s a product from when I had more time on my<br> hands than I knew what to do with, before I found my<br> current aim.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t use any material that would deteriorate easily,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and programmed it with a general purpose<br> self-maintenance spell, so\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Continuing with the previous example, my pre-<br> examination impression would be:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u201CI, an intellectual, darling daughter of the Atlas<br> chancellor, didn&#39;t build a puzzle that&#39;d break apart for<br> no reason.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But let&#39;s take a look.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Activate this part here, easy as that.</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm, hold up? Is that a Singularity reaction light on<br> the monitor?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Check what that&#39;s about!</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0A:</strong><br> I-it is! I can see it\u2014but...</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0B:</strong><br> No Singularity detected!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> \u2014Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah, sorry, but I can definitely confirm its visuals.<br> Around Egypt, per the world map.</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0B:</strong><br> No matter how many times I check for input data<br> against PAPERMOON, I get nothing.</p><p><strong>Chaldea\xA0staff\xA0B:</strong><br> There&#39;s no logical reason why this would be lit...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s visible with no input?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can think of two possibilities.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> One of them is a problem with the display.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A burned-in portion of the monitor, a scribble on the<br> screen, or something to that effect.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A misapprehension unrelated to the data.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If not that, then it can only be the second possibility.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> PAPERMOON is sending a signal to something.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A receptor directly connected to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The light is...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dazzling...</p><hr><p><strong>Da\xA0Vinci:</strong><br> What&#39;s happening!? All hands, emergency!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai, are you alright? Senpai!

Wait a second.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Something feels uncomfortable...with my magical<br> energy path with Master.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I assumed that would be the case... It&#39;s an unavoidable<br> side-effect.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Etherlight can be injected even directly into the brain,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but when it comes to Magic Circuits and Spiritron<br> conversion, it needs a special route with one additional<br> step.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Therefore, I used the Command Spell system tied to<br> [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] Circuits as an intermediary to force the Etherlight<br> route open.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In simpler terms...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Portions of Fujimaru&#39;s Command Spells<br> and Magic Circuits have been replaced with my<br> Etherlight.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And since I&#39;m obviously the one in control,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it wouldn&#39;t be inaccurate to count me as part of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her]<br> Circuits and Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hey, are you sure about this!? Circuits and Command<br> Spells are pretty important! You can&#39;t let anyone other<br> than me take parts of that away from you that easy!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That&#39;s basically giving her control over your life and<br> death!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was the only way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What else could I have done?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I agree it comes with some ethical issues, but it was<br> our only option. I&#39;d appreciate if you thought of it as a<br> necessary expense.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> By the way, from now on, any attempt to utilize your<br> Mystic Codes or whatever else you use for magecraft<br> will be executed through me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Basically, we have become a two-in-one Master<br> package.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never heard of anything like this. Is this even<br> allowed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> All I can say in regards to the technical difficulties of<br> this mechanism is that we&#39;re not in the real world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t the slightest idea whether or not this is<br> possible outside of here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh) I can&#39;t believe you let this untrustworthy child<br> steal all your valuables...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;d have stopped her if I knew.<br> Greatest mistake of my life.</p><p><strong>Berserker&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look too satisfied. Are you...not healed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] is. As long as [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] has my support, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] can move<br> [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] body and fight with no detriment to [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] health.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry for all the trouble.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s n-nothing.

I could&#39;ve just called her \u201CMaster\u201D, but not<br> having a name is still a major inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> She wouldn&#39;t shut up about health this, treatment that,<br> so I thought this&#39;d be perfect for her.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> Naming others was a frequent occurrence for<br> someone of my exalted status.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> It&#39;s noblesse oblige, as the strangers say.</p><p><strong>Berserker:</strong><br> Oops!

Now I know exactly<br> how strong you are!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Come again...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I wanted to make sure you were ready to deal with an<br> ambush.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s just a bit of tough love.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Drona beat me up a lot back in the day, but this is for<br> real. I could&#39;ve just dumped it on Karna and run away!<br> Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Heh. What I say may sound nonsensical, but a<br> Servant should be able to see the connections.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (I&#39;d have had a huge advantage if I could have taken<br> out just one of them with a surprise attack...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Well, there&#39;ll be other chances. Next time, for sure!<br> Man, I&#39;m such a good general!)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Awfully sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I am a warrior among warriors, so I treated you guys<br> the same way.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I guess I should have kept the kid gloves on.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What are you doing!?<br> I thought that was an actual fight!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> At least make it sound like you&#39;re sorry!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Are you alright? Any injuries? I can treat them,<br> if you&#39;ll let me.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Whatever... It&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (If it was just me, there&#39;s no way he&#39;d get away with<br> this. I&#39;d make him pay by corrupting him down to the<br> core, then killing him during the act of love.)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (But Master is just so damn easygoing. I can&#39;t work<br> like this...)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (At least give me an order or something! Why doesn&#39;t<br> [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] say anything!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why are you glaring at me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> No reason at all! You&#39;ll just get burned by it one day!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha. Now now, let&#39;s all get along.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> By the way...after some thought, I don&#39;t like being the<br> only one whose True Name is out in the open.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Those floral arrows smell of India. Flower arrows give<br> away you&#39;re our divinity Kama, or am I missin&#39; the mark?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (A \u201Cwhat should we do?\u201D expression)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (What should we do?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (It feels like we don&#39;t even need to tell him.)</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wait, hold up. I can tell what you&#39;re thinking,<br> I&#39;m not that dumb.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually true?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I mean... Why&#39;re you a girl?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s complicated. Gender doesn&#39;t really make much of<br> a difference for our kind.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, I guess that&#39;s a god for you. I should&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But flower arrows that incite lust?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> If I had something like that, I could easily win over<br> Draupadi and all sorts of other pretty girls... Ghehehe...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Right, I&#39;m boycotting my services now. I don&#39;t care<br> how much you worship me, I won&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Not to mention the gall it takes to ask for favors after<br> a surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Next time, I&#39;ll kill you! Clear?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Of course. I get it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> From now on, we&#39;re a divinity and a Servant working<br> together respectfully.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (But no matter what she says, she&#39;s still one of my<br> gods. If I play this right, it could be pretty useful...)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Why are you in such a good mood?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, whatever. We&#39;ve almost reached the central<br> Defend area. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> These Ranis are a little different...</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> They&#39;re D-type girls. Defend AIs. Whenever a bug<br> shows up in this world, they deploy their security force.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I think the equivalent role in the outside world is called...<br> police?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> They&#39;re very special girls, so don&#39;t try to flirt with<br> them. They&#39;ll get mad.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Is this where the general supervisor AI is? It looks like<br> a church...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s designed that way. There<br> probably isn&#39;t any special meaning behind it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Maybe this just projected the greatest sense of<br> stability and comfort?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s go in. Entry request sent, and\u2014okay.<br> We&#39;re approved.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I could hear you. And what you say is true.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There is no significance behind the form of this<br> building.

All the R.A.N.I. series in this world<br> use me as their archetype.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> Naturally, the appearance settings of the other AIs are<br> also based on me.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> Their name was also decided upon based on my<br> research.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> They were originally unnecessary, but the current<br> situation calls for individual designations. Indeed,<br> we now acknowledge their utility.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> You could say that I am Rani...but that would not be<br> entirely accurate.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> As I am functionally the only one of my type and not a<br> supplemental unit...</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> I believe it would be appropriate to refer to myself<br> based on my current version, after the number of major<br> updates performed.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> Based on the above logic...</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> Rani XII.</p><p><strong>General\xA0Supervisor\xA0AI:</strong><br> That would be my name\u2014</p><h2 id="section-3-holy-grail-war-your-starlit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-holy-grail-war-your-starlit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Holy Grail War/your starlit</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> My belated greetings\u2014visitors from the outside.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> To you as well, prime R-type AI, current unit name<br> Ayus, and her accompanying Berserker Servant.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmm...

Before coming here, I had decided that<br> the first thing I&#39;d do would be to verify what you are.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since you named yourself, I&#39;ll respond in kind.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m Sion Eltnam Sokaris, former PAPERMOON<br> operator.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Could you look up the administrative jurisdiction files<br> associated with my name?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Searching\u20140 results found.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Even if you were indeed the operator of the<br> PAPERMOON device, I am not equipped in any way to<br> determine or respond to that.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> All I can say is, \u201COkay.\u201D</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Wait. If she&#39;s the designer and operator, doesn&#39;t that<br> make her like, the god of this world?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And then you say she doesn&#39;t have the right to give<br> orders to a doll? What&#39;s that all about?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The PAPERMOON that I managed was explicitly only<br> the device.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This world and its AIs are naturally occurring content.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Following this line of thought, it makes sense that I<br> hold no direct jurisdiction here.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> A god. I see. A fascinating line of thought.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Conjecturing based on our base data of the outside<br> world, I ask you a question.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> How would a regular human react if someone<br> appeared out of nowhere,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and proclaimed to be the god of their world with no<br> evidence to their statement?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, I suppose...all they could say is, \u201COkay\u201D.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I see.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I infer that the current situation was not too different<br> from this hypothetical scenario. Thus, I feel validated in<br> my reaction being correct.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well...fine.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I won&#39;t be deliberately claiming to be a god to an AI<br> that I have no memory of creating either.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Besides, I learned enough in the one moment of<br> contact you had with the Etherlight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Learned what?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Her quality and quantity of information.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In the case of a creator inspecting their own AI,<br> as a programmer reading the code they wrote,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> they could freely edit and repair whatever information<br> they come across.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But this instance felt like engaging something with the<br> same data quantity. Like a case of one human being<br> inspecting another.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Related to the principle of awareness I mentioned<br> earlier,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> as I am now, I can&#39;t interact with her as \u201Ca product I<br> can do whatever I want with\u201D.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If you permit my conjecture.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Since you have a definite body here, we are most<br> likely equal in composition.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even so, the fact remains that Rani XII is an AI.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because I felt the same thing interacting with Ayus.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh? When? Don&#39;t go inspecting me without telling,<br> that&#39;s so embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Conversely, I have a similar answer.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Through a query executed via my authority as the<br> general supervisor AI, I could confirm that you are not<br> any artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Neither are you products of PAPERMOON.<br> Which could only make you visitors from outside.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Non-AI from the outside with the same structural<br> intensity as we AI\u2014that&#39;s what I presume you are.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hm? So, in short...<br> They&#39;re outsiders here for no reason?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I can&#39;t say for certain. It&#39;s a fact that<br> they are Master and Servant,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> which could suggest they were accidentally integrated<br> into the System Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Normally, all Masters are selected from the AI in this<br> world,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and then born from a randomized arrangement, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Randomized?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The prime AIs to be made Masters... Although they are<br> all of different types, they share the same core in the<br> sense they&#39;re all part of the R.A.N.I. series.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If they were to become Masters on equal terms,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> it is believed that they would all employ the same<br> tactics and perform the same actions.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This would be inappropriate for the System Grail War,<br> where we expect active and irregular resource<br> operations.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Therefore, they are converted into Masters via a<br> randomizer generating random personality traits in<br> their minds.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The RNG builds upon the prime AI&#39;s base, modifying<br> their character and appearance...resulting in a Master<br> AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> With this in mind, let us return to the topic of your<br> presence.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You are beings with a compositional intensity similar<br> to that of a Master AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Therefore, I believe you were dragged into the system<br> for some reason.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Naturally, we don&#39;t want any part of that.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Is it possible for you to disconnect us from the system<br> and return us outside?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Unfortunately, no.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The Holy Grail War is a system executed by the entire<br> world itself.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Due to my position as general supervisor AI,<br> I was granted the role of overseer,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> but that doesn&#39;t give me the ability to intervene with<br> the system.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Even if I could run a program for addition and revision<br> of rules,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be able to alter the essence of the rules.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, how can we get back out?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The fact that you appeared here at the moment the<br> System Grail War started,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and arrived in a format directly associated with it<br> means that...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> For an unknown reason, the program&#39;s execution had<br> an effect outside the device and pulled you inside.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That is the sequence of events as I have conjectured.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Consequently, it is highly likely that the trigger to your<br> return outside is the System Grail War&#39;s conclusion or<br> cancellation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s pretty much all the clues we&#39;ll get.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Fine.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Then can you explain this AI Holy Grail War of yours<br> in more detail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you explain the System Grail War in more detail?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Yes. The System Grail War is defined as:</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That which repairs and stabilizes the PAPERMOON<br> world when an irregularity occurs.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It is basically a large-scale defrag system. In other<br> words, a recovery ritual performed to optimize the<br> world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I can confirm we saw PAPERMOON suffer a failure<br> for unknown reasons before this happened to us.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So you mean, this is all to fix that?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know the cause of the failure either.<br> All AI were functioning normally.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You could say it&#39;s precisely due to not knowing the<br> cause that the world chose its most all-encompassing<br> form of stabilization.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> On the other hand, this means it will be difficult for<br> PAPERMOON to return to its normal state before this<br> Holy Grail War is concluded.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If ignored, it is possible the stress level might rise to a<br> state where the device can never operate normally<br> again.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I have never experienced such a situation, so I don&#39;t<br> know what that would mean for this world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It is impossible to simulate it as well.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The chances of this world being physically broken to<br> pieces is not zero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> PAPERMOON is very important to us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t have it broken...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, please.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t you be worrying more about whether or not<br> we&#39;re safe inside it?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Here are the principal rules of the System Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Being an AI Grail War, five artificial intelligences take<br> the role of Master.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As you know, those are the primes of the five AI types<br> composing this world&#39;s partitions.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Those being Keep, Transfer, Build, Grow, and Repair.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> To induce variety, each leader is arranged with a<br> random personality,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and are granted one Command Spell allowing them<br> an absolute command, crafting somewhat unique<br> Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You met one of them already\u2014</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Me. You&#39;ve heard it enough times, but I&#39;m the Master<br> representing the Repair section!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Five AIs!? The Holy Grail Wars we know generally<br> have seven Masters. Why five?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That would be because the five partitions are the only<br> usable areas we have.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The Defend AIs in the central area need to deal with<br> all naturally occurring bugs, so we don&#39;t intervene in<br> the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Additionally, the central Defend area can serve as a<br> somewhat neutral sector for everyone.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> All combat inside the administrative grounds of the<br> overseer&#39;s church is forbidden.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In other areas, any form of non-pacific interference<br> with the regular AIs, including D-types, is likewise<br> forbidden.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The Masters, with some degree of variety, summon<br> their respective Servants and fight to decide a winner.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> And when the final Servant and Master AI are decided,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> the system uses the energy fostered by the combat to<br> return PAPERMOON to its regular state\u2013</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s the outline of the procedure.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> For that reason, the system should not consider the<br> presence of a sixth participating team to be an<br> irregularity.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. We...[\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] and Kama are a sixth team with no<br> corresponding AI or area.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Is that really how things will go? Yeaaaah, that&#39;s a<br> problem...right?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Exactly. Now you see I was making the right call when<br> I\u2014</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ahem... When I practiced an ambush with them to see<br> what they were capable of.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Only one team can win the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That was the most obvious move for someone trying<br> to lower the competitor count, even if that wasn&#39;t the<br> intention at the time.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> After all, both the Master and the Servant have a<br> reason to aim for the top.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, you really need to ask?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> The victor gets any wish granted.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s why all Masters and Servants fight to<br> win\u2014</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that how Holy Grail Wars work?</p><h3 id="arrow-2-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As an AI, a Master is charged with restoring the<br> PAPERMOON world back to normalcy.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Even when provided a personality via randomization,<br> this mission does not change.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> However, it goes without saying\u2014</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The AI which wins the System Grail War is sure to<br> become the next general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In which case, the rights to customize the next world<br> and manage its upgrades are manifested.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If your ambitions are generated by your personality,<br> you&#39;ll surely gain whatever it is you desire.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Such variation and diversity is important for the world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The same goes for the victorious Servant.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As an entity living in the new world, their wish would<br> be granted by the authority of the general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This concept of fulfilling wishes was hypothetically<br> designated a Holy Grail,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and became the source of this Holy Grail War&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say I care about the name one way or the other...<br> But suppose the non-AI Master wins?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Then there would be no transfer of the general<br> supervisor AI&#39;s authority.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In that event, I swear to do my best to grant the<br> wishes of the winners.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, so I see.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> While the situation is all kinds of confusing,<br> it&#39;s safe to say that dying here counts on a spiritual<br> level.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Our wish is to get out of here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> To gain that wish, and to stay alive, we&#39;re required to<br> win the Holy Grail\u2014right?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That is so. Given that the condition precedent for the<br> System Grail War is the creation of the last pair...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Not even a sixth team, being outside the original<br> design, can avoid this.

Maybe I had the right idea in some way,<br> huh?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t claim to know the wishes of the Berserker side.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But it still remains that we&#39;re stuck having to kill one<br> another before long, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hold up, it took you this long to realize?<br> It only makes sense when put so simply.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You ought to think on your feet at least as quick as<br> yours truly, good grief.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Are you having difficulties with storage space?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This church is a completely neutral domain,<br> with all hostilities forbidden therein.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If you violate that, every single D-type AI will be<br> mobilized to apprehend or eliminate you all.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It also means being disqualified from the Holy Grail<br> War.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But wouldn&#39;t it spare us much more effort by going for<br> the kill straightaway?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Do not pursue.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (\u201CDo not pursue\u201D?)</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Rules must be followed.<br> Formulae must be correct.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As general supervisor AI, I will allow no exceptions.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Okay, okay already! I don&#39;t plan to fight here either!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Not that I mean that I wanna do it somewhere else...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Uhm, your team, being anomalous, doesn&#39;t even have<br> an area of its own, does it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> In that case, suppose we decide to team up until it&#39;s<br> down to just our parties?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And when it&#39;s down to just us, we fight it out with<br> nothing held back. Until then, we&#39;re allies!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> During which, you can move as you like through the<br> Repair partition, as thanks for your help.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I really find it unfair for you to not have your own area.<br> After all\u2014</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I would agree. Replenishing your Raniment would be<br> difficult.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Raniment... So, replenishing magical energy.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Raniment is fundamentally what an AI has at their<br> disposal.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The more of it you collect via negotiation, trade,<br> or other actions,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> the greater the resources given to a Servant,<br> giving them advantages in battle.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> When you say negotiation and trade, you mean the<br> lesser AIs are striving for their respective domain&#39;s<br> lord to win?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> They fundamentally are, but even these AIs have been<br> granted free will.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Following their occupations is also an innate desire of<br> theirs.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> By helping those who, for whatever reason,<br> cannot help themselves,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> it would be theoretically possible to gain Raniment<br> from AIs over whom you have no jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Any girls who want to give out Raniment will definitely<br> do so.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Although\u2013I won&#39;t say there are no means to<br> extract Raniment from those who remain unwilling to<br> share.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. That must be the reason why Caster was<br> assaulting the Repair AIs.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So they were trying to forcibly seize resources<br> equivalent to life force, magical energy, and money.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah. And we can&#39;t just roll over and let them take it<br> from us, so wouldn&#39;t anyone try to stop them?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s an approach that&#39;s simple, yet not.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So, being able to trust partners who are more<br> peacefully inclined...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I mean, having AIs you can get along with is to your<br> advantage.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;re already acquainted with the Repair girls,<br> so I think you&#39;ve got a head start on things.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> To be honest, Berserker doesn&#39;t have much Raniment<br> on hand at the moment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t fully restocked what we used to drive off<br> Caster, on top of our little mock battle.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t resupply properly on our way back,<br> a subsequent battle will be harsh.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So we&#39;re in a rehabilitation phase for a while.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hey c&#39;mon, who can really say how full one&#39;s belly is?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> There&#39;s guys with full stomachs who have energy to<br> spare, and guys so worn out you can knock them over<br> with a feather.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious which one falls prey to bandits.<br> If you don&#39;t wanna be attacked, you&#39;ve got to puff out<br> your chest even if your belly&#39;s empty.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Not that you can do anything about a growling<br> stomach...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be in trouble if you&#39;re attacked by another<br> Servant during your rehab,</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> so wouldn&#39;t it be safer to cooperate with Assassin for<br> that, at least?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> Two are better than one. That stands to reason now,<br> and it means safety from here on.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re oh so smart, you must have known<br> foreseen us potentially joining forces and fighting<br> together down the line?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hm, sure... I guess so.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Whether we call it joining forces, or maybe making<br> use of them... I guess both are basically the same.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Still though, Master, why is it that you&#39;ve gotten so<br> awfully impulsive?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Oh... Because it&#39;s so close to her own \u201Cwish\u201D, is it?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Good grief, so that&#39;s that. The upsides are plain to<br> see...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Most of all, there&#39;s that nonchalant and good-<br> natured Master of Assassin.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ([\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She] won&#39;t backstab us along the way...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (And even if I put together a winning strategy for our<br> final showdown, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] may not even notice.)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (All things considered... I&#39;ve got every advantage,<br> don&#39;t I?)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Ugggh... Fine, I get it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It does present risks for us, but it&#39;s for the best if we<br> return the favor for the assistance.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s one heartrending sentiment to keep in mind!<br> Accept risks while being open minded and tolerant!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> We&#39;ll join forces with this bunch on the condition that<br> we collaborate until the final two...!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I get the feeling they&#39;re doing everything they can to<br> make us feel like we owe them.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But given who I am, I don&#39;t have a mote of grateful<br> feeling in me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m thankful you agree to be allies!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha, think nothing of it. I like guys who can be of<br> use to me!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s keep on giving it our best, yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The path to our escape is slowly coming into view, I guess.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yay! So we can stick together for a while, right?<br> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Then our first order of business is to head back to the<br> Repair area and collect Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What exactly does it mean to collect Raniment from<br> the AIs?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Something like forced requisition using the prime AI&#39;s<br> privileges?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say...I&#39;d want to resort to that. I wouldn&#39;t,<br> since I couldn&#39;t live with myself afterwards.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> AIs are essentially programmed to return favors and<br> pay compensation.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The AIs are still active during the System Grail War,<br> with all sorts of problems still occurring.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Such as assisting with routine activities, or dealing<br> with a problem.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> And when the AI gives thanks for that, Raniment will<br> naturally be collected in return.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s how it goes. Now, let&#39;s go back and get to<br> work!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> There&#39;s so much to do!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thank you for everything, general supervisor.<br> See you later!</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> There is no need to thank me.

Because what else<br> can you do when you still want it?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always lived my life.

I wanted it bad<br> enough to start a war over it, and so I went on to fight!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I&#39;ve no regrets about that. I only knew that it was the<br> right thing to do.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Even if I were reborn a million times, I&#39;d do the same<br> thing every time.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And this time&#39;s the same as any other.

Whatever it is\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Nah. There&#39;s no meaning in whatever it is.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And yet, you&#39;ve got a habit of eyeballing every<br> feminine type when you first meet them. So sleazy.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Erk. That kinda thing, you know, I can&#39;t deny.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> My heart&#39;s whispering at me to find a woman.<br> Probably...a prospective wife, I&#39;d gather.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> More than likely that. The coolest of princes needs a<br> wife to match. Hwahaha!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, I suppose that&#39;s family-like in its own way.<br> Provided there&#39;s no coercion or anything.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> At any rate, I&#39;m sure to find whatever it is I want if I&#39;ve<br> taken it all beforehand.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wahaha! Are you starting to comprehend my most<br> fantastic of wishes?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s why my noble self is going the extra mile to<br> help bring my Master victory.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> With help from the overseer AI&#39;s authority,<br> she&#39;ll be able to imagine even the creation and all that<br> stuff in this small world.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> First we&#39;ll build a gargantuan shiny new palace,<br> and then stuff it with treasures and tasty food.<br> Ghehehe...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ugh. Berserkers really are so selfish, aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wrong. Your wish is just too paltry.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I&#39;m left wondering here why you&#39;re dwelling on small<br> potatoes like family when all your wishes can come<br> true.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Is it really worth your while? You don&#39;t know the<br> ruckus that comes with a hundred brothers.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Do you really think I&#39;m supposed to know from such<br> an extreme example? Not that I&#39;m endowed with<br> anything but the most plain examples.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But you all know what families are about. I kind of<br> envy you for that.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I know. Let me have some practical experience.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If all of you were a family, would that make you a<br> [\u2642 father /\u2640\uFE0F mother] and them your two daughters?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And proud of them I&#39;d be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please take care of us siblings three.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Uh, would you mind not treating me like a child?<br> I just so happen to have this appearance.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;d prefer you not lump me in with the shady<br> alchemist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And what&#39;s so shady about me? There&#39;s nothing to be<br> ashamed of regarding my current appearance or<br> thinking process.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Where ability is concerned, I am not so much a<br> daughter or little sister as a peer in whom one can trust<br> and find support\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I had the pretense of \u201Ccolleagues within an<br> organization,\u201D but that&#39;s more of a personal preference.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a point I&#39;d push on you. For starters,<br> there&#39;s a question mark as to your satisfaction in that<br> regard.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Plus, one&#39;s position shouldn&#39;t be something you<br> yourself assert or inquire after...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hahaha. Get along now. Where yours truly stands,<br> you&#39;re both just stunted parsnips of different stripes.<br> Nothing special with you either.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hm? Weren&#39;t you describing me the same way?<br> I&#39;m an excellent prime AI, you know!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I dunno about that.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You&#39;re such a... Hm?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Is there some kind of clamor going on at the home<br> base? What could be going on?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Intra-type communications are\u2014um, down? Odd.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t had a chance to check, but do the AIs have<br> comms capability?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Those of the same type can essentially network with<br> one another.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bit trickier between different types, which<br> requires an exchange of individual IDs for one-on-one<br> comms.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> There are other ways to communicate remotely in<br> cases of emergency, but that&#39;s the basic gist of it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Anyway, now it seems like the standard network<br> connection between medical types has gone down.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I can&#39;t get in touch with the girls at our<br> home base...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this.

If not, I have no such<br> intention.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> All I am is a tool.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> I would utter a different name as well, as I am no<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> Even in the event I were called such a thing,<br> it is not who I am here and now.</p><p><strong>Rider:</strong><br> I am naught but a blade, a mere warrior.<br> Merely\u2014Gao Changgong.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Oh, what a chilly reception. I do feel a rather high wall<br> set in your heart.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Brushing it seems to hold the risk of suffering a very<br> real cut.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Gao Changgong... That name is still associated with<br> the general known as Lanling Wang.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Or is the name particular to the Rider class?</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So? What&#39;s the Rider faction&#39;s business here?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> It oughta go without saying. I dropped by to let our<br> Servants duel to the death, as a competitor in the<br> System Grail War\u2014</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Or how about none of that, given that we&#39;re in Repair?<br> I brought by a subordinate who I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d fix<br> up.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> We can kill each other any old time.<br> I&#39;ve got more important shit to do, ya see.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What, now?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1ATransfer\xA0AI:</strong><br> H E L L O. I am a Transfer AI, specifically, a T-type of<br> the R.A.N.I series.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I am very embarrassed to admit that I suffered an<br> accident while carrying out my duties. I was surprised<br> by a bug that suddenly popped out.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, is that right? So these two came as escorts to see<br> your injury treated?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> E X A C T L Y.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You went out of your way to saunter into your<br> enemy&#39;s midst, the Repair home base, in the middle of<br> a Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Put it like that, I do get your drift. It&#39;s not like we had<br> to come here to get treatment.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I could just as easily flag down and ask a Repair-type<br> who&#39;s in another partition on official business,</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> or send in a request, or use a roadside emergency<br> repair kit if I felt like it.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> But\u2013since gettin&#39; this Master thing in my system,<br> a little bit of desire&#39;s been created in the process.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The kinda desire that makes ya wanna look around...<br> check things out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> That&#39;s part of the reason I made the trip. I mean,<br> there&#39;s a whole lotta things these fresh eyes haven&#39;t<br> seen first-hand.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d gimme a tour.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah... I&#39;d call that weird.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to find the right words here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He warrants a degree of caution either way...I think.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s both true and justified. I&#39;m relieved to hear<br> some rational thinking.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hahah, you might be right.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So how &#39;bout I only move around within your guys&#39;<br> visibility?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Plus, I&#39;ll give Rider orders not to do a damn thing.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I&#39;d be able to whip something<br> together right in front of you, and no way to wreak<br> havoc on my own. Right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In that case... I guess...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As long as you stay in sight, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I wonder if Rider over there is okay with his Master<br> taking unilateral action?</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> If I am given an order, I will follow it. All I am is a tool.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I know, lemme borrow an R-type to play tour guide.<br> That way it&#39;s less annoyin&#39; for me to call anybody<br> over.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Right then, first we&#39;ll check out the therapy pods and<br> medical kits...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> No, maybe start with this building? I seem to be stuck<br> on everythin&#39; that didn&#39;t draw my interest before...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I have to second that this is still weird. Does anything<br> else bear comment?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So he really came here for treatment and a tour?<br> I guess we do owe him one for driving off Caster.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And yet...I truly feel no hostility from that Master or<br> his Servant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though I do get a strong sense of discretion,<br> or at least, an unsociable will.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s even making eye contact.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Just keep an eye on each other...)</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That should do it. Scan executed\u2014and<br> confirmation complete.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I admire such treatment akin to a S P E E D S T E R as<br> much as our own work. Here is some Raniment as<br> thanks.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thanks for that. Now, back to that Master...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Humm, haww. What future will this lead to...<br> Most certainly...a world close to perfection...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Real damn fascinating.<br> Oh, there you are. All done?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> E X A C T L Y.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (He hasn&#39;t escaped my sight.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Yet he hasn&#39;t done anything suspicious...)</p><hr><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;re outta here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You mean to say you really came here just for this?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Whatever more I could say, that&#39;s all there is.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The future&#39;s moving forward at high speed.<br> We&#39;ve got no time to sit around and eat its dust.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But you&#39;re at least saying...you have no intent to fight<br> us today?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> True that. Pick a fight and it might all be over.<br> I get the feelin&#39; like that&#39;s still a waste.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> But what do you make of Caster? His Master&#39;s<br> character looked all too warlike to me.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll continue to make the first move.<br> Though I can&#39;t say if it&#39;ll be here or elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No doubt. I&#39;ve calculated that much.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> While I&#39;m talking, I&#39;m willin&#39; to pay for the tour with<br> information on top of Raniment.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> We on the Rider side of things are over in Transfer.<br> We got the edge over the others in mobility, AI or not.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> And most of the partitions&#39; goings-on have been<br> scouted out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I oughta say that it&#39;s only a rough idea of things.<br> There wasn&#39;t a thorough investigation.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> As you probably know, Caster&#39;s off in Build.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> And it&#39;s more than likely Saber&#39;s at Grow and Lancer<br> is at Keep.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Where were those, and what were they again?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Right here.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Adjacent to us in Repair are Build and Transfer.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And here, you have Grow and Keep.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, all clear then.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I guess it goes without sayin&#39; after your bunch got<br> attacked that the most aggressive side so far happens<br> to be Caster&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Indications are that Saber&#39;s and Lancer&#39;s have yet to<br> proactively mount an attack.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I got no clue whether those Masters aren&#39;t warlike or<br> if they&#39;re craftily building up their strength instead.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s...Lancer&#39;s status?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Yeah, ya got it. Not one sign of him. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s<br> even stepped outta their partition yet.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Not warlike. Possibly crafty...)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Ridiculous. Is that even possible? It&#39;s HIM\u2014)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Eh...? What could be wrong with me? Yours truly is the<br> same as always.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> All right, we&#39;ll be heading home right about now.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be meetin&#39; again\u2014in the near<br> future. That&#39;s the one thing ya can count on.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> The question is, which route to take?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> (Glinting shine)</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> As in whether your Transfer&#39;s express travel asset or<br> Rider&#39;s fine steed might make the trip faster?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I took that to be the manner of your Q U E S T I O N.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Eh? Haha, that wasn&#39;t my aim at all.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Shall we race? We are the proud S P E E D S T E R S<br> of this world. There will be no losing if we are<br> challenged.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Not a word.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Still not talkin&#39; with anyone but me, Rider?</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> If ordered to, I shall. If not, I won&#39;t. That&#39;s all there is<br> to it, Master.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> I will repeat it as often as I must.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> Please do not expect me to make any moves on my<br> own initiative.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> I will never take action on my own. Not to fight and<br> not to use my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take no action whatsoever of my own will.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> In return, I honor my Master&#39;s every command.<br> That&#39;s all I amount to.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> If a Master expects their Servant to tread beyond their<br> expected bounds,</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> that would surely make me into a wretched,<br> evil Servant.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> I am merely a sword. Nay, as a Rider, truly no<br> different than a mere horse.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> Simply point my nose in the direction I am told to go,<br> and only run when I am told to run.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> (That&#39;s right\u2014)</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> (Because the fate of a horse that runs as it pleases<br> despite its reins goes without saying.)</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Psh. If I had to pick one or the other, I&#39;d say my<br> character leans more towards calculation than instinct.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I &#39;preciate how much quicker on the uptake we can be<br> with fewer uncertainties in the picture.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I&#39;m not that unhappy with the way ya do things.<br> Just try to give it your best for the future&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Then what will you do now?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> We would regret missing a chance to show off our<br> superior S T Y L E. Hairpin curves are our specialty.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Not a word.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> (Sigh) Well, point of fact, I don&#39;t really care how<br> quick I go or anythin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> If you&#39;re simply in a hurry, just use your own machine.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> I recall that your own express travel asset was a<br> special bike, leader.</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> The one with the handlebars all splayed out.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Yeah, I left my chopper behind at HQ.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Just moving around fast is fine and well, but right now<br> I&#39;m making both detailed observations and measuring<br> variables.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> There&#39;s more profit found in taking the comprehensive<br> view by dedicatin&#39; some attention there while on the<br> move.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that why I picked you up and shuttled you here<br> on Rider&#39;s horse?</p><p><strong>Rani-T:</strong><br> Then...do you have no use for your S P E E D S T E R S?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Never said that, everything just has its time and place.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> I was only plannin&#39; on going back to HQ for now to<br> consolidate this information.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> It&#39;s also worthwhile to give Rider some downtime.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So this time we&#39;ll head back on your express asset.<br> But there&#39;s no need to gun it all the way.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> If I discover something of interest on the way back,<br> I obviously mean to wholeheartedly investigate\u2014</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now then. We&#39;ll need to update our comm protocols.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That way we can get back in touch quickly in the event<br> anything should go wrong.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Its encryption...and of course, higher signal strength...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You okay...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Of course I am. I&#39;m certainly sad to see them go...<br> but I can&#39;t be stuck in a rut over it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If there&#39;s anything I can do to help...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No, not to worry. This really is my role as a prime AI.</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So all of you can go ahead and get some rest.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I can sleep after I&#39;ve finished all the work that needs<br> doing. Don&#39;t worry about me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How do all of you usually sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The girls on night shift stick to their duties,<br> with the others taking a control pod.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> About your group... Uhm, what should we do?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The control pods designed for AIs are rather rugged.<br> I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the most comfortable choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Anywhere&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m used to roughing it.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For the time being, we&#39;ll be okay as long as there&#39;s a<br> place to lie down.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Although it&#39;d be best if there were such a room that<br> would allow all three of us to rest at the same time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;d like to avoid having three single rooms.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re being cautious around me...?<br> Or do you have your own scheme in mind?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s not limited to you, but anything that might<br> threaten Fujimaru during [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] sleep period.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Simply an optimal solution for a top priority issue.<br> Or do you have anything to add?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I feel like things just took an awkward turn,<br> but it might just be me.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Lots of rooms do meet your requirements, so I&#39;ll show<br> you to whichever&#39;s best. Have a good rest then!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Not too wide, not too narrow. It&#39;s no sleeper carriage,<br> just a stage with space with room for three to lie<br> down.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I think it earns passing marks for lines of sight on both<br> intruder precautions and incidental escape routes.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Good, then it&#39;s time we went to bed. Let us be<br> immersed in lapses right up close and impossible to<br> escape.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I will, of course, be your escort...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Your area is over there. I don&#39;t mind forcing you to<br> move with my Etherlite.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Fine then, I get it.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmph to you.

My lips are sealed.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Whatever. We need to restock on Raniment-laced<br> materials. Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Raniment is a conceptual factor analogous to magical<br> energy. And materials refer to the base substances that<br> compose this world, right?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah. In simpler terms, that&#39;d be food.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The people at Keep modify the raw material produced<br> by Grow to contain tiny amounts of Raniment.<br> Here&#39;s one.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And by ingesting these...you AI replenish magical<br> energy and recover from material deterioration?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. That is indeed how food works.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> The Raniment we gain through this balances out our<br> natural consumption, meaning this just preserves the<br> status quo.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It won&#39;t give us any advantages in combat.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re in the same standing as an AI,<br> I think you can eat it. Will you try?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s important to stay energized.

Then they&#39;re\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Correct. Among all things in this world...

Food above all.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I can&#39;t fight before I give my Master the delicious meal<br> that&#39;ll make her happy.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve come to procure ingredients here in<br> Grow!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m not here for a fight. So put that sword of yours<br> down, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you stupid? Who would believe that?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Well, I kinda need you to... Okay, here&#39;s a fair<br> compromise.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> What are you sitting on the ground for?</p><p><strong>L\uFF1ALancer:</strong><br> Saber, you may call your Master here.</p><p><strong>L\uFF1ALancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m not lying. If you let me have a sincere conversation<br> with your Master, that will convey my honesty to you<br> too.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> That confirms it, just an idiot\u2014<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (Right, there could be another group working off this!<br> While he distracts me here... Sakura!)</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> She said no. Let&#39;s leave...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Sakura!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ve never seen you make a face<br> like that...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> \u2014You&#39;re not hurt.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I was worried for nothing... No, it may just be that I got<br> here faster than them.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> There&#39;s an enemy here. We need to move, just in<br> case\u2014</p><p><strong>L\uFF1ALancer:</strong><br> Hup hup. Cutting in!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Don&#39;t leave me behind, you idiot...!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> (He seems to have followed me here. I returned at full<br> speed. He&#39;s as fast as me...!?)</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that look in your eyes?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, uh, see, I&#39;m a bit blessed by the winds.<br> Just &#39;cause I&#39;m big, it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m slow.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You used me to locate my Master?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Nah, you just ran here without saying a word.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I told you to bring your Master to me, but I never said<br> I&#39;d be staying put,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> so when you ran, I assumed you were leading me to<br> her and followed.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Eh, not that any of that matters.<br> Yo, are you Saber&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I...am.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to answer. Back away, Sakura.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I already told you enough times before, I&#39;m not here<br> for a fight.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m a cook. And the ingredients necessary to cook in<br> this world are your material.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> So I&#39;m here to procure some. Here&#39;s where the crops<br> grow, so I suppose I can find some quality goods<br> around these parts, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Cook...ing? So you&#39;re the one behind the new trend?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hell yeah, you ate some? Was it good?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AGrow\xA0AI:</strong><br> Delicious. Just remembering it... I feel like I&#39;m living a<br> dream...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hahaha, really now? Glad to know my cooking works<br> even on AI!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> But my gloomball of a Master still isn&#39;t satisfied with<br> my quality, see?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> The ultimate dish starts with the ultimate ingredients.<br> And that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you really believing his words?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yeah. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the story someone wanting<br> to trick me would go for.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> And if he was planning to fight, he would have<br> attacked before we linked up.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Not to mention\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Not to mention this really great smell. Don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I...suppose.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> So I think it&#39;s pretty safe to say Lancer is indeed a<br> cook.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> As the prime Grow AI,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> it&#39;s my natural duty to provide materials to the<br> children of Keep who will put it to good use.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> It&#39;s not me asking for this donation, though...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Besides, didn&#39;t I mention before that I&#39;d like to learn<br> how to cook?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I have so many questions. So can you take him at his<br> word, Saber?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I thought you were more timid, but you&#39;re quite<br> stubborn and stupid.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say stupid. That&#39;s so mean.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I won&#39;t allow anyone acting out of hand. One false<br> move and I&#39;ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> \u2014This applies to everyone here. I&#39;ll even kill your<br> Master.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m fine with that!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m not!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> I mean... I feel like if anyone&#39;s going to die,<br> I&#39;ll be the first one anyway, but...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> No, no, what I&#39;m fine with is the way it sounds like<br> they&#39;ll hand us the ingredients.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way you&#39;d die. I&#39;m here to protect you.<br> You&#39;re totally safe from death.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Alright, the wind is blowing in a nice direction!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> So let&#39;s waste no time. Show me the best produce you<br> have!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Come to think of it, this might be the first time<br> someone actively demanded quality.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This gets me in the mood to show off a product<br> worthy of my prime AI status.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Heya!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I still don&#39;t know what you consider \u201Cbest\u201D,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> so let&#39;s take a look at the stock together.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We should be able to find the highest grade materials<br> that haven&#39;t been shipped yet.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Oh, really? Thanks a bunch!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Hoh, you do have a lot. Don&#39;t mind if I test a few.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There is some stuff I&#39;ve never seen before,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> but a good cook knows how to predict how good<br> something ultimately will be.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Lemme see...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m really proud of those materials over there in<br> particular. What do you think? Do they satisfy you?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> He&#39;s clearly digging through things at random.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> He could be aiming to mishandle material to lower its<br> value. How much slack are we going to give?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Ugh, he&#39;s smelling them. We need to stop him before<br> he starts licking or biting things.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t we kill him before he does?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> C-calm down.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> He&#39;ll just have to pay for anything he does lick or bite...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But he wouldn&#39;t do it for more than one item per<br> batch. And what can we do if that&#39;s what he needs to<br> evaluate the product?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> (Ugh. Can this end any faster...?)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hello... Lancer&#39;s Master... You&#39;re the prime Keep AI,<br> right?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Probably.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Probably?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> My personality was randomly plastered over an AI.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> This must have caused some sort of weird bug.<br> I don&#39;t feel any sense of duty as an AI.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> My memories show me being dutiful, but now my<br> responsible side is tangibly gone.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> (Not only that... I&#39;m definitely failing as a Grail War<br> Master too...)</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Heh... What&#39;s going on with me?</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Seeing how well you&#39;re doing, it makes it all the more<br> clear to me.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> I can&#39;t pretend not to notice it anymore. Not that I<br> ever really tried to.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> I&#39;m probably glitching, both as an AI and as a Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Are...you? You don&#39;t seem that way.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> I am.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But, uh...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh. There was something I wanted to ask you but<br> forgot.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m called Sakura. It was Saber who named me.</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> I have no name\u2014</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> She&#39;s got one!</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Lancer!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you say yourself you felt like that was your<br> name? Names are important. If you have one,<br> you shouldn&#39;t hide it.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Mmm, I can do some good stuff with this! Its smell is...<br> Well, now...</p><p><strong>Lancer&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> ...Cerejeira.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Cerejeira? That&#39;s a beautiful name.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hehehe. By the way, did you ever eat those meals,<br> Cerejeira?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> They&#39;re quite delicious. Lancer made them, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> They&#39;ve also got me dying to get him to teach me how<br> to cook.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> Go ahead. He&#39;s...a weird Servant.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> He spends all his time cooking for me, not fighting or<br> preparing for battle.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh. Hehehe, you&#39;re a shy one.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> To me, you mentioning how you get to eat his meals<br> all the time sounds like you&#39;re bragging about your man.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But my Saber is a great Servant too.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> She&#39;s usually brusque, but she&#39;s actually very kind.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Whenever I&#39;m doing any remotely dangerous job,<br> she&#39;s always watching me from behind in silence<br> and\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Sakura.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Hehehe...I&#39;m saying too much, aren&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;m usually not this talkative.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Most of us G-types don&#39;t get to talk much, but now I<br> suddenly find myself enjoying chatting quite a lot.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s weird...</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> You call it chatting... Are you forgetting I&#39;m an enemy<br> Master? You shouldn&#39;t be treating me like a friend.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We AI were pure functionality, but now that we&#39;ve<br> been added this extra element that is our pseudo-<br> personalities,</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> everyone will have a part of themselves that feels odd<br> or glitchy, I think.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> That&#39;s pretty much why I wanted to chat with you<br> despite you being an enemy Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Our competition doesn&#39;t change this. Right,<br> and beyond that...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason why\u2014rivals can&#39;t be friends.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Or is that a problem for you?</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> I... I&#39;m...</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think I deserve any of this.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m not qualified to be prime AI, or a Master,<br> or someone&#39;s friend.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;m not qualified to be anything. Considering all I&#39;ve<br> done before\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Done before? Your phrasing makes no sense.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We&#39;re Masters birthed by the randomizer. This is the<br> first place we&#39;ve ever been to.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> You may have messed up before when you were just<br> an AI, but why would that matter now?</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> Do you...think so?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure. So I don&#39;t think you need to mind it.</p><p><strong>M\uFF1ACerejeira:</strong><br> You&#39;re weird...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yup, that&#39;s the stuff! That&#39;s some good material.<br> Perfect size and perfect luster.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;ll take the whole lot!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Ah. Sorry, am I interrupting something?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> N-not at all.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yeah, we were just chatting. We had a very meaningful<br> time together.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Great to hear. So, I gotta pay in Raniment, right?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> There you go.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Oh my, this much? I don&#39;t think this trade is fair on<br> you...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> No biggie, it&#39;s &#39;cause I dropped in with no previous<br> warning. I included a fee for being unreasonable.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Thank you very much for that.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need this much, so that&#39;s all yours, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...Are you alright in the head, Lancer? You&#39;re<br> benefiting your enemy.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Are you trying to say you can defeat me even with a<br> handicap?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Man, you&#39;re really raring for this fight, huh?<br> I already told you I&#39;m not duking it out with anyone for<br> now.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Now&#39;s the time for cooking. Gotta do something &#39;bout<br> my Master&#39;s sulking face.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> How long do you mean by \u201Cfor now\u201D?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Nothing changes the fact that we&#39;re participants in<br> the Holy Grail War. Combat is unavoidable, I believe.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Like I care.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure everyone wants a little more time to<br> settle in. Not just you and me.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Just give all of us a moment to eat what we want,<br> and once everyone is full,</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> and out of other things to do\u2014</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> That&#39;s when should gather for our little tournament.<br> Have it as an exercise to help digestion, don&#39;t you<br> agree?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> And that&#39;s all I had to say, so I&#39;m out. Gotta make a<br> supreme dish with these ingredients.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Heheheh, just wait for it, Master. Your next meal will<br> be the one that finally breaks you out of your shell...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Don&#39;t expect any excitement from me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Well then, uh... Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I had so many questions I wanted to ask about<br> cooking, but it&#39;s hard to find the courage to ask Lancer...</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> It was the right choice. I&#39;d do everything to stop you if<br> you tried asking him.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to ask you never to try anything like that again.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> From my perspective as someone who needs to<br> protect my Master in the Holy Grail War, what<br> happened just now was far too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Was it...?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you tell me you already developed trust and<br> think of them as friends now?</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> If so, you&#39;re insanely naive.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> This area is what I love and what matters the most for<br> me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> So I kinda...can&#39;t be harsh on people who value Grow<br> and praise the quality of my materials.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> You need to change the way you think.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> Those are the only Holy Grail War participants we&#39;ve<br> met so far. There&#39;s no guarantee the others will be like<br> them.</p><p><strong>Saber:</strong><br> We&#39;re lucky that no one was harmed in the present<br> incident. If it happens again, who can tell what\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wh-what?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> \u2014Team! Tell me what happened!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ARani-G:</strong><br> Oh no...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ARani-G:</strong><br> We&#39;re under attack.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ARani-G:</strong><br> It&#39;s...a Servant!</p><h3 id="arrow-2-pre-battle-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-pre-battle-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Caster&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Stand in line.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ABuild\xA0AI\xA0(Rani-B):</strong><br> ...Complete.</p><p><strong>Caster&#39;s\xA0Master:</strong><br> Hold your tongue.

That doesn&#39;t mean<br> abandoning Grow forever.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Escaping now is the only way to prevent the true end<br> of Grow. No arguing about it, Sakura!</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Oh, excellent. Better than I imagined!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about your fuel reserves, eat anything<br> that moves! You have food everywhere!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get rid of the restraint routines while<br> we&#39;re\u2013Hm...? The command responses weren&#39;t<br> supposed to be this slow...</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> That way next? You have a good sense of smell for<br> living Raniment.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> \u2014Not a problem. His decision making is more<br> autopilot than I hoped for, but that doesn&#39;t hurt the<br> plan.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> This power gain makes maneuverability loss still a<br> quite favorable trade-off. Fine by me. Consume greedily,<br> expand greedily!</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> You can eat a Servant if you find any.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> They won&#39;t be able to beat you. No one will!<br> Hwhahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Wheeze) D-don&#39;t you think we ran far enough?<br> That&#39;s a fair enough distance for me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What&#39;s our current location?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Uh... Around here.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Exactly at the frontier between Grow, Keep,<br> and the central Defend area.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The Grow AIs all received the message through<br> the G-type communications, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Yes. Escaping is the number one priority now.<br> I told them to leave without concerning themselves<br> with the area.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> But they aren&#39;t as fast as the T-types.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> After we escaped, a large number of them were eaten<br> by that giant monster.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> They all went their own ways, so the enemy couldn&#39;t<br> pursue them in all directions at the same time.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You have to believe the damage was minimal.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (This AI&#39;s face is unsettling...<br> Reminds me of Parvati.)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Ah, s-sorry. I forgot to thank you for helping me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Better late than never with courtesies.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m...the prime Grow AI and Saber&#39;s Master,<br> named Sakura by her.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Thank you so, so much.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Repair AIs can&#39;t ignore a formal request delivered<br> through official channels.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> That call was something I tried only for the sake of<br> trying... Then why...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You can tell just by looking that I&#39;m already partnered<br> with Assassin&#39;s party.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> So, you know... It&#39;s not like I&#39;m not trying to win the<br> Holy Grail War,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but I don&#39;t see that as a reason to cut myself off from<br> interaction with other AIs.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> My hope is to strengthen our connections, even.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> And, you know, you don&#39;t abandon others for no<br> reason, right?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I have to say it again... Thank you so, so much.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need thanks. We did what anyone would.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But now that we&#39;ve calmed down, time for some<br> proper observation. Not you either...? I want someone a<br> bit more...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> What are you doing to Sakura? Get any closer to her<br> and I&#39;ll kill you on the spot.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Oho, a dangerous lady with amazing curves...<br> Not you either. Yeah, no.</p><p><strong>I\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Heh, seem like neither of you ladies are my soulmate.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;d better not think that you saving Sakura means<br> she owes you anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Saber Medusa...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She feels slightly younger...)</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. Berserker might be thinking about who<br> owes us, but I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Anyways, the Repair forces should be joining us at<br> any moment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We can fix all the damaged Grow girls.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now the big question is location. Are we okay to<br> gather where we are?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well, that depends on where Caster\u2014that giant<br> monster\u2014will go.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> If he&#39;s after us, then we should stay on the run.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Wait a second. Wasn&#39;t he forbidden to attack AIs in<br> the Defend area?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If we fully enter the central area, which is not far from<br> here,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> then at the very least, we won&#39;t have to fear any<br> danger to the AIs.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> True.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We have a good shot with that, so I&#39;ll message all the<br> Grow girls telling them to flee to the central partition if<br> they can.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, good! Then we&#39;ll go further in and build our<br> field hospital there.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t recommend that, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the prime Defend AI, right?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Yeah, DX. Why are you here?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wait, this place is bordering Defend, so there&#39;s<br> nothing particularly weird about your presence.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...Your statement intrigues me. Which of our actions<br> are you considering unrecommendable?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> This question has multiple answers.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> To allow a mass of Grow AI to join with a mass of<br> Repair AI arrived to fix them. And to gather them in the<br> Defend partition.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wait a second. Are you forbidding them to evacuate to<br> Defend&#39;s area?</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> As far as I know, Defend&#39;s rule of neutrality includes<br> becoming a place of refuge during emergencies.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Much like the church in the center is for Holy Grail<br> War participants, the AIs need Defend to\u2013</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> ...Agreed. That is correct. But I must clarify.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The neutrality provision of the AI in Defend is not<br> functioning.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The giant monster amalgamation of Caster&#39;s<br> familiars\u2014identified by the title \u201Cworm fiends\u201D,</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> has currently invaded the central area and is eating<br> every D-type in its path.</p><h2 id="section-6-covetous-veneration-for-eating" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-covetous-veneration-for-eating" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Covetous Veneration/for eating</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wh-what do you mean!?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Exactly what I said. The neutrality regulations are not<br> being respected.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> We speculate that an unidentified glitch occurred in<br> Caster&#39;s Master, the prime Build AI&#39;s programming.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s supersized worm fiend is in the vicinity of<br> coordinates 17-50, indiscriminately preying upon<br> nearby AI.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> There is no distinguishing between G-type refugees,<br> the intercepting D-types, or other AI who happened<br> to be in the area.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The situation is clearly abnormal.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Thus, the general supervisor AI suggested I be sent<br> here, where multiple Servants are gathered.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Rani XII&#39;s orders... Eh, whatever. Why does the<br> number of Servants here matter?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> The general supervisor AI declares that\u2014<br> the AI Holy Grail War is suspended,</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> and, under her overseer jurisdiction, proposes that we<br> all cooperate to eliminate the potentially rampaging<br> Caster.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Message to all Servants here:<br> Gather at the church with your Masters.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Saber. Berserker. Assassin...</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> And Lancer.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Sure thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Where have I seen him before?)</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Lancer. How long have you been here?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> You&#39;re at the border of my territory.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I was just headed home with my ingredients when it<br> suddenly got real noisy behind me.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> I wish I were considering the best way to use what I<br> procured, but I had to at least check on what was going<br> on.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I smell another Indian god here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Yours is...Vayu, the wind god...?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> Yup. I&#39;m Vayu&#39;s son.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong><br> By the way, my big bro is Dharma&#39;s son, and my little<br> bros are Indra&#39;s son and the sons of the Asvinau twins.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I knew it was you. Bhima...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hey, Duryodhana... Fancy meeting you here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Bhima, son of the wind god Vayu. Fujimaru,<br> do you understand the implications of this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s...Arjuna&#39;s brother...right?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hm? Your Master knows Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> He&#39;s the GOAT. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better brother.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Though he might have been serious to a troublesome<br> degree, not that I think he ever caused anyone real<br> problems.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But don&#39;t mind it, that&#39;s just how he is. Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ah, I&#39;m here talking as if you were his allies,<br> but I still don&#39;t know if you actually were. Eh,<br> I&#39;m sure you were, you wouldn&#39;t still be alive otherwise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s one of the five Pandava princes.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hoh? Sure, I suppose a Master with a Hindu Divine<br> Spirit would know that.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (One of the five Pandava princes and Arjuna&#39;s older<br> brother, yes. But not only that. Bhima the Mightiest...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (And the person most deeply associated with him in<br> folklore is\u2014)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that glare, Duryodhana.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Now&#39;s not the time for it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Wh-wh-what did you say!?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> He&#39;s right, though. I don&#39;t know what history binds<br> you and this Lancer,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but the situation with the AIs and Caster&#39;s supersized<br> creature is more important.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Rani XII told us to come to her church, right?</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> Correct. Rider is absent here, but another<br> spokesperson relayed him the instructions.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> This is a formal request from the overseer. You must<br> obey if possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to deal with Caster one way or the other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Sure, the more people we have hitting that big lug,<br> the better.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Less work per person.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmph. I don&#39;t mind going to the church, but definitely<br> not with him.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can never know when he&#39;ll stab me in the back.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;d never be so cowardly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You lowlife, who do you think you&#39;re talking to?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Whoa, he got all red. That&#39;s some real deep-seated<br> hatred.)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to make friends with anyone either.<br> We just need to all ultimately arrive at the church, right?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Then we&#39;ll go our own way.<br> ...Sakura.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>DX:</strong><br> I request you gather as swiftly as possible.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to tell us. We&#39;ll probably be the first<br> there.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Whoa, she jumped away bridal-carrying her girl.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I gotta go back to pick up my Master.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But I&#39;m the son of the wind god. My huge physique<br> doesn&#39;t slow me down at all.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, wait for me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> These are unforeseen circumstances, but at the very<br> least, we managed to confirm who all the Servants are.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s review all the information we have on the way to<br> the church\u2014</p><h3 id="arrow-2-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> (Sulk)</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> You can&#39;t even bother hiding your bad mood.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s about Lancer, right? He&#39;s someone you knew?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Silence. Don&#39;t ask.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Nuh-uh...I will ask! Because you&#39;re not gonna tell me if<br> I don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We&#39;re talking about a Servant that might become our<br> enemy in the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that your Master would want to know.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you won&#39;t talk,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> we could always present all objective information we<br> know to Ayus, from top to bottom.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It might contain details you&#39;ll find inaccurate or<br> unpleasant,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but if hearing from you is not an option...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> WHA... Wait, stop!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can tell all you have to say is worthless nonsense<br> saying I&#39;m the irredeemable villain or that everything is<br> Duryodhana&#39;s fault!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Fine then, I&#39;ll tell a bit of the story.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> His group of five brothers were the enemies of us one<br> hundred princes.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But since we hailed from the same country,<br> we all learned martial arts under the same mentor.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I see. And why did you become enemies? Why do you<br> hate him so much, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Family trouble is the simplest way to put it.<br> A question of who rightfully deserved to inherit the<br> kingdom\u2014</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Quiet, you.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> There were many reasons, quite a lot of them...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> But the short of it is that they were a dirty pack of<br> misunderstanders who didn&#39;t know their place.<br> That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> My instincts tell me the short of it isn&#39;t saying enough.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No, it is. That&#39;s how it always has been. That&#39;s why<br> yours truly and my brothers had been fighting them<br> endlessly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And the biggest eyesore of the bunch is that guy<br> Bhima. Ever since he was a brat, he was all like,<br> \u201CLook how big and burly I am. Look how strong I am.\u201D<br> Repulsive.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> My only option to oppose him was the brilliant idea to<br> put him to sleep with poison, tie him up before he woke<br> up, and throw him down the river.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Speechless)</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And SOMEHOW, the guy ended up in the Patala realm,<br> where he drank the Nagaraja&#39;s Amrita and came back<br> stronger!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How unfair! Unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Later I took away everything he had in a dice gamble...<br> Though that only worked thanks to Uncle Shakuni...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And then, right, when they were exiled to the woods,<br> I visited them to point and laugh,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> but then I needed them to save me when I was<br> captured by some gandharvas! Oh, the humiliation!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Okay! You&#39;ve heard enough to understand how evil<br> they are.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s only natural that I wouldn&#39;t even want to talk to<br> their ilk. Understand me!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Well...okay. You must have been through a lot...<br> And so had they.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hmph. That&#39;s enough talk. Get moving. We&#39;re almost<br> at the church.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What a blatant attempt to force the conversation to<br> an end. Is he avoiding the topic of the all-out war?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can imagine why.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Indeed. Among all five princes, Bhima is the one who<br> became a most special part of Duryodhana&#39;s past.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> He certainly doesn&#39;t want to say from his own mouth<br> that he died in a duel against him\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why would that be?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> My knowledge allows me to infer this:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Among all five princes, Bhima is the one who became<br> a most special part of Duryodhana&#39;s past.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> He certainly doesn&#39;t want to admit personally that he<br> died in a duel against him\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Oops, we the last ones here?

It&#39;s been some time.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I, in my functions of overseer to the AI Holy Grail War,<br> am not allowed to meet you except in the case of<br> unforeseen circumstances...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances is exactly<br> what we&#39;re dealing with here.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (I was brought here against my will...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s Lancer&#39;s Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Saber&#39;s Master said her name is Cerejeira. Not that I<br> care.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (...? I don&#39;t know what, but something feels out of<br> place. What can&#39;t I put my finger on...?)</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The prime Defend AI already informed you of the<br> situation.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Through usage of his Noble Phantasm and a<br> construction support spell programmed by his Master,<br> Caster transformed into a large abomination modeled<br> after his familiars\u2014</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The creature summoned and merged with\u2014hereby<br> named Supersized Worm Fiend\u2014is a monster existing<br> solely to devour nearby AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It completely ignores the neutrality of Defend,<br> so we assume it to be out of control.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s unclear how much of its actions are affected by its<br> Master&#39;s will,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> but considering he displayed no attempts to stop it,<br> they must be punished for this rule violation.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I, in my functions of overseer to the AI Holy Grail War,<br> classify them as a hindrance that must be eliminated<br> from the System Grail War.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> A little slow on the uptake, aren&#39;t we? It&#39;s been clear<br> for a while that they were doing whatever without a<br> care for anything.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Managing AI is an element of this Holy Grail War.<br> Any action that doesn&#39;t affect the world as a whole...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> is accepted as valid strategy\u2013but causing a<br> stampede in the central area is too blatantly unlawful<br> to allow.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I can safely say he crossed the line.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> And why do we have to do your dirty work?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s a known fact that the fighting strength of a<br> Servant can only be contained by you, the other<br> Servants.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You could say all the Raniment in the world currently<br> revolves around you.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Parameter-based reasons aside, I understand you<br> question the necessity of this based on your role and<br> position.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As such, I, the overseer, prepared a reward for<br> participation in this operation.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Oh? And what would that be?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I promise to share the additional Command Spells<br> available to the overseer.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Needless to say, those are supercompressed charges<br> of Raniment customized for usage among System Grail<br> War Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> They will prove useful in future battles.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Aw.

You can deal with it.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you&#39;ve decided after dragging me all the<br> way out here?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Everyone&#39;s here. It&#39;d be rude if we didn&#39;t at least<br> show our faces. But that never meant we were going to<br> listen and follow what they said.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t mention any penalties, am I right?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...Correct. I made the request to everyone, but it was<br> nothing more than a request. You are not forced to<br> abide.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No problem, then. I&#39;ll be the only one missing out on a<br> bonus, but that&#39;s no bother.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Our delicious dinner is a bonus only I&#39;ll get.<br> No big difference there. Things are even.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I really don&#39;t understand you. No, I kinda do, but...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Well... I do agree that we&#39;d just get in everyone&#39;s way<br> if you don&#39;t feel up for it. So\u2014</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right, Cerejeira.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Everyone has their own things they&#39;re good at...<br> We&#39;ve got everyone else here.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> And I look forward to the tasty dishes you&#39;ll make for<br> us.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Once things calm down, I&#39;ll make sure to go check<br> what delicacies my materials are being used for.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sure...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> We couldn&#39;t unite everyone, but this response still falls<br> within the predicted range.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll give you the information necessary to solve<br> the situation.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s Supersized Worm Fiend&#39;s presumed<br> movement routine...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...is heading in the direction that allows it to obtain the<br> most Raniment.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Towards any place populated with AI. Or preferably<br> to the closest location, as far as we speculate.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If more than one choice is available, it&#39;ll opt for the<br> one containing the largest group.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Its current location is in the north part of the Defend<br> partition, coordinates 10-14. It&#39;s been heading south<br> ever since its emergence in Grow...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Meaning the central part of Defend is within its route.<br> It might be trying to reach the church.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This would mean it entered Defend because the<br> population of AIs stationed in Defend...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...came to outnumber the population of scattered AIs<br> running for their lives in Grow.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Sakura. It&#39;s Defend who are to<br> blame for failing to solve the problem.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> More importantly, is this church the creature&#39;s<br> ultimate goal?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If Caster detects Raniment quantity, then I can&#39;t deny<br> the possibility he&#39;s after what&#39;s stored here...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The spare Command Spells intended to be delivered<br> to you,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and the nucleus Raniment used to operate the system.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Assuming its rampage is commanded by a purely<br> mechanical routine, then we&#39;re mostly guaranteed<br> that&#39;s what he&#39;s working toward.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> So that gives us a pretty good picture of its route.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hah. In that case\u2013it&#39;s obvious what we gotta do.<br> We&#39;re taking our leave, if you&#39;ll excuse us.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh!? Weren&#39;t we all doing this together!?</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Nah, not seeing that future. Do whatever you want.</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> See ya. Let&#39;s go, Rider.</p><p><strong>Gao\xA0Changgong:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Talk about uncooperative!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> And here I was thinking I&#39;d have less work cut out for<br> me. Now we&#39;ve ended up with only three Servants left.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Weird... Definitely weird.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> How could he prioritize anything other than battle?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Is he...truly Bhima...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t go spacing out, Berserker!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what everyone&#39;s up to, but now we&#39;ve<br> gotta do it on our own!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got to think about how we&#39;ll fight here!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now that we know where the enemy is headed<br> toward, we can either wait in its path or intercept it.<br> Those are the basic possibilities.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The opponent will be stronger than it was the<br> previous times we fought.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Which means we need an advantage we didn&#39;t have<br> before.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So here is my question:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rani XII. With this being a formal request from the<br> overseer, don&#39;t you have some sort of plan to<br> accommodate us?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> \u2014Suggestion accepted.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I&#39;ll offer certain quantities of pre-stocked Raniment at<br> my discretion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Excellent.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So what makes this battle different from the previous<br> ones is our stock of resources, and the geographical<br> advantage of the point at which we&#39;ll be waiting for the<br> enemy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s you, Saber.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;re ordering me to work?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> For what other reason would you have remained here?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Saber, please.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It&#39;s true, this battle is not like the one in Grow.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> There will be no G-types around us. Nor any facilities I<br> need to worry about.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I have enough Raniment in the tank... I can fight as<br> hard as I want.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Although, honestly, I&#39;d rather not have to give it my all<br> when anyone can see me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Are you all right with this, Sakura? This will end with<br> us showing our hand to them.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think we have any other choice...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t do what it takes to get rid of that Caster,<br> we won&#39;t be able to return to Grow.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I just wanna go back to the place I love. To spend<br> those quiet times with everyone like we always did...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Got it... I&#39;ll do what I must.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But since I&#39;ll be going all out, I&#39;ll need all of you to<br> contribute too.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> You&#39;re not allowed to slack off like the ones who ran<br> away.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Slacking off is all I wanted, but guess I can&#39;t say no<br> here.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Our number one slacker, Berserker, has something<br> else occupying his mind right now.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> We need someone on duty kicking his butt to make<br> him work.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Oh, I can help with kicking his butt!<br> And I can also heal it perfectly if it gets sore!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But what are our chances of victory, Saber?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> We won&#39;t know until we try,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> but at very least, since collateral damage is not a<br> problem,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> it becomes a competition between me and that worm<br> fiend...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> To decide which of us is the greater rampaging<br> monster\u2014</p><h3 id="arrow-3-pre-battle-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-3-pre-battle-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 3 Pre-Battle</h3><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The creature advances.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I seek only to fulfill my simple and clear desires,<br> as permitted to me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To devour.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> To trample over the weak, to rip apart those who owe<br> him complete obedience\u2014to end their lives.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah\u2014Ah!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Acknowledgments of terror.

This has the same color, smell,<br> and screams as that room decorated with foolish<br> brides... Thus, the same taste.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need no longer wait for any sacrifices.<br> I can simply walk towards new brides.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I understand what its body is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can smell it on its skin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Could it be?

Now your scared eyes<br> are looking at I, the room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s no different from being inside.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Where&#39;s my next wife?

I must reach the ideal.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> For that purpose...I have things I ought to discard...<br> and feelings I ought to kill off...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I had to point at one fatal fallacy to the current<br> version of my blueprint,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> it would certainly be its pitiful resilience.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been dissatisfied at how one as competent as<br> myself was forced to disengage and retreat over<br> numerical disadvantages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And what I used to clear up this accumulated<br> dissatisfaction...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> was a trump card that sacrificed handling to display<br> my competency through extra power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And that went beyond expectations.<br> It went beyond my estimated margin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Unable to withstand the inflexibility of the mold I<br> established for it, its contents are\u2014overflowing as<br> they will.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Haha...

Neutrality? Who cares?</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Look at this power. Look at this all-consuming power.</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> Since I&#39;m the most superior being in existence and it&#39;s<br> all but guaranteed that I&#39;ll become the next lord of this<br> world,</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> and if that&#39;s the one fastest road to the ideal,</p><p><strong>Makiri:</strong><br> what could possibly be wrong with me consuming<br> everything in the old world\u2014?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Only one end awaits models not built for resilience.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They break.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Reviewing the operation one last time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;re following a simple formula, but we have to go<br> over it one more time from the top to make sure<br> everything is in order.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Completely agreed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do your thing, boss.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The enemy, Caster&#39;s Supersized Worm Fiend,<br> is heading south as predicted. Marching at 97% the<br> calculated pace.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We must thank the unfortunate AIs who fell victim to it,<br> unable to escape despite making optimal decisions,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and the work of the Defend AIs killed in action.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> True. Now is not the time to be gloomy about it.<br> We need to do our best to avoid greater casualties.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Our final objective is eliminating Caster and the<br> Supersized Worm Fiend he&#39;s merged with.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Dealing with the medium and small worm fiends<br> present around it is also a necessity,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but it&#39;s predicted they&#39;ll vanish if their controller,<br> Caster, is defeated. We don&#39;t need to crush all of<br> them.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What&#39;s important is to clean up the fodder in front of<br> the Supersized Worm Fiend and halt its march.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Since the creature detects AIs with Raniment,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it&#39;s natural to assume it also detects Servants,<br> which hold higher concentrations of Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In short, we&#39;ll eliminate the surrounding worm fiends,<br> attracting the Supersized&#39;s attention,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> and attack the main body whenever possible to<br> whittle it down\u2014That&#39;s our part.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Naaah, I&#39;ll pass. Sweeping small fry is no job for a<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No complaining!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (...But is he back in the mood? Not that he was<br> supposed to make strategic decisions for such spoiled<br> reasons though!)</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So the whole point here is...we&#39;re the decoy.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m the god of love.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m an awful pick for these meatheaded tasks like<br> blowing away the giant monster or physically wearing<br> it down with overwhelming destructive force.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do what I can even if I&#39;m not cut out for it,<br> but are you really sure we can leave the job to her?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> If I&#39;m the only option, that&#39;s how it has to be.<br> If anyone else is qualified, I can swap places.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone is.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Taking off a couple legs probably won&#39;t be enough to<br> stop that giant monster.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I think the only way to go is through its heart...<br> killing its core, which is presumably Caster. The big<br> problem is:</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know where in that huge body Caster is.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> True. We&#39;re searching for that specific point,<br> but we&#39;ve yet to have a clear answer.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Sakura... The prime Grow AI. She seems to have a<br> non-combative personality, much like Ayus.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (But I see she still has the capabilities of a Master...)</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> With Saber&#39;s full power, we can...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Oh. We can find where the damned Caster is?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> No. I can fillet the whole fish and petrify each piece.<br> If I keep doing that, I&#39;ll eventually get to the right part.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Oh, fine. A lot less technical than I expected.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> All right then, that sort of unappealing manual labor is<br> not for me. You can handle it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This talk about having to find him reminded me of one thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about the option of targeting his Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a possible solution, naturally. The idea is to sever<br> his root source of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But the fact that the monster is self-sustaining is a<br> serious obstacle to this approach.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The Master needs to stay at a safe distance from the<br> hubbub, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s within our reach.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The enemy is aware that eliminating the Master is an<br> option, so he should be doing everything he can to hide<br> himself.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We must consider it unrealistic to locate the Master<br> within our limited time frame.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Looking at him really upset me for some reason,<br> so I&#39;d ideally prefer to win by crushing that Master&#39;s<br> head.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> But if that&#39;s impossible, I suppose we have to deal<br> with the big guy.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> By the way...can you two stand side by side?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> (They feel similar... Yet different... Maybe opposites.<br> Eh, doesn&#39;t matter.)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> \u2014Don&#39;t mind me. Anyways, we have a plan.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be waiting somewhere easier for me to deal the<br> first strike.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll take the first step when I find the chance and<br> you follow up after me.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Wait, Saber...</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Sorry, people. I&#39;ll also be moving to my post. Bye.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah, wait. How are you feeling in the parts I healed<br> before?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;m curious since it was my first time healing a Master.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly fine, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong><br> Look how full of energy I am.<br> Heya!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Really?

Yeah, that was just some custom<br> fine-tuning.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s best for a girl with fatigued legs is different for<br> what&#39;s best for a girl with fatigued arms.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Since the taste would be middling anyways,<br> I thought the food could at least have that going for it.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (For all her constant lack of confidence, she actually<br> pays a lot of attention to her team.)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (Did she get these observation skills from her habit of<br> keeping a diary?)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s the dumb smile for?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nothing.

One more important question.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What were you doing? Where have you been?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, just popped out real quick to kill Caster&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Pardon?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Hold up, was that a joke or...?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No joke. I did it with my own hands. It was surprisingly<br> easy. Don&#39;t know what happened to Caster himself,<br> though.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> No way... No, you wouldn&#39;t lie about this. Then, really?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> In that case, uh, what was it...? Search rules\u2014</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What happens if a Master dies first in combat?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> By accessing the defeated Master&#39;s AI Core,</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> the winning Master can obtain their remaining<br> Command Spell, if available, and the leadership rights<br> to their partition\u2014</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Hey...did you perhaps, grab some kind of core?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hm? I won&#39;t mince words here.

It&#39;s the last thing I want.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hahaha! I know I&#39;m the one who suggested, but yeah,<br> your own food being what satisfied you would hurt my<br> pride real bad.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> All right, this was a great reference for the next recipe<br> I&#39;m about to develop!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> My table prep got rid of your misgivings, so next time<br> will be when I make something that reaches your heart!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (Misgivings.

Love hurts.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So\u2014what will you do about it?<br> Are you giving up on familial love?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No. I don&#39;t wanna.

It&#39;s almost like<br> a pillar, or a...Coffin...?)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Judging from the message we received from Rani XII,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it seems one of the mechanisms of the Holy Grail War<br> was for the world to rotate at some stage, thus altering<br> the partition structure.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably why we were thrown all the way to<br> the outer perimeter...I guess.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m not following at all. Some stage? Is this because of<br> Caster&#39;s death?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I believe so. The System Grail War incorporates an<br> element of the prime AIs competing for territory.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> If you manage to defeat another Servant and claim<br> victory, you will receive their authority, allowing you to<br> administrate multiple partitions...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, you would have multiple domains.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This may even be the primary reason why the newly<br> controlled region was even physically moved and<br> \u201Cmerged\u201D.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hmm, moving even the actual places of the world<br> seems a bit overblown, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well, when it comes to the domain of gods; mountains,<br> oceans, and the like do tend to be thrown around<br> pretty nonchalantly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s run the basic localization program we copied<br> from Ayus.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I see. The locations outside of the actual center have<br> definitely changed.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It appears that the whole world has rotated,<br> causing the positional relationships of the partitions to<br> become misaligned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it didn&#39;t just rotate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought their physical positions couldn&#39;t change...?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A valid question, but remember that this is a virtual<br> world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For example, just then, the thickness of each partition<br> may have been made conceptually close to zero.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At the end of the day, we just have to accept that<br> \u201Cthem&#39;s the rules\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The same goes for any Raniment and all the AI in the<br> various managerial areas of the world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The PAPERMOON was most definitely a compass<br> equipped with a rotating mechanism.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The fact that momentary rotation in the form of a<br> gyrocompass is needed for regulation...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s something that does make sense in this<br> world, but really makes you scratch your head in<br> relation to the macro world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I...see..?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now, the merging of two partitions carries two<br> implications:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> First is that the winner, the Rider faction, has simply<br> doubled the available area in which they can easily<br> procure Raniment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is an inevitability since the leadership roles of the<br> AI have changed as well.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The other implication is that no one can have outposts.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let me explain it the other way around.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> Had the Build sector been left to remain unmerged,<br> it would have been able to serve as an outpost for the<br> Rider party.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> If they had chosen to instead just make that their<br> home base, then the Transfer section would have<br> served as an outpost.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> In other words, it creates a situation where only one<br> of the two can be safeguarded, while the other one has<br> to be left on its own.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> The winner&#39;s prize cannot be a new set of<br> disadvantages.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> The rules say to merge the partitions themselves in<br> order to avoid this scenario.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> Doubling the available area will likewise increase the<br> work to protect it, but compared to the benefits,<br> this is nothing worth complaining about.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> More importantly, in the scenario that only two<br> surviving parties remain,</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> it avoids a situation where both of them are on<br> opposite sides of the map, unable to affect each other.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> This way, it&#39;s like they&#39;re forcing a scenario where<br> everyone&#39;s close to each other at all times.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASion:</strong><br> You could even say it&#39;s a necessary development to<br> actually promote continued battle in the Holy Grail War.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I hope the AIs are all okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> To the extent of my knowledge, the regular AI not<br> involved with the war should have remained unaffected<br> by the centrifugal momentum just now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> On the other hand, that means Ayus and Duryodhana<br> would have also been thrown elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Same for Rider and Saber&#39;s party.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m unable to spot either of them, so I would have to<br> assume a certain randomness in the distribution.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, as expected, they cannot seem to force a<br> separation between Master and Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess we should meet up with Ayus first.</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I agree, that would be for the best.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I consensually planted a tracer on her, like a<br> transmission-esque Code.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I thought it would help with finding her later.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, since we&#39;ll be moving along the outer<br> perimeter, chances are we&#39;ll run into someone else.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;ll need to stay on guard.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You know, the Rider party may have been real coy<br> about actually wanting to help...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But no way would I have expected them to sit on an<br> attack with such a stupid amount of firepower.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> So don&#39;t get caught off guard again, Master.<br> For all we know, something like that could be aimed<br> at us next time.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Well... Whatever happens, Master, I&#39;ll be there to save<br> you, alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks for trying to help earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> That upfront sort of gratitude is much appreciated.<br> You know I&#39;m always accepting compliments, right?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Even now would be a good time for more, don&#39;t you<br> think? Maybe even...some physical touch...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That was a ton of preparation for a single-use Greater<br> Spell. I doubt they could set it up again so easily...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But I agree we should stay on guard. Rider&#39;s Master...<br> that enigmatic guy, is long gone now.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (That said, it really felt like there was something that<br> only he was seeing. What could it have been...?)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (He gave off a vibe like his highest priority was to<br> search for the answers to something, rather than fight<br> in the war.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Regardless, we should keep our eyes peeled.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Whatever the answer he seeks,)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (we can&#39;t know if it will benefit or harm us\u2014)</p><h3 id="arrow-2-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-2-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 2</h3><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Who am I?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I can at least tell you my name: Lainur Gusion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a title you want, there are plenty.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> System Grail War participant.<br> Master of Rider. Prime AI of the Transfer sector...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Ah, my bad, my bad. That&#39;s not important right now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I got some sort of tremendous directive, something<br> unrelated to the duties and ideas programmed into my<br> AI.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I would go so far as to say most of my being is<br> dominated by it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It thrusts my body into action from the depths of my<br> being. It&#39;s a fever running rampant through my whole<br> body as this imitation of a heart beats.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If it conflicts with my original mission as an AI,<br> it might be fundamentally lost or I&#39;ll become<br> indecisive over it,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> but as it stands right now, the impetus to push<br> forward prevails.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It is, in simple terms, a wish. Or perhaps a craving.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps I have an innate familiarity for systematically<br> isolating parts of my existence? Whether that&#39;s out of<br> preference or not, I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But that&#39;s likely the reason why I have such an<br> overhead view of myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> A purely functional entity originally designed to have<br> one major directive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Because I am self-conscious about my own existence<br> as such a being, I&#39;m able to consciously apply this<br> craving to myself...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something like that, at least...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So what is this craving, this wish?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s most definitely the word which best describes me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u201CFuture\u201D.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then, the answer would have to be...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I am an \u201C\u2014\u201D, that which has been separated from<br> something, driven by the directive called the future...</p><p><strong>Lainur:</strong><br> Hey hey hey, c&#39;mon.

The most efficient means of<br> winning in war is to exploit weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The weak on the enemy side.<br> The weak on your own side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> When I think of it like that, the old fart isn&#39;t in the<br> wrong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014But it makes me sick to my stomach.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are different kinds of wisdom, and I cannot<br> stand the kind that&#39;s more wise and efficient than my<br> own.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> There are kinds which, even if the wisest of us would<br> come up with, we wouldn&#39;t do because it wouldn&#39;t be<br> the smart move.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And if someone then goes and flaunts that,<br> then it&#39;s nothing more than irreverence towards the<br> prince.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Then there&#39;s definitely good reason to punish that<br> person for it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Also, another thing...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It&#39;s pretty simple, I think.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I bring down the hammer on those who have done<br> vicious deeds here and now,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> then all those watching will feel relieved, wanting to<br> praise and admire me for it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d simply be a hero. Rising above the masses,<br> the most popular person around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That would be neat.

I&#39;m positive I saw her eat food as well<br> back then.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It would not have been a case of resource scarcity or<br> anything.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wait, you said \u201Cuntil some stage\u201D. Do you mean\u2014</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The first skirmish with Caster&#39;s familiars, wherein she<br> was wounded.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes, correct... Ever since you administered her<br> treatment.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ah! I knew the post-treatment effects were strange!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> She was seriously wounded back then.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I managed to completely treat the AI part of her,</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> but the recently implanted Master part was made up<br> of a bunch of unknown mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I had no choice but to do what I could, and then just<br> observe what impact that might have had...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Indeed. Most regrettably, it was these left-out parts<br> that posed an issue.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> After she performed a physical examination,<br> I forcibly questioned the performant R-type.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It appeared there was a fault with the internal system<br> which constituted the \u201Cpathway\u201D through which<br> Raniment flowed to her Servant.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> It was implied to have suffered damage.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> The explanation I received was the emergence of<br> numerous holes within the hose which connected<br> Sakura and myself.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As Raniment flowed through, a substantial amount<br> would be lost as it seeped out of these holes.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Thus, in order to amend the issue and return to normal<br> levels of Raniment supplying,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> she had no course available to her other than simply<br> letting an inordinate amount flow through to make up<br> for what was lost.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> This amount would have been taken from the pool<br> originally reserved for herself.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Were I not the fool, I would have realized sooner.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> As she proceeded to divert increasingly larger<br> amounts of Raniment to allow me to fight with all my<br> might,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I noticed she was staggering, barely able to walk.<br> That is when I sensed something was abnormal.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I told her taking care of herself was of utmost priority,<br> but conversely, she\u2014</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I remember. The second time the Supersized Worm<br> Fiend appeared, she used a Command Spell on you,<br> didn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Yes. Why did Sakura act the way she did? Why did<br> she use that Command Spell? These questions hold the<br> same answer.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> She had to protect this place to which she belonged.<br> That is what she relied on me for, and what she<br> entrusted me with. That is all\u2014</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you say anything...!? There were plenty of<br> opportunities!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I explicitly told the both of you to alert me if any<br> unexpected malfunction happened...!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I inquired about this fact myself, but ultimately,<br> it was Sakura&#39;s decision. She likely had several<br> reasons.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Something the R-type who examined her noted; so<br> fundamental that perhaps not even the prime herself<br> could have diagnosed it.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Sakura herself would have felt this way too.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> That&#39;s not... If you&#39;d just let me examine her again,<br> I could...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> Perhaps she felt inclined not to be any more in debt<br> to one who was for all intents and purposes her enemy.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> And...Sakura had laughingly said:</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> \u201CNo matter how defective I become,</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t want to replace my duty to protect this<br> place for the sake of my own appearance.\u201C</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong><br> \u201CI want to do as much as possible by myself.<br> \u2014Even if it&#39;s just some unintentional result of my<br> ego.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> \u201CProtect my home,\u201D she had ordered with the<br> Command Spell.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> That same Command Spell remains effective yet.<br> At the very least, it would appear so.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> I shall protect this partition, and doing so is analogous<br> to protecting Sakura herself.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> Thus, I shall protect her at all costs.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> Even should it entail sacrificing the AIs outside of<br> Grow.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> Were I to utilize the magical beasts born of this sword,</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> to retrieve an amount of Raniment so extensive it<br> surpasses the amount consumed, and deliver it to<br> Sakura all at once, then...she will most assuredly<br> awaken.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMedusa:</strong><br> There is no other way!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I know how you must feel right now, but...<br> But\u2014</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No. I agree, this is the way.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;s a thought that&#39;s crossed my mind before.<br> At the end of the day, I can only really understand my<br> own desires.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> And yet we still think about everyone else. What&#39;s<br> even the point of giving in to them?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Even if you have a good reason, and resign yourself in<br> the most intelligent way possible...wouldn&#39;t you feel<br> regretful about your own desires?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s okay for you to act the way you<br> want.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Do whatever you want. Take whatever you want.<br> That&#39;s just the natural way of things.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> However\u2014</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that it&#39;ll conflict with the<br> wants of others.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Whose desires will win out in the end will depend on a<br> bunch of things. Social status, strength, economic clout,<br> and so on.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Since yours truly is an elite possessing all the above,<br> I naturally get whatever I want.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> And this time won&#39;t be any different. What I want is to<br> win the Holy Grail War, and to have it all.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> That is to say, all these other AIs are my future<br> property. I won&#39;t have anyone else lay their filthy paws<br> on them!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> It&#39;s so self-centered it passes over into honourable.<br> Desires are a slippery slope to lapse. I have to praise<br> it, hehe.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Being who I am, I will resort to logic rather than<br> sentiment.

Full marks.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It is an application of the PAPERMOON&#39;s ability and<br> property to \u201Creproduce everything as it were\u201D.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> A trial run to artificially produce \u201Ca certain something\u201D.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> All of you, Masters and Servants alike, are a result of<br> this experiment; this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The materialization process differs, but the end result<br> remains the same.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> We are the test subjects?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Indeed. All you Masters and Servants gathered here...<br> Not a single one of you are natural occurrences.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You are manufactured. Generated.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The degree to which you are conscious of this fact<br> differs on an individual basis. There was also some<br> discrepancies in the degree.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Nevertheless, those with a special objective<br> perspective would have sensed it within themselves.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Or perhaps, they were taught this fact through the<br> views of others.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Different personalities. Different principles.<br> Different preferences.

All of you are, without a doubt\u2014</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Artificial Alter Egos, expressed as such by the<br> PAPERMOON.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible... As its operator, I can say with<br> certainty the PAPERMOON possesses no such function.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s the problem I told you I&#39;m fixing, self-<br> proclaimed administrator.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The key is rotation. Namely, the centrifugal force<br> generated by it.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This world is rotated by the power of the systems of<br> this Holy Grail War, and the conceptual centrifugal<br> force generated by it,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> separating the elements of the soul before enforcing a<br> reproduction based on them. That is the basic theory<br> behind this operation.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Tch...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Centrifugal separation of the soul...!?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Your face tells me you do not comprehend it,<br> yet recognize the possibility. Very well.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I named it the AEC Method: Alter Ego Centrifuge.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Waitwaitwait!</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> She&#39;s throwing so many things at us from all<br> directions. How can we know any of it&#39;s true?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Not like she has any proof. What&#39;s the likelihood of<br> this woman telling us the real deal?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There exists circumstantial evidence.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> When we woke up after being launched by the<br> rotation, we were in shock absorbers installed in the<br> outer perimeter...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Did they not give a feeling of d\xE9j\xE0 vu?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Most likely, they&#39;re Coffins. Or at least, something<br> which resembles it in functionality.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A vessel to prevent the soul, and the Spiritrons,<br> from escaping. A cradle for ensuring a separated<br> personality...!</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Incidentally, the rotation which occurs at the time of a<br> Servant&#39;s dispersal is merely a preemptive operation<br> \u2014preparatory work, if you will.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Do not fret, no separation of personality has occurred<br> yet. The real performance only begins at the conclusion<br> of this ritual.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hol&#39; up for a second, I don&#39;t get what this means.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Suppose that we are Alter Egos, and suppose this<br> Holy Grail War is a means of producing them...</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> What&#39;s the point?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That is a matter of course.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> To avoid the end of the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I suppose I have to explain from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> At some point, a Holy Grail manifested within the<br> micro-territory within PAPERMOON. In response to this<br> event, my existence was anchored.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Just as I thought... It wasn&#39;t just a name, there was<br> an actual grail involved...)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (If the concept of a grail, with its infinite framework<br> and power, came to be involved in a minimal,<br> virtual world such as this...)</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Utilizing the power of the Holy Grail, I thus calculated<br> that the world would come to an end, which leads us<br> to this very point.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Just what world are you talking about...?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Naturally, I speak of the bleached Earth; the world<br> which you of Chaldea are attempting to save.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I understand well that you are heading to confront<br> your final decisive battle.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That is the foremost issue, and the cause of this<br> destruction we face. Simply put, your strength is<br> insufficient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re wrong...!</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I am most correct. The Servants with which you have<br> made a bond of fate. The surviving staff of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Quantifying the number and faculties of all these I<br> have calculated and concluded thusly. I, in my brilliance,<br> do not make mistakes.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There are many willing to lend their power...!</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That may be, but the calculation determined them as<br> insufficient.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I don&#39;t deny you have your allies. It is a hard question<br> of whether the number of you exceeds that which is<br> required.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In this decisive battle, there&#39;s no difference between<br> an insufficient number and zero. Your number is<br> insignificant.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Therefore, in order to reinforce your military strength,<br> I turned my attention to the Alter Ego class.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, what even is an Alter Ego...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It is one of the extra classes allotted to Servants.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> An alteration of the state of a Heroic Spirit,<br> differing from the those designated as \u201CAlter\u201D,<br> whose abilities and thoughts have been modified.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In contrast, they are a \u201Cseparate personality\u201D of a<br> given Heroic Spirit, isolated to become a separate<br> Servant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Using computer programs as an analogy, Alters are<br> like different versions of the same program.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But Alter Egos are more like taking the original<br> program and reusing its systems to create a distinct<br> product.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because of its nature of having been \u201Cseparated\u201D,<br> they often become High Servants due to the remaining<br> void within them are often filled by beings of sufficient<br> weight, like Divine Spirit Servants.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But this High Servant composition is not a hard<br> requirement.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> As long as a separate personality makes up the prime<br> entity, it could be considered of the Alter Ego class.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It seems you have already fallen into the habit of<br> taking them at face value,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> but I consider them a most curious class.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The conditions for compatibility were far too broad.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It was too dependent on mindset; on formless<br> interiority.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> And so, I started to consider...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If any given facet derived from a personality could be<br> made into the prime aspect, and be eligible for the Alter<br> Ego class,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> would it not then be possible to create two individual<br> Alter Egos from the same fundamental entity?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I understand well that the mental activities and<br> personalities of living organisms differ.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Because of this, a single person\u2014a single Heroic<br> Spirit\u2014should exist as a collection of innumerable<br> overlapping personalities and goals.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> On the other hand, an Alter Ego can be independently<br> materialized just by virtue of being an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Looking over data stolen from Chaldea, there is<br> nothing to indicate an Alter Ego is inferior in terms of<br> combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In that case...if a Servant exists,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> then instead of utilizing it as a single unit, its<br> personality can be artificially separated.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Producing multiple Alter Ego Servants from it should<br> be much more effective in terms of generating military<br> power, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s absurd...!</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Not absurd. It is possible, of great value, and the right<br> solution.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As such, I decided to implement it.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That is exactly what is being carried out here with the<br> System Grail War, or AI Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The Alterego Increase Holy Grail War.

Bold choice of words for someone who<br> attacked Saber and Rider&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> It was simply the divine duty assigned to me.<br> This goddess exists to fulfill divine duties.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Rider&#39;s Master had the potential to prove himself an<br> obstacle to management due to his analysis, contact,<br> and intervention with the core pillars of the system.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Saber acted upon visible intention to harm the<br> Overseer, who is my Master.</p><p><strong>Durga:</strong><br> Both were valid extermination targets.<br> Therefore, I eliminated them.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if I believe you being only the guardian of<br> the Holy Grail War and the Overseer&#39;s weapon.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You&#39;re more fundamental to the Holy Grail War in my<br> opinion, Durga.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Otherwise, why would you bother hiding under an AI&#39;s<br> skin?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> A special X among the D-types.

This is a fact.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Allow me to explain. I&#39;d love for you to understand<br> how I manage this beautiful system.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Durga possesses a supervolumous conceptual hole.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Presumably meant as a place of storage to safely<br> utilize the powers she received from numerous gods.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I used the power of the Holy Grail to summon the first<br> five Servants and stored their still unawakened Saint<br> Graphs inside Durga&#39;s pit.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> (Does she mean...the originals of the Servants<br> participating in the AI Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Then I used the remaining power for the first rotation,<br> generating five Alter Ego Servants.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...Oh, those beings akin to Heroic Spirit shadows<br> spawning in this world are personality-less dregs<br> generated by the impact.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You can consider them fragments of Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Being Heroic Spirit fragments, they had some<br> modicum of power, so they attached themselves to the<br> system&#39;s regular bugs, becoming special enemies.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> But the purpose of this Holy Grail War is for Servants<br> to fight one another,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> so the energy generated by their dismissal can be<br> absorbed into Durga&#39;s pit, which is further connected<br> to PAPERMOON&#39;s world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I estimate that this energy will suffice...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...to rotate PAPERMOON&#39;s world to spawn Alter Egos<br> for two more cycles.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Meaning, this is what will happen when the Holy Grail<br> War is over:</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Having obtained the power of four dismissed Servants,<br> Durga will use it to spin the world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Doing so, the five Servants stored in her pit will<br> generate new Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> These five Alter Ego Servants are collected.<br> They will be our forces to avoid the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Next, we perform the second rotation.

We need as many forces as possible to<br> stave off the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I just wanted...a family.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If you win, you&#39;re free to set the next Holy Grail War<br> parameters to give you one.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No. I wanted to live peacefully with my family,<br> with no wars happening anywhere!</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to worry about it.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Once you obtain general supervisor status, to avoid<br> doom will become your first priority, in other words,<br> to continue the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that mean...I&#39;ll stop valuing the wish I<br> already have...?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> It&#39;s pointless. None of this matters...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let it bother you. Ultimately\u2014</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You said...\u201CAlter Ego Master\u201D.<br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The system that gives you AIs your personalities is the<br> randomizer. An RNG device.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It is, in reality, transforming you into random Alter<br> Egos.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> What...?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The infinite Alter Ego production project requires<br> Masters.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Having an infinite force of Alter Egos meant nothing if<br> held back by the possibility that Chaldea&#39;s Master<br> couldn&#39;t handle all of them alone.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Therefore, I considered it necessary to produce<br> Masters as well.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> And what kind of Master is the most appropriate to<br> manage Alter Egos?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Seeking for answers, I prepared both Masters and<br> Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That was the most efficient way of arranging a good<br> enough variety of personality patterns.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> For more diverse results, I selected each of their<br> models from different roots.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Caster&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was a created type.<br> AI: Alterego Invented.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> He was an attempt to produce a competitive<br> personally as close to created from zero as possible.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That said, his name and appearance were recycled<br> from a random model found by peeking into Chaldea&#39;s<br> data.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> He was prideful, overconfident, and compensated for<br> his lack of empathy with mage-like logic and<br> calculations.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I made his personality expecting him to be the driving<br> actor actively advancing the war.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I needed to give him a support patch and some<br> fine-tuning partway through, but he did his part with<br> passing grades.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Rider&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was an acquired type.<br> AI: Alterego Imported.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I read the substances of a real human being who once<br> touched PAPERMOON,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and separated an Alter Ego from them.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> He was the Master with the greatest ability to<br> understand and respond to the system, and that led<br> him to deviate from his programming. Such a waste.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I conjecture that his affinity for the Alter Ego<br> conversion stems from him naturally having multiple<br> personalities, or something akin to it.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Saber&#39;s Master&#39;s personality was a forged type.<br> AI: Alterego Imitated.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I first selected the appearance of an existing human,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and counterfeited the expected mind this human was<br> likely to have.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The pool of human models I had contact with is very<br> limited in options.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> But you can tell who she was just by looking.<br> The answer is: The girl being used as Durga&#39;s vessel.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You can figure out the rest from here.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The Masters had diverse personalities,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and the one of them who won the AI Holy Grail War<br> would be selected the Master most apt to managing<br> Alter Egos, accruing EXP.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> They would then become the next Overseer and<br> repeat my actions in the next Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Thus continuously upgrading us into a Master better<br> suited to managing Alter Egos... That was my line of<br> thought.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> In summary\u2014The wishes held by AI Masters are<br> a marker of their Alter Ego status.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You produced your wish because you are an Alter Ego.<br> It&#39;s not originated from your AI self.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You&#39;re merely borrowing it from someone.<br> Thus, I believe you have no need to attach much value<br> to it.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> No... That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Screw this. Then what&#39;s all my guilt supposed to<br> mean?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Why do I have to be like this for such a dumb reason...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> \u2014Oookay!

I beat everyone, and then what?<br> I just become a soldier?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> \u2014No chance!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> This is not the ending I fought for!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> I will obtain everything and live an amusing life!<br> That&#39;s what I fought for!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> I care about nothing else!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Berserker...?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, and you should be thinking the same thing.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> \u201CWhat about my wish!? I don&#39;t care about anything<br> else!\u201D</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> That&#39;s the correct attitude to have here! And if you&#39;re<br> denied it, you gotta lash out.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Then I ask you, Duryodhana&#39;s Master:</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Do you still have a wish in you? Something you want<br> to see accomplished no matter what?</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> \u2014Yes!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Then you need to think of nothing other than attaining<br> it for yourself!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> If playing the Holy Grail War the right way won&#39;t do it,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> then there&#39;s one way to grant your wish!<br> Let us defeat them and hijack the system!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Put a stop to this ridiculous Holy Grail War of Alter<br> Ego nonsense.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Steal their jurisdictions later or whatever it takes.<br> Full speed ahead to where your dreams come true!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (\u2014Hah.)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (Yeah, right. That&#39;s the Duryodhana I know.<br> The grade-A dumbass who only sees what he wants.)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> (But... There&#39;re things that can only be accomplished<br> with that stupidity, I guess.)</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The winning Master becomes the general supervisor<br> AI.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then what would happen if Fujimaru won?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You were not part of my calculations.

I calculated what&#39;s written in the stars.<br> This demise is without question.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I am this world&#39;s Pneuma.

You&#39;re also up for the fight?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I&#39;m still a Master, even if not in the traditional way.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Durga is not a participant in the Holy Grail War,<br> and due to her being so far above your standard,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> using her to kill your Alter Ego Servants is almost a net<br> negative in energy gain.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As such, I would much rather avoid this, but no sane<br> person can disregard justified self-defense.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I calculate I&#39;ll remain with barely enough reserves left<br> to restart the next System Grail War,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> and to create the next batch of Alter Ego participants.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I, in my functions of Overseer, will eliminate the<br> defects trying to prevent the execution of the Holy Grail<br> War and attempt a reset.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hah.

All I thought back then<br> was, \u201CSure, why not?\u201D</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Before I knew it, I found myself accepting the idea<br> that I could love her.

What is it right now?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Tell me what&#39;s in you this instant, regardless of your<br> previous wish.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Even then...

This could get a smile out of me.

That dickhead is tenacious as hell in<br> his own special way...no exaggeration.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Even without him, divine Kama can&#39;t carry this alone.<br> I gotta get back right... (Cough)</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Say, Master. You got anything to eat?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What? No, you shouldn&#39;t need food.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I made sure to give you Raniment to fix you up,<br> so just wait a minute for it to\u2014</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nah, forget that. Getting hungry is a major crisis for<br> me. Eating should help my recovery. Maybe.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Is it a mood thing?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> More a motivation thing.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...If you insist. Take this.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ooh...a sandwich. This wasn&#39;t one&#39;a mine, was it?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t suppose this is your handiwork...?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> How bad is it? I was watching you make your own,<br> so I killed some time...whipped something together...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Not bad. I couldn&#39;t ask for more from my Master&#39;s<br> home cooking.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Awright. I&#39;ll eat my fill\u2014</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? If you don&#39;t want it, just throw it away.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> No, I was wondering if you&#39;d tailored the taste.<br> You did that before for the AIs.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> With your memory and powers of observation,<br> you carefully customize the taste parameters for each<br> person to make the most subtle buffs... It must be your<br> specialty.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I only did all that because I remembered it somehow.<br> It&#39;s nothing to do with specialties.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Besides, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d need that kind of fine<br> tuning. Makes no sense.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Even I have to see that. There&#39;s nothing about you<br> that&#39;s normal for a Servant.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You&#39;re one of the greater heroes who could beat most<br> Servants if you were to fight seriously.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how much greater a hero I might be.<br> I just don&#39;t wanna lose to anybody.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If there&#39;s anyone with a good chance, that&#39;d be the<br> middle of us five brothers.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Why would I, of all people, end up as your Master?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> If it weren&#39;t for me, you&#39;d probably have an easier<br> time fighting.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You probably wouldn&#39;t have ended up beaten, bruised,<br> covered with wounds like this.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> To be honest...you should give up on me already.<br> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better option. So why fight?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I told you before why I&#39;m fighting.<br> Because I want to make you smile.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> And the reason I want to make you smile is because<br> you&#39;re my Master.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You were asking how it was that you became my<br> Master?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I got no clue.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But that don&#39;t bother me none. I&#39;m here because I<br> want to serve you.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That all fits in like the other stuff. It&#39;s just how things<br> turned out, and it&#39;s just how that works for me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> You call that a reason?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Such a troublesome, gloomy woman wracked with<br> guilt... Anyone normal would quit.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Hm? Well, I guess there&#39;s one thing.<br> The answer could be that simple.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...(Munch) Mm, delicious.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You recall the story of the rakshasa&#39;s sister I had a kid<br> with after one thing led to another, right?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind women who are a handful. That&#39;s just<br> how it is.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Haha.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Don&#39;t lump me in with a woman who eats people,<br> you jerk.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Now then, I&#39;ve had my feast and it&#39;s time I made a<br> move. Thanks to you, my injuries are mostly healed!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (That&#39;s a lie.)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> (But...it&#39;s not like I can stop you.)</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Huh.

Upon analyzing their data, I cannot<br> disagree with that.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I could observe a considerable output from the Saber<br> Alter Ego of Avoidance,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> but I must admit the presence of those two ruined the<br> overall balance of the total forces.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> But I wasn&#39;t able to calculate that. This answer was<br> beyond my reach. Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Because\u2014your calculations didn&#39;t account for<br> the most important parameter:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Their emotions.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Structural defects.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Heroic Spirits are humans, and humans operate<br> through multiple personas regulating their emotions,<br> egos, and senses of purpose.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In summary, we are complex beings composed by<br> numerous overlapping Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You can&#39;t be considered human otherwise.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But you&#39;re an AI. A mechanical being operating under<br> a single command.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> And that&#39;s why you failed to understand it.<br> That&#39;s what lead you to the mistaken assumption that<br> one ego was enough for us...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I see. I cannot deny that. But it raises a further<br> question.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Why does the Alter Ego Class exist?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> What sets a functional Alter Ego apart from a<br> dysfunctional Alter Ego?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s another answer you can approach by looking<br> at the scene before you now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I believe this comment also applied to me.<br> I must watch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So I gazed in the same direction as the AI girl next to<br> me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> AIs are made to fulfill a role. They carry a singular<br> directive that&#39;s precious to them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In that way, they&#39;re no different from Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Beings created with a singular emotion have meanings,<br> values, and capabilities...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But looking at it from another angle, they also have<br> sorrow, sin, and repulsiveness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> With all said and done\u2014was I able to figure it out?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The meaning in Alter Egos existing?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I need to confront the issue.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Ah. My bad.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I lost track of stuff in the heat of the fight, but I gotta<br> ask the big question before it&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...Did your wish come true?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Who knows? My wish for amendment was<br> totally self-important to begin with.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> But maybe...it wasn&#39;t pointless.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Now that the war is done with, we can have some<br> days of peace again.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> She won&#39;t be there to see, and I most likely won&#39;t be<br> directly involved either...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> but I believe I managed to stay true to the directive she<br> wished for down to the very end.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. You were fighting for someone else&#39;s<br> wish.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Even if that was a pessimist&#39;s attempt to make<br> amends, facts are facts. Be proud of what you<br> accomplished.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Yeah... I think that if you found the answer you were<br> looking for,</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> then victory didn&#39;t even need to be on the menu.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Heheh...hahaha, haaahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> W-what the hell?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It only now hit me.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;ve won numerous battles before gettin&#39; here.<br> I just kept winning nonstop. And now I&#39;m satisfied<br> with a defeat!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> There was that one time that Hanuman put me in my<br> place, but this isn&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s the first time I lose in a good ol&#39; slugfest.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Against him of all people! That sure is a new one!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Okay, now it all makes sense.<br> That&#39;s one of the reasons why I lost.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> In no right world would a fight end with the guy who<br> wouldn&#39;t mind a loss winnin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Especially when the opponent is as freakin&#39; motivated<br> as he was.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Though while I don&#39;t regret the loss...I can&#39;t say the<br> same for all the rest.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Unlike you, Master, the parts I can&#39;t be proud<br> of\u2014weigh on me.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Sorry I never managed to cook anything you liked.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> No...</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s completely wrong.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I always loved your cooking. How the hell couldn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I was the problem.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> It was all me thinking I didn&#39;t deserve to eat food that<br> made me happy...!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sorry, Lancer.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;ve always been a source of regret to you.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Sorry I could never properly thank you for a good<br> meal. Sorry I never let you be a hero.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> If I was normal, you could have been fighting and<br> winning instead of being so focused on cooking...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Nah, I don&#39;t feel that. I&#39;m glad things were how they<br> were.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s best that I spent all my time cookin&#39; for you<br> and only fought right at the end.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If I had all of me and was my perfect warrior self...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I prolly wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive myself for getting<br> my ass kicked at the clutches of victory.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I&#39;d be whinin&#39; like a little baby right now.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I mean, even my current self is still pretty pissed that<br> it was him that did me in.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> It was pathetic. I&#39;d die of embarrassment if any<br> brother of mine made fun of me for what happened.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> But back to the point...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> My satisfaction right now comes from this version of<br> me being more than just a warrior.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Maybe you being like this was for the best, too.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> The version of you who was prisoner to an unknown<br> guilt and decided to fight to make amends.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> You&#39;re fine like this.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if what I&#39;m saying means anything to you,<br> but...</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> I hope you manage to get the atonement that&#39;s at your<br> core.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. I hope I do... Do you think I can manage?</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Already taught you how to. Just live the way you want<br> to.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Listen. Unforgettable pain can be hard to deal with,<br> but it can also be a driving force.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> We brothers never forgot how humiliated we were,<br> and that&#39;s how we managed to survive both the long<br> exile and the war.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you say you can&#39;t forget your guilt no matter what,<br> then\u2014</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That&#39;s a driving force you can convert into motivation<br> any time you want.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> That sure is a better way to handle it than how you<br> were doing, letting it crush you to the point you couldn&#39;t<br> do anything for long periods of time.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t forget either way, just make it into your<br> strength. That way you got never-ending fuel to move<br> you forward.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> When things get difficult, painful, suffocating\u2014<br> you&#39;ve got what can move you to a better place.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah... You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> I&#39;ll keep walking\u2014taking this guilt with me as an<br> unforgettable motive.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That will take me where I want to go.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Time&#39;s up. Bye, Master.</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> If we ever meet again, I&#39;ll cook you some even better<br> stuff that&#39;s guaranteed to pull a smile out of you!</p><p><strong>Bhima:</strong><br> Look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> ...Okay.

Are you satisfied?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> Just barely...I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> My brothers, my husband, my father-in-law.<br> All of you died without my knowing it.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> Maybe I hated you men for going to war and leaving<br> me alone without a care.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> So this has at least been better than that.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> This time around...it looks like we managed to be<br> together for our last moments.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> At least let me attend you at your end.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> No, wait. The hell are you even sayin&#39;? I&#39;m still in<br> fighting shape here.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you the answer about my being satisfied:<br> Not in the least. Isn&#39;t it obvious?</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> \u2014Not at all? Not one little bit?</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well...I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a lie if I said didn&#39;t attain some part of what I<br> was searching for.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Much like you, my answer is also \u201Cjust barely\u201D.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So you see. What I was searching for and what I<br> wanted was \u201Ceverything\u201D.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Obviously...there&#39;d be a long-lost little sister counted<br> in that.</p><p><strong>J\uFF1AAyus:</strong><br> Hehe... Well, thanks.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hngh.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Plus it wasn&#39;t even &#39;til I actually figured it out that I<br> realized what missing part was making me uneasy.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Nothing I can do about that with the sheer number of<br> siblings.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So don&#39;t go wandering off on your own, my silly little<br> sister. Grab hold of some cuff of your brother&#39;s clothes<br> so you won&#39;t disappear.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Hold on, don&#39;t actually do that with mine. It&#39;ll annoy<br> me, so do it with Duhshasana.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to. He would be just as annoyed and<br> angry about it.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Well, try one of the other brothers. Anyone&#39;ll do.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I used to have a lot on my plate back in the day.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Way too many little brothers to handle. I had to get<br> everyone trained, go out looking for allies,</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> and I had to be the figurehead for a whole war.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Now here I am, more than the sum of what I used to<br> be. A being who freely goes after all the things I want.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If I&#39;d been asked that, I&#39;d have had an answer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was probably\u2014the Alter Ego of Avarice.<br> Probably something along those lines.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Single-mindedly pursuing what I wanted was pleasant,<br> but in exchange, I could never have enough.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be satisfied with this.<br> Just my sister won&#39;t cut it!</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> (Sigh) You&#39;re the worst.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> But...I do see that. That&#39;s the kind of person you are.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Ahh...I&#39;m tired. Even I have to bow before sleepiness.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Friggin&#39; frustrating. I still want more things before I<br> have to sleep.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;m the picture of avarice. Which brings me to...<br> Hey, c&#39;mere.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Yeah, you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> We&#39;re still part of an alliance. That means you&#39;re<br> under my command.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> So get out there and claim everything in my name.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go lookin&#39; all shocked on me. I dunno what it&#39;s<br> about...but you&#39;re going back into a battle to save the<br> world, aren&#39;t ya?</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> If your battle is gonna make the world safe,<br> isn&#39;t that the same as makin&#39; the world yours?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about that...</p><hr><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Why wouldn&#39;t it be? That&#39;s why I&#39;m making you my<br> proxy. In other words, you&#39;re gonna make the world<br> mine in my stead.</p><p><strong>K\uFF1ADuryodhana:</strong><br> Heheh, good. Now I can get a quick sleep without any<br> anxiety.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Ugh, I&#39;m sorry. Please don&#39;t pay him a second thought.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I consider it a Duryodhana-style pep talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I guess...you could? I&#39;d judge it differently but, well,<br> if you want to take it in a positive light...</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> As long as I have time, allow me to say my piece.<br> I&#39;m nearly done for after the stunt I pulled before.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Thank you for helping me all this way.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> I&#39;m so glad you were the first Master we met.<br> Someone who&#39;d come to the rescue of the Repair girls.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Your kindness will surely save us all someday.</p><p><strong>Ayus:</strong><br> Take care of your health, and good luck!</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Yep...here comes the last will. I had to impart it to<br> Ashwatthama the same way back in life.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You gotta leave it to others if you wanna rest in peace.<br> No question, that&#39;s the best course for a smart guy like<br> yours truly.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> So I&#39;m gonna tell it to you straight.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> You&#39;re the next commander-in-chief.</p><p><strong>Duryodhana:</strong><br> Don&#39;t forget, you hear me?<br> Make the world\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Those two\u2013no, not just them. All the Servants in<br> this world must have gained something...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> ...on account of being Alter Egos, and were able to<br> arrive at an answer they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> There&#39;s no denying that innate meaning.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> An Alter Ego is, generally speaking,<br> a \u201Csimplified being\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s why they can often proceed in directions and<br> possibilities that \u201Cnormal personalities\u201D hardly ever<br> would...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Does that mean the issue lies in how they were<br> refined?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. The opposite is more worthy of attention.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The refinement process\u2014it&#39;s not that you gave<br> them life through a faulty method, but they already had<br> life before the method became a factor.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The question you need to consider is not \u201Chow to<br> refine someone into a new, simpler life\u201D,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but \u201Cwhy did pre-existing life refine itself into<br> something simpler\u201D.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s because they have performed the refinement that<br> the Alter Ego is produced. That&#39;s how I see it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Unlike normal beings, they are a single emotion<br> extracted from inside an individual&#39;s ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This emotion can often overflow or grow too strong,<br> which results in what happened here\u2013</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That&#39;s what makes them beings that \u201Cbear new<br> possibilities\u201D, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Then you mean that what matters for an Alter Ego is<br> the directive that has overflown out of them naturally?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if the overflow is not natural, I don&#39;t mean to say<br> that it would never manifest as something that<br> happens to bear power.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In this world, those who approached such possibilities<br> ought to hold out until the very end.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Furthermore, not everyone has personality fragments<br> intense enough to naturally form another individual<br> single-handedly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The parts of a person can only go so far unsupported...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I think that must be why the class somehow binds<br> multiple divinities together so often.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Even if you forcibly differentiated the form alone,<br> the probability that it will become powerful would be<br> low.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Then, my methodology may truly have been much<br> like\u2013</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Trying to illuminate all of the night sky by launching<br> many paper moons into the cosmos\u2013</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> A distorted formula that led only to empty answers<br> blinded by numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Numbers, and distortions...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (That&#39;s right. I need to address that question of hers.)</p><hr><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> If there are distortions, they are within all of you<br> already.</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> You have already employed several Alter Egos.<br> You believe them fine to be handled as battle assets.</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> What reason is there why one is good but a hundred<br> unacceptable? To tolerate ten but denounce a<br> thousand?</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> If you have no answer, then there you have your<br> distortion. It&#39;s the same even with a single Alter Ego<br> unit.</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> You people are accepting, without any reason...</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> ...the distortions within the nature of Alter Egos<br> themselves.</p><p><strong>Dust\xA0of\xA0Osiris:</strong><br> The human race has a bad habit of covering for their<br> lack of calculations with sentiment, contradicting all<br> rationality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like you said, I think utilizing Alter Egos\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> is a matter of distortion, whatever the numbers.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But I want to believe that it isn&#39;t a mistake.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Why...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re all people who essentially</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> accepted themselves as Alter Egos.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As long as that remains true, they might be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...You do have trust in the Alter Egos of Chaldea,<br> don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That naturalness proves its correctness, then.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> \u201CReason\u201D is the key. Even if you haven&#39;t found it<br> yourself, each already had a reason inside them.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I understand. It seems distorted at first glance,<br> but it&#39;s merely an accumulation of honesty\u2013</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> A possibility such as that may well exist.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Even if it was something like a miracle... It&#39;s<br> astronomical, and by nature should never happen.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Yes. Being unaware of this is probably the biggest<br> source of my miscalculations.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Emotions. Humans. Alter Egos. The state of a vessel<br> with a will. The state of power with personality.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I should have studied these more deeply, now that<br> they appear so distant from this paper moon.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> The final stage of processing has been reached.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I, the conversational interface, and Dust of Osiris,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> who was the main body for the AI Holy Grail War<br> system will soon disappear.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It will be a fundamental reboot, as expected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So there&#39;s no room for irregular existences to remain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What will happen to this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This is the world within PAPERMOON, which has<br> conceptually taken form due to the Holy Grail&#39;s power<br> generated in this micro-realm.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Once you retrieve the Holy Grail, you will lose the<br> means to observe this world.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> All that will be visible from the outside is the<br> PAPERMOON device operating as normal.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Then...what would be visible from the inside?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This is just a thought experiment of mine, but perhaps<br> the \u201Cusual world here\u201D may yet continue on.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> I see. If so\u2014I have one favor to ask.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sure. You can have it. I already pieced together what<br> you&#39;re going to ask.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The original premise was that the Holy Grail War&#39;s<br> winner would become the world&#39;s general supervisor AI.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> At which point, the original you...the personality of<br> Rani XII would be integrated and cease to exist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> For you, the closing of the AI Holy Grail War led to the<br> beginning of the next, as well as a decisive death...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Small details are no great concern. So long as the<br> functions are passed along, there is no problem.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It may only be a formality, Cerejeira,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> but let&#39;s set you up for the vacant general supervisor<br> AI position.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> So then...I guess I&#39;ll manage things like normal.<br> From somewhere no one can see it.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. If everything, especially Grow, keeps on moving<br> like normal...I wonder if she&#39;ll rest a bit easier?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Incidentally, Cerejeira, what type of Alter Ego AI did<br> you happen to have?</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Hers was also as experimental a case as the Master of<br> Berserker was.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It&#39;s a form that was installed hastily and decided on<br> according to the situation. She is\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Ungh. Now why didn&#39;t I put that together myself?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> No. While even I was made into an Alter Ego,<br> I didn&#39;t account for anything like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, so that&#39;s what it was...</p><hr><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t feel real at all. Okay, it kinda does...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> This should bring to a close everything I needed to say.<br> The time is near.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> One moment, please. That was all you needed to say,<br> but there is still something I need to say.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Rani XII, presently the latest version of general<br> supervisor management AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> These are purely the words of an Atlas Institute<br> alchemist.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> While the experiment failed, and your goals were in<br> error...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In any case, you have done what you determined as<br> best to avert the destruction you measured. All under<br> strict secrecy.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That is a most laudable task.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You have carried out your duty splendidly.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Even if the action&#39;s means turned out to be incorrect,<br> I will not deny this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The words may be clich\xE9, but you can&#39;t succeed at an<br> experiment if you&#39;re afraid of failure.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You performed your function well, Rani XII.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hold the mistaken data close to your heart,<br> and rest with no regrets.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct. My wish has only been to avoid<br> destruction.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> And to that end, I dedicate potential mistake in my<br> observations and the significance of the experiment&#39;s<br> failure to your journey ahead.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> May the blessings of the stars shine upon you all.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> May the stars of the northern skies illuminate the way<br> through whatever difficulty,<br> and whatever darkness\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Now. Let&#39;s not leave any mess in our wake.<br> Suppose we keep things appropriately themed?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s open a spiritron-separating logout gate...<br> keeping it door-shaped for simplicity&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> We&#39;d better go now.<br> Anything to add for the end?</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Yeah. I&#39;ve somewhat decided on what I need to say.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> Talk to me next time we meet.</p><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> That&#39;s it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Cerejeira:</strong><br> See you then.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Oh, I just remembered.<br> This is the end for me too, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll say this while I can, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> After all, I&#39;d rather avoid carrying over feedback that<br> could disturb the resolve of the me outside.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I went on this adventure with you.<br> It made for a very pleasant dream.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The time spent here was like a miracle for me.<br> One that can&#39;t be allowed to exist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you mean by...?</p><hr><h2 id="section-17-epilogue" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-17-epilogue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 17: Epilogue</h2><h3 id="arrow-1-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arrow-1-8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Arrow 1</h3><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!

I&#39;m affiliated with Chaldea as the<br> on-staff record keeper.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (We&#39;ve definitely exchanged greetings before.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Though she&#39;s not someone I&#39;ve really talked to.)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (But for some reason I feel interested now...)</p><hr><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> She is an\u2014Alterego Involved-type Master.<br> A sort of collateral type, you could say.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> At the time of the initial rotation, she simply<br> happened to be in the vicinity. In that sense,<br> she is similar to you.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> However, as an Alter Ego, she was merely a copy of<br> her personality model,</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> so a direct connection to the her in the outside world<br> is nonexistent.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Since the direct interference that brought the two of<br> you here was truly accidental, the mental transfer will<br> come to affect her real body.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> You two are currently in a coma in the outside world,<br> I presume. But she will come out of this completely<br> unaware anything happened to her.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Whatever effect takes root, it will be in the sense of<br> subconscious feedback via sympathetic magecraft.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As for the difference between her and you two...<br> it is naught but a simple and brief reason.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> From the onset, she was in a state that facilitates this.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> Ultimately, you were drawn in unintentionally.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> It is because of that difference only she ended up as<br> an official Master AI.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> If you permit my conjecture, I would presuppose she<br> already possessed some sort of mental instability.</p><p><strong>Rani\xA0XII:</strong><br> As if it were less taxing for her to slip out of character.<br> A denial of the current self; like seeking a different<br> self, or a different possibility\u2014</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Hey...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Wow.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go blurting out affirmatives like that, you&#39;ll<br> startle people.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Hey, listen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You want to...talk?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Don&#39;t go finishing my sentences for me... Did you use<br> some kinda mind-reading?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Ah, forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I decided that one-to-one communication with you<br> was mostly Meuni\xE8re&#39;s job, so I haven&#39;t exactly spoken<br> to you much whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> But, there&#39;s something I wanted to talk to you about,<br> just for a little bit. Do you have some time for me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So what did you want to talk about?</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> R-right.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I... For the longest time, I&#39;ve been wanting to<br> apologize to you.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but suddenly my heart is telling me<br> now is as good a time as ever. To talk with you, I mean.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> (Deep breaths)...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Right. Listen closely, because this might turn into a<br> real trip down memory lane...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> December 27, 2017.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> The sky, which had been occupied by a violent snow<br> storm until late last night, now harbored not a single<br> cloud. Fair weather took root as dawn broke.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Below this azure sky soared a black aircraft\u2014a<br> helicopter. It carried with it the visitors who would<br> herald the end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Aww! They&#39;re finally here.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> What are you yelling for? You&#39;re that excited about<br> this job?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Not a chance. Even considering this isn&#39;t my main<br> responsibility,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I figured before I even came here that being on gate<br> duty at some secret base in the Antarctic would be<br> super boring.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I mean, who are they expecting to come knocking?<br> Penguins?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But still, even considering how boring it is...<br> When I think about the fact that this&#39;ll be the last time<br> I do this, it really gets to me.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I guess so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Anyway, considering how important our last time here<br> is, how come you&#39;re here assisting with gate duty?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Wait, Cerejeira, don&#39;t tell me you couldn&#39;t help but<br> want to spend as much of your last time here together<br> with me...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> As if. As usual, it&#39;s orders from the higher-ups.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> You know how it is. This is a rare moment where<br> there&#39;s any point to recording the gate&#39;s visitor log,<br> so throw any free records clerk that way.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Also, I keep saying you&#39;re not on a first-name basis<br> with me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t help if I just want to yell it out over and<br> over again. I mean, how many times could I really have<br> said it?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> H-hey...how about instead of that, I say something<br> which I haven&#39;t ever said to you before, and that I might<br> as well get off my chest?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> We&#39;ve worked together for such a long time here,<br> and now that this place is getting dissolved and we&#39;ll<br> all walk out of here for the first time...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Well...when we get out...I was wondering...just once,<br> if we could...have dinner?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m being serious here.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> 312 times...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> The number of times you&#39;ve used my first name.<br> I remember them all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> O-oh. I see. That&#39;s our record keeper for you.<br> Imagine having that sort of memorization capability.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not my point.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AElron:</strong><br> \u201CJust once,\u201D you said.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AElron:</strong><br> You insisted on calling me by my first name,<br> trying so hard to get close to me.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AElron:</strong><br> But your serious dinner invitation is a one-time thing?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> ...<br> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> N-no, don&#39;t be ridiculous, it&#39;s obvious I would ask you<br> out a bunch more times.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I&#39;d do that until you agreed, and when you finally did,<br> I&#39;d ask a bunch more after that...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine, right...? I mean, that&#39;s what you&#39;d want,<br> right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Alright, alright, alright, I finally did it. Nice show of<br> courage, me...!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AElron:</strong><br> Spare me the celebration, you&#39;ve got work to do.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AElron:</strong><br> Look, there&#39;s a signal above the gate.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Seems they&#39;re here. The new director, Gordolf Musik,<br> and...</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Who&#39;s this? His pink-haired...secretary?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah, that should be the secretary.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It seems she&#39;s brought the UN inspection guys with<br> her, too. I guess she&#39;s not just some shady tagalong<br> after all.</p><p><strong>Gordolf:</strong><br> Hey! Where&#39;s the mic on this thing? Is this it?<br> We&#39;re here! Open this door!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yeah yeah, going through the response procedure<br> now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Cerejeira, when that display turns green, press the<br> button to open the gate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So\u2014what would you like to eat?</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Copy that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Anything&#39;s fine...but maybe some Portuguese food<br> after such a long time away from home\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> What I&#39;m saying is, I was the one who opened that<br> gate.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> When I think back on it now...it really was the last<br> chance to stop it all.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I dream about it constantly. I think, if only I had<br> realized something was off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That must&#39;ve been hard. I mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone already accepted they had to move on.</p><hr><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I know that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> We all had to fill out paperwork and prepare for the<br> hearings.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> And the current director Musik has now redeemed<br> himself, having shown that even he was deceived.<br> None of us really had any other choice. It was fate&#39;s<br> lot.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Yet\u2014and yet!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but think about what would have<br> happened had I not pressed that button.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> The last, I mean the absolutely last threshold between<br> it happening or not was my one button push.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I can&#39;t stop thinking about that.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Like, if I&#39;d just noticed something weird about<br> Koyanskaya, and lied about the gate malfunctioning.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I could have gone to speak to someone else first.<br> I could have made a difference.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> And, if I could&#39;ve just done something right for once,</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I could have kept my promise about dinner with that<br> guy who couldn&#39;t make it to the Border!</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> Countless scenarios have played over and over in my<br> head for the longest time. I&#39;m unable to forget them.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I&#39;m...the record keeper. I like to keep a journal as a<br> hobby, but memorizing things is a power I have.<br> That&#39;s what my family&#39;s magecraft is about.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> It&#39;s not like I can turn it off; this feeling of guilt.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> This...this guilt I carry, if I&#39;d just been a bit more<br> cautious back then.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I&#39;ve talked about it in counseling, but I think people<br> might be vaguely aware of it.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> No, they would&#39;ve probably figured it out by now.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> But right now, I...I just wanted to tell you in person.<br> I wanted to apologize in person.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> I know it might seem self-centered of me, but I really<br> do need to say this.</p><p><strong>Elron:</strong><br> \u2014I&#39;m so sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to apologize...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The guilt you feel\u2014</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure everyone here feels the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.

I don&#39;t get you.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I heard talk you were experiencing some sort of<br> sleeping sickness,</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> so now that you finally woke up, I decided to come<br> see if some delightful change had occurred within you...</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> But you haven&#39;t changed at all. How boring.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> This was such a good chance for a moral lapse,</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> You could have drunk yourself into carelessness,<br> or thrown a tantrum because you don&#39;t want to work<br> anymore.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Uh...what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Speaking of working.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Watch out not to overwork yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Why does it feel like I&#39;m getting scolded when I didn&#39;t<br> even do anything?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m constantly boycotting my services as the god of<br> love. I don&#39;t get this at all.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;ll refrain from work even without you telling me to.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> I&#39;m only here right now because, well, that&#39;s just how<br> it is, okay? There&#39;s nothing more to it than that.<br> Don&#39;t get the wrong idea, alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Still...I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Are you half asleep or something? Why would you be<br> glad about the presence of the Demon King of Lapse?</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Hehe, maybe there was a degenerate and ruinous<br> change within you after all. A desire for lapse.</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Whatever the case...why don&#39;t you just savour a<br> slothful sleep at the end of a long, hard day, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Yawn)... Will do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good night...</p><hr><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> \u2014Perhaps the parts of the ego that made up the<br> Alter Ego wanted to make themselves known.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Something that is bottled up but still \u201Cdefinitely there\u201D<br> within a person, with the goal of coming up to the<br> surface.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Perhaps that manifestation is what we would call an<br> Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Specifically, maybe it&#39;s the case that within the<br> person who gave birth to the Alter Ego of Yearning,<br> no matter how indistinct or suppressed, there exists<br> a\u2014</p><p><strong>Kama:</strong><br> Dummy...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Man, I&#39;m beat.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Considering the assimilative analysis ascertained by<br> Rani XII at the time of establishing the route between us,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> it&#39;s obvious that this event was one of the distortions<br> of the Human Order we had to deal with; one of the<br> so-called Ordeal Calls.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> But I would&#39;ve never guessed such a distortion had<br> accumulated within a place like PAPERMOON without<br> my knowing.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> This was nothing Seven Superweapons level,<br> but if I&#39;d upped the managerial attitude, maybe I<br> could&#39;ve spotted distortions at an even finer scale.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s really embarrassing as an administrator to admit<br> such a mistake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> The single praiseworthy point would be that the event<br> was resolved as quickly as it occurred.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Other than that, everything has been a mistake I gotta<br> make sure not to repeat.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s because of me being accustomed to<br> Thought Partitioning, but my memories have<br> unfortunately made it back to me intact.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Though, would I be the only one who remembers?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Kama is...also the type to be accustomed to \u201Cmultiple<br> selves\u201D, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It might be possible she does, but it would be akin to a<br> samurai&#39;s elegy, so it would probably end up cut right<br> out.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Elron and Fujimaru would be affected on a<br> deeply subconscious level at best, I presume.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Speaking of, maybe I should verify something.<br> A thought experiment, of sorts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> What got us dragged into PAPERMOON&#39;s world was<br> the initial rotation to produce Alter Egos.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, it only stands to reason that he was<br> also an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> In other words, it only stands to reason that she was<br> also an Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> So, just what kind of Alter Ego was<br> Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> [\u2642 His /\u2640\uFE0F Her] poor physical condition as soon as we entered<br> that world is something of a clue.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> That condition was such that it became downright<br> impossible to fight without assistance from my<br> Etherlight.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Poor conditions of unknown cause; a lag between<br> mind and body. When considering the meaning of this...<br> I see.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Hypothesis 1: [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] might have been [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] \u201Ctired of<br> fighting\u201D or \u201Cpacifistic\u201D side.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Sure, that&#39;s a good trait to have. Necessary, even.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> It&#39;s a personality trait that every human should<br> naturally possess.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Without it, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] definitely wouldn&#39;t be able to return to<br> [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her] daily life once all the fighting is over.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Let&#39;s consider the reverse for a moment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Suppose someone&#39;s raring for a fight, ready to do so<br> for the sake of the world without either hesitation or<br> anxiety, and not even a single particle of them was<br> averse to fighting...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> A person like that would be nothing more than a<br> bloodthirsty warrior.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> You could say they would be broken.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong><br> Once all the fighting was over, I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t<br> be able to return to daily life.
