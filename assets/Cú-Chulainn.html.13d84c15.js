When he was 16, he proceeded under Scathach, who ruled over the Land of Shadow. Learning under her, he was given the secret of leaping, as well as the demonic spear technique of Gae Bolg.</p><p>In the tale of T\xE1in B\xF3 C\xFAailnge, he fought alone against the army invading Ulster that had received an order from the queen of Connacht, Medb. At the end of his continuous days and nights of fighting, he was pressed with the contradiction of the vow (geas) to not eat dog meat and to not refuse hospitality; not only he ended up losing the freedom of his left hand, he also had no choice but to let go of his demonic spear at the behest of the poets.

To add, her master also made an appearance as a Lancer; Scathach, the queen of the Land of Shadow and the one who gave her the demonic spear Gae Bolg.
