While she is a warrior, Sc\xE1thach, who taught C\xFA Chulainn the 18 Primordial Runes, is also a powerful Mage at the same time.</p><p><strong>God Slayer: [B]</strong></p><p>As the gatekeeper of the \u201CLand of Shadows\u201D, a foreign land/magical realm, Sc\xE1thach\u2019s existential form that continued to slaughter Divine Spirits in great numbers has been converted into this Skill.

Also, only to those whom she truly acknowledged as Heroes, Sc\xE1thach can teach such Skills to them too.</p><p>A Skill Sc\xE1thach often employs during combat is \u201CClairvoyance\u201D for the foresight of combat situations.

There is not only one, but several of them.</p><p>For its ability at the time of its True Name Release, it results in a special move similar to C\xFA Chulainn\u2019s two Noble Phantasms \u2013 \u201CThe Barbed Spear that Stabs with Piercing Death\u201D and \u201CThe Soaring Spear that Lunges with Piercing Death\u201D \u2013 being combined together. First, for its close-range attack, a first demonic spear would snatch away the enemy\u2019s freedom to move and act by \u201Csewing them onto space\u201D, then after that, Sc\xE1thach would throw a second demonic spear with all her strength to pierce through the enemy as the finishing blow.

It completely sucks up all living things that are within the effect\u2019s range to the \u201CLand of Shadows\u201D, the domain under her rule. Those who fail a Magical Power Check and Luck Check will be sucked into the \u201CGate\u201D and are instantly killed.

A member of the ruling class by birth. Possessing the temperament of a monarch, she views the matter of reigning as a queen that bestows happiness to the people as self-evident. Overflowing with talent, she herself properly understands the most that she is different from the mediocre. \u201CBecause I am excelling over the mediocre, I will rule over the masses.\u201D \u201CFor the duty of the ruling class, I will rule over the masses.\u201D Rather than granting her own desires (happiness) or some such, having the thought of \u201CTo rule for the sake of the masses\u201D appears to be the natural thing for her to do. Although her mind has no intention on becoming a slave for the masses, she has absolutely no hesitation in refining herself for the sake of deciding on the happiness of the people whom she rules over.</p><p>In the same way on how she understands herself, Sc\xE1thach has a reliable eye to find out the qualities and temperament of others (especially whether they really are mediocre or not). That is, it is possible to say that C\xFA Chulainn was a rare individual who possessed a prodigious nature that made him worthy of being guided by her.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>Concerning the Master, Sc\xE1thach recognizes their partnership as a temporary alliance, but sometimes, her habit comes out where she also conducts herself like a teacher around the time of when she was teaching lessons to her former child pupils. When she notices that, she would smile and say, \u201C\u2026 No, I am not your teacher. Forget it.\u201D</p><p>The wish Sc\xE1thach wants to make on the Holy Grail is \u201Cfor someone who can kill her to appear.\u201D Sc\xE1thach, having changed halfway into a Divine Spirit at the end of many long months and years, had become an immortal existence. She can no longer hope to die\u2026 like a human, with either a beautiful death, or an ugly death. Just that, she must keep on existing until the time when the World, and its Outside, finally vanishes. If it is true that the Holy Grail is proven to be something actually omnipotent, then it is fine if it sends over someone who can kill her. \u201CAnd I pray\u2026 that person; if it is that person who holds the spear that was once granted to him with these hands\u201D\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CI will not act seriously.

The Queen who served as the gatekeeper of the \u201CLand of Shadows\u201D \u2013 a foreign land/magical realm, and a genius in spearmanship and Rune Magecraft. Sc\xE1thach possesses a tremendous power that is sufficient enough to close and control the Gate of the \u201CLand of Shadows\u201D, a region of which it is overflowing with a multitude of wraiths. It is said that she became the teacher of the young C\xFA Chulainn \u2013 who would later grow into the Great Hero of Ulster \u2013 guiding him, teaching him all sorts of her techniques, and even bestowing him his favourite demonic spear. She also guided and instructed his son, Connla.</p><h2 id="character-in-fgo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character-in-fgo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character in FGO</h2><p>\u201CMany things\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Truly, I have robbed many lives.

In the end, this body was wet with the blood of many victims, and became immortal. The \u201CLand of Shadows\u201D, the territory that is under my rule, was ultimately driven out to the Outside of the World, and I ended up being promoted into an existence not greatly different than that of a Divine Spirit\u2019s.</p><p>Without further aging.</p><p>Without even death.</p><p>I have changed into \u201Csomething\u201D that continues to exist for eternity.</p><p>Sure enough, I can no longer remember exactly how much time had passed since the first time I picked up a spear in my hands. No, that is incorrect. I, who continued to stand on the Magical Realm and guard the \u201CGate\u201D, already since acquired the Wisdom of the Abyss, so I am able to accurately measure the exact time.</p><p>However, I simply do not feel like doing it.</p><p>It is different from melancholy. It is also different from resignation.</p><p>Regret?</p><p>I do not understand. I might have said such a thing, but I am unable to affirm it.</p><p>At least, during the interval where I slaughtered many things, there is certainly something that exists inside the present me, something that I cannot stop feeling around the time when I was conducting my teachings towards the brave warriors of Ulster.</p><p>Ah, that is exactly right. I used to guide many of the extremely brave warriors.</p><p>Everything should have became extinct at the end of the days of the many passing months and years, but in the middle of my memories that are being preserved in a condition intentionally kept obscure, one person\u2026 There is only one person, a man who shows his figure clearly even to me.</p><p>Red eyes\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>That fellow\u2019s pair of eyes.

To say why she does not talk about these, concerning her, she already moved on from this World.

So basically, Sc\xE1thach does not participate in direct battles, and her cooperation is being held back to giving advice only\u2026 Although it can be said that, given that she has a genuine fondness for battle, she deceives herself by attaching a reason one way or another to participate in local battles, demonstrating some of her special moves. After taking away the turns of other Servants like that, she returns to her room to reflect on her actions alone, and this series of events is a one-set course of events for her.</p><p>Even in this form\u2019s state where she boasts the ability of a Top Servant sufficiently, Sc\xE1thach seems to have a Saint Graph [body] one step further above her current form.

In her true feelings, she believes that wishing to be killed by him is equal to wishing to be saved by him, but in any case, because she also believes that he is probably not able to do it, it is not a very serious belief.</p><p><strong>Medb</strong></p><p>A rascal that cannot be helped.
