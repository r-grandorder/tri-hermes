That\u2019s nothing but a mask she puts on to impress the ones around her.</p><p>This personality is partly a reaction to the fate imposed upon her. After being faced with betrayal over and over, this time the tragic woman fell into the role betraying others.</p><p>When she was alive, after she suffered a severe betrayal, was branded as the Witch of Betrayal after a long journey and was driven away from her hometown, she made a decision. \u201CIf I can only live as a witch, then I shall live as a witch\u201D.</p><p>Caster is considered the weakest Class in a Holy Grail War since many Servants have Magic Resistance.</p><p>As she can use lost magecraft from the Age of the Gods, she is knowledgeable enough to even hack the Holy Grail\u2019s system to summon a Servant as her own familiar. Her favorite tactic is hide herself behind a solid barrier, set layers upon layers of traps and corner her enemies into dooming themselves.</p><p>She is fundamentally an innocent and compassionate woman and will be wholeheartedly devoted to any man who sees her as such.</p><p>While she has her own twisted ways of showing affection, she is very actively helpful.</p><p>Also, due to her past experiences, she is unable to trust good-looking men and seems to like cute girls.</p><p>In the 5th Fuyuki Holy Grail War, when she was testing her binding over the Saber (Arthuria) she was going to use against Berserker, she shows her sadistic desire to degrade the knight into a witch like her, but you can also infer she took a liking to her looks.</p><p>Her hobby is making dolls, and after she was manifested as a Heroic Spirit she started trying her hand at dioramas.</p><p>Building small worlds is the most basic and most advanced principle of magecraft.</p><p>Her being able to build detailed and elaborate small worlds is proof she is a magus who learned directly from the Goddess Hecate.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>She is a troublesome Servant with a considerable risk of betraying anyone she doesn\u2019t like, even her Master.</p><p>She has a special grudge against good-looking men who remind her of Jason and men who try to take advantage of her. In the 5th Grail War in Fuyuki, she made her plan, deceived her Master (Atram Galiasta in the Fate/stay Night [Unlimited Blade Works] anime), made him waste his Command Spells and killed him.</p><p>On the other hand, she will actively try to show off for someone she likes and will even put herself in danger to help them.</p><p>However, as she still has her trauma from being ditched by the man she loved, she will almost always interact with them from a safe distance. She is not very aware of it herself, but she has a subconscious wish to go back to her happy life in her hometown.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><p>\u201CBut, what a shame.

You can see her in Fate/Hollow Ataraxia as a happy young wife and in the Carnival Phantasm anime, we can even see her donning a tennis uniform.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>Arthuria:</strong></p><p>Liked from the start because she would be a good model for dolls, but then turned out to like her personality and life choices too.

I had to adjust the pose a lot to make her long staff fit into the frame and think about how that change would affect her cape, but then came the third ascension and she loses the cape that defined most of her movement and cover most of most of the area, so I went back and forth a lot when adjusting the balance between the second and third ascensions. Since she is a character who showed a lot of deep expressions in the previous games, I had no idea what mood I should show her. It was difficult to decide. As she exposes her face upon ascension, I decided to draw Medea looking less evil when her face is exposed.
