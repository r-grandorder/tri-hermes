I&#39;m glad<br> you seem so accustomed to this sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Aha, I see.

That is all you needed to<br> figure out what has happened!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I see... So it was the chocolate. You think it must have contained elixirs from all four&#39;s respective places and eras of origin?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And this is why you&#39;ve been so concerned by the four of them spending time together lately? I see...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Aah, I&#39;m so sorry!<br> I had no idea that chocolate was so dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not your fault, Murasaki.

Maybe we can learn something of value about where we are...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Whoa now, hold it right there, you two.<br> You were just talking about chocolate, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh!? Who are you!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Me and my boys here got a real sweet tooth, you see, so it was a stroke of luck running into you two like this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now why don&#39;t you just hand over the goods and we&#39;ll be on our way, yeah?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> And by goods, I mean chocolate, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, great. This again.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You mean this sort of thing happens<br> regularly in your dreams, Master!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Huh? What do you mean, \u201CThis again\u201D?<br> Ain&#39;t never seen either of you before.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Look, save the small talk for the small-timers. We know what we&#39;re doing here. Just give us what we want, and we won&#39;t kill you.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> We heard you talking about chocolate, so just put it down nice and slow and we won&#39;t have any trouble.</p><p><strong>Bandit A:</strong><br> Hehehe... It&#39;s chocolate time!</p><p><strong>Bandit B:</strong><br> I can&#39;t remember the last time we &#39;ad fresh chocolate!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry, we don&#39;t have any chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I hate to tell you this, but...we don&#39;t have any...</p><hr><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Huh? You don&#39;t have any chocolate!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Tch. So you&#39;re just a couple of outsiders then. Could&#39;ve led with that instead of getting our hopes up.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> All right, never mind then.<br> Go on, get out of here.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> And be careful! It&#39;s dangerous around here!</p><p><strong>Bandit A:</strong><br> Watch out for monsters!</p><p><strong>Bandit B:</strong><br> Just follow that road there,<br> and it&#39;ll take ye straight ta town!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I-it looks like...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...they&#39;re putting their guns away.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And that leader of theirs is obviously Lord Teach. Perhaps we could find out more about this place from him?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s up?<br> There something you two need help with?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Wanna ask me for advice?<br> I&#39;m a better listener than I look.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;d be happy to assist. In particular, milady, I couldn&#39;t help but notice your most impressive chest\u2013</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Oops, pardon me. Let me rephrase that.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> I&#39;m speaking, of course, of your dress,<br> and its incredibly intricate embroidery.</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> As a man of culture, I find it both intriguing and magnificently easy on the eyes... Huhuhu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, I guess we can talk for a little...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hwachaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Mwachaaaaaa!?</p><p><strong>Bandits:</strong><br> Chaaa!? I mean, Chieeef!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hiya! Next, I use my rebound from the flying kick to do a triple midair backflip...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...with a perfect, ten out of ten landing!<br> That. Was. Awesome!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Man oh man, that was a close call for you two, wasn&#39;t it!? Good thing for you I showed up to help!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wait. IS it a good thing?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Meh, who cares?

Whacha!<br> Come on, bring it on!</p><p><strong>Bandits:</strong><br> Guh-whaaa!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We should probably get them to stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You good to go, Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Y-yes, I&#39;m fine!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, Master.<br> I promise I&#39;ll put a stop to this squabble!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> This overwhelming abundance of cheerfulness!<br> This rejuvenating party girl power!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> And above all, these weird movements that are making my head hurt in more ways than one!</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve always prided myself on being a gentleman, and so able to endure common attacks...</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> But there&#39;s something about those sparkly attacks that makes me feel like it would be wrong to dodge them... Gurk.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Woohoo, I won!<br> I think I&#39;ll snap a quick pic to remember this by.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um...who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> May I ask who you are?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Heh. Me? I&#39;m nobody important.<br> But, if you insist on calling me something...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> How about...Mysterious Pretty Sailor Girl? No, wait,<br> calling myself \u201Cpretty\u201D is kind extra, isn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (She&#39;s obviously trying to come up with something on the spot...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t interrupt her, Murasaki.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> There, I&#39;ve got it!<br> I am none other than the shining\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Sei Shounagon!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You&#39;re obviously Sei Shounagon, daughter of Kiyohara-no-Motosuke, one of the Nashitsubo, the Five Men of the Pear Chamber! Right!?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Uh... Who, me?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I saw you avert your gaze!<br> Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sei Shounagon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> As in THE Sei Shounagon?</p><hr><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> No, really, I have no idea who you&#39;re talking about.<br> Nope. No clue at all.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Do you know who Sei Shounagon is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not very well.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Sei Shounagon is an author from Japan&#39;s Heian period,<br> much like myself.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Of course, we had quite different taste in genres. My focus was on narrative, while she preferred essays...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But, she was still the only other woman besides me who managed to hold her own in the harsh world of the old imperial court...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> A world quite thoroughly dominated by men.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What&#39;s more, she trounced every single opponent who challenged her to a lyrical Heian MC battle...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...so I know she was very...skilled.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Kinda getting the vibe that I&#39;m<br> getting a backhanded compliment.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Of course, Sei Shounagon is best known for<br> \u201CThe Pillow Book\u201D! Have you ever read it, Master!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It&#39;s said to be the first collection of essays ever written in Japan...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...and it details her singular thoughts and feelings on daily life in the palace court using a wide variety of colorful prose.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> At the time, the first passage from her essay<br> \u201CIn Spring the Dawn\u201D was so shocking that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, that&#39;s enough for now, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m so sorry.<br> There I go getting carried away again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I take it you&#39;re a huge fan of hers?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m not!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I-I-I do think her work has historical value,<br> but that doesn&#39;t mean I care for it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Not to mention that there are many passages where her attempts to show off her knowledge only demonstrate how little she truly understands!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I can&#39;t tell you how many headaches I got from trying to make sense of all of her anecdotes where she was clearly just bragging about how great her life was!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> In modern parlance, the phrase that best describes my true opinion of her work would be, \u201COh NO she didn&#39;t!\u201D</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> You don&#39;t say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She&#39;s usually much more reserved than this, I promise!</p><hr><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Wahaha!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Hey, I don&#39;t got a problem with it.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Hell, I appreciate that kind of candor!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take that over talking about me<br> behind my back any day of the week!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh?<br> U-um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> You mean...you&#39;re not upset?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I thought for sure you were going to say something like, \u201CWhere the hell do you get off talking about me like that, bookworm nerd I&#39;ve never met before?\u201D</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...You ARE Sei Shounagon, right?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Well, you know...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> I may or may not have been called that<br> at one point or another...</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> See, I&#39;m retired now.<br> I decided I wasn&#39;t gonna be Sei Shounagon anymore.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> So I don&#39;t have any plans to write anything new anytime soon! If ever!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Say what?</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> I&#39;m a new party girl now, full of possibilities! And I&#39;m looking for some new hobby to catch my eye!</p><p><strong>Sei Shounagon?:</strong><br> So just call me \u201CNagiko\u201D and don&#39;t sweat the rest.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Something tells me it&#39;s not a coincidence that we ran into each other out here like this...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...so now that we have,<br> we may as well make the most of it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Wha... Wha...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What in the world are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Head Bandit:</strong><br> Um...

Pirates? What are you on about? Who&#39;s heard of pirates lubbing it up on land?

Weren&#39;t you listening to me?<br> Didn&#39;t you hear me introducing myself?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Who is this \u201Cthem\u201D you last<br> guardians (lol) are fighting?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Do they have anything to do<br> with why you brought us here?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Now that I&#39;ve seen how strong you guys are, I want to ask for your help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell us more.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> First off, this city&#39;s divided into five districts.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Each district is run by an administrator, and let me tell you, these admins are all real pieces of work.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> They all run around doing whatever the hell they please like they own the place, not just run it.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> The worst part is...they don&#39;t even see us as human.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> If they did, they&#39;d never be capable of such cruelty!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh my, that sounds terrible.<br> What did they do, Lord Higekuro?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> (Ahh, Kaorucchi...<br> You&#39;re like an angel come down from the heavens...)</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> They came up with a seriously<br> messed up custom, is what.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> And we can&#39;t get rid of it on our own,<br> which is why we need your help.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Our goal is to rid the world of the most twisted holiday ever...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Valentine&#39;s Day!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh, yeah, I know what that is. I don&#39;t know<br> WHY I know, but I know I know, you know?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Valentine&#39;s Day is a holiday where<br> girls take chocolate and...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Uh...throw it in the face of the guy they like to challenge them to a duel. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And since it&#39;s all dishonorable to refuse one of these duels, the guys gotta choose to either kill their opponent or love them forev\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Stop. Just...stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really reaching for a laugh there.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Besides, we already know what Valentine&#39;s Day is!<br> That has nothing to do with why we were speechless!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Yeah, I only wish things were that easy.<br> No, Valentine&#39;s Day here involves\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> \u2014, \u2014!!!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Huh... Anyone else hearing that commotion outside?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It sounds like some sort of argument...<br> What would you like to do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go check it out.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> Wait! Valentine&#39;s is still a ways away, right!?</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> I promise I&#39;ll find some chocolate before the<br> fourteenth! Please, I just need a little more time!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Do you really expect us to believe that!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You had a whole year to prepare for this day!<br> If you couldn&#39;t attract anyone by now, you never will!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Exactly, losers!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The only thing guys like you are good for<br> is doing whatever guys like us tell them to!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What&#39;s with those guys?<br> They&#39;re being real jerkfaces.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Those guys...are the Lonelyheart Police.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The lonely what now?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> They track down poor saps who don&#39;t<br> get any chocolate and punish them.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> As far as guys like us are concerned,<br> they&#39;re basically grim reapers.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I, um... Oh goodness, I don&#39;t even know what to ask about first, but for the moment...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What does this punishment involve?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> In this city, it&#39;s a crime to be unpopular and single. If you can&#39;t attract a girl, no chocolate for you.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> And any guy who fails to get himself some chocolate by February 14 is sentenced to being a Lonelyheart:</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> A third-class citizen who has to pay heavy taxes, undertake forced back-breaking labor, and is subject to all kinds of restrictions on their livelihoods!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> And they have to live through<br> that hell for at least a year!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there no love in this world anymore?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is awful even for a dystopia.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Oof... That got me right in the feels. I&#39;m so glad you understand. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d swear you and I&#39;ve known each other for years.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Uh, but I digress.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Rumor even has it that every year, some poor saps are taken to the central district, where they&#39;re never seen again.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> That&#39;s just what life is like here in this city...<br> And now, you know the truth about Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Well then, I&#39;m gonna go greet them with a dynamic entry: flying kick to the face.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> W-wait!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Just because we now know what&#39;s going on in this city doesn&#39;t mean we should just rush in! It could be dangerous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, we should go. In fact, we have to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t allow oppression like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heh. Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.<br> I knew you and I were birds of a feather.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> There&#39;s just something about arrogant holier-than-thou types that really makes you wanna throw hands!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> All right, I understand. We certainly can&#39;t stand back and do nothing when we see someone in trouble!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> If this is what you&#39;ve decided, Master,<br> then I&#39;ll be with you every step of the way!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> Higekuro! You didn&#39;t have to<br> stick your neck out just for me!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> We&#39;re comrades in arms, right?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> There&#39;s not much time left till Valentine&#39;s Day,<br> so we&#39;ve all gotta stay on the chocolate prowl.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> Higekuro!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> If there&#39;s a girl you&#39;ve got your eye on, just keep lavishing her with attention until you creep her the hell out. Do that, and you can&#39;t fail!</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> Yeah... You&#39;re right!<br> Okay, I&#39;ll give it a shot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, you tried to give good advice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I figured out why these guys don&#39;t have any luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Also, what&#39;s a chocolate prowl, anyway?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Phew...<br> Thank goodness we managed to save that poor man.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Though if what you&#39;ve said is true, Lord Higekuro,<br> it would seem that is a common occurrence here.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Yeah, it is...<br> All I want to do is help those poor lonelyhearts out.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> That&#39;s why me and my boys have been going around stealing chocolate from normies with plenty to spare...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...and sneaking it over to the lonelyhearts.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> But that&#39;s just putting a Band-Aid<br> on a bullet wound, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> We need to take down Valentine&#39;s Day for good, or late-blooming gents like us&#39;ll never have a shot at a happy ending.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> So while I doubt you can turn back at this point,<br> let me ask you again anyway:</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Will you help us?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master, I don&#39;t have any evidence I can point<br> to in order to support this hypothesis...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But my intuition is telling me that for<br> this city to have reached this point...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...there must be something here that&#39;s<br> responsible for twisting the world in this way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You mean, like...a Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, I think so.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So if we can find the Holy Grail&#39;s owner...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...and take the Grail into our own custody...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We should be able to escape from this dreamworld?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Lord Higekuro.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> We would be glad to help you free this city<br> from the clutches of this Valentine tyranny!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Yeah? I&#39;m thrilled to hear that.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> &#39;Course, I knew that anyone with eyes as clear and pure as you two would have to be good people.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Not to mention you actually bothered to hear what we had to say even when we&#39;d only just met... (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Whoops, sorry &#39;bout that! No tears of joy for me<br> until we&#39;ve won this battle for good.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> All right then, from now on, we&#39;ll all work together to kick those smarmy jerks out of our city!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heh... Not so fast.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I just came up with a brilliant idea that&#39;ll solve aaall our problems! Wanna hear?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Nope. Not interested.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Why not?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> &#39;Cause whatever it is, I can already tell<br> it&#39;s gonna be anything but brilliant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now, now, let&#39;s give her a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It can&#39;t hurt to hear what her idea is.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heh... Hehe...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Glad to see someone here gets it, Chan-mas.<br> I give you extra affinity points for that\u2606</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Gag!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> All right, Beardie, hear me out.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Stop calling me \u201CBeardie\u201D already!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I&#39;ll admit, this city&#39;s way of celebrating Valentine&#39;s Day is seriously jacked...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...but what if WE were able to take advantage of that?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I see. And how would we go about this?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> According to this city&#39;s rules, it doesn&#39;t matter who you get chocolate from as long as you get it from someone.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...all we have to do is make a bunch of chocolate and hand it out to all the lonelyhearts ourselves!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What? You all so blown away by my genius idea that you&#39;re at a loss for words or something?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Once everyone&#39;s got chocolate of their own, they&#39;ll all get to live ultra happily ever after.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And that&#39;s before you get into the bonus happiness of getting it from a beautiful babe like myself.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It&#39;s perfect! Completely foolproof!<br> This way, anyone and everyone can be happy!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Anyway, that being said...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> How come you&#39;re all facepalming like there&#39;s no tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I knew you weren&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed, but I didn&#39;t think you couldn&#39;t even do basic math...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You calling me stupid or something?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Handing out chocolate of our own is<br> all well and good in theory...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...but where are we supposed to get that<br> much chocolate in the first place?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...Oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That is not a helpful answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is there any way we can get some?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Frankly, no. Chocolate is an extremely precious resource for guys like us.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> The only ones in this entire city who can get their<br> hands on it are the women who live here.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ugh, what a waste of time that idea turned out to be!<br> I knew we should never have listened to her! Hmph!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never seen you like this before, Kaoruko!</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Putting aside how happy it may or may not make everyone, that idea is useless without actual chocolate.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And seeing how chocolate neither grows on trees nor rains down from the sky, where are we supposed to get that much\u2013</p><p><strong>Underling A:</strong><br> Boss!<br> Sorry to interrupt you, Boss, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong><br> It&#39;s an emergency!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong></p><h1 id="we-ve-got-a-golem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-ve-got-a-golem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> We&#39;ve got a golem!!!</h1><p><strong>Underlings:</strong></p><h1 id="yeaaah" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yeaaah" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Yeaaah!!!</h1><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Keep your voices down, dammit!<br> What&#39;s the big idea!?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> You&#39;ve all seen golems before, right?<br> Just gang up on it and it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><p><strong>Underling A:</strong><br> Y-ye don&#39;t understand, Boss...<br> This ain&#39;t a normal golem.</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong><br> It&#39;s way bigger, an&#39; stronger,<br> an&#39; it&#39;s got a color I ain&#39;t never seen before.</p><p><strong>Underling B:</strong><br> So we thought maybe, jus&#39; maybe,<br> it&#39;s the legendary\u2013</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Chocolate...Golem...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Chocolate?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Golem?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um, I suppose I should ask what sort of creature it is we&#39;re talking about?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> The Chocolate Golem&#39;s a legendary golem that&#39;s said to only appear once every few hundred years. I never thought I&#39;d get the chance to see one for myself...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> True, if we can find a way to defeat it, that oughta give us plenty of chocolate to work with.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> But if the rest of the legend is also true...<br> that would mean it&#39;s a powerful Demonic chocolate!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Dammit! If only we had a way to combat it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> All right, I see how it is.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Looks like this is my time to shine then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not you, Nagiko.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nope. It&#39;s Kaoruko&#39;s.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I, um... I suppose I&#39;d better get going then...</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a literal mountain of chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Whoooa. I didn&#39;t even know you could have this much chocolate in one place!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, well, with a name like \u201CChocolate Golem\u201D...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I would honestly have been more shocked if it dropped anything that wasn&#39;t chocolate...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Hot damn, Kaorucchi, I can&#39;t believe how easily you took down a Demonic creature. Thank goodness I&#39;m not Demonic myself.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Then again, seeing how opposites attract and all, maybe we&#39;d end up happily ever after if I WAS Demonic...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;d probably end up as ash, assuming there was anything left at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I doubt it. Kaoruko&#39;s not the type to hold back.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Whoops. I was so overcome by her<br> beauty that I almost forgot myself.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Anyway, now that we&#39;ve got all this chocolate, we should be able to hand it out to every guy in town!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> And when Valentine&#39;s Day comes and goes without any third-class citizens, it oughta bring down the admins&#39; reign once and for all!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heh...<br> Does that mean we&#39;re doing this?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Yeah, it does.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> We&#39;re going along with your stupid plan after all!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> All right! Now that that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s all<br> pitch in to make enough chocolate for everyone!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> We&#39;re all in on the hijinks now!<br> Yeaaah!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong><br> Aw yeaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re hitting it off so well...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, um...<br> I don&#39;t really feel comfortable in that sort of atmosphere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does it have something to do with her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you not get along with her?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> In her case...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I think she was probably meant<br> to be summoned as a Caster.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But since she was summoned as a class that doesn&#39;t suit her, that might be why she&#39;s so, um, free-spirited.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So she was supposed to be a summer Heroic Spirit (read: party girl)?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> N-not necessarily! That&#39;s only a guess on my part!<br> Nothing certain!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master, I...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Before I served Lady Shoushi, the Empress,<br> I used to serve Lady Rinshi.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It was during that time that I first saw<br> Sei Shounagon back in the palace.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But she, well...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think she so much as looked my way.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Not that I can blame her, for I had yet to write anything of note at the time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Her world was so entirely different from mine. She was so strong and seemed to sparkle with energy...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> She was also proud to a fault, immodest, and so spiteful it almost seemed to seep out of her pores...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um... Murasaki?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This Sei Shounagon doesn&#39;t quite<br> fit the image I always had of her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I can&#39;t say why that is, though perhaps<br> it&#39;s due to her class. At any rate...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Writers like Lord Andersen, Lord Shakespeare,<br> and even myself...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> We write because it&#39;s the only way we know how to live.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I especially don&#39;t see how anyone who owes their becoming a Heroic Spirit to their accomplishments as a writer could put down their pen so easily.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> So I can&#39;t help but wonder what<br> could have caused her to\u2013</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hey hey.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Eeeeeek!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hi, Nagiko.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought you were yeah-ing it up over there.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Beardie and his gang said they wanted to bring the chocolate mountain back to their hideout, so I came to get you two.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Kaorucchi?<br> Something on your mind?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> N-no, it&#39;s nothing.

Now every single sad sack<br> in town&#39;s got chocolate of their own!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Which means there&#39;ll be zero<br> third-class citizens this year!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> And that, in turn, means there won&#39;t be anyone left who has to suck up to you just to make ends meet anymore!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Hmph, that&#39;s what you think.

This is just what happens when a bad guy kicks it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes... I suppose you&#39;re right, but...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hwachaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Gaaaaaah!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Wh-wh-wh-what do you think you&#39;re doing!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Well, she didn&#39;t look like she was doing so hot, so I thought I&#39;d cheer her up with something sweet.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...!<br> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> What...did you do? You... You... Idiot!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Can&#39;t you tell that calorie control is crucial<br> to keeping this bod so perfectly proportioned!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> U-um, excuse me, but...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I think your Spirit Origin has stabilized...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll be damned.</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Grr...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Besides, you and I are enemies, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> What were you even trying to do by saving me?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> And please say it&#39;s not &#39;cause you&#39;d have trouble sleeping if you let me die, or something cheesy like that.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Uh, no.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I just remember Kaorucchi said she wanted to ask you something, so I thought it&#39;d be better if you stuck around.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> THAT&#39;S the only reason you saved me!? Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t you come up with anything better than that!?<br> Anything at all!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I mean, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got, so...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Well... I guess if I had to choose something else...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It&#39;s your hair, Aocchi.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> \u201CAocchi\u201D? Huh?<br> You don&#39;t mean me, do you?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> A-and what about my hair?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been wondering how you got it so<br> silky smooth ever since you showed up.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What kinda product do you use?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Are you kidding me?<br> You want me to tell you my hair care regimen?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And how you keep your skin so smooth, and how<br> you do your nails hidden inside those gloves...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> There&#39;s so much about your beauty<br> routine I&#39;m dying to know about!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Q-quit staring at me, will you?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Th-those are trade secrets, all right? Why would I tell you about them?

This girl I was fighting to the death just a few minutes ago is now saying she wants to be friends because she loves my hair, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Is this normal now?<br> Am I the weirdo for not getting it?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Well, look.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> You can&#39;t go back to the way things were here anymore anyway, so you might as well enjoy yourself, right?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Yeah... Good point. This all seems real<br> silly when you stop to think about it.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Besides, there&#39;s no point to me running this district<br> without any third-class citizens to subjugate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aocchi...</p><hr><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Don&#39;t call me that.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> So, uh... You there, with the beard.<br> Take me somewhere I can blow off some steam.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> We can have tea or something while I manicure<br> the hell out of this nutjob&#39;s nails.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Really!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You really really mean it, for real!? Yeaaah!<br> Come on, guys, let&#39;s get out of here!</p><p><strong>Underlings:</strong><br> Aw yeaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...I almost feel bad for you guys.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> You must have your hands full with her, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh my! I didn&#39;t know Medb\u2013Er, Aoi was even capable of looking at anyone with such overwhelming pity!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> And you know, while we&#39;re at it...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> I honestly thought this city&#39;s rules<br> were kind of messed up, too.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> I mean, where&#39;s the fun in breaking a hot guy&#39;s body and spirit when all it takes is a piece of chocolate to make him do whatever you say?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Lady Aoi...?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> So if you guys reaaally want my help...<br> I guess I could think about offering it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I... Yes! Absolutely! That would be wonderful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sure this is a good idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I already tell you not to ask me!?</p><h2 id="section-four-thankful-things" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-four-thankful-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section Four: Thankful Things</h2><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heehee.<br> Teeheehee.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Please stop that, Shounagon\u2013</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I mean, N-Nagiko.<br> It&#39;s starting to creep me out.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Check it, Kaorucchi!<br> My nails are sooo shiny!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I know because you showed them to me yesterday!<br> And please call me by my proper name already!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Just to be clear, you need to take care of your nails every day if you want them to stay in good shape.

Lonelyhearts who&#39;ll pay whatever it takes to avoid getting demoted to third-class citizen status.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I can see you&#39;re wondering what could possibly be so fulfilling about chocolate like that, Kaorucchi.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> True, there might not be much to gain from the chocolate itself, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s meaningless.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Suffice to say, there are some gents out there for who that fact alone has to be enough to get by.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hmm, I gotcha.<br> Well, don&#39;t you worry about a thing, Beardie.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure to save every single purehearted guy here with my special handmade chocolate!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Uh, first off, you didn&#39;t make it; Kaorucchi did.

You can&#39;t<br> put one over on me, wily high school girl!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Aw crap, it&#39;s the Lonelyheart Police.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Then, does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Teehee, it&#39;s quite all right, I promise.<br> They all work for me at my shop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That voice...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh my, you&#39;re a much more austere older gentleman than you seemed from a distance, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Might you be here looking for chocolate, by any chance?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Then you&#39;ll definitely want to stop by my shop.

How rude can you get!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you made it this far<br> treating other people like garbage!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Pot, meet kettle.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> My, my, it&#39;s not every day we see an admin here doing her own shopping.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> What happened? Did you get carried away and hand out so much chocolate you don&#39;t have enough to go around anymore?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Well, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re not the first woman to ruin herself by giving too much away to men.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Yeah, okay. Kill her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know you&#39;re upset, but please try not to let her get to you!</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Bahahaha! It&#39;s true!<br> She really was ruined!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Hey! Whose side are you on, anyway!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Aaanywho...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> &#39;Sup, Obochin!<br> I&#39;m Nagiko!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Are those fake ears?<br> They&#39;re so cute!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Obo...what?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Um, excuse me, but can you tell me what her deal is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you angry? Did she cross a line?</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> It&#39;s more like, her acting so chummy<br> kind of makes me suspicious...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;ve heard of those phone scams where people pretend to be your relatives to ask you for money, right? Don&#39;t you think they&#39;re terrifying?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Is that what&#39;s going on here?<br> Are you after my money?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Nope, no going-after-money-ing here.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Those ears of yours just reminded me<br> of an old colleague of mine, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Oh... That&#39;s a new one.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> So you once knew someone else with ears like mine?<br> Is that it?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yup! ...In fact, they looked exactly like the picture you&#39;ve got on those chocolates there.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> That is a cat.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yeah, a cat.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Wait. Just a moment.<br> Are you saying your old colleague is a cat!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh man, this Myoubu chocolate looks reaaal good.<br> How much do these go for?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Wha\u2013That has nothing to do with what we were just talking about! Seriously, what is her problem!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s just...like that. You get used to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> W-well... All right.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> I very much doubt you can afford it,<br> but just for your reference...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> ...this kitty-cat chocolate typically costs as much as an average citizen makes in a year.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> A year!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um... Hang on. Since Valentine&#39;s Day happens every year...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If you work hard for the whole year,<br> you&#39;ll be able to afford one next year, too.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Well, what do you know.<br> That&#39;s actually pretty considerate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what an actual demon looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s what actual demons look like...</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Of course, we have very reasonable payment plan options as well. How about it, Bearded Sir?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> You seem like you have no family to support,<br> so you can spend your money as you like.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Really, it&#39;s not expensive at all if you consider it money spent on a hobby. Just sign this purchase form here, and you&#39;ll be on your way!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> No... I&#39;ve heard enough.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I see now that you&#39;re the cold, heartless personification of Valentine&#39;s Day itself.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> H-huh!?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> People like you have been oppressing and exploiting me for my whole life...and I&#39;ve never had so much as a single date to show for it!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Well, no more! I&#39;ve had it up to<br> here with that depressing reality!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Now get ready to feel the pain of every single sad<br> sack you Valentine bastards have ever messed with!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> So what you&#39;re saying is, there are good Valentines and bad Valentines...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...and Oboro&#39;s here is the bad kind, right? Then I&#39;m waaay down to help you destroy it. Also her. Mostly her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh? W-we&#39;re going to fight now!? I was hoping to avoid combat if we could, but I suppose that&#39;s no longer an option.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> After all, if we don&#39;t do something about her now, we&#39;ll never be able to hand out our own chocolate!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> H-h-h-hand out!? As in, for free!?<br> That&#39;s the most horrible thing I&#39;ve ever heard!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Employeeeeees!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Get rid of these malicious customers<br> before they ruin my business model!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Awawawah! My shop!<br> My shop is on fireee!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Nooo! My poor, precious money!!!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Damn, I never expected our Noble Phantasms to hit the shop directly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um... I think we may have gone a little too far...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Oopsies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s so darn cute!</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Never mind that!!!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> What am I supposed to do now that I&#39;m flat broke!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> You really are a dummy, aren&#39;t you? This is what you get for caring so much about money of all things.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> All you had to do was bring a man or three under your heel, and they would&#39;ve gotten money for you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t strike me as a very, um,<br> nice way to live, either...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Heh. Don&#39;t feel too bad, Obocchi.<br> You still have your... Um...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You still have those soft, fluffy ears going for you!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> As long as you&#39;ve got fur like that,<br> you can always start your life over, no problem.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Probably.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> How is that possibly supposed to cheer me up!? You just made me sound like some kind of hairy animal!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I mean, it is what it is, you know?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Besides, losing everything you&#39;ve got means there&#39;s nothing to do but try something new, right?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It&#39;s a lot more fun than you might think.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You can trust me on that.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Something...new?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got an old bar just laying around.<br> We could rebuild it into a caf\xE9!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> A caf\xE9 where the staff wears fluffy ears.<br> What do you think? I bet it&#39;d be a hit.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> That&#39;s OUR old bar you&#39;re talking about!<br> You can&#39;t turn it into a caf\xE9!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> It&#39;s our holy land! Our safe space!<br> A world of men, by men, and for men!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> A fluffy ear caf\xE9...<br> I think I really like the sound of that...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Now look what you did! You woke the beast in a very literal sense just to get her hopes up for nothing!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Um, Nagiko, maybe you should be a little more considerate towards Lord Higekuro...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Aw, c&#39;mon. Why would he have a problem with a caf\xE9 full of pretty girls wearing fluffy ears?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Okay, so this is not about me having any interest in beast girls. Not one damn bit. Uh-uh. No, sir...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> But if you want to use that old bar to make a caf\xE9 that just HAPPENS to be packed to the rafters with them at all hours...I, uh, guess I can&#39;t stop you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Hehe, hehehe...<br> You&#39;ve got yourself a deal, Bearded Sir.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Yeah, I feel good about this! No more sneaking around scalping chocolate on the black market for me!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> From this day forth,<br> it&#39;s all about fluffy ears!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a great idea, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yay, another case in the bag!<br> We&#39;re doing great!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Are we sure this is a good idea!?<br> I mean really, truly sure!?</p><h2 id="section-five-lazy-things" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-five-lazy-things" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section Five: Lazy Things</h2><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> You know, I&#39;ve been giving it some thought...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> ...and I realized running a business that preys on people in trouble really isn&#39;t ethical.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve turned over a new leaf. From now on,<br> I&#39;ll be working with you, not against you.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Together, I know we can kick all<br> these bad guys out of our town.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> And once we do, we can expand the fluffy ear caf\xE9,<br> \u201CMama&#39;s Ears,\u201D into a full-blown franchise!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Hey. Are we sure letting her<br> join the team is a good idea?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Yeah, I think we&#39;d all be a lot better off if we just sold her to the nearest circus.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Oh gosh, how could you say that!?<br> That&#39;s fluffy earist, I&#39;ll have you know!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Hearing that sort of hate speech is as bad as punching a delicate flower like me in the face! I won&#39;t stand for it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yeah, you two, be nice. Obochin&#39;s one of us now.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> She&#39;s a valuable member of the team,<br> and she deserves to be treated as such.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Huh? Where&#39;s all that praise coming from? I don&#39;t disagree, of course, but even I&#39;m kind of shocked.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Well, you know...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> There&#39;s just something really nice about having you around.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Just stroking your ears like this makes all the stresses of the workday seem to melt away...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> That sounds exactly like something an office worker would say to their pet after getting home for the day!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Khh... Although, I must admit...<br> you&#39;re surprisingly good at this...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hehehe. I didn&#39;t spend all that time<br> taking care of Lady Myoubu for nothing.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> So you like that, huh?<br> I bet you do! I bet you do!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s not the point!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Be warned that I&#39;m keeping close track of every last stroke, and I&#39;ll be billing you accordingly!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master...could I speak to you for a moment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s up, Kaorucchi?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t call me that.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> At any rate, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been<br> thinking about in regards to this world.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> As I recall, Master, you said there have been times when you visited other worlds in your dreams.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Do you still think that is what is happening here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Honestly, I&#39;m not sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And then there&#39;s Sei Shounagon,<br> who just showed up so suddenly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> What do you think could have summoned her here?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> If this world really is some sort of dream...<br> then whose dream could it be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Maybe yours?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Could it be...yours?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...No, Master.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Even if I did manage to obtain a Holy Grail,<br> I would never wish for a world like this.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;ve heard that Servants don&#39;t have dreams...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...and my own experiences would seem to bear that out, as I have not dreamed once since I materialized.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Ooh, what&#39;s going on here?<br> Whatcha guys talking about?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Think little old me can get in on this action!?<br> Wooo! It&#39;s talking time!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh my. Teehee, you&#39;re so silly, Nagiko.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But we&#39;re having a VERY important discussion here,<br> so would you mind leaving us alone?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hey, Chan-mas?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Why&#39;s Kaorucchi always giving me the cold shoulder?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good question.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I can tell you that. It&#39;s &#39;cause people like us are fundamentally different from people like you.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> (Does that mean he thinks he and<br> I are cut from the same cloth!?)</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Okay, okay, that&#39;s enough pointless chitchat.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost at the next district now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, it certainly looks peaceful here.</p><hr><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Mmm, the scent of flowers is in the air. And there&#39;s no sign of violence or bloodshed anywhere.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Still, something about this place feels off to me.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There don&#39;t seem to be any men around...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Which is odd, as I&#39;m quite certain we&#39;ve seen men as part of couples and families in the other districts.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Maybe...the happily fulfilled guys all spontaneously combusted or something?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Oh man, that would be amazing.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> ...I take it this is your first time in this district?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh, there&#39;s a guy!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, it is.<br> May I ask who you are?</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Just a moment there, Kaorucchi.<br> Let me do the talking.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t call me that.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Hey there, bro. From the looks of you,<br> I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re one of the lonelyhearts.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> Every man here is.<br> Not a single one of us has been able to get any chocolate.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> And it&#39;s all thanks to those new<br> things that are all the rage...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Ooh, opportunity alert! Those new things that are all the rage wouldn&#39;t happen to be...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong></p><h1 id="heroic\u2606boyfriends" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#heroic\u2606boyfriends" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Heroic\u2606Boyfriends</h1><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> ...would they?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You know about them, Obochin!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m already getting a really bad feeling about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve heard rumors about them. In fact...</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> I thought they were going to sell so well that I once came here to propose a collaboration with this district&#39;s admin.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> But she turned me down flat,<br> without so much as giving me the time of day.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Oh, look, over there.<br> All those women have them.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh, yes. I&#39;ve seen those before in<br> someone&#39;s room back at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I believe they&#39;re called, um...body pillows?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What!? Those are pillows!? Well now you got my attention. I&#39;m pretty picky about pillows since I literally wrote the book on them.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s see what these<br> so-called body pillows are like...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hmm... It looks like they&#39;re just large pillows<br> with illustrations of half naked men on them.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Er, yes, that&#39;s basically what they are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not exactly, but I think I&#39;ll just let it slide...</p><hr><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Pictures of those hot guys<br> are all the rage in this district right now!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Here, revived handsome heroes and historical figures from all ages gather as a story of the springtime of life unfolds at the local high school!</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> ...At least, that&#39;s the plot of the weekly comic featuring them. It&#39;s got a bunch of merchandise perfectly tuned to its audience&#39;s desires that&#39;s given away for free to promote it.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Up against a multimedia assault like that, the people of this district probably never stood a chance.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Is that really how it works?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. That&#39;s really how it works.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Er, that&#39;s not quite my point. Matters of taste aside, it feels like this is all being taken way too far.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say it is. Those hunky works of art have every woman<br> here completely under their spell.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> And there&#39;s no way we can compete with art.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> I mean, they&#39;re art, and we&#39;re<br> just regular guys, you know?</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why none of us have been able to get any chocolate anymore...</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong><br> (Sigh) Looks like it&#39;s going to be another year of third-class citizen life for all of us...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> This is horrible...

I&#39;m Yugao, the administrator in charge of this district!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> I&#39;m the hope of this very universe, here to free women and girls everywhere from the illusion that is real-life love!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> I am the guardian of the innocent, the light that banishes the darkness, friend to women everywhere, and enemy to you lonelyhearts!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Oh please, you&#39;re obviously one of us. I just want to know what the hell you&#39;re doing as an admin.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Wh-whaaaaaa!?</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Me, a lonelyheart!? I-I most certainly am not!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I read all of your Heroic\u2606Boyfriends<br> comics on the way here.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> About the shady elderly (student) gentleman who tried to ensnare the famous (student) detective in a cunning trap...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...only to find out that the famous (student) detective had been playing him the whole time.

And this? This is quality.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> You really need to be committed to draw a story this involved. You need the kind of tortured passion that lets you turn your back on everything else out there, so you can focus solely on your craft.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I see a lot of myself in you.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Nooooooooo!!!<br> I don&#39;t want to be like yooou!!!</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Now I get it.</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> ...No, wait, I don&#39;t.<br> Tell me what you&#39;re talking about, Beard-man.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Well, basically...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Yugao here wasn&#39;t intentionally trying to trap the men of this town in third-class citizen hell.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> That was just a side effect of her real goal:</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> To get every woman in town into the stuff she&#39;s into and stop them from forming relationships.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Which means...<br> It was the plan to eradicate all normies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. That sounds like Batty, all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Seriously, stop, Batty. Just stop already.</p><hr><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> (Sniff)...

Your bones will be the foundation on which I will build my dream world!</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> (Sniff) Guess this is it for my ambitions...</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> Heroic\u2606Boyfriends&#39;s serialization ends due to the author&#39;s sudden illness, huh? ...Guess that takes care of that.</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> Things should soon go back to normal here now that the supply has been cut off.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> That being said...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It must be hard for these women too, knowing that they&#39;re inadvertently responsible for these men winding up as third-class citizens.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> When you take that into consideration, providing entertainment doesn&#39;t seem like such a bad thing...</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Right!? Finally, someone who gets me!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Of course there&#39;s nothing wrong with being creative!<br> I&#39;m so glad you understand!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I guess there is still hope for you, since when all was said and done, you were putting up an honest fight...</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> ...but I don&#39;t know how many people here are going to remember Heroic\u2606Boyfriends now that they have their freedom back.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Gaaah!</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> Entertainment is meant to be enjoyed freely,<br> not as pure escapism.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> When you get right down to it, it&#39;s this city and its twisted rules that are the problem. I can&#39;t let things keep going on like this.</p><p><strong>Higekuro:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to do whatever it takes to get rid of Valentine&#39;s Day for good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That sounds cool in a vacuum, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Be that as it may...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...I also can&#39;t help but feel a bit sad at the thought of a story being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Come on, cheer up already!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Bwuh!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t look to me like you were cutting any corners. You really put your heart and soul into that comic, right?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And if I could tell that much, I&#39;m sure there are other people out there who could, too!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> D-do you...really think so?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Sure I do. And whoever those other people are,<br> they&#39;re not gonna forget about it anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> See what I mean?</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> W-well sure, I knew that.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes...you may be right.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The whole reason certain stories are remembered by future generations is because they were beloved to begin wi\u2013</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Wahaha, loosen up, Kaorucchi!<br> We don&#39;t need a research paper about it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> If you really, truly love something,<br> then it doesn&#39;t matter if you let it go.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> &#39;Cause it&#39;ll never be gone for good!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Nagiko...?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey, Nagiko?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you not enjoy writing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you not like writing anymore?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What made you keep writing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why&#39;d you stop writing?</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Whoa, Chan-mas, that&#39;s a lot of questions.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Wahaha, is this your way of saying you want to get to know me better?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> If that&#39;s what you want, we could always start dating.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> P-please, be serious for once!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> This is more important than anything!!!<br> Why did you\u2013</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Um...</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Since you&#39;re all talking about something else now,<br> I&#39;m just gonna head back home, okay?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh, yeah. We still need to figure out<br> what to do about you, don&#39;t we, Gatty?</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Gatty!? Where&#39;d that come from!?</p><p><strong>Aoi:</strong><br> You&#39;re not planning on taking her home with us,<br> are you?

We&#39;re both Japan-themed, so we&#39;re totally birds of a feather, right? We obviously have a lot in common!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I know you and I&#39;ll be great friends, Gatty!</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Are you nuts!?

Don&#39;t you mean hotcakes?</p><p><strong>Oboro:</strong><br> No, she means griddle cakes.</p><p><strong>Yugao:</strong><br> Wait.

You got me right in the feels.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> So the opportunity I got from being<br> fake was Valentine chocolate, huh?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I guess friendship chocolate, chocolate from your mom, and chocolate given out of obligation might not be the same as chocolate from your true love...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...but maybe it&#39;s also okay for them to convey feelings that are just as genuine as true love.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Maybe, even though I&#39;m fake...<br> my feelings can still be real.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hmm. You know...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> That was pretty sentimental of me just now,<br> wasn&#39;t it, Chan-mas?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Are you done?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Rokujou!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Are you still\u2013</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> How touching.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I think I threw up a little bit,<br> so thanks for that, but...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Did you really think that was going to change my mind?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> That I&#39;d be so convinced I was wrong I&#39;d just hand over my Holy Grail like it was no big deal?</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Well, if so, you were wrong. That&#39;s not happening.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> This resentment and anger are all I&#39;ve got.<br> This grudge is who I am.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> If all of it went away, I&#39;d probably disappear with it.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> So there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to let that happen.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> If I can&#39;t at least curse you<br> to death, Murasaki Shikibu...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> ...then there&#39;s no point in my even being here!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh no!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Rokujou&#39;s feelings are resonating with<br> the Holy Grail fragment! This is terrible!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> She&#39;s trying to destroy the entire dreamworld,<br> and us along with it!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Well, I can understand how she feels.<br> She is me, after all.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And believe me, I used to have plenty of anger myself.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> If I&#39;d held onto them...<br> I could&#39;ve easily ended up like her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> But, I&#39;m not gonna do that now.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Right now, I&#39;m more pumped up<br> than I&#39;ve ever been before.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And since you two are here to watch...I think I&#39;m<br> gonna show you just a bit of how badass I can really be!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Is this...Kyoto...?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be... Is this...<br> Did you create a Reality Marble!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What ultimately thawed my sad, frozen heart,<br> were my memories of more brilliant, colorful days...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, young people! Just be happy!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> What you smiled about yesterday will ease your sadness and lead you onward to days yet to come!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Paint over all of them, Pillow Book!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Emotional Engine\u2013Full Drive!!!</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Right.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I made it through the days.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I made a beautiful field of flowers in my mind, and I&#39;d retreat to it whenever life became unbearable.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I really am a pitiful, hopeless fool.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> But for me...the version of<br> me consumed by resentment...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> ...this scenery and feelings...are pure poison.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Rokujou...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> So come on, other Sei Shounagon.<br> Let&#39;s finish this properly.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I refuse to become a complete fool like you,<br> so I&#39;m going to end this here and now.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I&#39;ll curse you all to death...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> And when I&#39;m satisfied that I&#39;ve had my revenge...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll disappear along with you.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Fine by me!<br> Just don&#39;t expect me to pull my flying kicks!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Come on, you two, don&#39;t just stand there!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> This is really, truly the final battle!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> R-right! Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Come on, you two! Let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Does this mean I lost?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Yeah...I think it does.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> I see... You know, easy as it might&#39;ve been, nursing a grudge forever was a lot more boring than I thought.</p><p><strong>Rokujou:</strong><br> Would you believe it?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> The Holy Grail fragment... Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did they just stick themselves back together!?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Does this mean that...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...the Holy Grail is back to normal now?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I thought I left it behind,<br> but I guess it came back to me.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh well... Wouldn&#39;t be the first time that happened, right?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Okay, Chan-mas, here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Just like that!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> You both wanted this, right?<br> So you can have it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> But, if we take this back with us, then...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nagiko...</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Aah! What&#39;s going on!? It&#39;s freaking me out!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh, wait, never mind.<br> This just means I&#39;m getting sent to the Throne...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...and that everything that happened here is gonna be inscribed in my record...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Hmm... Well, that&#39;s kind of a shame.<br> I was having so much fun.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...Please, make sure you remember at least that much.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> After all, it wouldn&#39;t be fair if we were<br> the only ones to remember, would it?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Bahahaha!<br> That&#39;s a hell of a tall order there, Kaorucchi!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> But okay. I&#39;ll do my best to<br> somehow make myself hold onto it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised that&#39;s even an option...</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Nagiko...<br> No, Sei Shounagon...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There&#39;s one thing I always wanted to ask you<br> if I ever got the chance.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Did you...<br> D-did you, um...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> E-ever happen to read\u2013</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> \u201CThe Tale of Genji\u201D? Yup.<br> The whole thing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> As for my impressions...<br> It shined so damn bright it almost bummed me out.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It grabbed my heart and wouldn&#39;t let go,<br> but it always had a warm and familiar feeling to it, too...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> In fact, that might&#39;ve been the first time I stayed up all night to finish a book because I couldn&#39;t put it down.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I mean, I could never write anything<br> like that no matter how hard I tried.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> So getting to spend all this<br> time with its author, well...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> It made me really, really happy.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Ah...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I-I also, um...</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Oh, wait, hang on.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> I really hated Hikaru, though.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Would you just go already!?</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Wahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And of course, I can&#39;t forget you, Chan-mas!<br> Thanks for everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No problem.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See you again someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you remember?<br> I already promised I&#39;d come to see you again.</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> All right, you two, take care!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> And don&#39;t forget to say hi to all the others for me!</p><p><strong>Nagiko:</strong><br> Bye-byyye!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Sei Shounagon... A smug and conceited woman who<br> considers herself the gods&#39; gift to the world...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Even now that I&#39;ve met her,<br> I&#39;m still at a loss as to how to describe her.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> She certainly was...a lot, wasn&#39;t she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That she was. She was a lot of fun to be around, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, but I still had fun hanging out with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Yes, I...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I enjoyed myself, too.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Now that we&#39;ve collected the Holy Grail, it looks like my mind is losing its connection to this world.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I would have liked to have said goodbye to everyone else before leaving, but I suppose I won&#39;t get the chance now...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> ...<br> ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Master...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Now that this dreamworld has lost the Holy Grail that made it...is it going to simply disappear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just because we may not have the same dream again...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll disappear once we wake up.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> At least, I&#39;d like to think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> Hehe... Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to think so, too...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> All right, we should probably be on our way.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> And once we get back,<br> it&#39;s sure to be Valentine&#39;s Day at Chaldea, too!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> So...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Afterwards, we woke up in Chaldea<br> without so much as a scratch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Apparently, we were asleep for a whole week, but the others quickly accepted it as \u201Cmore of the usual dream nonsense.\u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It made me realize once again how much they&#39;ve all been around the block, as they say nowadays.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> And now, today is Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Women and men alike went in to visit Master while [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]<br> was still in bed, and it wasn&#39;t long at all before [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she]<br> had a veritable mountain of chocolate piled up in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her]<br> room.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I suppose it just goes to show that<br> what goes around, comes around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Oh yes, as for the jointly developed chocolate that was in the works, I&#39;m happy to report that the plans have since been scrapped.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Its creators were all disappointed, but I can&#39;t feel too bad for them. Something that dangerous should never have made it to market in the first place.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> As for me...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> It should be right around... Ah.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> There it is. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t read it in a very long time...<br> but I think I can make a special exception today.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong><br> In spring, it is the dawn that is most beautiful.<br> As the light creeps over the hills...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And there you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So yeah, that was another thing that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. Congratulations on another job well done, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, I have to say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It feels like it&#39;s become a sort of Valentine&#39;s Day tradition for something to go wrong, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m only sorry I wasn&#39;t able to help you out with this one. Anyway, this latest world revolved entirely around chocolate, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, knowing you, Senpai, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be able to get along just fine in a world like that, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t know about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I mean, I guess so...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can see that you&#39;ve already gotten lots and lots of chocolate from everyone else again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is it too late for me to give you some as well?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Or, maybe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...you&#39;re so sick of chocolate by now<br> you don&#39;t even want to look at any more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Coming from you, Mash...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;d be more than happy to accept!</p><hr><p></p>', 2260);
