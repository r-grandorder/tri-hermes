It seems you are not willing to come to me. I find that hard to understand. A heroic spirit like you must know how valuable it is to be chosen by me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Nonsense.

Be mine.</p><p>Let us enjoy our second lives in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I refuse.</p><p>I have no interest in such things, and most of all\u2015\u2015I do not want to live with you.&quot;</p><p>She does not nod or retreat.</p><p>Saber looks at Archer head on.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku\u2015\u2015fu, haha, hahahahahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p>He stops.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s so funny, but the man starts laughing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Great, that is what I expect from the woman I chose!</p><p>Yes, there must be at least one that will not obey me...!</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. Then I shall do so by force. After I obtain the Holy Grail, I shall pour the contents onto you.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Rejoice, Saber. You will not need your Master after that.</p><p>You will be taking in all the power of the omnipotent vessel. You shall not be a familiar to humans like the Servants.&quot;</p><hr><p>The man says so with satisfaction.</p><p>To that, Saber replies.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer. What is your intention?&quot;</p><p>She must have realized that fighting is the only way.</p><p>Saber asks for her enemy&#39;s reasons at the end.</p><p>\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>The man&#39;s answer is an unexpected one.</p><hr><p>&quot;Intention? I do not remember.

Oh, immortality. Heh, I gave that to the snake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015You gave immortality to a snake...?&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s presence freezes.</p><p>...What was that conversation?</p><p>Saber shakes her head and tries to deny the word.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015But this world is interesting.</p><p>The basic principles do not change, but the decorations are so elaborate that it seems different when it has come this far. In this case, it will not be too bad to reign over this world.</p><p>...Yes, I think that is my intent. If it will let me do that efficiently, the Holy Grail is not without use.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...The desire to rule? You are despicable, Archer. You seek the Holy Grail for such a purpose?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not seek it. Everything in this world is mine. I just do not like others using what is mine.</p><p>You too should hate having your holy sword used by strangers, king of knights.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Saber&#39;s body grows misty.</p><p>After a brief flash, Saber is wearing her silver armor.</p><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The man does not even move.</p><p>In the next instant, Saber dashes forward.</p><p>She runs up to the man instantly and slashes her invisible sword with deadly speed\u2015\u2015!</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Repelled, Saber jumps backward.</p><p>If Saber&#39;s armor is materialized from her magical energy, his armor must be the same as well.</p><p>In the short battle, the enemy has armed himself.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber looks calmly at Archer, holding her sword ready.</p><p>Even with her stare, the man does not stop smiling.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right. I shall allow you to oppose me, Saber.&quot;</p><p>The enemy happily announces the beginning of the battle.</p><hr><p>The white light runs through the darkness.</p><p>Saber, running up to the golden knight without hesitation, slashes her sword down surrounded by lightning\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>One blow, two, three, four\u2015\u2015!</p><p>Each time Saber&#39;s sword finds the enemy, blinding light is released.</p><p>Combinations like a strobe.</p><p>It&#39;s just like when I first saw Saber when she fought Lancer.</p><p>Saber drives magical energy into her sword and strikes with it like lightning.</p><hr><p>The sword and armor clash.</p><p>The man hasn&#39;t even drawn his weapon yet. With Saber&#39;s sword in front of him, he is just protecting his head with his hands.</p><p>That man does not have the skill to block Saber&#39;s sword.</p><p>Saber is much better than this man at sword techniques.</p><hr><p>And on top of that, Saber&#39;s sword is invisible.</p><p>Even if the man had a weapon, I don&#39;t think he would be able to block that invisible sword.</p><hr><p>The invisible sword keeps hitting the man&#39;s armor.</p><p>The sword smashes against the armor, shaves it, letting off lightning sparks.</p><p>All the man can do is to protect his head with his hands.</p><p>This isn&#39;t even a match.</p><p>This is just one-sided elimination.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015But.</p><p>Still, the golden armor retains its shape.</p><p>If the armor is free of damage even after taking Saber&#39;s attacks so many times...</p><p>...Could it be that his Noble Phantasm is his golden armor\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. I guess any more would be bad. You certainly do have a large supply of magical energy. My armor does not give out often, but\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>The enemy who was merely defending raises his arm.</p><p>Not toward Saber.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but the man raises his hand to the night sky, and\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Enough playing around. Offer me your body, right here.&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015Is it an illusion?</p><p>In his hand.</p><p>A shortsword like a key is in his hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber attacks with all her power.</p><p>But...</p><p>...The enemy repels it with his dark red sword.</p><hr><p>&quot;...! \u2015\u2015That is a Noble Phantasm bearing a curse of vengeance\u2015\u2015!?&quot;</p><p>Saber distances herself and glares at the sword in her enemy&#39;s hand.</p><p>...The fact that the enemy has revealed his weapon is a threat.</p><p>But at the same time, it means that the enemy&#39;s attacks are revealed.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if his Noble Phantasm is a sword or armor. As long as you can see it, you&#39;re able to deal with it.</p><hr><p>Saber readies herself.</p><p>...As the man said, his armor is at its limit.</p><p>If Saber relaunches her fierce barrage of attacks, she should be able to slash him through his armor.</p><p>Even if he has brought out his Noble Phantasm, it won&#39;t make a difference to the fact that the next blow will decide the match.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015This is it. Let us decide the match we could not finish before, Archer.&quot;</p><p>The sword in her hand is still invisible.</p><p>Readying the holy sword sealed in wind, Saber stares at her enemy.</p><p>...It seems Saber knows what that Noble Phantasm is.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why she intentionally distanced herself. And since she knows how to deal with it, she&#39;s confronting the enemy straight on.</p><p>If their Noble Phantasms are swords and if the swords&#39; abilities are equal, the deciding factor will be their own sword techniques.</p><p>By that theory, Saber has to win.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right\u2015\u2015then come at me.</p><p>In deference to your sword, I shall show you everything I have.&quot;</p><p>The man laughs.</p><p>&quot;Fine\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber charges without hesitation.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Saber&#39;s sword will slash his armor for sure.</p><p>The instant I think that.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Gate of Babylon.&quot;</p><hr><p>An invisible &quot;door&quot; opens behind the man.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh\u2015\u2015at...!?&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s body stops.</p><p>The weapons the enemy takes are different from the previous dark red sword.</p><p>The first is an invisible sword like Saber&#39;s.</p><p>As soon as Saber defends against it, the man is holding yet another sword.</p><hr><p>This sword is of ice.</p><p>She twists her body to avoid it, but the space the sword goes through freezes.</p><p>Saber retreats, covered in ice.</p><p>As the ice starts to break, the enemy holds a sickle-like weapon.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>She instantly tries to block the weapon approaching her neck with her gauntlet.</p><p>But it&#39;s useless.</p><p>The sickle goes through her arm like the gauntlet isn&#39;t there and takes away her magical energy.</p><p>...As if cutting away her bone and not her flesh or blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015kuh...!&quot;</p><p>Saber totters, but manages to stay standing.</p><p>...It is a different kind of retreat now.</p><p>Not to distance herself and prepare for the next attack.</p><p>It&#39;s a desperate retreat, just to get away from the enemy\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;That is\u2015\u2015impossible.&quot;</p><p>Saber glares at the enemy, drawing magical energy into her arm.</p><p>...Many handles are floating around the man.</p><p>That&#39;s what slaughtered Caster,</p><p>...And those are the Noble Phantasms of the golden knight who cornered Saber.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a scene that makes even me want to doubt my own eyes.</p><hr><p>Those handles floating behind him are surely those of Noble Phantasms.</p><p>Not just ten or twenty.</p><p>No, even though I can&#39;t see them, I can feel that they are infinite.</p><p>From all times and places.</p><p>As if to say, that Servant has all the divine mysteries from every legend\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer. Who are you?&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s voice is trembling.</p><p>A Servant will not answer when asked their true identity.</p><p>But the enemy&#39;s Noble Phantasm is so strange that Saber has to ask.</p><hr><p>&quot;Answer me, Archer...! A heroic spirit can only have one Noble Phantasm. No, some have more, but two should be the limit.</p><p>\u2015\u2015A heroic spirit with infinite Noble Phantasms cannot exist...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Cannot exist...? You are jumping to conclusions, Saber.</p><p>Heroic spirits&#39; Noble Phantasms are the weapons they had when they were alive. So this is a simple story. All these Noble Phantasms are things I collected while I was alive.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Are you insulting me, Archer? That is even more impossible.</p><p>No matter who you are, it would be impossible for you to collect all the Noble Phantasms, the symbols of other heroic spirits. No such heroic spirit exists.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber is right.</p><p>All the Noble Phantasms he has are real.</p><p>There are demonic swords from Northern Europe, and demonic swords from South America.</p><p>No hero made his name in so many different places. And first of all, only Lancer has Gae Bolg.</p><hr><p>Heroic spirits&#39; Noble Phantasms are the weapons they had when they were alive.</p><p>By that rule, as soon as he has Gae Bolg, he has to be Cu Chulainn.</p><hr><p>But he isn&#39;t Cu Chulainn.</p><p>So that lance cannot be Gae Bolg. But the thing is, that is definitely the real Gae Bolg.</p><p>This could be all explained if it was a fake. But as long as it&#39;s real, this contradiction is.... No, hold on.</p><p>Original\u2015\u2015the model of weapon......?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015It can&#39;t be. But, wait...&quot;</p><p>It is possible.</p><p>Myths and legends do not start from nothing.</p><p>All myths have common points because a single foundation became their model.</p><p>Because legends that become objects of faith are only those that originate in that land. I think demonic swords and holy swords start having special abilities around that time.</p><hr><p>So, before that.</p><p>What if the Noble Phantasms in myths and legends had a form before they were given names\u2015\u2015?</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. It seems your Master is not so bad after all. It seems he has a hunch about my true identity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber looks towards me.</p><p>...So far away.</p><p>I can&#39;t even help her if she&#39;s so far away.</p><p>My body has only recovered to the point where I can barely move my fingers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Run... Saber\u2015\u2015his... Noble Phantasm is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Real, right?</p><p>Yes, it is really simple, Saber.</p><p>Let me tell you about the most ancient time, when the world was still one.</p><p>That kingdom flourished, and the king collected every treasure in the world.</p><p>There was nothing he could not collect, and he lacked nothing.</p><p>The king had a perfect treasury, and the masses of weapons in there were never used, but instead went to sleep with the king.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015The story is that simple.</p><p>After the king&#39;s death, the contents of the treasury room spread all over the world. They were valued because they were splendid swords, and they eventually became Noble Phantasms.</p><p>...Do you understand, king of knights?</p><p>The Noble Phantasms you use are just the king&#39;s possessions.&quot;</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s like inheritance.</p><p>If you go back far enough, a &quot;model&quot; must exist.</p><p>So it is only natural for every legend, myth, folklore, and Noble Phantasm to have an original model.</p><p>And\u2015\u2015in the distant past, if it was possible to collect all of their models, then one could possess all of the Noble Phantasms.</p><hr><p>Only one hero could correspond to that.</p><p>One with origins in a legend far older than that of King Arthur or Hercules.</p><p>One said to rule over ancient Mesopotamia.</p><p>The half-god, half-human king who collected treasures as he wished and sought immortality at the end. His name was\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Gilgamesh\u2015\u2015mankind&#39;s oldest king of heroes\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber sounds shocked.</p><p>The golden knight\u2015\u2015Gilgamesh accepts the shock with satisfaction.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Indeed. I am the strongest heroic spirit. You shall be no match.&quot;</p><hr><p>And the golden knight moves forward.</p><p>\u2015\u2015There&#39;s nothing else to talk about.</p><p>All that remains is for him to use his many Noble Phantasms to defeat his enemy.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh? You would still oppose me even after you know my name? You must know you have no chance of winning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I do not know unless I try.</p><p>Even the king of heroes must have something he cannot surpass.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s surroundings waver.</p><p>The wind starts to twirl and becomes a raging gale to protect her.</p><p>At the same time, the golden sword appears.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No, Saber...&quot;</p><p>...It can&#39;t be.</p><p>Saber&#39;s going to use the Excalibur here...!?</p><hr><p>Gilgamesh stops.</p><p>He too must know the holy sword&#39;s power as his composure vanishes.</p><p>Saber keeps staring at Gilgamesh and looks in my direction for an instant.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Is she telling me to run?</p><p>Gilgamesh has his back to the river.</p><p>And Saber is over here.</p><p>It must have been when she attacked him earlier.</p><p>Before I realize it, Saber is confronting Gilgamesh to protect me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015No. You can&#39;t use it here\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I pour strength into my limbs.</p><p>Even if I try to move my numb body, all I can move is one of my arms.</p><p>But I still collect all the magical energy in my body to raise my body with that one arm.</p><hr><p>&quot;Guh\u2015\u2015damn it\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My senses were gone, but every bone in my body starts to scream once I start moving.</p><p>The pain is a warning.</p><p>The pain is telling me I will break if I move any further.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015! ...!&quot;</p><p>I ignore it and raise my body up.</p><p>&quot;Ah\u2015\u2015haa, ha\u2015\u2015ah...!&quot;</p><p>I bear my pain.</p><p>I don&#39;t have time to deal with it.</p><p>I have to get up quickly and protect Saber.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Because I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p>A premonition I felt when I faced that enemy.</p><p>She will never be able to beat him.</p><p>The instinctive feeling that I should never let Saber fight him won&#39;t go away\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Humph. A holy sword, huh? Fine.&quot;</p><p>The twirling wind is now a raging storm.</p><p>Even with the holy sword shining in front of him, the golden knight does not back away.</p><hr><p>Moreover...</p><p>&quot;Then, I shall use a weapon appropriate against it.&quot;</p><p>He pulls an incongruous &#39;sword&#39; from the gate behind him.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015That&#39;s the cause of my bad feeling.</p><p>That sword does not appear in any legend.</p><p>I could identify every one of the Noble Phantasms that were floating behind him. But even I cannot tell what that sword is.</p><hr><p>&quot;I have the original models of all the Noble Phantasms. But they are all nameless, and I am not their only possessor.&quot;</p><p>A cylindrical sword.</p><p>The sword is made of three parts, and each part is turning slowly in different directions.</p><p>It looks like a rock drill to pierce through a hard surface.</p><hr><p>&quot;But this is different.

It is only natural for your body to heal.&quot;</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t stay conscious.</p><p>It&#39;s because I produced too much magical energy. My tired mind wants to sleep right now.</p><hr><p>...How strong is she?</p><p>Saber wraps her arms around me and holds me tight.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I finally understand. You were my sheath, Shirou...&quot;</p><p>...She says so in a deep, seeping voice.</p><p>The feeling is so comfortable that my remaining consciousness fades away.</p><p>I&#39;m glad to be saved and I let my body sleep.</p><hr><p>...But before that.</p><p>I complain to myself that it would have been more perfect if our positions were reversed\u2015\u2015</p><hr><h2 id="scene-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06</h2><p>\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>Before I realize it, it&#39;s morning already.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m useless. I couldn&#39;t get any sleep at all.&quot;</p><p>I stop the alarm clock with a sigh.</p><p>Today is my date with Saber, no matter what she says.</p><p>I&#39;m going to go take her to places she hasn&#39;t been and play around, and the most important thing is for her to enjoy herself.</p><p>I was trying to use the knowledge I don&#39;t have to come up with a plan for the day, but the alarm clock went off before I noticed the time.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I set the alarm clock, just in case.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t come up with any good plans last night, so I borrowed it from Tohsaka thinking I might take a long time to come up with a plan.</p><p>I used it going against my principles, but it was useless in the end.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come to think of it, I&#39;ve never gone on a date before.&quot;</p><p>I sigh again.</p><p>That&#39;s the problem.</p><p>Even more shocking than the fact that I couldn&#39;t get any sleep is the fact that I couldn&#39;t come up with any plan that might make a girl happy, even though I thought about it all night.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Fine. I&#39;ll leave this to luck. I&#39;ll take her everywhere and make her realize what it means to have fun...!&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber is a girl.</p><p>If we go to cute-looking stores, she&#39;s bound to have fun.</p><p>Well, I think the plan has some weak points, but I&#39;ve made up my mind so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p>It&#39;s not like I have any other ideas, so I&#39;m going to entertain her today until she gives up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Then Illyasviel has not woken up yet?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Nope, she&#39;s still asleep. It looks like it&#39;ll take her a bit longer to wake up, but I guess that&#39;s good luck today.</p><p>If she were awake, she&#39;d be following Shirou around and bothering him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. We cannot have her continue to accompany Shirou as she has been.</p><p>It ended like that last night, but we are going to start seriously searching for the remaining Master today. Shirou cannot be concerned with Illyasviel.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not what I meant, but... oh well.</p><p>It won&#39;t do any good if I tell you, and this is yours and Shirou&#39;s problem.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka tries to hide her laughter.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? A problem for me and Shirou...?&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s expression questions me.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>We&#39;re done eating breakfast, so this is a good time.</p><p>Saber is ready to go and search for Masters, but I have willpower as well.</p><p>I just need to come out with it like a man.</p><hr><p>&quot;About that, Saber.</p><p>We&#39;ll be going into the neighboring town today. So if you need to get ready, do so now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Looking for the Master? In that case, I would have thought the suburbs would be a better choice than the neighboring town\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. We&#39;re going to go hang out, so there&#39;s no point in going to the suburbs.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Saber freezes.</p><p>...I&#39;ll really have to get back at the person behind her who&#39;s trying not to laugh.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Shirou... what do you mean by that? You are not going to go hang out with Rin, but, um...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m going, so who else but you will come with me? Tohsaka has nothing to do with this since she&#39;ll be staying here to take care of Illya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015How ridiculous. We would not accomplish much even if we did search the neighboring town. Doing such a thing is meaningless. What are you trying to do?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber complains directly.</p><p>...This is what I expected, but the future looks troublesome as she still thinks we&#39;re going to town to look for the Master even after I told her clearly.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez. You don&#39;t understand when I put it this clearly? In other words, I&#39;m saying let&#39;s go on a date. How about it?&quot;</p><hr><p>I ask, ignoring Tohsaka&#39;s stare.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how much she understands.</p><p>&quot;I do not understand what you are saying. Can you give me a concrete description?&quot;</p><p>She asks, even less happily.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>That flips a switch within me.</p><p>...It seems like caring for her has the opposite effect when it comes to things like this.</p><p>It seems it would be to both our benefits to state it clearly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. I will obey if you want to go into town, but please explain to me what you mean by going to this &#39;date&#39;.</p><p>Even though I am familiar with this age, there are words I still do not understand. Please do not use technical vocabulary.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not a technical vocabulary.</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you since you don&#39;t know. Going on a date means going out to play with a girl.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><p>Saber freezes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? A girl... you mean, me...?&quot;</p><p>She murmurs, still astonished.</p><p>When I nod, Saber frowns even more unhappily.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I understand the meaning of the word, but I do not understand your intent. What is the reasoning behind such a thing?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Hm.&quot;</p><p>Her reaction is unexpected.</p><p>The intention of a date is obvious, but I&#39;m a bit hesitant to tell Saber straight on\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez. She&#39;s misunderstanding because of the words you&#39;re using. Don&#39;t use the word date, explain it to her in simpler terms.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka interrupts as if unable to ignore us.</p><hr><p>&quot;Look, Saber. A date is basically a rendezvous.</p><p>Shirou says he&#39;s going to play, but it&#39;s a chance for a man to appeal to a woman he likes.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I cough.</p><p>Tohsaka is right, but I think a date and a rendezvous are vastly different.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...But I shouldn&#39;t interrupt.</p><p>It seems Saber finally understands what a date is.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That&#39;s right, Saber.</p><p>We&#39;re not going to fight today, but we&#39;re going to go into town instead. After all, we won&#39;t be able to fight during the daytime since there are a lot of people around. So, we should be able to do whatever we want right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That is true, but... this is too meaningless. There is no benefit for you in doing this.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. Even if it were, I wouldn&#39;t mind.</p><p>I&#39;ve already decided to spend today for you, so don&#39;t worry about me.</p><p>Anyways, we&#39;re going into town today. I won&#39;t change my mind no matter what.&quot;</p><p>I stare straight on at Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>After thinking with a serious face for a while...</p><p>&quot;...Then will you go into town by yourself even if I do not go?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m definitely going. Or the stuff I thought about all night will go to waste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then I will have to go with you. As a Servant, I cannot leave my Master alone.&quot;</p><hr><p>With a deep sigh, Saber answers in her usual manner.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I get really angry about her following me because she&#39;s my Servant.</p><p>But I managed to succeed in getting Saber out.</p><p>So I just have to take Saber to places without thinking too much about it\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;See ya. Bring me back something.&quot;</p><p>I gesture to Tohsaka to go to hell as she makes fun of me right to the end, and we go outside.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>What are we going to do exactly, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll go the neighboring town. There&#39;s a bus from the intersection, so let&#39;s take that.&quot;</p><hr><p>The road is awfully quiet.</p><p>It&#39;s past nine on a weekday. The town is starting to come alive, but it must be a bit too early for people to start going anywhere.</p><p>There&#39;s no one out on the road, and it&#39;s like we have the place to ourselves.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Come to think of it, I&#39;m starting to feel no resistance to skipping school. I&#39;ve been at home all the time recently.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. You are a Master, so it would be strange for you to be out walking.&quot;</p><hr><p>She replies sharply.</p><p>...She&#39;s walking behind me as usual, but it feels different today.</p><p>To put it nicely, I feel pressure from behind me.</p><p>Anyways, Saber is going to be harder to handle today.</p><hr><p>We get on the bus.</p><p>It would have been full of people an hour ago, but there aren&#39;t many people using it at this time.</p><p>The only people on the bus are an old lady and a kid, so it&#39;s like we have this place to ourselves.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s sit at the back, Saber.&quot;</p><p>I call out to Saber, about to sit right at the front, and sit at the back end of the bus.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber watches the passing scenery silently.</p><hr><p>...Looking at her, I realize how crazy I&#39;m being right now.</p><p>The bus to the neighboring town is ordinary for me.</p><p>But in this ordinary thing, there is something extraordinary.</p><hr><p>...Well, in short...</p><p>To be honest, my mind starts to twist like a Rubik&#39;s cube realizing we&#39;re about to go on a date.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>\u2015\u2015Oh.</p><p>Crap, I&#39;m getting really nervous.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath, trying not to let Saber notice.</p><p>And I know I shouldn&#39;t, but I sneak one more glance at Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>My heart jumps.</p><p>...The Saber sitting next to me is a Saber I don&#39;t know.</p><p>No, Saber herself is the same. All that&#39;s changed is the place.</p><hr><p>But still.</p><p>Just that makes me realize she is &#39;different&#39;.</p><p>Something I didn&#39;t notice back at my place.</p><p>This ordinary scene seems like a different world just because it has Saber in it.</p><hr><p>Her hair is like golden silk, and her green eyes are so beautiful that their mere presence is overwhelming.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t much to compare her against up to now, so I forgot about it.</p><hr><p>...I remember the time I first met Saber.</p><p>I was probably avoiding her because I was embarrassed about being fascinated by her.</p><p>No matter what Saber says, she is a girl before she is a swordsman for me.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know how to approach her and didn&#39;t realize my feelings for her.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It seems I got the order wrong.</p><p>I was finally able to believe in Saber with everything I have, and then I decided to go on a date with her.</p><p>Just those two are in the wrong order. And I finally realize when our day is about to begin, just how big a deal it is to go on a date with a girl you like.</p><hr><p>But so what?</p><p>I can only do my best, so I can&#39;t back out now.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I calm myself and shake off my weak spirits.</p><p>The bus has crossed the bridge and it&#39;s going into the developing area where the buildings are.</p><p>I breathe out and prepare myself.</p><p>The announcer I&#39;m so used to hearing announces the next stop, Shinto station.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-07" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 07</h2><p>We do the same thing in the afternoon.</p><p>I go to every place I can think of, and Saber follows me silently.</p><p>But it&#39;s not as painful as it was in the morning.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m getting used to it or whether Saber is complying.</p><p>Saber still isn&#39;t talkative, but if I look closely, her expression isn&#39;t like it is when she&#39;s mad.</p><p>There&#39;s a feeling of accomplishment and happiness when I see Saber leave a shop with light steps.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015So.</p><p>Considering many factors that might make Saber happy from many angles...</p><hr><p>I&#39;m a bit dubious, but I&#39;ve determined that this shop will be the best suited for Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber stands there dumbfounded.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if her shoulders are shaking because she&#39;s angry or because she&#39;s deeply moved.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shirou, this is...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The biggest stuffed animal shop in town. I&#39;ve never been here before since men aren&#39;t allowed in.&quot;</p><hr><p>Of course, there&#39;s actually not a rule like that.</p><p>But since there&#39;re only women and no men, it&#39;s like an unwritten rule.</p><p>To prove it, there are only girls in here.</p><hr><p>The golden-haired Saber is being stared at, but being a guy, I&#39;m being glared at.</p><p>I&#39;m sure they want to tell me not to come into their sanctuary.</p><p>...I feel the same way.</p><p>I would not approve of men entering this place.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let&#39;s ignore everyone and look around since we&#39;re here. Saber, is there an animal you like?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... um, I feel that lions and panthers are lovely, but... is that strange?&quot;</p><p>She asks me with upturned eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I look away instantly and contain my laughter.</p><p>The funny thing is, Saber is strange for thinking she&#39;s strange for thinking lions are cute.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou, that gesture was unnatural. I feel unreasonable anger, but perhaps it is just my imagination?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, sorry. Liking lions is so like you, so I had to laugh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! How dare you laugh at other people&#39;s preferences!? There is nothing wrong with lions!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll take you somewhere good as an apology, so don&#39;t get mad.&quot;</p><hr><p>I go into the store while trying to hold my laughter.</p><p>Well, it looks like the stuffed animals are that way.</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>It&#39;s taken about an hour to go around the store.</p><p>I looked at Saber staring at stuffed animals and felt really nervous with all the girls there. Anyways, it was the most tiring hour so far.</p><hr><p>But the worst part is, we&#39;ve only looked through half the store.</p><p>It took us this long to look at just half of it because Saber was frequently paralyzed... I mean, Saber kept staring down stuffed animals.</p><p>It looks like Saber is interested in the other half too, so I&#39;ll have to accompany her...</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...? Why are you sighing? Are you tired from walking...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...? Yeah, I&#39;m a bit tired. I&#39;m usually not so weak, but this place is special. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be doing things I&#39;m not accustomed to.&quot;</p><hr><p>I let out a big sigh.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind being looked at by other people while walking with Saber, but a girls-only place like this is really uncomfortable.</p><p>Boredom sometimes tires one&#39;s body.</p><hr><p>&quot;How about you? This must be your first time in a place like this. Tell me if you&#39;re tired.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I certainly do not feel calm, but you look more uncomfortable. Not just here, but you seemed this way in the previous store and the store before that.</p><p>...I do not want to think this, but are you choosing places you do not wish to go to?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>For me...</p><p>Saber&#39;s words are enough to cast away my worries.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. To be honest, I&#39;m choosing places I don&#39;t like.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...As I thought. Why do you continue to choose places you are unfamiliar with? You will...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, because these kinds of places are suitable for girls.</p><p>I&#39;m the one that started this whole thing and today&#39;s your day as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&quot;And it&#39;s not that uncomfortable either. It&#39;s fine since you&#39;re with me. I have such a cute girl with me, so people might get jealous, but I&#39;ll never be out of place.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;H-How ridiculous. I am a Servant even though I am not armed. You do not need to treat me as a woman just because we are not fighting. Please treat me as a Servant as usual.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re the ridiculous one. You&#39;re a girl to begin with. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m treating you differently today. Am I acting any differently?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>In astonishment,</p><p>Saber opens her mouth as if she&#39;s just realized that.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you are the same.</p><p>You are acting the same as always, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. So you don&#39;t need to worry about me.</p><p>So let&#39;s go. We&#39;re going to buy the one you like the most, so we have to go look at the remaining half.&quot;</p><hr><p>I take Saber&#39;s hand.</p><p>Saber silently follows me.</p><p>&quot;...That is right. It has been like this from the start, but I did not realize it until this moment...&quot;</p><p>She murmurs to herself.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08</h2><p>It&#39;s still nine in the morning, but the area in front of the station is crowded.</p><hr><p>Most shops open at ten, but cafes and bookstores are already open.</p><p>There are already many more people than there were at Miyama City, and this place is as crowded as it is on weekends.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Getting off the bus, Saber looks around unhappily.</p><p>...It&#39;s only natural.</p><p>Saber was against this date and people passing by are looking at her curiously.</p><p>She must not feel too good about that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ugh. Come to think of it, this was bound to happen if I brought Saber here in the morning.&quot;</p><p>But that&#39;s going to follow us around for the whole day.</p><p>If there&#39;s a way to calm it down, it&#39;s to make Saber have so much fun that she forgets about the people staring at her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015All right.&quot;</p><p>I pound a fist and turn to Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. I&#39;ll ask you first. Is there any place you want to go? We&#39;ve come all the way here, so we should at least do whatever we want today.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not know. I have no place that interests me. Before even that, I have no knowledge on which to base such a decision.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? ...That&#39;s too bad. Then I guess it&#39;s really up to luck. The future looks bad if you don&#39;t have anywhere you want to go and I don&#39;t have any idea where to go.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t want to ask this, but you do not have a plan, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Well, I have a few, but no details. Let&#39;s just go to random stores.&quot;</p><hr><p>Well, that&#39;s still difficult.</p><p>I know places where I won&#39;t get bored, but I can&#39;t even imagine where a girl would be happy to go to.</p><p>...Geez, if it&#39;s going to end up like this, I wish I&#39;d gone out with a girl just once....</p><hr><p>&quot;...Honestly. Please do not take offence, but there is something wrong with you. Your plan to take a rest is fine, but how can you not even have a plan for that rest?&quot;</p><hr><p>Oh, Saber enters her scolding mode.</p><p>...This is the first time she&#39;s started to complain about something outside of the dojo.</p><p>I knew she was irritated not being up for this and being looked at by curious eyes, but I didn&#39;t think she was this irritated.</p><hr><p>&quot;I have always wanted to object to your lack of planning. You are closely aware of everyone around you, but you treat yourself too carelessly.</p><p>As a result, you yourself have to pay the price for this discrepancy.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Are you listening to me, Shirou!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I am. So basically, you&#39;re not happy about being here right now, right?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s natural you wouldn&#39;t like it since it&#39;s pretty obvious it&#39;s going to be boring going anywhere with me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015um, it is not that, but I\u2015\u2015I am saying, now is not the time to be doing such things.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know that too. But I won&#39;t listen since I&#39;ve already decided to have you accompany me today.</p><p>I won&#39;t change my mind no matter what.&quot;</p><p>I look at Saber.</p><p>Saber just looks back at me in shock.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015But I&#39;ll listen if you have something to say.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you have complaints, so tell me them right now. I won&#39;t have to worry about making you unhappy if you do so.</p><p>If you say you don&#39;t want to go on a date, I&#39;ll think of something else.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Um... no, I do not think you need to go that far... I, um....&quot;</p><p>Saber averts her gaze and runs out of words.</p><hr><p>&quot;You have no complaints? Then let&#39;s go.</p><p>You have no requests, so don&#39;t get mad at me wherever we go.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m considering an ordinary place like an aquarium.</p><p>I decide and grab Saber&#39;s hand.</p><hr><p>&quot;H-Hey, Shirou! I-I have no complaints, but there is no need to hold my hand!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...? I don&#39;t want to waste time, so we&#39;ll be running for a while. I&#39;ll show you the way, so follow me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... no, I cannot do so in a situation like this...!&quot;</p><p>I start to run without waiting for Saber&#39;s reply.</p><p>Since I&#39;ve talked big to Saber, I can&#39;t act miserable now.</p><p>I just have to take her to every possible place I can think of.</p><hr><p>I run, holding Saber&#39;s hand.</p><p>She must have accepted it as Saber finally stops complaining and follows me quietly.</p><hr><p>Well, it&#39;s before ten o&#39;clock.</p><p>I&#39;ll make the two hours before lunchtime worthwhile and surprise her\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>To summarize, the two hours went by like a storm.</p><hr><p>We went to a boutique I usually don&#39;t go to, and we played bowling while I taught her the rules.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t find an aquarium, but we fed some birds in a park.</p><p>We also went to an antique store, and I still think it was best not to go to the movie theater.</p><p>Anyways, I kept taking her to places a girl might like for the past two hours and there were many results: honorable defeats and total defeats.</p><hr><p>...But I don&#39;t think this is what people would call a date.</p><p>This is more like a contest, a fight to the death where the first one to give up loses.</p><hr><p>Saber is the same as usual no matter where I take her, and she sometimes goes so quiet that I seriously start wondering if she&#39;s really mad.</p><p>She gives no reaction, so I became desperate to make her happy at the next place I take her to.</p><hr><p>As a result, I became obstinate about making Saber smile and ran around different places all morning. But it&#39;s already noon without much success.</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>As Saber reminded me it&#39;s time for lunch, I decided to take a short break, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;...What is this place?&quot;</p><p>I complain once we&#39;re seated at a table.</p><hr><p>&quot;I recommend the restaurant by the river if you&#39;re going to have lunch.&quot;</p><p>That was the only advice Tohsaka gave me last night.</p><p>I trusted her and chose this place, but I never thought it would be so fastidious.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I look at the menu.</p><p>Fortunately, the menu has a version in Japanese as well, so I have no problems reading it.</p><p>But the trouble is, I can&#39;t understand what kind of food it is from the name and the prices are outrageous.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Am I on Mars? I seriously don&#39;t know what I should order....&quot;</p><p>I groan, looking at the menu.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...? Did we not come by here to eat lunch?&quot;</p><p>I hear a rather frail voice from the other side of the table.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s too different from what I&#39;m used to...&quot;</p><hr><p>I raise my head.</p><p>And then.</p><p>There is Saber, with an expression like a cornered rabbit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If this place is not suitable for lunch, let us return to the mansion. I prefer the food you prepare, Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... you mean, you want to go home?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I do not want to go back home, but, um... today has been really exhausting, so I am more tired than usual.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Really? ...I see, I thought about going out into town again after eating, but... if you&#39;re tired, we can rest here for a while.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that is not what I meant! Tired was not the word I meant. Um, it should have been...&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber stops.</p><p>The small gurgling sound was fortunately small enough that only I could hear.</p><p>...Oh. If she was hungry, she could&#39;ve just told me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Excuse me. So in other words, I am saying it would be helpful for us to have lunch quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Roger. Yeah, it&#39;s no fun, but let&#39;s order something safe and get our food quickly.&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s simple if all we want are light snacks.</p><p>I order two things from the lunch menu and decide to eat quickly.</p><hr><p>I consider what to do in the afternoon while drinking the after-meal coffee.</p><p>What I learned this morning is that anything physical is not good.</p><hr><p>Saber gets serious when it comes to contests.</p><p>That&#39;s good for me, but it makes Saber stand out even more.</p><p>After we finished a game, Saber got angry because she caught all the attention she wanted to avoid.</p><hr><p>&quot;So we should avoid anywhere that involves moving around...</p><p>Hey, Saber? I&#39;m asking for the second time, but is there anywhere you want to go?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Me? No, there is not. I cannot tell, so I will leave it up to you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so, Saber lifts her teacup.</p><p>Saber ordered English tea and it seems she really likes the taste.</p><p>We don&#39;t have much English tea at my place, and even if we did, it&#39;s all instant tea-bags.</p><p>It seems Saber was a bit dissatisfied with the drinks at my house as she seems to like English tea.</p><p>I should put that into consideration starting tonight.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber is sitting there and drinking tea.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t seem happy or bored.</p><hr><p>If I had to use one word to describe her, it&#39;d be that she looks natural.</p><p>She drinks her tea, sitting up straight in the shadows of the streaming sunlight.</p><p>Even though this is the first time I&#39;ve seen such a thing, it doesn&#39;t seem strange. It feels like I&#39;ve seen such a scene before.</p><p>...Why do I feel that?</p><p>The Saber I know is a tense girl, who&#39;s always holding a sword and fighting.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh, I see.&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s only natural.</p><p>I also know her attitude after she lets go of her sword.</p><p>Once she stops fighting, Saber has always been calm and gentle.</p><hr><p>This scene looks natural rather than new because this is her true nature.</p><p>No matter how superior she is as a swordsman, it is natural for Saber to be like this.</p><p>Rather, it&#39;s abnormal for her to hold a sword at all.</p><hr><p>...I once thought in my dream that she wasn&#39;t suited for fighting.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong.</p><p>No matter how superior her technique or no matter how many battles she&#39;s experienced...</p><p>As long as she is who she is, it can&#39;t have been a comfortable place to be.</p><hr><p>...So this is natural.</p><p>Saber is resting, not holding a sword.</p><p>This calm scene is the way she should be.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-09" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 09</h2><p>The unusual day goes by quickly.</p><p>Saber never laughed nor could I laugh from my heart.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not like there was any memorable moments nor were it so boring that I regret doing it.</p><p>To be frank, this was nothing.</p><p>Saber might have been happier if we&#39;d stayed at the mansion and trained together.</p><hr><p>But today wasn&#39;t bad.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t fun or boring, but I can be proud of it in the end.</p><p>...After the battle is over and everything goes back to normal...</p><p>It would be too sad if all the time Saber and I had was spent fighting.</p><hr><p>Even if it&#39;s something stupid, she has to spend some time not fighting, or there&#39;s no point in her being here.</p><p>So I can be proud of myself for now.</p><p>...The end is near.</p><p>When everything comes to an end and when there&#39;s no more need to fight...</p><p>If Saber will remember this moment and remember that this happened, that alone is enough for me to be proud of.</p><hr><p>We go home on foot.</p><p>Because Saber said,</p><p>&quot;Let us walk home.&quot;</p><p>...Just as I decided to go home by bus.</p><hr><p>There&#39;s some wind now.</p><p>The vivid setting sun is lighting the bridge red.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh.&quot;</p><p>Saber notices something and stops.</p><p>She is watching a mountain of rubble.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s not that tall even though it&#39;s a &#39;mountain&#39; of rubble.</p><p>Steel frames and the likes are piled right up to the water surface and are slightly distorting the flow of the river.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but it seems like a ship sank or something, and pieces of it flowed into a mountain.</p><p>I heard the local residents have been demanding its removal for a long time since it damages the beautiful sight.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? What&#39;s wrong, Saber? Did that catch your attention?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I was noticing that it still remains because I was the cause of it. I used the Noble Phantasm here, having fought on water in the previous war.</p><p>The only damage was that the river dried up, but I also destroyed the ship that was unfortunately anchored there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh\u2015\u2015? You mean Excalibur!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes. But fortunately, nobody was on board and the damage was minimal. The river is back to normal, so you should not get so mad.</p><p>&quot;...I regret it as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...I should watch out.</p><p>I have to take care to only use Excalibur in an open place like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...? Are you still mad?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh? No, I&#39;m not mad. I was just surprised. And I was just thinking how many traces there are from the last war.</p><p>The rubble in the river shouldn&#39;t be a problem compared to the wasteland in that park. Well, I guess it was unfortunate for the owner of that ship.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Please do not worry as Kiritsugu said the owner had insurance. He parked the ship there as a buffer, so he used the ship as a wall to reduce the power of the Noble Phantasm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. So you destroyed the ship knowing it was there?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I did not know! Kiritsugu prepared it without telling me.</p><p>...I think Kiritsugu knew how the battle would turn out. I did not notice since he never said anything before or after he prepared the ship.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber looks down at the river yearningly.</p><p>The water surface reflects the sunset.</p><p>The wind coming from the river is a bit strong and flutters Saber&#39;s hair.</p><hr><p>...Is it because she looks so beautiful like that?</p><p>&quot;Saber, did you have fun today?&quot;</p><p>I was assaulted by a sudden fear that Saber might just disappear, and I ask something I don&#39;t need to ask.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Did you say something, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I asked you if you had fun today.&quot;</p><p>...She gasps.</p><p>Saber opens her eyes in amazement.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I would be lying if I said this was not new to me.&quot;</p><p>She says so in a voice of hope.</p><p>As if such a thing will never happen again.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...I knew what her answer would be.</p><p>All I can do now is nod and just go home.</p><p>Everything can return to the way it was\u2015\u2015just like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p><p>I nod, looking at Saber.</p><p>&quot;Then let&#39;s go again. It&#39;s not like this has to be the last time.&quot;</p><p>And I say something I won&#39;t be able to take back.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Saber freezes.</p><p>...She must have realized what I want to say.</p><p>She shakes her head, looking directly at me.</p><p>As if saying there won&#39;t be a next time.</p><p>As if this mistake is only for today.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Why?&quot;</p><p>I know Saber&#39;s answer.</p><p>But I ask, not liking the answer I expect.</p><hr><p>&quot;I do not even need to explain. Servants exist to fight. A day like today is merely denying my own existence.</p><p>I obeyed since you decided to take a rest, but I believe resting should not be necessary from now on.</p><p>There are only a few enemies left. I would like to start searching for Lancer right now if you would order me to...&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks at me with eyes full of fire.</p><p>Saber is saying she will start fighting right now if I order it.</p><p>That...</p><p>...Causes me to get mad about all the things I can&#39;t approve of.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015What&#39;s with that? You really want to fight that much?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I draw closer to the Holy Grail the more I fight.</p><p>Battle should be prioritized over everything. You should know that as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I understand. That&#39;s why it&#39;s strange.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to say this, but you&#39;re contradicting yourself.</p><p>You say fighting is important, but you don&#39;t like fighting. You&#39;re fighting against your will because there&#39;s no other way, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha... that is not true. I do not hesitate to fight.</p><p>I have already told you that I will do anything to win.&quot;</p><p>Yeah, she did say that.</p><p>But that&#39;s not a reason to like fighting.</p><hr><p>&quot;As far as you can manage, right? ...Look, Saber.</p><p>If you just want to defeat other Masters and obtain the Holy Grail, you could just attack people and take their power. But you don&#39;t want to do that, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015That is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not that you don&#39;t want to involve innocent people. You know well enough that people will be dying once you start fighting.</p><p>That&#39;s why you want to minimize the battles. People will die if you fight, so you want to end the battle as quickly as possible. \u2015\u2015In other words, you&#39;re frightened of fights with victims.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She gasps.</p><p>After opening her eyes as if she&#39;s seen a ghost, she grits her teeth and straightens her stare.</p><hr><p>&quot;You are wrong. I do not fear battles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. I don&#39;t think you were ever scared. Because an individual&#39;s fear must have been suppressed by what you call the king&#39;s mission.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But you still fear battles.</p><p>You were strong and good at fighting. But that&#39;s not a talent you ever wanted, right?</p><p>\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll say this honestly. Fighting doesn&#39;t suit you. You must have hated even pulling out that sword.</p><p>Your claim that fighting is your only objective is just an excuse to try to deceive yourself.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015It&#39;s so simple.</p><p>Why didn&#39;t you or anybody around you notice it?</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Shirou. I will not tolerate any more insults even from you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can&#39;t stand it because it&#39;s the truth, right? You won&#39;t be able to fight anymore if you admit it.&quot;</p><hr><p>She grits her teeth.</p><p>Saber glares at me in anger.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t back away.</p><p>If I believe I&#39;m right, I can&#39;t run away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...So, you should stop. You want to stop too, right? You must know fighting doesn&#39;t suit you. So just quit it.</p><p>Stop being a Servant and do something that suits you.&quot;</p><hr><p>She needs to regain the happiness she should have had as a human.</p><p>For that, I\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015How ridiculous. I have no choices besides fighting. I only exist to obtain the Holy Grail.</p><p>I submitted my body to fulfill my promise as king. I cannot allow any other use for myself.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>&#39;I only exist to obtain the Holy Grail&#39;.</p><p>That annoys me the most.</p><p>Why does she say ridiculous things like that as if to convince herself?</p><p>Everyone around her took her word because she kept saying things like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;You idiot! That&#39;s not true...! There are infinite ways! You&#39;re here and different from before...!</p><p>So\u2015\u2015you have to live for yourself.</p><p>Don&#39;t make any mistakes and don&#39;t use the Holy Grail...&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015The final wish she&#39;s permitted.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Don&#39;t use it for people you don&#39;t care about.</p><p>If you&#39;re here, you need to be happy here.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear the wind.</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t even nod.</p><p>She just looks back at me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I cannot accept your words.</p><p>I made a contract to obey you, but I did not give you my heart, Master.&quot;</p><p>She replies with a strong voice.</p><hr><p>&quot;I cannot forsake my oath as a king. There is a duty I must fulfill as the king.</p><p>King Arthur&#39;s goal is to obtain the Holy Grail. Even if I achieve that goal, I will not return to being Arturia.</p><p>I have only ever had one wish. \u2015\u2015This wish has never changed since I pulled out the sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Why? That&#39;s not a thing you have to do.</p><p>It&#39;s wrong for you to be unrewarded for your actions.</p><p>You don&#39;t need the Holy Grail. And...&quot;</p><hr><p>...And Saber&#39;s wish won&#39;t come true.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible to erase everything that&#39;s happened.</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. You can&#39;t redo what&#39;s already done. ...No, I think it&#39;s something you mustn&#39;t do. You should know that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. That is not true.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p>However bad the result, you can&#39;t change what&#39;s happened.</p><p>Wanting to redo something because you couldn&#39;t do it is just childish selfishness...!&quot;</p><hr><p>...Our words end there.</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t say anything, and I don&#39;t have anything to say.</p><p>The wind has stopped as well.</p><p>No.</p><p>The wind hasn&#39;t stopped, it&#39;s only died down for a second.</p><hr><p>Another sound of wind.</p><p>Just as I feel the wind on my cheek...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015I thought you would understand, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>The wind has changed into a headwind.</p><hr><p>&quot;Is that all you wanted to say after wasting this meaningless day?&quot;</p><p>A cold voice.</p><p>It contains only rejection.</p><hr><p>&quot;Do not be so conceited. What makes you think you understand me?</p><p>You have no right to invade me.</p><p>Do not fight? What are you saying when you need me to protect you? Please, give me that nonsense after you are able to fight on your own.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Humph. I do not think that will ever occur.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No\u2015\u2015it&#39;s not nonsense...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It is nonsense. Think about myself? That goes for you as well.</p><p>You do not consider your life.</p><p>You say I am mistaken, but you are even more mistaken.</p><p>...Only corpses consider others more important than themselves.</p><p>How can a fool who does not even know the value of his own life address me so?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015Saber, you...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Did I annoy you? Then I will not mind if you dissolve your contract with me. You do not need the Holy Grail anyway.[l]</p><p>I will defeat the remaining Masters by myself and obtain the Holy Grail myself.</p><p>...If you do not wish to fight, you can go and hide somewhere far away.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Saber. Are you serious?&quot;</p><p>I ask with a trembling voice.</p><p>My teeth are chattering because I&#39;m suppressing my emotion.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course. My only goal is the Holy Grail. Everything else is unnecessary.</p><p>\u2015\u2015You are no exception, Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>The hammer comes down.</p><p>I bear my head going white and stop myself from raising my fist.</p><hr><p>&quot;You blockhead...! Fine, if you want to fight, go ahead and do what you want! I don&#39;t care anymore!&quot;</p><hr><p>But I can&#39;t stop my emotions.</p><p>I yell what sounds like an excuse and run away from Saber.</p><p>I get away from her.</p><p>But, for a moment.</p><p>I think I see Saber standing there absent-mindedly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Dammit, dammit, dammit...!&quot;</p><p>I run.</p><p>I keep running, not knowing what&#39;s so vexing or maddening.</p><hr><p>&#39;Everything else is unnecessary. You are no exception, Shirou.&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>I grit my teeth hard and stop myself from yelling out.</p><p>Just remembering it makes me white out and I might run into a pole or something.</p><hr><p>...No, it would be easy if I could do that.</p><p>If I was just angry at Saber, I could just take it out on something.</p><p>But that&#39;s not the cause of this fury.</p><p>It&#39;s not just Saber that I&#39;m mad at.</p><p>It&#39;s so vexing, and I keep running so hard because I hate how weak I am.</p><hr><p>...Saber was standing there absent-mindedly.</p><p>The words she said, just as the wind changed directions.</p><hr><p>&#39;I thought you would understand, Shirou\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! Damn it! You idiot, I don&#39;t understand...!&quot;</p><p>I spit that out, then regret it so much that I almost fall.</p><p>...What was it about?</p><p>Her voice like a farewell sounded like she was crying.</p><p>Come to think of it, maybe those words were the only honest thing she said.</p><hr><p>Those words murmured with her head hung.</p><p>A voice of hope, disappointment, and wishes.</p><p>\u2015\u2015Then...</p><p>Who was the betrayer, and who was betrayed?</p><hr><p>I run into my room and shut the door.</p><p>I collapse.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to stand up.</p><p>I just want to lie down and go to sleep.</p><hr><p>&quot;Haa\u2015\u2015Haa, haa, ha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>But my body is still burning.</p><p>My heart feels like it&#39;s splitting open and my lungs are desperate for air.</p><p>I ran full speed from the bridge to here.

That makes me furious.</p><hr><p>&quot;...But what can I do? It&#39;s useless for anyone to say anything if Saber herself doesn&#39;t want happiness.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s why I tried hard, so she&#39;d be able to find her own happiness.</p><p>But she told me that was meaningless, and on top of that, she called me a fool.</p><hr><p>&quot;A fool who doesn&#39;t even know the value of his own life, huh?&quot;</p><p>...What can I do when she says that?</p><p>I value my life as well and I don&#39;t want to do anything that might endanger it.</p><hr><p>But this has nothing to do with Saber.</p><p>I think it&#39;s unfair of her to bring it up right there.</p><p>No matter how stupid I am, I&#39;m sure Saber&#39;s wrong.</p><p>But if she denies me like that, I can&#39;t do anything\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Dammit. Man, she can do whatever she likes...!&quot;</p><p>I turn over and lie on my stomach.</p><p>The floor is the only view, so I close my eyes to black out my mind.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s it.</p><p>I don&#39;t care about Saber anymore.</p><p>If the Holy Grail is so important to her, she can go marry it.</p><p>She is so obstinate that she doesn&#39;t understand after I&#39;ve told her this much. I&#39;ll be burned if I associate with her any more.</p><p>No, I&#39;ll be seriously hurt.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve already been hurt, though.</p><p>Not just burned.</p><p>I met her, fought with her many times, and even had sex with her even though it was just to survive.</p><hr><p>The heat of that night wasn&#39;t a burn, but it almost killed my brain.</p><p>Why\u2015\u2015Why do I recall such a thing when I&#39;m so pissed off?</p><p>If I recall that, it won&#39;t matter what Saber says.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Something only used to fight? Then don&#39;t show your weak parts...&quot;</p><p>...Anyways, Saber is unfair.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s so unfair, but I think it&#39;s unfair that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s unfair.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t hate her even though I&#39;m this mad, and the more I try to ignore her, the more I can&#39;t. It&#39;s such a contradiction.</p><p>Her whole existence is unfair.</p><p>I can&#39;t hate her no matter what.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Damn it. I guess the one who&#39;s in love loses...&quot;</p><p>...But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p>If I can&#39;t give up no matter how useless she tells me it is, I have to keep trying until the end.</p><p>No matter how much Saber hates it or rejects me, if I believe I&#39;m right\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&#39;I thought you would understand, Shirou\u2015\u2015&#39;</p><hr><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>I remember her face, about to cry.</p><p>In the future.</p><p>Will she make that kind of a face every time I repeat this?</p><hr><p>&quot;...But still.

He served the king as a knight with an unknown father, waited for his chance to take over the throne, and finally organized a revolt.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015This was the battle later known as the battle of Camlann.</p><p>The end of King Arthur.</p><hr><p>King Arthur discovered Mordred&#39;s betrayal on her expedition and returned to her homeland with her tired troops to invade her own territory.</p><p>She slashed away knights that used to serve her.</p><p>She attacked the lands she once protected.</p><p>The few knights that stayed with her died off, and the only ones standing in the end were her and Mordred.</p><hr><p>Their personal combat ended with the king&#39;s victory.</p><p>...But she did not emerge unscathed.</p><p>Mordred was bound by a strong curse, so he still swung his sword even after his death and left a fatal wound on the king.</p><p>That is the end of this battle.</p><p>The last of her, the one called the king of knights.</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015It must have been painful.</p><p>Come to think of it, none of her battles were painless.</p><p>Every one of her twelve battles was severe, and this just happened to be the greatest wound appropriate for her end.</p><hr><p>She returned to Britain and destroyed her own army.</p><p>She punished the knights who used to serve her, and the knights following her all died.</p><p>And in the end, she had to kill her own son, even if he was son only in name.</p><hr><p>...I cannot tell what went through her mind.</p><p>But I have to wish.</p><p>The lone king, who tried to be a king until her last moments...</p><p>I wish that her last dream might be a normal dream, one that the girl called Arturia might wish for.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm...&quot;</p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>I don&#39;t know when I got back, but I&#39;m in my room lying on my futon.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Oh. You have awoken, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Saber. Why am I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have been sleeping since that time. Your body is almost completely healed, so you do not need to worry.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s great, but....&quot;</p><p>What about Saber?</p><p>If my wound has healed, I&#39;m fine.</p><p>But Saber&#39;s different. Even though she can heal her wounds, her magical energy isn&#39;t infinite.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be a problem if she had just fought, but she used Excalibur.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. Um, were you treating me all this time...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I merely wiped your sweat. I cannot treat wounds as Rin does.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Idiot. You didn&#39;t need to do that.</p><p>It must be more painful for you right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That is not true. I only have a light wound compared to you.</p><p>But I cannot ignore what you just said. Even if your wounds have healed, they were bad enough that you could have died. Please worry about yourself for now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so, Saber reaches for the washbowl beside her.</p><p>There&#39;s a cold towel in there and after squeezing the water out of it, she wipes my sweating body.</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m really embarrassed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Shirou, does your wound hurt? It seems you are getting a fever again\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I don&#39;t have a fever...! No, you can just rest for now.</p><p>You might be all right, but you used Excalibur. So you should be the one resting! You&#39;ll collapse again at this rate.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... well, that is true, but...&quot;</p><p>She hesitates, squeezing the towel.</p><hr><p>&quot;But, I am doing better than you right now.</p><p>It is only natural for me to protect you until you get better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...What&#39;s with that?</p><p>I can&#39;t object if she says so with that kind of an expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then you&#39;ll rest once I recover, Saber?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I need to sleep as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber says so in her usual tone.</p><p>...So, I let Saber take care of me and suppress my embarrassment.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...Time passes slowly.</p><p>Have I ever looked so closely at Saber without doing anything?</p><p>Saber is the same as always, and moonlight is shining on her.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>Looking at her now, she really is feminine.</p><p>White fingers and slender arms.</p><p>She looks so lovely that it doesn&#39;t seem like she would be capable of fighting.</p><p>...That&#39;s why I can&#39;t stay calm.</p><p>She&#39;s been fighting all this time with that slim body of hers.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...? Why are you staring at my arm?</p><p>...I do not want to suspect this, but are you comparing my arms to those of Rin?&quot;</p><hr><p>...Is she angry or sulking?</p><p>She has such slender arms, but she thinks her arms aren&#39;t cute at all.</p><p>Probably because there&#39;s some muscle on them, but they&#39;re rather cute to me.</p><hr><p>&quot;No. The wound doesn&#39;t hurt, so I was just spacing out. It&#39;s not like I have anything to say about your arms.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. That is good.&quot;</p><p>Saber seems relieved.</p><p>Then...</p><p>Saber notices something as she closes her eyes and nods.</p><hr><p>&quot;So your wound is fine now? I was seriously angry before, but I will forget about it if you are all right.</p><p>...It is rather late to say this, but I thank you, Shirou.</p><p>And I am really happy that you are safe.&quot;</p><p>She says happily.</p><p>Then, she smiles faintly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s smiling about such a thing.</p><p>...I recall her memories in my dream.</p><p>She didn&#39;t know happiness or entertainment, but she&#39;s going to smile about something like this?</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015No.</p><p>She can only smile at somebody else&#39;s safety and not at her own happiness.</p><p>Those words from before.</p><p>That she was happier seeing me smile.</p><p>She said that with a satisfied expression.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m going mad.</p><p>I really feel like I&#39;m crazy, and...</p><p>&quot;...! Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>...I hug Saber with all my strength.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sh-Shirou...! W-What are you doing...!?&quot;</p><p>She wriggles to tries to free herself.</p><p>I ignore that and embrace her tighter.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015! Shirou, please stop...!</p><p>I do not know what is going on, but this is going too far for a joke...!&quot;</p><p>Her arms resist me.</p><p>But.</p><p>I don&#39;t listen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou, please\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>Saber raises her arm to hit me.</p><p>To that...</p><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015It&#39;s okay. Listen, you have to smile for your own sake.&quot;</p><p>I say so from the bottom of my heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh\u2015\u2015Shi... rou...?&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know why she hesitated.</p><p>I just spat out what was inside me.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015Why...&quot;</p><hr><p>...I can understand her being focused on the Holy Grail.</p><p>But I can never approve of that.</p><p>I want her to know normal happiness. I think it&#39;ll all be a lie if she doesn&#39;t.</p><p>Because all this time, she&#39;s fought for others.</p><p>So she should be as happy as the people she&#39;s made happy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Are you crying\u2015\u2015?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!&quot;</p><p>When she asks that, I realize my eyes are watery.</p><p>Not because I&#39;m sad.</p><p>It&#39;s just too vexing.</p><p>I&#39;m annoyed that Saber can only smile for others. It&#39;s just that my head went crazy because it pissed me off so much\u2015\u2015</p><hr><p>&quot;...Saber. Isn&#39;t this enough? You&#39;ve done your best. You fought even by yourself.</p><p>So\u2015\u2015you have to find your own happiness.</p><p>You&#39;ve fulfilled your oath, so you can return to being Arturia.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015you are still talking about that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll keep on saying it...! I can&#39;t help it because I&#39;ve fallen in love with you...! I won&#39;t give up until you change your mind...!&quot;</p><p>I yell and embrace Saber as if to stop her from struggling.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha\u2015\u2015&quot;</p><p>...She&#39;s weak.</p><p>She curls up in my arms and looks away.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shirou. Please do not bother me.</p><p>...This is unpleasant even if you are my Master, Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll move away if you don&#39;t want this.</p><p>...I said I like you, so I&#39;ll let you go if you don&#39;t like me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Saber doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>She just hangs her head to escape my stare.</p><hr><p>&quot;...You are being unfair. You knew my past, but you continued to invade me. You should know my answer already, so why\u2015\u2015why are you still concerned about me?</p><p>...You must have seen all the sins I have committed.&quot;</p><hr><p>\u2015\u2015Yeah, I did.</p><p>She sacrificed many people in the name of the king and killed many enemies.</p><p>I don&#39;t intend to ignore that or pretend it didn&#39;t happen.</p><p>But still, even knowing that, I want the girl named Arturia to become happy.</p><hr><p>&quot;\u2015\u2015So what? I don&#39;t know what this emotion is.</p><p>I just can&#39;t leave you alone.</p><p>Please smile. I want to be with you, Saber\u2015&quot;</p><hr><p>A child-like unilateral confession.</p><p>Saber bites her lip, still hanging her head.</p><hr><p>&quot;...My answer will not change. I cannot break my oath as a king.</p><p>Even if I was not appropriate for the role, I was entrusted with my country as the king.</p><p>I could not fulfill my duty, so this... this freedom is not permitted to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>She looks at me straight on like she&#39;s about to cry.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-12" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 12</h2><p>\u2015\u2015You...</p><p>...Fuckin&#39; chicken grill!!!</p><p>I can&#39;t believe this! I can&#39;t believe anyone could be such an insane gamer that they&#39;d come to this Tiger Dojo! Osu!</p><p>You shouldn&#39;t be here!</p><p>Beat that goldie quickly and protect Saber or I&#39;m going to get mad!</p><p>Is that okay, buruma?</p><p>Oh, hi, Senpai.</p><p>...Well, it&#39;s a bit vexing to be honest.</p><p>But I want him to act cool if things have gone this far.</p><p>Fu.</p><p>Well, this dojo is done.</p><p>Quickly go back to the choice and beat him, Shirou!</p>', 3268);
