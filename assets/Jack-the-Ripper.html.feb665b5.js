Catching glimpses of the underwear and the bare skin[3] is an essential point to wearing thick clothes. The second ascension&#39;s liberal look is aiming at the gap between it and the first ascension with its design. The character&#39;s image, which is adorably small, but gives off the feeling that you&#39;ll be cut if you let your guard down, is a fittingly frightening weapon. Even though the large variety of knives she possesses won&#39;t see much use, thinking about what purpose each could serve while I was arranging them was a ton of fun.
