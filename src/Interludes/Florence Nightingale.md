# Florence Nightingale

<h2>An Angel Does Not Plant Flowers</h2>

**Narration:**
It's awfully dark.

 
**Narration:**
It must be night, but even still...
It's TOO dark. So dark. Where's the light?

 
**Narration:**
And...dammit.

 
**Narration:**
It hurts...

 
**Narration:**
My entire body hurts. My chest, my stomach, my back, my arms, my legs, my head, my nose, my inner ears hurt.

 
**Narration:**
The only thing not hurting is my fingers. Otherwise there's this stabbing pain throughout my entire body.

 
**Narration:**
Who am I? I'm a soldier.
Where am I? Am I in the Scutari base camp?

 
**Narration:**
What the heck? I thought I was on the frontline.
So why am I at the base?

 
**Narration:**
...It hurts, it hurts, hurt, hurt, hurt...
Oh, that's right.

 
**Narration:**
I remember. I got shot. I got shot in the chest and stomach, and the bullets passed through my back. And then I broke my arms and legs when I fell. And my head and face, too.

 
**Narration:**
The Russians got me.

 
**Narration:**
May the Ottoman Empire be victorious. Death to the invaders. I need to keep fighting. I can't face my brothers in this state.

 
**Narration:**
...I can't move a muscle. What's going on with me?
Am I a goner? Ahhh...it hurts.

 
**Narration:**
Nothing changes even as time goes by.
The pain's not going away. It's not getting better.

 
**Narration:**
Don't tell me...am I going to be like this forever?
Or am I going to die soon?

 
**Narration:**
...No. I don't want to die.
I can't die yet.

 
**Narration:**
Ah...I hear it. Footsteps. Has the grim reaper come for me? I can see light...

 
**Narration:**
I can tell someone's coming towards me carrying a lamp. The darkness is thinning out...

 
**Narration:**
It's light.
Someone's here for me.

 
**A：Nurse:**
Oh, good.
You've come to.

 
**Narration:**
Who the heck are you?
And why're you wearing a British military uniform?

 
**Narration:**
I've never heard of a grim reaper wearing a military uniform. Well, everyone who's seen a grim reaper in person is dead, so they wouldn't really be telling anyone.

 
**Narration:**
Right, Miss Grim Reaper with the lamp?

 
**A：Nurse:**
...

 
**Narration:**
Heh. I knew it.
I'm gonna die.

 
**Narration:**
Everything hurts. It's excruciating. Can you see me?
I'm crying. I'm crying because it hurts so much.

 
**Narration:**
But I can't even make a sound. This is bad.
My big brother was a goner. I'm a goner.

 
**Narration:**
Hurry up and take me.
I'm gonna...

 
**A：Nurse:**
Unfortunately, I do not know what you are saying.

 
**A：Nurse:**
But, I will say this:

 
**A：Nurse:**
I will save you.
I will not let you die.

 
**Narration:**
Lies.
I'm as good as dead.

 
**Narration:**
I was shot. Multiple times.
Only God could save me. Otherwise...

 
**Narration:**
...Or an angel.

 
**Nightingale:**
You had a dream?

 
**Nightingale:**
Why would you tell me of such a thing?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Because Servants and Masters...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sometimes we are connected by dreams...
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
I see.

 
**Nightingale:**
Is this about the supernatural? Everyone is entitled to his or her interests, whatever they may be.

 
**Nightingale:**
But it is inappropriate to force those interests on others. Understand?

 
**Nightingale:**
So, what kind of dream did you see?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, here's what happened...
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
That...

 
**Nightingale:**
It is natural for things that interest you to appear in your dreams. You should study neurophysiology more.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait a minute...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not from your memory, Nightingale?
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
My memory?

 
**Nightingale:**
No. You mentioned that you saw me from a male soldier's perspective.

 
**Nightingale:**
That could not be a memory from my lifetime.
Obviously.

 
**Nightingale:**
But...the fact that you have taken an interest in me...

 
**Nightingale:**
Does that mean you have taken an interest in nursing, treatment, and sanitation?

 
**Nightingale:**
Excellent.
In that case...

 
**Nightingale:**
Hello.

 
**Nightingale:**
Thank you all for gathering today.
I, Florence Nightingale, am extremely pleased.

 
**Nightingale:**
You have gathered here today because you all value human life, and all of you have sacrificed on behalf of others. It is my sincere belief that we can have a meaningful, productive discussion.

 
**Nightingale:**
For the sake of all human life.
For Fujimaru, who has also shown interest.

 
**Nightingale:**
And, of course, for each of us as well.

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm looking forward to hearing everyone's input.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Likewise, Miss Nightingale.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I am yet inexperienced as a practitioner of medicine, but I hope to be of some small assistance.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Above all, I would like to learn more, as well.

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Hm. I thought this was simply a gathering of beautiful women. Seems I was mistaken.

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Still, this isn't terrible. An angel in a white nurse's outfit, a black-haired beauty, and one very sprightly girl.

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Ah, what a wonderful selection. A buffet of beauties...the cream of the crop. This isn't just about being surrounded by beauty; it's like a harem!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Ah, my apologies.
I got a bit overexcited. Just a joke!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
This is a gathering for those who want to save people, right?

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Well, then I have every reason to be here. I do have a Noble Phantasm that can save lives, after all!

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Sanzang:**
Um!

 
**Sanzang:**
I don't really get it, but we're just here to talk about how to save people, right?

 
**Sanzang:**
Then leave it to me! I have the guidance of the Buddha, so you're in good hands!

 
**Sanzang:**
Aw, if I'd known there was a support group like this,
I would have dragged Touta here, too.

 
**Sanzang:**
So, what are we going to talk about first?
The health benefits of fasting?

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods deeply)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooouuu...

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes, Fou.
I sense an indescribable feeling in the air.

 
**Mash:**
I thought this was just discussion group for Servants who have recovery skills...

 
**Mash:**
But it feels more like they're anxious and getting pumped up to go into the simulator for combat training...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is a bit tense for a discussion group...
 
**Mash:**
A-a just point...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nightingale's hosting this?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. It appears that Nightingale had approached everyone earlier.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
If I may ask...um...is it appropriate to call Sanzang someone with recovery skills?

 
**Mash:**
I don't believe she has any skills like that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Seems a bit off the mark, yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's totally wrong...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes...and it appears that Fionn believes that everyone but himself is female...

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Nightingale:**
Devotion to helping others is my creed. I search the battlefields after overcoming many obstacles.

 
**Nightingale:**
All the injured and sick must be saved.
Yes... Life is precious. I must save all lives.

 
**Nightingale:**
And to do so, I must let go of all that holds me back or makes me hesitate. Yes...and that's why...

 
**Nightingale:**
First and foremost, hygiene is key.
Good hygiene is a bare minimum requirement.

 
**Nightingale:**
All affected body parts and the surrounding environment must be sanitary. Uncleanliness is the enemy. It is the enemy of all medical practices.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Life is precious.
And hygiene is indeed very important.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Very admirable, Miss Nightingale.
Truly you are a noble Heroic Spirit.

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Of course, clean water is also important. Any water I pour from these hands of mine becomes water of life...

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
But yes, water should be clean. That also helps lovely flowers bloom. I agree, my wonderful ladies.

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Sanzang:**
Eh? What? Clean? Are you talking about washing or cleaning up after yourself?

 
**Sanzang:**
I like it when things get cleaned, too.

 
**Sanzang:**
Whenever I go to an inn, the first thing I do is clean the dust off the bed!

 
**Sanzang:**
Of course...my disciples always said my room was too messy.

 
**Sanzang:**
Buuut I really do like it when things are clean!
I'd even clean up after myself if someone made me!

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods deeply)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, this is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's like they get it wrong,then do an about-face and get it right somehow.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nightingale looks satisfied.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
As unbelievable as it may be, they seem to be on the same page. At least this is a productive conversation!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All coincidence!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are they even talking about the same things?
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
I ask myself：How many patients can I save with these hands of mine?

 
**Nightingale:**
I am a nurse, not a doctor. There are some out there who say that medicine should be left to doctors.

 
**Nightingale:**
Sterilizing and disinfecting is sure to increase the chances of survival for the wounded and ill.

 
**Nightingale:**
So many lives are in our hands before they ever reach the doctors.

 
**Nightingale:**
...Yes, there were too many...

 
**Nightingale:**
That is why I advocate sterilization so much.

 
**Nightingale:**
Treatment. Nursing. Maintaining hygiene. These are the weapons that we use to defeat the threat of injury and illness.

 
**Nightingale:**
We are here to save every life we can.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Wonderful argument.
Hygiene is also important in the world of alchemy.

 
**Paracelsus:**
When doing biomedical experiments, the patient's cleanliness and health management are crucial.
The same is true in medicine, of course.

 
**Paracelsus:**
But for you to focus on that subject, and advocate it to spread the word... You really must love humans.

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
I completely understand!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
It's the same kind of joy I feel when I come across a beautiful stream while I'm hunting deep in the forest!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
The delightful sounds of a babbling brook, so like the finest instrument...the sunlight kissing the surface of the water to make it glisten...ah, exquisite!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Just like when I meet a beautiful woman for the first time!

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods)

 
**Mash:**
(Eh!? Is that really something to nod at in agreement, Nightingale?)

 
**Sanzang:**
A brook? You're talking about a river?
I love bathing in water! It feels sooo good!

 
**Sanzang:**
But...when you talk about a river, I think of fish. Oh, but I'm a disciple of the Buddha though, so I don't eat meat.

 
**Sanzang:**
But I love to watch them. Fishes have these beady eyes that make them sooo cute!

 
**Nightingale:**
... (Nods deeply)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooouuu...

 
**Mash:**
I'm sort of confused about what Nightingale's been nodding at here tonight.

 
**Mash:**
A-anyway, it doesn't sound like anybody's on the same page, but somehow the conversation is still going!

 
**Nightingale:**
And now...

 
**Nightingale:**
Let's continue our discussion. Well, I would like to, but perhaps we should take a short break.

 
**Nightingale:**
It's time for our practical training.
Everyone, ready yourselves.

 
**Nightingale:**
To save the injured and sick, sometimes the use of force is necessary. Especially in the face of a threat that may increase the number of patients.

 
**Nightingale:**
It is very important.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Ah, combat training.
The medical ward may turn into a battlefield, it seems.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Some superstitious people have gone deranged after seeing medicine practiced, thinking it to be a ritual of the devil, and attacked the practitioners.

 
**Paracelsus:**
So in situations like that...yes...the use of force is necessary.

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Oh? Is it time for me to demonstrate my valor?
Perfect!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Honestly, I was starting to think it was time for me to change my flirting approac&ndash;err, I mean the topic!
Good timing!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
Heh. Then let's do it! I, Fionn mac Cumhaill,
shall show off my glorious form!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
I'm sure it'll drive the ladies wild!

 
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**
And, as luck would have it, I don't see my annoying subordinate here to mess it up for me!

 
**Sanzang:**
Eh? What?
Battle? Huh? Why?

 
**Sanzang:**
I-I'm going to participate too!?
I'm beyond surprised!

 
**Nightingale:**
Please head to the training site.

 
**Nightingale:**
<span style=font-size:25px> IMMEDIATELY!</span>

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, are we going to battle in the simulator!?
Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, just let them do whatever they want at this point.
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
[♂ Mister /♀️ Miss} Fujimaru. You will be playing the role of my subordinate this time. Understood?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-yes, ma'am.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do it if you tell me...
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
Ready to treat!
Repeat!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready to treat!


---
 
**Nightingale:**
Very good. Now let's go.
Miss Mash, I leave the operations to you.

 
**Mash:**
Yes!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai.
U-um...g-good luck!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nightingale:**
...Good work.

 
**Nightingale:**
Now we shall resume our discussion.
Please take your seats. Quickly.

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes...
Senpai...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The meeting continues, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I might be a little tired.
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
...?

 
**Nightingale:**
What is the matter?
You are looking pale.

 
**Nightingale:**
Ah, I see. Have you by chance...not had adequate sleep, or not had a proper, balanced meal?

 
**Nightingale:**
This is a problem.
You are therefore injured.

 
**Nightingale:**
Change of plans. I will begin treatment. First: sterilization. Then we will maintain the hygienic state.

 
**Nightingale:**
Rest assured, [♂ Mister /♀️  Miss} Fujimaru.

 
**Nightingale:**
I will save your life...even if I must first kill you to do so.

 
**Nightingale:**
...I guarantee it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
W-waitaminute!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, no...no!!!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
U-um, you have it wrong, Nightingale.
Senpai is neither injured nor sick!

 
**Nightingale:**
Mash.

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes?

 
**Nightingale:**
You look pale as well.

 
**Mash:**
!!!

 
**Mash:**
N-no...that is not true... Not true at all!
I am not hurt nor am I sick!

 
**Nightingale:**
I will treat you as well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nightingale's...probably...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's more intense than usual!
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Nightingale:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
Name: Fujimaru.
Place of employment: Chaldea.

 
**Nightingale:**
Breathing, pulse...all normal. No loss of limbs.
No issues with the special nervous system, either.

 
**Nightingale:**
Very good.
There are no issues.

 
**D：???:**
Hmph.
Special nerves, you say?

 
**D：???:**
To you, even the structure the mages call magical circuits is just a type of nerve.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I see you have had quite the eventful day.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Is this all because someone got a glimpse of your life and you panicked? You, the angel of steel...panic?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I caught a glimpse of something rare.
Haha, thank you for that.

 
**Nightingale:**
...You.

 
**Nightingale:**
I'll thank you to refrain from superfluous talk. It's not just Master...this place is overrun with the wounded and potentially ill.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Don't mind me.
Just keep focusing on Fujimaru.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
I'm sure a time will come when your help is needed.

 
**Nightingale:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
Your words confuse me.
I do not comprehend all of what you say...

 
**Nightingale:**
But I am a nurse.
Nothing more, nothing less.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Hmph.

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Many Heroic Spirits have arisen from human history! Many heroes are men and women of dauntless courage and battlefield valor!

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
But those who heal wounds...Heroic Spirits of salvation. There are not many of those.

 
**Nightingale:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
I still do not understand.
Why not speak in your own native language?

 
**Edmond Dantès:**
Heh.

 
**Nightingale:**
...And he flees once again.

 
**Nightingale:**
Heroic Spirit of salvation...
That is quite the overstatement.

 
**Nightingale:**
I am simply one who takes joy in treating and nursing others. And at the same time...

 
**Nightingale:**
I am also saddened when I see Fujimaru hurt and suffering.

 
**Mash:**
Ah!

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. It's a nice morning.
Did you sleep well last night?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think I dreamed of an argument...or...something...
 
**Mash:**
Hm???

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about you, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
I slept very well.
All of my vitals are good.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Um, breakfast is ready.
Shall we head to the cafeteria?

 
**Mash:**
Actually...

 
**Mash:**
I woke up early, so I helped out Emiya and Boudica in the kitchen today.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, that's good.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, let's go to the cafeteria!


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
Good health comes from a good night's sleep and a proper, nutritious meal, right!?


<h2>Fighting for Someone</h2>

**Mash:**
Welcome back, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Welcome back, everyone!
Great job out there!

 
**Mash:**
I can see the minute Singularity shrinking even as we speak. That's one less to worry about.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad we took care of it without things getting out of hand.
 
**Mash:**
Me too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Great job, everyone!
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hmph, that was so easy I didn't even need to bother going! Hahaha!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But don't forget my tribute, all right? I don't have to tell you what you need to bring me so I'll spare your life, do I?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Heh heh heh, you'd better not ever forget I'm an oni!
You can't just go ordering me around so easily!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
The moment you drop your guard, I'll eat your head and use your intestines to floss out any bits of skull that get stuck between my fangs. Don't forget that.

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't.
 


---
 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Mwahaha, so you do know your place!
Not bad!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
...Anyway, hurry up and do something about that one.
She's been acting weird and it's bugging me.

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
...Have you noticed, Master?

 
**Geronimo:**
I was watching while we were in battle,
and she was far less active than usual.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I noticed.
 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
Florence Nightingale.

 
**Geronimo:**
I've never seen her be so passive in battle before.
I did not notice any affliction or wound that might explain it.

 
**Geronimo:**
There may be something wrong with her Spirit Origin.
We should treat her at once.

 
**Geronimo:**
You should let Da Vinci know about this,
just in case.

 
**Nightingale:**
What are you talking about?

 
**Nightingale:**
I was?
In that last battle?

 
**Geronimo:**
...That's right. Twice, there was an enemy right in front of you, and you didn't lift a finger to attack them.

 
**Geronimo:**
You would not normally allow yourself to be so passive.
Are you aware you were acting like that?

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
It's not my job to fight. I'm a nurse, not a soldier.

 
**Nightingale:**
Though of course, that doesn't mean I won't fight should it become necessary.

 
**Nightingale:**
There may well be times when I'm pinned down,
unable to reach relief supplies right in front of me.

 
**Nightingale:**
So in circumstances like that...

 
**Nightingale:**
...I'm sure I would do whatever was necessary to remove the obstacles in my way.

 
**Nightingale:**
If it came down to it, I would have no hesitation about drawing a gun and pulling the trigger. Of that, I'm certain.

 
**Nightingale:**
But...

 
**Nightingale:**
...enemy or not, to do that would be to cause injury with my own hands.

 
**Nightingale:**
And nothing could be further from what I want.

 
**Nightingale:**
Listen, Commander, that others think of me as a small army unto myself does not make me an officer.

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm not here because I want to win wars.
All I want is for the fighting to stop.

 
**Nightingale:**
I...

 
**Nightingale:**
I want to save lives.

 
**Nightingale:**
As long as I can do that,
I don't care about the rest...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nightingale...
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
...(Gasp!)

 
**Nightingale:**
Nnn, I can't remember how I got here.
Weren't we just fighting golems?

 
**Nightingale:**
Are we back in Chaldea now? We are, aren't we?
What have I been doing...?

 
**Geronimo:**
You were telling us how you aren't a soldier.
That is certainly true, of course, but... Hmm.

 
**Geronimo:**
I knew it. Something is wrong with her Spirit Origin, Master.

 
**Nightingale:**
I see.

 
**Nightingale:**
Yes, I must not be feeling well. I will go rest.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nightingale?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Nightingale!?

 
**Gentleman:**
...Are you listening to me, Florence?

 
**Nightingale:**
Yes. I'm listening.

 
**Nightingale:**
We were just talking about the front line's medical supply situation. I need your help, Sidney.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Oh for... I knew it! You aren't listening to me at all, Florence! Do you even realize where you are!?

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
This is London! The capital of the entire British Empire! You aren't on the battlefield anymore, Florence.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
But it's clear to me that your heart is still there.
Just look at you.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
I can't believe you're wearing an army uniform.
You don't even work for them...

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
I won't ask what happened while you were there,
but this is London, Florence. London.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Do you understand?
You can't go around behaving like this.

 
**Nightingale:**
...I dress this way for a reason.

 
**Nightingale:**
You may find it strange. Maybe it is strange.
But I'm fighting too, just like those soldiers.

 
**Nightingale:**
I'll never stop fighting against the illness and injury plaguing our world. This uniform is more than appropriate for that.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
You'll never stop fighting...?

 
**Nightingale:**
That's right.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Ahh...

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Don't do this to yourself anymore, Florence.
Please. I'm begging you.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
You haven't been the Angel of Crimea for a long time now. You don't have to keep fighting any longer.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
It's time to focus on your own life now.
What about... What about marriage?

 
**Nightingale:**
Sidney?

 
**Nightingale:**
What in the world are you talking about?
You know nobody can get married on their own.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
...That's not what I mean, and you know it.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
How long are you going to keep pretending not to know?

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
I haven't been helping solely out of the goodness of my heart, Florence. Everything I've done has been for you...

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
For years now, I...

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
I've always lo&ndash;

 
**Narration:**
No.
This is wrong. It's a lie.

 
**Narration:**
Sidney Herbert was my friend. He was already married.
This conversation never happened. It couldn't have.

 
**Narration:**
No. It's not just that.

 
**Narration:**
In all my life, nobody ever told me they loved me...

 
**Voice:**
I see.

 
**Voice:**
I always thought your way of life was...bizarre, but now, you've started seeing cracks in your own facade.

 
**Voice:**
Heh.
Fascinating.

 
**Voice:**
But...I'm not about to let you dig your own grave.

 
**Nightingale:**
You have horrid taste in hobbies.

 
**Nightingale:**
Do you always go around spying on women while they're sleeping?

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...Hmph.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Most Servants don't sleep at all, let alone dream.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
That you are here, now, doing both makes plain that something is wrong with your Spirit Origin.

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Generally speaking, all of Chaldea's Servants are linked to Master. It's no wonder that sometimes lines may get a little blurred.

 
**Nightingale:**
How dare you say that to me?

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Something like this has happened to you before, hasn't it?

 
**Nightingale:**
That wasn't me. It was Fujimaru who...

 
**Nightingale:**
Yes. It has.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Nice to see you be direct about it.

 
**Nightingale:**
It's clear what is going on here.
There's no point in denying it.

 
**Nightingale:**
...I must be mentally injured.

 
**Holmes:**
Heroic Spirits...

 
**Holmes:**
...are usually created when a human being ascends beyond their humanity. At this point, they have yet to be assigned a class.

 
**Holmes:**
For one thing, the very concept of classes only arose as a byproduct of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual.

 
**Holmes:**
Naturally, Chaldea's summoning system follows the same principles, typically assigning each Heroic Spirit one of the seven classes.

 
**Holmes:**
But there are, of course, exceptions to this rule. Most potential problems can be avoided if there is an appropriate Extra class to which the Heroic Spirit can be assigned...

 
**Holmes:**
...but there may also be times when a Heroic Spirit is forced into a class for which they may not be fully suited.

 
**Holmes:**
Such cases can certainly become cause for distortion of one sort of another.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh... And that means what, exactly?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could you try that again, only way, waaay simpler?
 


---
 
**Holmes:**
...The Ms. Nightingale we know is a Berserker.

 
**Holmes:**
She is clearly a fighter, with her struggles to save lives as a nurse now manifesting in more literal terms.

 
**Holmes:**
But is that who she truly is? Was she always so obstinate during her life as a human woman?

 
**Holmes:**
Or is the fierce devotion we see in her a caricature of her true self, exaggerated to fit her Berserker class?

 
**Holmes:**
If the latter, she will continue to strain her mind and Spirit Origin for the length of her materialization.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then, I've been forcing her to be something she's not all this time...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
N-not necessarily!

 
**Mash:**
I know that in my case, I never felt like I was under any strain.

 
**Mash:**
So maybe it's similar for&ndash;

 
**Holmes:**
As a Demi-Servant, Ms. Kyrielight,
your circumstances are even more unusual.

 
**Holmes:**
Thus, I'm afraid your argument may not hold much water in this case.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ugh, not again, Holmes. You really can be kind of a twat sometimes, you know that?

 
**Holmes:**
Can I now?

 
**Da Vinci:**
You don't have to put it like that. Summoning a Heroic Spirit with a mind of their own has always been a huge deal.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And it's especially difficult to maintain a contract with a Berserker. This is KNOWN.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...It makes no difference to me.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Let's go, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
Wha&ndash;

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Take care of [♂ his /♀️ her} body, girl.
Er, Mash Kyrielight.

 
**Mash:**
W-wait! What are you talking about, Count!?

 
**Mash:**
Ah! Senpai!

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Ah, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Miss} Fujimaru!
Excellent timing!

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Please, would you say something to Florence?
I can't seem to get through to her myself.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
But maybe she'll listen to you,
since you're one of her colleagues.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Go on! Please, say something!

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
J-just a minute!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What is this place...
 


---
 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
You are seeing her mind as it is now.
Normally you would only see this in your dreams.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So this is Nightingale's...
 


---
 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
That's right.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Are you all right, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Miss} Fujimaru?
Your eyes seemed to glaze over for a moment.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Please, you have to talk to Florence.
She needs to rest up and return to her normal life.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
She only just got back from the war, and she's still intent on fighting. She can't keep going like this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm sorry, do I know you?
 


---
 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
He's nobody.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Remember, she's a Berserker. Most of her rational mind was sealed away when she materialized.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Ordinary people could never keep the fires of battle raging in their hearts at all times, but that's not the case for Berserkers.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
However, that of course comes at a cost.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
There's something that builds up deep down inside Berserkers over time.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Especially in the ones who still speak with some semblance of sanity!

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
It becomes twisted, warped, distorted.
At times, it can even manifest.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
Sometimes, it appears as a monster who wants nothing more than to follow its destructive impulses and lay waste to everything around it...

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...and sometimes, it embodies reason in the shape of an old friend!

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
She needs to rest now.
She shouldn't push herself anymore.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Come now, Florence, think about it.
There's no reason to do this to yourself.

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Don't you agree, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Miss} Fujimaru!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe you're right.
 


---
 
**Sidney Herbert:**
Of course I am!

 
**Sidney Herbert:**
So she should stop this right&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But not yet.


---
 
**Sidney Herbert:**
What was that...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want to keep fighting beside her until the very end.


---
 
**Sidney Herbert:**
What!?

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 
**Nightingale:**
...So that's your wish, Fujimaru?

 
**Nightingale:**
Very well then, I accept your request. I will return to the battlefield to save as many lives as I can.

 
**Nightingale:**
If helping those in need requires me to do violence, then so be it.

 
**Nightingale:**
Good grief. I guess you're no better than me in some ways, Commander.

 
**Nightingale:**
Your desire to remain on the battlefield with me can't be healthy. I must cure you of it...some day.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Works for me.
 


---
 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
I see your appearance has changed.
Not bad.

 
**Nightingale:**
So it has. I didn't mean for my hair to come undone...but perhaps it suits who I am now.

 
**Nightingale:**
If I'm to embrace my Berserker self...then I must admit this is who I am.

 
**Nightingale:**
A wild woman, hair untamed, saving every life she can without regard for her own safety.

 
**Nightingale:**
This is who I truly am right now.

 
**Nightingale:**
All right then, Commander. No...Master.
First, I'll need your help with something.

 
**Nightingale:**
The temporary excision of this fragment of rationality masquerading as an old friend.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You got it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let the healing begin!
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
Good. Very well then...

 
**Nightingale:**
Start the treatment!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nightingale:**
Good morning.
...I see you have more or less awoken on schedule today.

 
**Nightingale:**
It's been a week since your last morning exam, so I'd like you to come to the infirmary for a follow-up.

 
**Nightingale:**
Mash Kyrielight is already on standby there,
so do try to hurry.

 
**Nightingale:**
Now, if you'll excuse me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nightingale!


---
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...G-good morning.
 


---
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes, it is a good morning.

 
**Nightingale:**
...Thank you again for fighting by my side, Master.
