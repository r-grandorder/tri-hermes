# Alexander 

<h2>The Beginning of a Trampling Conquest</h2>

**Mash:**
...You want to meet the hero of the Iliad?

 
**Alexander:**
Yes, that's right.
Can you help me out?

 
**Alexander:**
With your summoning system, I should be able to meet that great hero, right?

 
**Alexander:**
The great Greek hero from the greatest of epics! His spear, his chariot, his body...the strongest is the only word to describe them!

 
**Alexander:**
I love it all. My tutor, Aristotle, gave me a copy of the Iliad a while ago&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
(A while ago?)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufou.

 
**Alexander:**
Oh, no, no. In life, I mean.
In this form, I sometimes get it wrong.

 
**Alexander:**
I'm sure you know this, but I love the Iliad and its heroes.

 
**Alexander:**
You want to read it, Master? It's great! It's like an exquisite fruit, you never get tired of it.

 
**Alexander:**
Someday when I go to battle,
I want to keep it with me at all times.

 
**Mash:**
(Someday?)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufou?

 
**Alexander:**
Oh, oops. I got it wrong again.
Haha, sorry. It just all seems so strange.

 
**Alexander:**
My personality and emotions from when I was young are very strong in this form. Somehow, my memories are being influenced as well.

 
**Alexander:**
I need to watch out for that, huh?
So, how about it&mdash;Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The hero of the Iliad, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Achilles, huh?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. The hero Achilles, the protagonist of the Iliad.

 
**Mash:**
One of Ancient Greece's greatest heroes.
But now&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I heard what you were saying, and unfortunately...
We haven't been able to summon him.

 
**Alexander:**
You haven't, huh?
Well, that's even better!

 
**Mash:**
Huh? How is it even better?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, I see. Even as his younger self, he still has a heart for adventure? I've got a bad feeling about this.

 
**Alexander:**
That's right, Doctor!
Now we get to go look for him!

 
**Alexander:**
Let's go in search of the great hero!
There was an era where you saw the Argo, right?

 
**Alexander:**
If we go there, we might be able to find him.

 
**Alexander:**
Do you remember?
When I met you in ancient Rome&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...You're right. Your presence there seemed to guide other Heroic Spirits too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I couldn't analyze the data in real time then, but you're right. That big Berserker is your...

 
**Alexander:**
My rival...or someone destined to be.
That's what I think now.

 
**Alexander:**
Yes, Darius III.
He was brought there by a “chained summoning.”

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, it makes sense.
Even with the Singularity repaired&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It might still be possible to chain summon in the Age of Exploration!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then it's settled!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master.
But the Third Singularity is&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
Okay Doctor, get ready!
We're off in search of the hero of the Iliad!

 
**Alexander:**
???
Hmm?

 
**Alexander:**
What? What is...this? This thing in front of me?

 
**Mash:**
(I thought so...)

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou?

 
**Alexander:**
What is this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's gotten into him?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's looking in shock at the sea.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
R-Right&ndash; The sea has a special meaning to him.

 
**Mash:**
Okeanos, the end of the world. What he would eventually seek later in life. The limits of his territory.

 
**Mash:**
It's said that all his conquests in his later years were to bring him to Okeanos&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Seeing the ocean should be a special thing for him...

 
**Alexander:**
...It's like there's a haze over it.

 
**Alexander:**
I can't see it, or hear it.
Hey, what's that's over there?

 
**Alexander:**
What can you hear?
I can't really hear anything.

 
**Alexander:**
I can see the land, and I can hear your voices, but...

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe young Alexander is unconsciously choosing not to see it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He can't see or hear it, huh? Maybe Iskandar the conqueror would have wanted to&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But this young Alexander might not want to see it yet.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&ndash;How romantic.
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, you're right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's kind of sad.
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. And very like him at the same time.

 


---
 
**Alexander:**
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe I should head over there with Bucephalus?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufou!
...Kyuu?

 
**Mash:**
N-No, that's&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
I'm fine. Sorry. It was a joke.
Anyway, guys, looks like we have company.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, you're right... A group of humans is approaching.
I'm not detecting any trace of magical energy from them.

 
**Alexander:**
They're... You know... Burglars or bandits...?

 
**Pirate:**
Who are ye callin' bandits?
We're pirates! Real live pirates!

 
**Pirate:**
We just stopped here to resupply, and it's our lucky day! A pretty lady and a rich little brat!

 
**Pirate:**
Ransom 'em for all they're worth!

 
**Pirate:**
Let's go, men! With our skill and pride&mdash;
It's super-plunderin' time!

 
**Pirates:**
Aye aye! Let's finish this quick so we don't have to work overtime&ndash;!

 
**Alexander:**
Hahaha, you guys are hard workers, huh?
But you shouldn't mix up work and hobbies.

 
**Mash:**
Um, just think of them as a type of bandit!
Senpai, enemy group approaching!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for combat!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're human, so don't kill them!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Master!
&ndash;Commencing combat!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Pirate:**
No way&mdash;!? He's seriously ripped for being a brat!

 
**Pirate:**
H-he's like a bodybuilder... We are no match for him! Run... Run away!

 
**Pirates:**
Uwah&ndash;!

 
**Alexander:**
Not a scrap of talent among you. Alright, run.
I won't kill you!

 
**Alexander:**
If you run, it's because you're weak!
A true plunderer leaves with a victory song!

 
**Mash:**
That's the future King of Conquerors for you.
He's very wild.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yup, very wild.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not many boys could say that.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's wild.
 


---
 
**???:**
Yup, I think so too. I see, the future King of Conquerors, huh&ndash;

 
**???:**
I heard a kid just beat up some veteran pirates, and since I was sponging off of them I came to check it out.

 
**???:**
But it looks like you're not an ordinary kid.
Interesting. And that book you've got&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
What about the Iliad?
It's my favorite book.

 
**Alexander:**
And who are you? You look “stronger” than the others.

 
**Alexander:**
...May I have your name?

 
**???:**
Wait, you don't know who I am?
I guess that'd be hard without my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou! Fou??

 
**Mash:**
Alexander, he is&mdash;

 
**Alexander:**
I know. He's a Servant.
So what's your name?

 
**???:**
So, you're not gonna introduce yourself? You ask my name and you won't even give me yours? That's rather rude.

 
**Alexander:**
That's right. I apologize.
My name is Alexander.

 
**Alexander:**
I'm the future King of Conquerors. Not that it seems real to me. This form is from before that.

 
**???:**
Alexander, huh?

 
**???:**
Man, I bet that lightning geezer would like that name.
It's a pain, but I'll remember it anyway.

 
**???:**
My name's “Achilles.” The Greek warrior written of in that book. You know that name, right?

 
**Alexander:**
!!! It's you! You're Achilles!
Oh, I can't believe this. I&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
I found you so quickly! Mash, Fujimaru!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
W-What?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is he getting excited?
 


---
 
**Alexander:**
I can't hold back my excitement!
Haha, I'm sorry, but this is so wonderful!

 
**Alexander:**
Even now, I feel an overwhelming desire to&ndash;

 
**Alexander:**
Fight him!
It's okay, right, Master?

 
**Achilles:**
I thought you'd say that.

 
**Achilles:**
I know a fighter by their smell.
Both you and I are the same type of punk.

 
**Achilles:**
But&mdash;Nah, I'm really sorry.
I'm just a freeloader, I mean, mentor now.

 
**Achilles:**
I wanted to try copying Chiron for once...
And so I've been looking after them.

 
**Achilles:**
So I won't fight you.

 
**Achilles:**
My job isn't to defeat you, it's to let these guys beat you.

 
**Pirate:**
Sir! Sir Spikey!

 
**Pirate:**
You'd really do that? For a bunch of no-name losers like us with zero attention span!?

 
**Pirate:**
Did you hear that, men! No running! Gather up, Gather up! Let's show our teacher what we can do!

 
**Pirate:**
Let's use the Achilles-style technique,
“Gang up on a lone guy and beat him up.”

 
**Pirate:**
AKA, “What to do if you see a Lancer with an unkempt beard!” Now is the time!

 
**Mash:**
I think we just heard a name for a tactic that we can never let Hektor hear, Senpai!

 
**Achilles:**
Feeling better, you losers?
Okay, now go get your butts kicked!

 
**Pirate:**
Aye aye, sir! Let's do this!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, there's no stopping them!
Resuming battle!!

 
**Alexander:**
That's fine. If a leader makes them stronger, that makes me happy.

 
**Alexander:**
I just have to defeat them all, right? Once the students are gone, the teacher will be out of work.

 
**Alexander:**
And after that&mdash;
We can fight, Achilles!

 
**Achilles:**
So you don't even think the pirates have a chance, huh? You're pretty cruel, kid! Wahahaha!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Achilles:**
Impressive. I'm not a big fan of kings,
but you, I think I like.

 
**Achilles:**
And that horse, too&mdash;
It's splendid. Truly excellent.

 
**Achilles:**
Actually, I think there are no bad Riders.
That's my theory, anyway.

 
**Alexander:**
Hah, hah... I agree, but I didn't think...
You'd have this much talent as a general!

 
**Alexander:**
The pirates' tactics were as messed up as Elisabeth's singing, and you brought them together...

 
**Alexander:**
Fighting with soldiers, not just one on one...is so much fun!

 
**Alexander:**
Someday I'll learn this feeling for myself, although really I should already know it. But I think...

 
**Alexander:**
I want to... I want to fight you more. I want to share this excitement, and the honor of the battlefield...

 
**Alexander:**
With more...people...someday...

 
**Mash:**
A-Alexander&ndash;?

 
**Alexander:**
...Zzzz.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He has the magical energy to keep going, but I guess he's just exhausted. He fell asleep.

 
**Pirate:**
...Wow, we just saw something amazing...
I can't believe we're still alive...

 
**Pirate:**
The world's big... It's too big...

 
**Pirate:**
There's flying horses that summon lightning and stuff...
I think I'm reevaluating my life!

 
**Pirate:**
Yup, I can't do this!
Being a pirate on seas like this is suicide!

 
**Pirate:**
We're better off landlocked!
Teacher, we're getting out of the pirate business!

 
**Pirate:**
We'll pay the lesson fees later! Bye!

 
**Achilles:**
H-Huh? Later? If you guys go on land you'll be arrested and thrown in prison...

 
**Achilles:**
Well, whatever. Take care, idiots!

 
**Mash:**
...Combat has concluded. No wounded on our side, and no casualties among theirs.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That was a fun fight, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is a different kind of fight altogether.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Alexander's charge on horseback and the way Achilles rallied the pirates were both amazing.

 
**Mash:**
The pirates that seemed so dangerous at first...
They were completely taken aback by it.

 
**Achilles:**
&ndash;Now then.
You guys fought hard too.

 
**Achilles:**
Good work. You're that kid's guardian, right?
I bet he gets you in all kinds of trouble.

 
**Achilles:**
One day, I'm sure he'll be a great king somewhere.
Until then, just keep an eye on him.

 
**Achilles:**
Right now he's just a little brat.
Man, look at his sleeping face.

 
**Alexander:**
...Zzzz.

 
**Mash:**
...Yeah. He looks really happy, doesn't he Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
No matter how cheerful he may seem, his actions and beliefs are filled with power. I can feel it.

 
**Mash:**
...Even if that path is filled with turmoil and chaos.

 
**Mash:**
The men he commands will probably lead happy lives.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Their lives will be busy.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It'll be hard for those around him.
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou.
