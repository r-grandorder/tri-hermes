# Caligula

<h2>Dimming Moonlight and My Precious</h2>

**Fou:**
Fou, foou!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, as for today's plans&ndash;Fou?
Wh-What is going on in this room?

 
**Mash:**
There are posters all over the wall...
Are these posters of Nero?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, Mash? You came at just the right time!
This Berserker...I mean, Caligula!

 
**Caligula:**
My...beautiful...niece...
My...beautiful...treasure...

 
**Mash:**
Th-These are all posters of the Emperor Nero...
Wh-What in the world is going on here...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know! I was suddenly called to Fujimaru's room, and this is what I found... I'd like to know why as well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you like Emperor Nero?
 
**Caligula:**
Nero...
My lovely sister's...daughter...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Imperator!!!
 
**Mash:**
What are you talking about, Senpai?!

 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ummm, I'm sorry to interrupt your fun, but Roman soldiers are wrecking havoc throughout Rome.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If we do nothing, it's going to be bad, right? This era will end up being inconsistent with the actual history.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, dammit! Why now?
Can you go, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No problem.
 
**Mash:**
Let's hurry, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I cannot allow anyone to disturb Rome's peace!
 
**Mash:**
R-Right...
What's gotten into you, Senpai?

 


---
 
**Caligula:**
My...niece's...city...
Who dares...to cause...havoc...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What?
You're going too?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Over there, Master!

 
**Caligula:**
Anyone who would commit the crime of devastating my beloved niece's Rome&ndash; Shall be punished by death!

 
**Caligula:**
&ndash;Neroooooooo!!!

 
**Mash:**
It looks like Caligula is up to the task as well!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I don't think this is quite the same...


**--BATTLE--:**

**Caligula:**
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;Hng!!
My... Ooohh&ndash;Nerooooooo!!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa! He's getting really fired up!
I-Is he, ok?

 
**Mash:**
Well, Doctor.
He may look like he's enraged,

 
**Mash:**
but he's guiding the enemy away so the city won't sustain any damage.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-Are you serious?
Even though he's a Berserker?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!

 
**Mash:**
It's obvious he has considerable love for the city of Rome. Let us continue on as well, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew... Somehow we were able to fight them off. It appears that we kept the damage to the city to a minimum.

 
**Caligula:**
The city...my lovely...niece loved...
I laud...its beauty...for all...eternity...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's going too far. What do you call that... a doting father? No, he's her uncle, so a doting uncle?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He certainly loves Emperor Nero.
 
**Mash:**
That's an odd way to express his affection, but he certainly holds Nero in high esteem.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rome, forever!
 
**Mash:**
H-Hold on a second here, Senpai! Are you all right?
Are you sure you didn't hit your head in that last battle?

 


---
 
**Caligula:**
Beautiful...So beautiful...! You eclipse even the moon...the pride of Rome...You are so beautiful!
