# Spartacus

<h2>Gladiator Circus</h2>

**Spartacus:**
Master! Ye who's not an oppressor,
but destined to become an oppressor one day.

 
**Spartacus:**
Yes. I see that you're confused.
I understand, we're inside the camp of a Roman army.

 
**Spartacus:**
And at this moment, we're going to show them our strengths. So it seems that I cannot avoid my destiny for battle.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where is this place?
 


---
 
**Spartacus:**
Not to worry.
We both share the same destiny.

 
**Spartacus:**
Although if you do end up being an oppressor,
I'll have no choice but to cut down your head&ndash;

 
**Spartacus:**
Perhaps, I should've cut you down the day you became my "Master." But for now... I shall accompany you.

 
**Spartacus:**
Or, maybe... No, as long as you're a "Master"
there's no use. It's sad, but that's destiny.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please listen to me.
 


---
 
**Spartacus:**
It is time now for battle and bloodshed. The road forward from here will be a living hell. Yes, my blood will seethe.

 
**Spartacus:**
And my muscles, organs, skin, and all that I am will tremble with delight!

 
**Mash:**
Um... Master, Master.
I don't want to bother you when you look so confused.

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;And I know this is sudden.
But it looks like we're captured.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How come?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
All I know is that we were already like this when I woke up. See? Even Fou has cute little shackles on.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
It seems that we will be forced to fight as combatants&ndash;as Gladiators.

 
**Spartacus:**
You there, puppets of the oppressor.
Come out. I'll take you on as much as you like.

 
**Mash:**
And what's making this even worse,
Spartacus is really in the mood for a fight...

 
**Mash:**
Rather than think our way out of this,
it might be better for us to fight.

 
**Spartacus:**
All right, so we'll start with a warm-up, eh?

 
**Mash:**
Master, orders, please.
All right, let's begin!

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?

 
**Spartacus:**
It is over, sad and fragile.
And no one would sing of their praises.

 
**Spartacus:**
They stood before us, without a shred of fear in their body, they charged at us.

 
**Spartacus:**
Now that's courage. A great and might conviction,
something an oppressor will never have.

 
**Spartacus:**
Hail them! Hail these warriors!
Not me, but them!

 
**Mash:**
...Master.
Wait a little while longer before giving orders.

 
**Spartacus:**
Ah-ha! You're next?
Come at me!

 
**Mash:**
A-A lion?
Master, your orders! This could be a real fight&ndash;!

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Or maybe not.

 
**Mash:**
Now that I think about it, Spartacus was always renown for being a great gladiator.

 
**Mash:**
On this kind of battlefield, he can handle this all alone without a problem.

 
**Spartacus:**
&ndash;This stench! It reeks! This is the stench of impatience. Mixed with the stench of rage.

 
**Spartacus:**
It's the stench of animosity, that they will not let us return alive. In that case, I am already prepared!

 
**Spartacus:**
Monsters! Bring out the monsters that you people sealed away with your oppression!

 
**Spartacus:**
That is their way to becoming free!
For as long as our interests conflict, I will crush them!

 
**Spartacus:**
Yet, when all has ended, I shall weep! I will take their hands, and shed tears of blood for their destiny.

 
**Mash:**
...This time, it is my turn...right?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Spartacus:**
Hmm. A warrior with the head of a beast, eh?
I am ready. Let each of us now fight for our freedom!

 
**Spartacus:**
Wahahahahahahahahahahaha&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
We've defeated the werebeasts&ndash;but.
From what I can see, it looks like more are on the way!

 
**Mash:**
Now it's&ndash;!

 
**Spartacus:**
Now it's the merging of a woman and a serpent.
But, whoever appears before me shall be a warrior.

 
**Spartacus:**
Will that torso of yours curl around me and crush me first? Or will my blade pierce your torso first.

 
**Spartacus:**
The bone crushing battle shall wait no longer!
I'll gladly vanquish my foe!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew... When Spartacus got Lamia in that suplex,
I wasn't sure how it would turn out.

 
**Spartacus:**
All right, what's next?

 
**Spartacus:**
Oh, another lion? ...No, it's not.
This is...a lion, yet a lot more ferocious!

 
**Mash:**
Could it be&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
A Chimera?

 
**Spartacus:**
What an abomination! Well, never in my lifetime have I encountered a creature like this!

 
**Spartacus:**
The trembling that I feel is by no means my imagination.
Let's do this, great lion!

 
**Spartacus:**
I shall risk my life&ndash;to obtain my freedom!
Gaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgh&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Spartacus:**
I am...victorious...

 
**Mash:**
I'm exhausted...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well done!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You fought well!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Thank you.

 
**Spartacus:**
All right, what's next?...Hmm?
What is the meaning of this?

 
**Spartacus:**
The Roman soldiers have disappeared.
The campsite is gone, too.

 
**Spartacus:**
Hm. ...What's this? Now I'm troubled.
What am I going to do now that the oppressor is gone.

 
**Spartacus:**
I was to regain my freedom after I defeat the oppressor.
Now that he's gone, how am I going to...

 
Wait! Could this be what true freedom&ndash;tastes like?
Master, what do you think?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, let me see...
 


---
 
**Spartacus:**
Wait, there're more oppressors out there in the world.
My fight won't end until I've defeated them all.

 
**Spartacus:**
Yes, without a doubt&ndash; Until that day arrives,
you're coming with me to the depths of hell.

 
**Spartacus:**
Oh, my Master!
