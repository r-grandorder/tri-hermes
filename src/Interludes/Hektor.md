## Hektor

<h2>Trojan Guardian</h2>

**Mash:**
Master, Hektor would like to ask something.

 
**Hektor:**
Hey Master, you there?

 
**Hektor:**
You don't have to be so on edge.
I'm your Servant now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm not on edge.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not worried.
 


---
 
**Hektor:**
I see. Good. So anyway,
there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

 
**Hektor:**
Mind if I ask you too, Mash?

 
**Mash:**
N-Not at all. Go ahead...

 
**Hektor:**
Okay, well I'll get straight to the point.
I'm not using all of my power right now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Going easy?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're strong if you tried?
 


---
 
**Hektor:**
Right. Of course, I'm not trying to go easy or anything,
and I could be powerful if I tried, you know?

 
**Hektor:**
But my Noble Phantasm...
It's gotten a bit weaker.

 
**Mash:**
Durandal, right? I think you called it...
Durindana, was it?

 
**Hektor:**
Yeah, that's the name, I think.

 
**Mash:**
Wouldn't it be better for you to remember its True Name?

 
**Hektor:**
Well... Ha, ha, ha. To be honest, I don't really care what lance I have as long as I can throw it.

 
**Hektor:**
It's natural for great swords and lances to break left and right on the battlefield.

 
**Hektor:**
And even if it didn't break, it's lost once you throw it.
So you learn to make do with whatever you've got.

 
**Hektor:**
To be honest, this old man can even kill someone with a single stone. Whether they're a Heroic Spirit or not.

 
**Hektor:**
Well, in any event. This lance is legendary in later generations.

 
**Hektor:**
I need to get it sharpened again, ya'know. Let me see.
As long as I can cut down 100 more people with it&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...Then how about you do some training in a programmed simulation?

 
**Hektor:**
A virtual battle, huh?
I guess I can't be picky.

 
**Hektor:**
Master, what do you think?
Want to help this old man with some training?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Guess I have to.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not a problem.
 


---
 
**Hektor:**
Good. Quick answers like that show one's true nature.
You're a great Master after all.

 
**Hektor:**
All right. Let's go.

 
**Mash:**
Okay, we're here.
So about those enemies&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
How about we get started with the humanoid ones first?

 
**Hektor:**
Okay, we'll use that for warm-up, then.
All right Master&ndash;give me your orders!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Hektor:**
I'm starting to get the hang of this.
Let's kick it up a notch.

 
**Hektor:**
Master, add fifty more!
Raise the level just a little, too!

 
**Mash:**
G-Got it.
I'll summon some ghost-type enemies next.

 
**Hektor:**
All right. You can't kill fog by piercing or cutting it&ndash;

 
**Hektor:**
You must scatter it,
like a raging storm!

 
**Hektor:**
Give me your orders, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Hektor:**
Whew.

 
**Mash:**
Confirming the elimination of all ghosts.
The next set will be the last.

 
**Hektor:**
If we're on the last set,
then bring me a really strong one next.

 
**Hektor:**
If you want, I can even take on a dragon.

 
**Mash:**
In that case&ndash;I'll summon a dragon-type enemy for you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you serious!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're joking, right!?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Huh? That was a joke?
I already started the summoning process!

 
**Hektor:**
It'll be fine. No problem.
My duty is to protect my Master.

 
**Hektor:**
You know this old man, when it comes to holding the line, guard duty, defense&ndash;

 
**Hektor:**
Basically, anything involving protecting something or someone... I've never lost before.

 
**Hektor:**
The Achilles thing was different!

 
**Hektor:**
Now Master, give me your orders!
As your shield and fortress&ndash;I pledge to fight, yeah?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
I've confirmed its defeat!
That was impressive, Hektor.

 
**Hektor:**
Yeah, yeah. This old man pushed himself a bit too hard.
My shoulders and back hurt all over.

 
**Hektor:**
I think Durindana's got its sharpness back a little.
Guess I'll call it good for now.

 
**Hektor:**
Anyway, let's head back. &ndash;Oh, yeah.
I guess I can be a bit more useful from now on?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please continue to lend us your strength.
 


---
 
**Hektor:**
I see.
Then I'll do the best I can.

 
**Mash:**
...I'm not sure if this is the case,
but maybe that ocean battle was on Hektor's mind?

 
**Mash:**
To him it might be the distant past,
but to us it's like yesterday.

 
**Mash:**
So maybe he's trying to show he can be a good Servant...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I trust him.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...I suppose you're right. That's what a Servant is, after all.

 
**Mash:**
He is the one who answered our summons, so I'm sure that's a happy thing and not a troubling matter.

 
**Mash:**
Let's continue to have him fight by our side.
