# Beowulf

## Grendel's Second Coming

**Beowulf:**
Anomaly during summons?

 
**Mash:**
Yes...

 
**Mash:**
The Doctor says that when you were summoned, there was a disturbance during this era in this spot.

 
**Mash:**
That might be the reason why you can't unlock your second Noble Phantasm.

 
**Beowulf:**
Something else was summoned at the same time...
The answer's simple.

 
**Mash:**
So&ndash;you think it's Grendel?

 
**Beowulf:**
No doubt. I can't think of anything besides him that could influence the summoning process.

 
**Beowulf:**
It's true there are nameless fire dragons out there...

 
**Beowulf:**
But Grendel was the only monster with such fierce hate and glory in my life.

 
**Beowulf:**
He was an evil creature who played with people's lives.

 
**Beowulf:**
The kind of evil that reveled in the meaningless slaughter of people trapped in their dwellings.

 
**Beowulf:**
I can understand fights over territory,
or animals just fighting for survival.

 
**Beowulf:**
But&ndash;Grendel had both reason and intellect and was simply evil.

 
**Beowulf:**
That's why his very existence...
is far more of a threat to me than that of a fire dragon.

 
**Beowulf:**
Fire dragons are passive as long as you leave their treasure alone. But Grendel's a twisted monster who revels in evil.

 
**Beowulf:**
If he revived as a side-effect of my summoning&ndash;
I gotta kill him.

 
**Mash:**
...Then let's go. The last response was in the old castle up ahead.

 
**Mash:**
If you take a look at it, maybe you'll figure something out.

 
**Beowulf:**
Okay.
Let's go, Master.

 
**Beowulf:**
There are some things that shouldn't exist in this world.
Grendel is one of them.

 
**Mash:**
It's&ndash;deserted.
Not a soul to be seen.

 
**Beowulf:**
I can smell blood.
It seems we missed our chance.

 
**Mash:**
Ugh...

 
**Beowulf:**
Mash, can you tell? Looks like every last human in this castle was slaughtered.

 
**Beowulf:**
...Damn.
This isn't good.

 
**Beowulf:**
The more human flesh he consumes, the more powerful and evil he gets. We have to crush him before he attains his perfect form.

 
**Mash:**
But, where is he&ndash;?

 
**Beowulf:**
Something's close!
Mash, prepare for battle!

 
**Mash:**
It's coming!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Beowulf:**
Damn... We didn't take it down!

 
**Mash:**
W-Was that a chimera?

 
**Beowulf:**
Grendel is a protean creature.
He can change his form depending on the situation.

 
**Beowulf:**
That's why I need Hrunting,
because it tracks enemies.

 
**Beowulf:**
Let's go after him. Follow me!

 
**Beowulf:**
So, here...

 
**Soldier A:**
H-Help me...

 
**Mash:**
That...

 
**Soldier A:**
Help me...

 
**Mash:**
Wait, now!

 
**Beowulf:**
Stop!

 
**Mash:**
!?

 
**Mash:**
Wh-Why&ndash;!?

 
**Beowulf:**
...Enough of this stupid farce, Grendel.
Hrunting is eager to bite into you.

 
**???:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
What, a fake&ndash;?

 
**Beowulf:**
Something like that!
Let's go, Master. It's not a human, so don't hold back!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Beowulf:**
He ran away again. Listen up, young lady.
Don't trust whoever it is you next meet in this castle.

 
**Beowulf:**
Also, don't be surprised by who you run into.
He can read your mind like a book.

 
**Beowulf:**
When he appears again, he'll likely take the form of someone we know.

 
**Beowulf:**
Brace yourself, it's gonna be painful.


**--ARROW--:**

**Beowulf:**
Just a little more...
Hey, come on out already!

 
**Jeanne:**
...
...

 
**Nero:**
...
...

 
**Drake:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
...T-These are all fakes!?

 
**Beowulf:**
Right. What looks like armor and clothes is hardened skin. The weapons are extensions of claws and hair.

 
**Beowulf:**
Pretty nasty, right?
That's why he's evil.

 
**Beowulf:**
But luckily it looks like we can kill him before he starts talking to us.

 
**Mash:**
He talks?

 
**Beowulf:**
Only based on the speech in the memories he extracts.

 
**Grendel:**
...N-No.
I'm just...not...used...to this body yet.

 
**Grendel:**
I don't know...why I was...summoned.
But...I'll do what...I have to.

 
**Mash:**
What on earth...

 
**Grendel:**
I'll kill you...in a cruel way.
Every last one...in cold blood.

 
**Grendel:**
That's how it is.
That's how it must be.

 
**Grendel:**
That's what makes me Grendel. Like how I feasted on the human souls back in that castle!

 
**Beowulf:**
Shut up. You probably just heard that from your mom. I'll make sure the two of you are nice and cozy together in hell.

 
**Beowulf:**
Master, let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Grendel:**
D-Damn you!

 
**Mash:**
Ugh... I feel queasy... I know they're fakes, but the sensation when you hit them...

 
**Mash:**
But it's all over now, right?
There's no response. Let's head back.

 
**Beowulf:**
...
...Master, don't you think something's off?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know.
 
**Beowulf:**
I see...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, vaguely.
 
**Beowulf:**
You've got a sharp nose.
That's my Master.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
What do you mean?

 
**Beowulf:**
It's a vicious creature we're dealing with.
Not the sort to accept death without a struggle.

 
**Beowulf:**
...Something smells.
Can we search a little longer?

 
**Mash:**
Okay... If you think it's a good idea,
there's no problem.


**--ARROW--:**

**Mash:**
He's nowhere to be found...

 
**Fou:**
...Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Fou?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou, fou!

 
**Mash:**
...Below us?

 
**Beowulf:**
Oh, damn, I didn't notice.
This castle has a cellar. Let's check it out.

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe the cellar connects to a place like this...

 
**Beowulf:**
So that thing faked his death and fled here.
Which means&ndash;

 
**Grendel:**
Ugh... D-Damn you...

 
**Beowulf:**
We've got you cornered.
Your mom's not here, buddy.

 
**Beowulf:**
I'll send you to hell where you belong!
I, Beowulf, will show you no mercy!

 
**Grendel:**
I could say...the same...
I've read the memory...of the one who killed you!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Beowulf:**
It's over, Grendel.
You're a monster that's not meant to be summoned.

 
**Beowulf:**
We'll likely never meet again.
...Dammit, I met the one I wanted to meet the least.

 
**Grendel:**
Wh-Why...
The one...who killed...you...

 
**Beowulf:**
Actually, you're the one I fear the most in this world.
The fire dragon simply dealt the killing blow.

 
**Beowulf:**
It was strong, but didn't frighten me.
I also now have dependable allies, unlike then.

 
**Beowulf:**
You're a fool to not see that.

 
**Beowulf:**
Good riddance, masquerader.
You should've had a bit more faith in your own strength.

 
**Grendel:**
D-Damn you!

 
**Mash:**
Seems we really got him this time!

 
**Beowulf:**
Guess so. My Noble Phantasm is unlocked now.

 
**Beowulf:**
In the future you'll face punks looking for a fight.
When that happens, let me help you.

 
**Beowulf:**
Well then, I guess we should head back, Master! Time for our triumphant return! Hah hah!
