# Medusa

<h2>Gorgon's Bride</h2>

**Medusa:**
(sigh...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's up?
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
Oh, Fujimaru. Actually...I was offered a chance for an arranged marriage...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh-huh...Wait, did you say arranged marriage!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
From whom!?
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
I have two older sisters, and they approached me about having a formal marriage interview.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-Okay...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So who are you meeting?
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
Well, I don't think they're that serious about matchmaking.

 
**Medusa:**
I have a feeling that they're just interested in my reactions...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't you turn it down?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's turn it down!
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
Sure..., but my sisters gave me a condition for turning it down...

 
**Mash:**
...So, you and Senpai must pretend to be a couple.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, cheer up, Mash. It's just a performance, not like they're going to actually link their arms or kiss...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, maybe they should?
Unless they do, they won't be seen as a couple.

 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Medusa:**
Uh, well, I don't know.
You know, I'm not used to that kind of stuff...

 
**Mash:**
...Whew.
Well, of course, not you of all people, Medusa.

 
**Medusa:**
I'm not really happy either that you felt so relieved...
I'm just not used to being in a relationship...

 
**Medusa:**
At any rate, I'm sorry, Fujimaru.
For making you go through the extra trouble.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
[♂ I look forward to dating you. /♀️ Have you noticed that I'm a woman?}
 
**Medusa:**
[♂ Oh, me too. /♀️ Of course, but I don't mind actually...}

 


---
 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, let me shoot the video evidence.
You back me up, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, understood.

 
**Medusa:**
Hehe, I enjoy doing stuff like this once in a while.
Though I'm sorry to trouble you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't have to be sorry.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd rather be ready to enjoy it.
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
Really?
You have odd taste in things.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now, now, Mash, it's high time you got over it.

 
**Young Man:**
Hey, lady. Look at your sexy body.
Why don't you hang out with us?

 
**Medusa:**
...? Fujimaru, who are they talking about?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They're talking to you, Medusa.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hmm, this is so typical...
 


---
 
**Young Man:**
Heehee...I'm sure it'll be more fun to hang out with us than a kid like that.

 
**Medusa:**
I'm sorry, but I'm enjoying my time with Fujimaru right now.

 
**Medusa:**
I'd appreciate it if you could quickly disappear from my sight...

 
**Young Man:**
What the heck? What a snob...
Hey, you guys. Teach her a lesson!

 
**Medusa:**
...Well. I may be used to it, but the fact that it's the same as always gives me a headache.

 
**Medusa:**
I'm sorry, Fujimaru.
Give me a little time to take out some trash.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Young Man:**
Wh-What the hell...this woman...
D-Damn it!! Boss!! Call the Boss!!

 
**Boss:**
Let me see... Ha!
You can't even handle a woman and a few kids?

 
**Young Man:**
Yeah, but that woman's a "giant" with "crazy strength."

 
**Medusa:**
...(Humph)

 
**Boss:**
Tsk, letting a single woman have her way with you.
Well, I do agree that small and cute girls are better.

 
**Boss:**
I'd turn down a "giant" like that even if she asked me out.

 
**Medusa:**
...(Ticked)

 
**Young Man:**
Hehe! With our Boss here, we're not afraid of you any more!! Hey, guys!! Let's take her down!!

 
**Medusa:**
...Master.
May I go all-out?

 
**Medusa:**
No, I'm not angry, I'm really not...
It's just that my mystic eyes are aching.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, let's back her up...!!
Oh, it looks like we don't need to do that.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Boss:**
?!?!?! (Freeze)

 
**Young Man:**
Whoa!? Boss turned to stone?
Dammit, I'm going to get you for this!

 
**Medusa:**
Whew... I lost my temper a little there.
Fujimaru, I apologize.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't mind.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It happens.
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
Hehe... you're a kind person.
I appreciate your concern.

 
**Medusa:**
Besides, you treat even someone like me like a normal person.

 
**Medusa:**
Anyone who approached me would turn to stone, their faces twisted in horror...

 
**Mash:**
Medusa...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The monster Medusa... The Gorgon...
By the way, how do your sisters look...

 
**Mash:**
Doctor!

 
**Medusa:**
My sisters are very cute.
They are not at all violent, unlike me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're cute, too!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're close with your sisters, huh?
 


---
 
**Medusa:**
!!!

 
**Medusa:**
...Thank you, Fujimaru.
I like being around you.

 
**Medusa:**
I'm inexperienced, but let's get along from now too.
