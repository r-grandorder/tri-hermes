# Tristan

<h2>It Begins with Loss</h2>

**Narration:**
These are the things I let go of...the things I lost.

 
**Narration:**
I reach out, but the distance is infinite,
which only compounds my melancholy.

 
**Narration:**
And so I surrender, I stop my vain efforts,
and return to my own tasks.

 
**Narration:**
Ah...that is probably the beginning of my mistakes.
This hand is, truly...

 
**Mash:**
Is that a harp...?
It must be Tristan.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Somehow sounds even more sad than usual.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's playing something different, isn't he?


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**Mash:**
The music that he usually plays combines both cold vibrations and warm rhythms. But this...

 
**Mash:**
I can sense a heavy sadness, like someone is lost at the bottom of the sea all alone...

 
**Bedivere:**
Oh? It appears Sir Tristan is thinking of something sad.

 
**Mash:**
Bedivere...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something sad?


---
 
**Bedivere:**
The music that the knight plays usually reflects his present mood.

 
**Bedivere:**
If he's happy, he plays a happy tune. When he's sad, a sad song. He can express even the most complex of emotions with his harp.

 
**Mordred:**
Aww, Bird Boy is sad again?
That's a switch.

 
**Mash:**
Mordred!

 
**Bedivere:**
Mordred, do you have any idea why Sir Tristan is so melancholy today?

 
**Mordred:**
'Course not.
...Ehh...maaaybe...

 
**Mordred:**
If that dork, a guy so dense he could sleep through a parade, is sad...

 
**Mordred:**
It's gotta be because of our king or some girl.

 
**Mordred:**
Either one of those'll set him off real fast.

 
**Bedivere:**
That's true...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He slept through a parade?


---
 
**Bedivere:**
Yes...

 
**Bedivere:**
After a victorious expedition,
we returned home in triumph with our king.

 
**Bedivere:**
We received a joyous reception from the citizenry.

 
**Bedivere:**
But...while we were riding through the fanfare...
Sir Tristan was asleep on his horse.

 
**Bedivere:**
Sir Lancelot obvious reprimanded him, but he may even have been sleeping through the lecture.

 
**Mordred:**
Eh, looking at that guy you can't hardly tell if he's asleep or awake anyway!

 
**Mordred:**
Unless something is REALLY serious, he's always got his eyes closed. Somehow he's still aware of his surroundings, though.

 
**Bedivere:**
I read somewhere that animals like bats and whales possess an ability called echolocation.

 
**Bedivere:**
Perhaps Sir Tristan is like that.

 
**Mash:**
That is...certainly a theory.

 
**Mordred:**
Well then, he's got to be a bat! We're already not sure whether he's a bird or a human anyway!

 
**Bedivere:**
Well, that is quite rude, Sir Mordred.
But Sir Tristan's nerves are truly mystifying.

 
**Bedivere:**
He possesses sensitivity, impudence,
transience, and incorrigibility...

 
**Bedivere:**
An animal that is tranquil, unreadable, but is said to shed tears at times...indeed, I suppose comparing him to a whale is appropriate.

 
**Tristan:**
...Sir Bedivere.
Sir Mordred.

 
**Mordred:**
Ack!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Tristan.

 
**Tristan:**
I have come, Master.

 
**Tristan:**
I've heard my name bandied about with some unkind words.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's those two.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something about a bat or whale...


---
 
**Tristan:**
That is...hmmm. A bat is out of the question because they are lacking in eloquence, but I suppose a whale isn't so bad.

 
**Mordred:**
Eh? Seriously!?

 
**Bedivere:**
See what I mean?
That's what this whale-man is like.

 
**Mordred:**
What the heck!? Bats fly and they suck blood! They are SO much cooler than whales! They're freakin' badass!

 
**Tristan:**
...Ah, I am suddenly stricken with sadness.
So, a bad man is what you see as beautiful...

 
**Tristan:**
As knights, I believe we must change that perspective. The same goes for the heartless Sir Bedivere.

 
**Tristan:**
Haha...my fingers are itching to play music.
It's been a while, but shall I play some battle songs?

 
**Mordred:**
Um...it's time for my training!
See ya!

 
**Bedivere:**
And I remembered I need to return the books I borrowed from the library. I'm thrice overdue, so I must be sure to return them today!

 
**Tristan:**
...(Sigh)

 
**Mash:**
Tristan, are you mad?

 
**Tristan:**
No, not at all.

 
**Tristan:**
It's hardly news that Mordred is so...lively,
nor that Bedivere is so strict with me.

 
**Tristan:**
But I am not known as Tristan,
the Child of Sadness for nothing.

 
**Tristan:**
The sadness that I bear in my heart does not simply disappear so easily.

 
**Tristan:**
So during our next battle simulation, I shall stand against him and focus my attention on my target!

 
**Mash:**
(He's so angry!)

 
**Tristan:**
Though I have to admit...I am at least a little angry after hearing that conversation.

 
**Tristan:**
(Sigh)... Sir Bedivere really knows how to push my buttons...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By the way, that harp...
 
**Tristan:**
Ah, I see you've noticed.
...I was remembering the past.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did something sad happen?
 
**Tristan:**
How direct of you. Yes...I was remembering something very sad from very long ago.

 


---
 
**Tristan:**
I was thinking of Iseult.

 
**Mash:**
Isn't Iseult your...

 
**Tristan:**
There were, in fact, two Iseults in my lifetime.

 
**Tristan:**
One was the Iseult I loved.
The other was the Iseult with white hands who loved me.

 
**Tristan:**
...Most people get the wrong idea about this story if I tell it.

 
**Tristan:**
They think of it as a story of an immoral two-timer, figuring that makes sense for a handsome man like me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well...
 
**Tristan:**
It's fine.
No need to sugarcoat your words.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't you love them both?
 
**Tristan:**
Yes.
And that is the problem.

 


---
 
**Tristan:**
Ultimately, did I really love someone?

 
**Mash:**
Eh...!?

 
**Tristan:**
According to legend, my falling in love was the work of a love potion.

 
**Tristan:**
That mad, passionate feeling...I never once felt it with the Iseult with the white hands.

 
**Tristan:**
But that was just the effects of the potion. Could it have been a mistake...a fleeting dream one night?

 
**Tristan:**
Yes. And all this seems to come from the fact that I was never loved once, not from the moment I was born.

 
**Tristan:**
As I never knew love during my childhood,
perhaps I never learned to love others.

 
**Tristan:**
Thinking on such things immediately drags me down, and the next thing I knew, I was playing this music.

 
**Mash:**
No, I don't think that is true.

 
**Mash:**
Tristan, you're the sort who would never think twice about sacrificing his life for others.

 
**Tristan:**
Ah, that is simply how a knight should be.

 
But...ah, however...

 
**Tristan:**
As Sir Bedivere mentioned,
maybe I do fail as a human being?

 
**Tristan:**
As a melancholy dragon who never knew love, I can't help but to think I may well end up crushed under Martha's foot!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
STOP!
 
**Tristan:**
But I'm not moving.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calm down!!!
 
**Tristan:**
I am calm.
My heart is beating at a normal rate.

 
**Tristan:**
I can check my pulse if you would like.

 


---
 
**Gawain:**
Haha, Tristan's up to his old tricks. Once he gets started on a self-loathing rant, there's really no stopping him. He'll be at this for a while.

 
**Mash:**
Gawain!

 
**Tristan:**
Sir Gawain...

 
**Tristan:**
But...I'm sure even you would not understand my suffering.

 
**Gawain:**
Of course I wouldn't understand. Not so much your sadness as WHY you are always getting so sad.

 
**Gawain:**
Nobody can best you when it comes to loving someone...at least that's what I think.

 
**Gawain:**
Love is a shapeless thing to begin with.
Even loyalty is a type of love, wouldn't you agree?

 
**Gawain:**
It has nothing to do with physical lust.
The intensity of passion is also meaningless.

 
**Gawain:**
For example, let's say that there is a man who was weak and mild-mannered. He then took a woman to be his wife...

 
**Gawain:**
But then, a powerful entity threatened his life, unless he would trade it for his wife. And the man, sadly, complied.

 
**Gawain:**
Would you say that he did not love his wife?

 
**Gawain:**
Who are we, who are much better able to fight such a being, to say that such a man did not love his wife?

 
**Tristan:**
Well...

 
**Gawain:**
Love is not just about not wanting to let go.
It's not that you don't know love...

 
**Tristan:**
I...

 
**Gawain:**
...My apologies. I may have overstepped my bounds...
I got too aggressive, just as I do in battle.

 
**Gawain:**
Master. Please do not trouble yourself about Tristan's lamentations.

 
**Gawain:**
This cloud of sadness can simply be blown away by force. Working up a sweat in the simulator should distract him.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Care to try, Tristan?


---
 
**Tristan:**
...I suppose.

 
**Tristan:**
It feels a touch impulsive and perhaps even brutish, but I suppose I should try Sir Gawain's idea.

 
**Tristan:**
Very well, then, Master, please give me your orders.

 
**Tristan:**
In my present wavering state, it's best if I ask you to make the decisions here.

 
**Gawain:**
Then use a simulation of me for his opponent.
Please make him as strong as possible.

 
**Gawain:**
After all, the intention here is to distract Sir Tristan from his perpetual melancholy.

 
**Gawain:**
His opponent should be a knight with all the force and power of the sun!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A full-power Gawain!?
 
**Mash:**
...I'm having trauma flashbacks, too, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
For Tristan's sake, let's give him all our support!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good luck Tristan!
 
**Tristan:**
Yes, I am well aware of how terrifying a full-powered Sir Gawain can be.

 
**Tristan:**
I shall set aside my inner anguish for now and concentrate on fighting!

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Good work, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
...He was strong.

 
**Tristan:**
What a brute. So much so that I nearly lost the melody that has been in my head this whole time.

 
**Tristan:**
Fortunately, that let me concentrate on the battle.

 
**Tristan:**
Still, I can hardly believe the pain that even a Servant can feel!

 
**Tristan:**
No wonder others call this a second life.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't get too hung up on it.
 
**Tristan:**
I will try.

 
**Tristan:**
I cannot forget that if I become a burden to my Master,
I am a failure as a knight.

 
**Tristan:**
I shall set my sadness aside.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If you want to talk...
 
**Tristan:**
Yes, I know I can come to you, Master.
I have no intention of keeping secrets from you.

 


---
 
**Tristan:**
My song has a certain bounce to it now.
It seems tonight I will be playing a pleasant tune.

 
**Tristan:**
Good night, Master.
May we both have pleasant dreams.

 
**Narration:**
...I dreamt I became a bird and flew through the air.

 
**Narration:**
I've always felt that dreams of this sort are philosophical in a way.

 
**Narration:**
Something about seeking freedom.
Or something like a bird is dreaming about you.

 
**Narration:**
But that is not possible.

 
**Narration:**
My name is Tristan. A Knight of the Round Table...
No, I am a Heroic Spirit. A Servant. An Archer.

 
**Narration:**
I open my eyes with conviction.
I know Master is before me.

 
**Narration:**
Master does not look bewildered.
[♂ He /♀️ She} looks straight at me.

 
**Narration:**
[♂ He /♀️ She} is not strict like my king,
but also not gentle like a saint.

 
**Narration:**
I was captivated by those intensely human eyes.

 
**Narration:**
Master, am I dreaming?

 
**Narration:**
In response, [♂ he /♀️ she} nodded.

 
**Tristan:**
I see.
So we're in my dream.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's how this usually goes, yeah...


---
 
**Tristan:**
I see.

 
**Tristan:**
In brief, this is more the inside of a Servant's mental world than it is a dream.

 
**Tristan:**
I had no idea that you fought for any purpose other than restoring humanity, whether in or outside Servants' dreams.

 
**Tristan:**
You work so much, Master.
So hard and so tirelessly.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not really.
 
**Tristan:**
Is that so?

 
**Tristan:**
But when you do awaken,
please use me as you would a manservant.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is actually fun.
 
**Tristan:**
...What? Your mental fortitude is enough to cause even me to open my eyes in shock.

 
**Tristan:**
No...could it be that after so many harsh battles,
you are simply always mentally prepared for more?

 
**Tristan:**
That is impressive all on its own. I should like to be so strong, but that is a difficult thing to be...

 


---
 
**Tristan:**
So this grassy plain is my mental world?
It's peaceful, but boring.

 
**Tristan:**
...No, I'm being too harsh.

 
**Tristan:**
If there is some entity lurking in my psyche,
then danger is sure to be nearby.

 
**Tristan:**
We must cautious, even of something so small as a rabbit. After all, even a tiny, innocent rabbit may turn out to be the dreaded vorpal bunny.

 
**Tristan:**
Its got sharp...well, it bites HARD! Even the eleventh of our number, Sir Bors, was decapitated by a single attack from the dreaded vorpal bunny.

 
**Tristan:**
Under the light of the sun, Sir Gawain was forced to use all his strength to hold the rabbit down while Sir Lancelot beat it with Arondight!

 
**Tristan:**
And then Sir Mordred darted in and kicked it viciously! And Merlin just...kept talking about the king like a broken record.

 
**Tristan:**
And, finally, we defeated this greatest of foes!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's...really a thing?


---
 
**Tristan:**
...

 
**Tristan:**
My apologies, Master. I may have embellished a bit.
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Keep your day job, Tristan.
 
**Tristan:**
How odd...
Sir Bedivere always found that story hilarious.

 
**Tristan:**
Could it be...that he was faking it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-is that so...?
 
**Tristan:**
During our next Round Table discussion,
I will definitely try to make Master laugh.

 


---
 
**Tristan:**
Ah, it seems the real beast has come upon us while we were japing.

 
**Tristan:**
Is that a beast within my heart,
or is it my malicious thoughts given form?

 
**Tristan:**
Either way, Master.
Let's fight together.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tristan:**
They were not so tough.

 
**Tristan:**
If that is the evil that dwells in my heart,
it is...unimpressive.

 
**Tristan:**
But I thought all would be resolved when we defeated those enemies...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're not waking up, though...


---
 
**Tristan:**
I'm terribly sorry.
It's almost nightfall.

 
**Tristan:**
How odd for night to come even in my dreams.

 
**Tristan:**
You must be tired.
Let's find an inn so you can rest.

 
**Narration:**
But to be honest,
I'm not sure where we are in the first place.

 
**Narration:**
We have no choice but to wander aimlessly. Aside from the beast we encountered, we haven't come across a single living being.

 
**Narration:**
Troubling.

 
**Narration:**
I asked Master whether a ritual of some sort was needed to wake us up, but [♂ he /♀️ she} did not have a definitive answer.

 
**Narration:**
Rather, [♂ he /♀️ she} asked if anything rang a bell to me.

 
**Narration:**
I was asked, so I thought.
Something necessary to wake up...

 
**Narration:**
I thought of two options.
First was suicide.

 
**Narration:**
In other words, if I slit my own throat, I would probably wake up. However, I doubt that was the answer to our troubles.

 
**Narration:**
If this was, by chance, an illusion established by the enemy, I would be a fool who abandoned my master.

 
**Narration:**
The second option: find my true enemy.

 
**Narration:**
It was hard to believe that that beast was the enemy who dwelled within my heart. There must be an entity...a source...that had given life to that beast.

 
**Tristan:**
...Hm?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that...a city?


---
 
**Tristan:**
Let's check it out, Master. That may at least spare us having to camp outside for the night.

 
**Tristan:**
It's...empty...
And this city is...

 
**Narration:**
A faint memory seems to be stirring...

 
**Narration:**
My instincts were screaming,
warning me not to set foot in this place.

 
**Tristan:**
Master. Let's get out of here immediately.
This city is dangerous.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But...


---
 
**Tristan:**
You are right in thinking this place is deserted,
but that is precisely why it is so dangerous.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Isn't this Camelot?


---
 
**Tristan:**
...!!!

 
**Tristan:**
How...do you know the name of this city?
No, I guess it's obvious.

 
**Tristan:**
We are in the Singularity...Camelot.
It should have been restored already...

 
**Tristan:**
...But that person is not here!

 
**Tristan:**
Even if they were here, I would...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Choose.


---
 
**Tristan:**
...Master?

 
**Narration:**
It is surprising how much can be learned from the sound of breathing alone.

 
**Narration:**
It can tell us whether someone is calm, angry, or sad...whether they are lying, happy, or even waiting for a chance to strike and kill.

 
**Narration:**
But the breath that you, Master, just drew when you spoke, was not that of a human being.

 
**Tristan:**
You are not Master.
If you are not Master...

 
**Tristan:**
YOU were the one who was dwelling within me!

 
**Gawain?:**
Hahaha. You, sir, get overeager and make a terrible mistake at the crucial moment.

 
**Tristan:**
!?

 
**Gawain?:**
See, this is what happens when you abandon your attack to simply wait and see what happens.

 
**Gawain?:**
You wouldn't be in this mess had you already taken down the unknown entity disguised as Master.

 
**Tristan:**
You are...no, not Sir Gawain.

 
**Tristan:**
To take his form disgraces us all.
You must disappear immediately.

 
**Lancelot?:**
Ah, Sir Tristan.
What led you to that conclusion?

 
**Lancelot?:**
You have no basis for saying so. We are mere Servants who are not even Heroic Spirits.

 
**Lancelot?:**
We are degraded imitations that manage to establish our existence with Master acting as an anchor.

 
**Enforcement Knight?:**
...But that is not the case for you.

 
**Enforcement Knight?:**
You are the Knight of the Round Table himself. You have sworn your loyalty to a certain individual.

 
**Tristan:**
Shut up.

 
**Bedivere?:**
No, I will not.

 
**Bedivere?:**
The more you wish to silence us,
the more we must speak.

 
**Tristan:**
...Nnngh!

 
**Tristan:**
Do not talk of our brotherhood!
Do not slander our loyalty!

 
**Tristan:**
Every time you change forms, you besmirch the honor of the Knights of the Round Table!

 
**Agravain?:**
Then tell us your name.

 
**Tristan:**
Tristan. Tristan of Sadness.
What of it?

 
**Mordred?:**
Yeah, that's right. But you're missing something, dumbass. You're a Knight of the Round Table.

 
**Tristan:**
That's right. A Knight of the Round Table.
Though in the end, I relinquished that seat...

 
**???:**
And by relinquishing that seat, you must have renewed that vow of yours. Vowed that you would offer your everything to THAT person...

 
**Tristan:**
That's...

 
**Narration:**
It was like opening up an old wound.

 
**Narration:**
Every accusations they throw at me reminded me I was back in that Singularity.

 
**Enforcement Knight?:**
Why do you quarrel, sir?
Didn't that massacre feel good to you?

 
**Tristan:**
Quiet!

 
**Gawain?:**
“Nightless.”

 
**Lancelot?:**
“Fierce.”

 
**Mordred?:**
“Rampage.”

 
**Narration:**
I'm dizzy.
I feel like throwing up.

 
**Narration:**
Don't remember...remember... You should have forgotten. No, a partial image must still be burned into your mind.

 
**Narration:**
“Reversal.”

 
**Narration:**
Irrevocable massacre. Devastation beyond hope of repair. Crime beyond hope of redemption...

 
**F：???:**
You want to have another taste of it.
Look, you're laughing.

 
**Tristan:**
...!

 
**Narration:**
I unconsciously covered my mouth after hearing those words. And at that moment, I was crushed by a darkness of great pressure and intensity.

 
**Tristan:**
...ter...

 
**Tristan:**
...ster...

 
**Tristan:**
...Master...

 
**Tristan:**
How many times...must...I commit this...mistake...?
How can I...atone...for these...sins...?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gawain:**
We heard this was an emergency,
so we came as fast as we could!

 
**Lancelot:**
Hm, I'm second?
Lancelot, reporting for duty.

 
**Bedivere:**
Did you call for us, Master?
...This is...

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, what's going on?
Did you call the whole Round Table?

 
**Mash:**
Okay, let me explain the situation!

 
**Mash:**
Tristan...Rayshifted somewhere and has disappeared.

 
**Mordred:**
Huh?
Without Master!?

 
**Gawain:**
Wait, we can Rayshift without permission?

 
**Gawain:**
I thought we could only Rayshift when accompanied by Master?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, there are few tricks you can pull,
but nothing like whatever's been done here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It was as if he was kidnapped...
Tristan's Spirit Origin just disappeared...

 
**Da Vinci:**
And next thing we know,
there's a weird new Singularity.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Well, it's not exactly a Singularity. It would hardly show up as even a tiny stain on the tapestry of history.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's more like a little piece of lint. Even the faintest breeze would blow it off of the fabric of history.

 
**Da Vinci:**
On the flip side...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It means that Tristan is in the most dire of all situations because he's in a place that could disappear at any moment.

 
**Everyone:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Want to come with me?


---
 
**Gawain:**
Obviously.

 
**Lancelot:**
Leave it to us, Master.

 
**Bedivere:**
I'll accompany you.

 
**Mordred:**
...

 
**Mordred:**
Pass. You've got plenty of help.
Should be fine.

 
**Gawain:**
Mordred...I see...you're not quite in top form because you...ate something strange...

 
**Gawain:**
No matter how wild and strange of an animal you may be, you are still a member of the nobility...and so I can understand why you've responded as you have.

 
**Lancelot:**
By God!

 
**Lancelot:**
Sir Mordred. Are you not feeling well?
Did you eat too much ice cream this summer?

 
**Bedivere:**
Or are you still angry at Sir Tristan for accidently shooting you the other day?

 
**Bedivere:**
That was an unfortunate accident. You know Tristan makes foolish mistakes like that sometimes.

 
**Mordred:**
You're all wrong!
Shut-up, tri-fold-man!

 
**Mordred:**
And Bedivere!
Is THAT what happened the other day!?

 
**Mordred:**
I knew something was funky when I felt like something was cutting into my back...

 
**Mash:**
So she didn't even notice...

 
**Bedivere:**
(Ack, I put my foot in my mouth...!)

 
**Mordred:**
Actually, I have a bad feeling about this.

 
**Gawain:**
Hm. Sir Mordred's animalistic instinct has never led us astray...which means this will be difficult.

 
**Gawain:**
Remember how you were lucky enough to run into me while I was in terrible shape because I hadn't fully healed after Lancelot?

 
**Gawain:**
I'd normally beat you without even breaking a sweat, even at night. That defeat was due entirely to my own bad luck.

 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Mordred:**
That wasn't bad luck. You're just a freakin' idiot. You were the one who let the king go without even arguing the point.

 
**Mordred:**
If you had two brain cells to rub together under all that muscle, I might not've had such an easy time defeating you.

 
**Gawain:**
Oh?

 
**Gawain:**
Oh, so you say that might've made it harder, hm?
Tell me this: Would you have a harder time fighting me without your head!?

 
**Mash:**
U-um...excuse me...!

 
**Mordred:**
...Calm down, Mash.

 
**Mordred:**
We're not gonna fight...
We're all just messing around! Round Table jests!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jokes at the Round Table are not for the faint of heart...


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, fighting and holding grudges doesn't work so well for a team dynamic.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Just accept them as jokes that KILL.

 
**Mordred:**
Anyway, I'm still giving this one a pass.

 
**Mordred:**
I got this feeling that I need to stay right where I am.

 
**Gawain:**
...I see.

 
**Lancelot:**
Then we three shall go...

 
**Bedivere:**
Yes.

 
**Bedivere:**
We shall save Sir Tristan and remove this piece of lint from history!

 
**Da Vinci:**
The lint thing is just a metaphor!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anyway, let's go.
 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, have fun everyone!
I'll be by to pick up your corpses later!

 
**Da Vinci:**
If Fujimaru ends up dead,
the world will be in real trouble.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, get in your Coffins.
The Knights of the Round Table, go rescue Tristan!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go save Tristan.
 
**Da Vinci:**
...I knew you'd say that.
I went ahead and prepared the Rayshift for you.

 
**Lancelot:**
You're amazing, Miss Da Vinci.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's all good as long as I can still do whatever the heck I want! Okay, time to head out!

 


---
 
**Gawain:**
This is...!

 
**Bedivere:**
...

 
**Lancelot:**
Yes...it's Camelot, the holy city.
But it's empty.

 
**Mash:**
I'm not detecting any enemies nearby.

 
**Mash:**
I am getting a Servant reading up ahead, though.

 
**Gawain:**
Wouldn't that be Sir Tristan?

 
**Mash:**
Actually, the Spirit Origin values are fluctuating. Whatever it is, it's not stable.

 
**Mash:**
Please be careful, everyone.
You too, Master.

 
**Lancelot:**
No point standing around.
Let's go see if we can talk to him.

 
**Lancelot:**
Let's go...!

 
**Gawain:**
!?

 
**Lancelot:**
Ugh...!

 
**Bedivere:**
What!?

 
**Tristan:**
...I have been waiting for you all.

 
**Mash:**
Tristan...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This aura...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something's...different about him.


---
 
**Tristan:**
Master.
I...I'm no longer just.

 
**Tristan:**
The moment I deemed that killing innocent citizens was fine, I should have ceased to exist as a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Tristan:**
The gift of Inversion is simply an excuse.

 
**Mash:**
Tristan, are you saying that your memories from the Sixth Singularity have...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That wasn't you!
 
**Tristan:**
No, THAT was the real me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But you were reversed!
 
**Tristan:**
What of it if I was reversed!?

 
**Tristan:**
It was still me!

 


---
 
**Bedivere:**
I don't quite understand the situation...

 
**Bedivere:**
But Sir Tristan, open your eyes. No matter how terrible your actions, there is no sin that cannot be redeemed.

 
**Bedivere:**
So long as you are truly remorseful...even if you are never forgiven, you still have a chance at atonement.

 
**Tristan:**
Sir Bedivere, my comrade.
You do not know.

 
**Tristan:**
Moments ago, I experienced the reversed version of myself.

 
**Lancelot:**
...!

 
**Gawain:**
What!?

 
**Tristan:**
I now understand why I know nothing of love.

 
**Tristan:**
A monster so evil as me should never be loved.

 
**Tristan:**
I should be killed.
Please, destroy me!

 
**Tristan:**
A fool like me deserves no more than having his comrades lop his head off.

 
**Gawain:**
That is absolute nonsense, Sir Tristan!
That is no reason for us to draw our swords against you!

 
**Tristan:**
Then I shall kill Master.

 
**All Three:**
!!!

 
**Tristan:**
There's no cause for surprise here.

 
**Tristan:**
As I said before... The inverted me is my true self.
It is only natural that I should drown myself in malice.

 
**Lancelot:**
...!

 
**Lancelot:**
Master.

 
**Lancelot:**
I don't understand what's happened,
but we need to stop Tristan first!

 
**Gawain:**
That's right. Sir Tristan, we may be at least partially the cause of your madness...

 
**Bedivere:**
Honestly...

 
**Bedivere:**
Master, please get behind us.
This...may turn into an astonishingly violent battle.

 
**Bedivere:**
My Airgetlám knows no mercy.
I shall destroy that sinister harp's sadness at its source!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Lancelot:**
Ungh!

 
**Gawain:**
Even after the beating we've given you, you're still standing! Where are you getting this endurance?

 
**Tristan:**
In addition to my Gift of Inversion, I have also been given the Gifts of Nightless and Rampage.

 
**Mash:**
Who gave them to you!?

 
**Mash:**
It certainly shouldn't be the Lion King.
She should already have disappeared!

 
**Tristan:**
I do not know myself.
It must be some cruel and unfathomable being.

 
**Tristan:**
But even that bit of ridiculousness made me realize something: I am truly a monster.

 
**Tristan:**
And I never even realized it, all while I lamented over my own origin, crying about my own inability to understand human emotion!

 
**Tristan:**
That's why...I could never be loved.

 
**Mash:**
That's not true!
Tristan, you're...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, it's no use.
 
**Mash:**
...Tristan, I believe in you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're wrong, Tristan.
 
**Tristan:**
Then in order to prove my villainy...

 
**Tristan:**
I shall...I shall lop your head off...Master!!!

 
**Bedivere:**
Tristan!!!

 


---
 
**Mordred:**
What the hell are you whinging about, Bird Boy?

 
**Tristan:**
!?

 
**Mash:**
Mordred!?

 
**Mordred:**
Yo, Tristan.

 
**Tristan:**
I see you did not come with the party.
How unlike you, wild dog that you are, to cower in fear.

 
**Mordred:**
Okay, everyone, STOP CALLING ME A DOG!

 
**Mordred:**
Ugh. Fine. If I'm a dog, what's that make you?
A little bug?

 
**Mordred:**
A tiny bug buzzing about...
A pissant that doesn't know what love is?

 
**Tristan:**
As ever, your provocations are the most grating of insults.

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, I got plenty more for you when you get back.

 
**Mordred:**
You're given all those gifts, then you bitch and bitch and bitch, then fall into some desperate madness!? What a damn wimp! Pathetic!

 
**Tristan:**
What would you know?

 
**Mordred:**
Hell if I know.

 
**Mordred:**
But now I know the reason why I didn't tag along.

 
**Tristan:**
...?

 
**Mordred:**
The real expert in self-flagellation is the damn king.

 
**Mordred:**
Your quibbling and all that whining would REALLY piss her off!

 
**Mordred:**
And if SHE's going to put in an appearance, all I could do is stay the hell away, or we might all end up killing each other.

 
**Tristan:**
What are you saying...
No...impossible...

 
**Tristan:**
It can't be!!!

 
**F：???:**
I have come in answer to a call from afar.

 
**F：???:**
Sir, I see you are lost.

 
**Tristan:**
...King of the sacred lance!

 
**Tristan:**
Even for you, I will not compromise!

 
**Altria:**
Then as your king, I will have your submission,
even if I must beat it into you.

 
**Altria:**
I am a king, but also a member of the Knights of the Round Table.

 
**Altria:**
Should my knights disagree,
I am fully prepared to handle their quarrel.

 
**Altria:**
Sir Tristan, show me your bow and its infinite arrows. With my sacred lance, I shall annihilate the source of your melancholy.

 
**Tristan:**
...Very well.

 
**Tristan:**
Sing, my Failnaught.
Sound the melody of my lament!

 
**Altria:**
Sacred lance, removing restraints.

 
**Altria:**
Master of Chaldea, I ask of you:
please take temporary command.

 
**Altria:**
I need to give this thickheaded knight a moment of silence and reflection.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!
 
**Altria:**
I appreciate your willingness to help.

 
**Altria:**
...Let's go!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks!
 
**Altria:**
No need to thank me.

 
**Altria:**
After all, this is my duty.
Now, let's go!

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**B：Tristan:**
Ungh!
My King! You do not understand me!

 
**Altria:**
No, it is you who does not understand yourself.

 
**Altria:**
No... It's not that you don't understand,
but that you refuse to.

 
**Altria:**
The light of Rhongomyniad will pierce through your blessings. And then...

 
**Altria:**
Master will destroy your hesitation.

 
**Altria:**
Master of Chaldea.
Do you know of Tristan's legend?

 
**Altria:**
While he did learn what love is, deep in his heart, he averted his gaze from it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Tristan...


---
**B：Tristan:**
I...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Love and guilt are two different things.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't you want to love?


---
 
**B：Tristan:**
!

 
**B：Tristan:**
I...I...

 
**???:**
It's a black sail, Sir Tristan.

 
**Narration:**
Even as my eyes grew dim from poison,
my hearing did not fail me.

 
**Narration:**
I heard a trembling voice,
a whisper like one confessing their crimes.

 
**Narration:**
Regret, sorrow, hatred. And yet another pure emotion remained, untainted by them.

 
**B：Tristan:**
Ah, I see. It was inevitable.

 
**Narration:**
I was truly very sorry.

 
**Narration:**
I must have hurt her so much...enough that it compelled her to say those words.

 
**Narration:**
Iseult. My Iseult with the white hands...the one who was by my side as I died.

 
**Narration:**
As my wife, you were loyal even while I was not.
And now the only thing I can do is believe.

 
**Narration:**
Yes. The black sail must have come.

 
**Narration:**
There was gratitude.
There was compassion.

 
**Narration:**
There was atonement.
Was there...ever love?

 
**Narration:**
My thoughts grow calmer. Is an inconstant man like me truly worthy and able to love such a good woman?

 
**Narration:**
No. I realized that at the moment of my death.

 
**Narration:**
That wild, passionate love I felt was the product of a love potion, not something within me.

 
**Narration:**
But I believed that was love. I believed it, and so continued to betray my Iseult of the white hands.

 
**Narration:**
I am truly a monster that does not know love.

 
**Narration:**
I was only ever loved by others,
never able to love another myself.

 
**B：Tristan:**
...No. That can't be true. I remember.
At the time, I was thinking...

 
**B：Tristan:**
“It would be my greatest regret if I died right here...”

 
**B：Tristan:**
“While leaving the most gentle woman I know to be so lonely and sad. I want to apologize to her...to talk to her...to tell her...”

 
**B：Tristan:**
“And I want to ask her: 'May I love you?'”

 
**Narration:**
And without having a chance to ask that myself, I made her tell me those words.

 
**B：Tristan:**
That's right...I...

 
**B：Tristan:**
I should have asked my question.
Even if the only answer would have been a curse or insult.

 
**B：Tristan:**
Even had it led to me losing my love,
I would have accepted that as just...

 
**Altria:**
(...The evil Gift has disappeared. But...the fairy princess, my older sister...does this mean she has manifested somewhere...?)

 
**Altria:**
Sir Tristan. I ask of you:
Do you still think you have never loved anyone?

 
**Tristan:**
...No.

 
**Tristan:**
What I lacked in life was not love, but courage.

 
**Tristan:**
I was constantly fearful of losing love, and therefore could not allow myself to love anything.

 
**Tristan:**
I loved two women. And that is fine.
And I will not discuss what that led to.

 
**Tristan:**
Thank you, Master.
And my king.

 
**Tristan:**
I can finally awaken from my dream.

 
**Altria:**
Gawain, Lancelot, Tristan...and...

 
**Altria:**
You must continue to dedicate yourselves to restoring humanity. Never forget to be proud of being Knights of the Round Table!

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, good, she's gone. Okay, Tristan.
I'm gonna give it to you straight:

 
**Mordred:**
Iseult of white hands and blondie Iseult? I'm pretty sure they'd have kicked a two-timing ass like you to the curb given half a chance.

 
**Mordred:**
Before you died of that poison, you should've gotten a big damn smack to the face!

 
**Tristan:**
Ha... I never imagined you of all people would be the one to point out the truth.

 
**Tristan:**
It's quite vexing, so remember this one thing when we get back:

 
**Tristan:**
I shall rain limitless arrows upon your unnecessary and demeaning personal attacks!

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah, firing off a buncha arrows while running away like a bitch is pretty much the definitive Archer move.

 
**Lancelot:**
Heh. Hold it right there, Sir Mordred.
There's still one last thing that Sir Tristan needs to do.

 
**Lancelot:**
Yes, a very important thing.

 
**Mordred:**
Huh?
What're you...

 
**Tristan:**
...?

 
**Gawain:**
Haha, yes, indeed, hahaha.

 
**Gawain:**
He was beyond confused...only able to snap to his senses after our king attacked him...he even attacked us with his Gift.

 
**Lancelot:**
And even the King was so focused on lecturing Sir Tristan, she only glanced toward us at the very end.

 
**Lancelot:**
No, no...
It's not that that made us jealous.

 
**Tristan:**
Sirs?
I mean, guys?

 
**Tristan:**
Are you...super pissed?

 
**Tristan:**
Well, okay, this did get out of hand enough that everyone had to get involved...

 
**Tristan:**
But at least...at least the conclusion was heartwarming, right...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I understand how they feel...


---
 
**Bedivere:**
Indeed. All sins can be atoned for, Tristan.
Whether you will be forgiven is another matter.

 
**Tristan:**
...

 
**Tristan:**
Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah.


---
 
**Tristan:**
Please...see to my funeral...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that another Round Table joke!?


---
 
**Tristan:**
Not a joke...!

 
**All Three:**
Brace yourself!

 
**Mordred:**
Sorry I took over.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I don't mind. But do you think Tristan and the others are all right?

 
**Mordred:**
What do you mean, all right?
They're all set to come back whenever.

 
**Mash:**
Um, I mean...is anyone holding a grudge?

 
**Mordred:**
Grudge? 'Course not.

 
**Mordred:**
It'd be different if we went after each other all serious and stuff.

 
**Mordred:**
But they're just bickering with each other.
Just playing around.

 
**Mash:**
Playing around?
Really?

 
**Mordred:**
Yeah.
Wanna bet on it?

 
**Mordred:**
By tomorrow night, the four of them will be rolling around on the floor like a bunch of morons laughing like this was the funniest damn thing ever.

 
**Mordred:**
Honestly, the Knights of the Round Table are all complete nutjobs!
