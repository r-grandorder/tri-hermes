# Altera 

## The Beast Inside of Me

**Altera:**
...I was waiting.

 
**Altera:**
I was waiting for you to come Fujimaru.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we now?
 
**Altera:**
I don't know exactly.
 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Am I, in a dream?
 
**Altera:**
Yes.
You have a good intuition, Master.

---

 
**Altera:**
I can't be certain, but I can guess to a certain level.

 
**Altera:**
This is&mdash;"inside of me."

 
**Altera:**
It's not something physical, but psychological.

 
**Altera:**
Inside of me. I still can't say that for sure, but it's my memory. Of me, who fought as the great King of Huns.

 
**Altera:**
...Inside of the memory of myself "as a hero."

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As a hero?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't really get what you mean

---
 

 
**Altera:**
It means exactly what I said. The memory of "me,"
who was once called King of Destruction, Attila.

 
**Altera:**
One who kept on destroying every civilization like a thoughtless, wordless machine.

 
**Altera:**
It's my memory.
That's why in here...

 
**Altera:**
...there's nothing.

 
**Altera:**
I didn't think "like a human being."
I didn't feel like one either.

 
**Altera:**
I couldn't think, and couldn't feel.

 
**Altera:**
...To you, what do I look like?

 
**Altera:**
To me, only the sky and the earth stretch endlessly.
It's the end of a star that was leveled with no feeling or purpose.

 
**Altera:**
To you...I suppose, it looks like a view "closest" to what you've seen.

 
**Altera:**
How you see it might be different, but this dark wasteland is indeed me.

 
**Altera:**
Even though I'm supposed to be looking at my memory,
I see nothing. No friends, and no family...

 
**Altera:**
I can't hear anyone's voice.
Nothing but gusty winds.

 
**Altera:**
...Heh, talk about empty.

 
**Altera:**
Despite the fact I've led many into battle, how come not even a single person is in my memory.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think it's quiet.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is pretty calming.

---
 

 
**Altera:**
You're kind.

 
**Altera:**
Well, I suppose that's how people would call someone like you, kind.

 
**Altera:**
I never...

 
**Altera:**
...I never wished to destroy lives. Still, I always kept destroying civilizations far as the eyes can see.

 
**Altera:**
You see the contradiction?
I can't help myself from choosing this way.

 
**Altera:**
I deviate from this planet's absolute principle&mdash;
that its purpose of survival is breeding.

 
**Altera:**
"Destruction" is implanted deep within my heart.
I don't want to willingly kill, but I want to destroy.

 
**Altera:**
As a result people die. I killed many of them.
The earth was always soaked with blood.

 
**Altera:**
...However.
What is left for me is this dark wilderness...

 
**Altera:**
Look&ndash;
it's coming.

 
**???:**
&mdash;

 
**Altera:**
I said there's nothing, but well, it wasn't true.

 
**Altera:**
I've got ones like them.
Those who have unclear names, with no faces.

 
**Altera:**
Those whom I fought against and killed. I simply fought and killed without recognizing them as individuals.

 
**Altera:**
Now it's time to use your power, Master. Though only if that summoning system of your works.

 
**Altera:**
You have no choice but to fight, if you don't want to die.

 
**Altera:**
...I'm not sure if death exists in this place, though.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altera:**
Splendid job, Master. You managed to stay alive because of the summoning system.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...This is a dream, right?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel like I am using a lot of magical energy.

---
 

 
**Altera:**
This indeed is a dream, but our minds here are real.

 
**Altera:**
Magical energy exists as a link between your mind and body, right? In that case, it's only natural you use it.

 
**Altera:**
Have you used it all up yet? No, that's good to hear.
You see, it's not over yet.

 
**???:**
&mdash;

 
**Altera:**
...This time, it doesn't even look like a human.

 
**Altera:**
I wonder what that was. I feel like I have a dim memory of having killed a monster.

 
**Altera:**
Or, maybe that is formed by some sort of concept?

 
**Altera:**
Whatever that is&ndash;

 
**???:**
&mdash;!!!

 
**Altera:**
...Hmm. For a mere concept, I see it's ready to kill.

 
**Altera:**
...I'm so ashamed I could pass out.
I can't believe I even envy such a thing.

 
**Altera:**
Feelings, emotions.
Things that I lacked, but now gained.

 
**Altera:**
However, I can't control these feelings well.
I've understood joy, but I don't how to express it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
L-Let's just focus on the monster before us!

---
 
**Altera:**
Of course, you know your priorities, Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think you're just awkward.

---
 
**Altera:**
...That's a problem.
Many of my allies would tell me that back then.

 
**Altera:**
It makes me happy, but I'm sad.
I really wish it was true.

 

 
**Altera:**
At any rate, we need to defeat that thing first.
Come on Master, try to pull it off again.

 
**Altera:**
You'll actually die if you die here.
If that happens, our contract will end.

 
**Altera:**
I'll be free from this subordination, and you'll be free from life.

 
**Altera:**
But that won't be fun.
So, try not to die.

 
**Altera:**
I'd like to talk to you just a little longer.

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Altera:**
...I'm impressed, Master.

 
**Altera:**
I have a better opinion of you.
I expected you'd stand frozen or something.

 
**Altera:**
Apparently I underestimated your way of existence Fujimaru, the one trying to save the world.

 
**Altera:**
...It's time for you to go back.
This place isn't appropriate for you to stay long.

 
**Altera:**
It only needs me.
This place&ndash;

 
**Altera:**
&ndash;This darkness, belongs to "me".

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
You didn't come out at the scheduled time, so I came to see how you were doing&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
But I can see that you overslept. Are you okay?
You seemed to be troubled by your dream.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It wasn't a bad dream.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I was fighting a real battle.

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Is that...so? If you don't mind,
can you tell me more...no, it's nothing.

 
**Mash:**
Breakfast is ready.
Let's go, Senpai.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Foooou!


## My Memories

**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Based on my observation, I couldn't detect anything. Um, maybe I should expand the range?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, you are in 1st century Gaul, within the second singularity that's being corrected.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Are you sure it's around here, great hero of destruction, Attila&mdash;I mean, Altera?

 
**Altera:**
Don't call me Attila. Yes, I'm sure it's around here.

 
**Altera:**
Someone is calling me here. I'm certain that I felt it.

 
**Altera:**
It's a destructive...impulse. What's worse, it's extraordinary.

 
**Altera:**
Even if it destroys everything in sight, it still won't calm down... That's what it is.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An impulse, huh? I don't know how to understand a phenomenon that can't be observed with numbers.

 
**Mash:**
She probably meant she sensed something similar to that of magical energy.

 
**Altera:**
Magical energy, hmm? I see, I won't deny that, but...

 
**Altera:**
It's more like a forced command, one more powerful than Command Spells. That's what I've sensed.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you sure about that?

---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I am wondering the same.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Forced command, huh...

---
 
**Mash:**
...Right. It might be best for us to be prepared for combat.

 

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou Fooou!

 
**Altera:**
It seems like it is already approaching us. A collection of destructive impulses.

 
**Mash:**
It's a Servant! If we're just picking that up now, that means...

 
**Mash:**
...it's hiding in spirit form until our arrival! Senpai!

 
**Brynhild:**
...I am troubled.

 
**Brynhild:**
Oh, no... See, I knew it. I am troubled because of it...

 
**Brynhild:**
I can smell that person... No wait, it's a smell similar to that person...

 
**Brynhild:**
Why do I sense it? Why do I think like this?

 
**Brynhild:**
...That woman...

 
**Brynhild:**
She must be one of the women... Who tried to get close to my...Sigurd...

 
**Altera:**
Oh?

 
**Mash:**
You're Brynhild...right? A woman who tried to get close to your Sigurd? Who are you talking about?

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Altera:**
She's looking at me. So that destructive impulse is directed to me.

 
**Altera:**
But I don't remember anyone named Sigurd. Hm...

 
**Mash:**
Ah! No, Altera, try to remember!

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Mash:**
How do I explain this... It's not Sigurd per se, but someone who shares the same origin and legend as him...

 
**Mash:**
You've already met him, Altera. That's right, this has happened before...

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Wait, I'm sorry. I'm getting confused so let me get this straight.

 
**Mash:**
In other words...

 
**Mash:**
Siegfried and Altera married "the same woman?"

 
**Siegfried:**
Yes, that's right. After I died, my wife Kriemhild remarried Etzel&ndash;

 
**Siegfried:**
In other words, the great king of the Huns. I heard that the great king also lost his wife.

 
**Altera:**
Kriemhild...

 
**Altera:**
My wife, huh?
Wife...

 
**Altera:**
Wife...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't you remember?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't know you had a wife.

---
 

 
**Altera:**
I'm familiar with her name, but it feels unrealistic to have a wife.

 
**Altera:**
I know nothing except for war and destruction. I never directed my attention to anything else.

 
**Altera:**
So...it's possible that woman was there for me.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh I see, one of Altera's retainers probably played it smart and had them married for diplomatic reasons.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How business-like...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, I-I see.

---
 

 
**Siegfried:**
...I do have some thoughts on that, but this is not the place to talk about it.

 
**Siegfried:**
I heard Kriemhild used King Etzel for her revenge.

 
**Siegfried:**
What led her to seek revenge was my death. So, I'm in no position to accuse the king.

 
**Altera:**
Etzel&ndash;

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Altera:**
Etzel, huh&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
What's the matter, Altera?

 
**Altera:**
Well, the name Etzel isn't bad.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It does sound cute.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think the name fits you.

---
 

 
**Altera:**
...It's not...what I meant.
It's not...

 
**Altera:**
It's not that.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Seems like it is.)

 
**Mash:**
(Yes, it is.)

 
**Siegfried:**
(Indeed.)

 
**Fou:**
(Fou, Fou Fou♪)

 
**Altera:**
...It's not...

 
**Mash:**
...Do you remember now?

 
**Altera:**
Indeed, I do. But I suppose he is a different existence, or hero, than Sigurd.

 
**Altera:**
Siegfried and Sigurd. I hear both of them are heroes with the same origin...

 
**Brynhild:**
Oh...
Oh my...how can that be?

 
**Brynhild:**
That's exactly what I thought.
Taking...a wife... There's no way it can be...

 
**Brynhild:**
&mdash;Forgiven.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not getting through to her!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whoa, this seems dangerous!

---
 

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, Senpai!
She's obviously gone into battle mode!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What, a Servant battle!?
Now?

 
**Brynhild:**
...Fight me with everything you have.

 
**Altera:**
Hmm, she wishes to fight.

 
**Altera:**
Very well, I shall answer that wish. All I can do is wield the sword of destruction.

 
**Altera:**
Come.
The sword of Mars shall crush you&mdash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Brynhild:**
...Oh... What...was I...doing?

 
**Brynhild:**
Don't tell me... Was I fighting?
Me? Against you?

 
**Altera:**
Yes.

 
**Brynhild:**
I-I see, so that's what happened.
I wonder why...

 
**Brynhild:**
It's odd. Sometimes I attack men, but usually not women.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It sounds horrible, but yes, most of Brynhild's victims are men.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Her Noble Phantasm feels like it's that way, too&ndash;
E-Either way, I am happy we could clear up that misunderstanding!

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes.
It was just a matter of pressing the wrong button!

 
**Altera:**
Hmm...

 
**Brynhild:**
Oh?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou...

 
**Altera:**
...Anyway, I was lucky to fight such a powerful individual. It helped adjust the aim for my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, Fou.
Kyao?


## My Sword of the God of War

**Altera:**
 
...So we meet again.

 
**Altera:**
Rather, do you still remember?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course I do.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was in a dark and stormy wasteland...

---
 

 
**Altera:**
I see. So you...remember that.

 
**Altera:**
How strange... Or perhaps not. I have come to understand that human memories are unpredictable.

 
**Altera:**
I may be repeating myself, but I shall explain the bare minimum...

 
**Altera:**
We are within my memories.
The memory that equates to a dark wasteland.

 
**Altera:**
Regardless, this place has nothing of value.

 
**Altera:**
To rephrase, this is the memory of my birth.

 
**Altera:**
If this dark wasteland was formed using memories of my life...

 
**Altera:**
...then my life was...

 
**Altera:**
No, this place was given shape by memories created before I walked my so-called life.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this your birthplace?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Were you born here?

---
 

 
**Altera:**
This is where I was discovered, where I awakened&mdash;this cave.

 
**Altera:**
A darkened ruin. Remnants of a civilization thousands of years ago...or so I hear.

 
**Altera:**
How do you see it?
I can only see it as a dark cave...

 
**Altera:**
This is an ancient ruin left in the Sahara Desert.
Within, the Hun elders sought me out.

 
**Altera:**
To be exact, I was not born a Hun.

 
**Altera:**
But the ones who raised me and made me into their king were undoubtedly the Hun elders.

 
**Altera:**
In my youth, after killing a soldier for the first time, I was told...

 
**Altera:**
...That I exist to fight.

 
**Altera:**
This crest of war on my flesh, and this sword of the War God... I had them from the very beginning.

 
**Altera:**
I had no father or mother. I was simply discovered by the descendants of the Huns.

 
**Altera:**
I was asked to become destruction itself.
So...

 
**Altera:**
That is what I did. I became destruction incarnate.

 
**Altera:**
...I did not want to kill. Yet I did not and still do not understand the so-called value of life.

 
**Altera:**
I do not know many things. Oh, how I do not know so very much of this world's matters.

 
**Altera:**
If things are taken, broken, killed...what becomes of it?

 
**Altera:**
These things simply vanish from this land for eternity.

 
**Altera:**
It's simple. It's plain and simple.

 
**Altera:**
Destruction is...something easily accomplished, yet irreversible.

 
**Altera:**
However, my existence adapted well to the act.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Did it pain you?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you sad?

---
 

 
**Altera:**
Who knows. That is a difficult question for me.

 
**Altera:**
It's what you call emotions, correct? I know.

 
**Altera:**
I understand that others possess them.
However, I cannot feel.

 
**Altera:**
What exists within me is only...

 
**Altera:**
No. Let's speak of it later.

 
**Altera:**
I might have worried too much over small matters...
It looks like that thing from the wasteland has come to pursue me.

 
**???:**
...

 
**Altera:**
Now, let us battle, like we always do.
I won't mind if you just step aside and watch.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll fight.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't leave you like this.

---
 

 
**Altera:**
...I see. Then let's go.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altera:**
That does it. Hmm.

 
**Altera:**
I must apologize. It seems my idle chatter has attracted something unnecessary.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Keep telling us the story.

---
 
**Altera:**
...You sure are curious.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think it's idle chatter.

---
**Altera:**
...Is that so.

 

 
**Altera:**
...Okay.

 
**Altera:**
Then I'll continue. Let me tell you what is inside the vessel shaped as I am.

 
**Altera:**
I do not feel the emotions&ndash;the sadness, the happiness&ndash;that you people do.

 
**Altera:**
Instead, there is only destruction.

 
**Altera:**
All that these hands can do is destroy, shatter, and kill.

 
**Altera:**
Yet...sometimes I think...

 
**Altera:**
With these hands that bring nothing but destruction...

 
**Altera:**
...just like you humans who live honestly on this earth...

 
**Altera:**
...I want to feel affection.
I want to embrace something, someone.

 
**Altera:**
I want to acknowledge everything on Earth, not destroy it. I want to gain emotions and become a woman...

 
**Altera:**
...

 
**Altera:**
That is what I sometimes think.
That is what I dream.

 
**Altera:**
Had I chosen a life different than that of a soldier of destruction...

 
**Altera:**
What would I have become? What would be the makeup of “me”? I could have read books. Sing. Perhaps cooked.

 
**Altera:**
Or&mdash;

 
**???:**
...It's futile...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who's that!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That voice...!

---
 

 
**???:**
...You are the incarnation of destruction...

 
**???:**
...The Sword of the War God is proof as such...

 
**???:**
...Destroy, destroy, destroy...

 
**???:**
...Your existence is nothing but that...

 
**Altera:**
You don't have to remind me.
I already know.

 
**Altera:**
...You're a meddlesome one, aren't you.

 
**???:**
...You have no other choice...

 
**???:**
...Admit it, acknowledge it...

 
**???:**
...Altera, no matter what time period you are in...

 
**???:**
...No matter what kind of world...

 
**???:**
...You...will...destroy...

 
**???:**
EVERYTHING!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not looking good!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Get ready to battle!

---
 

 
**Altera:**
Indeed. That voice is starting to get on my nerves.

 
**Altera:**
It's time to destroy it.
Master, there's no need to hold back.

 
**Altera:**
That is me, but it's just me.
Even if that dies, I will not vanish.

 
**Altera:**
So...

 
**Altera:**
So let's destroy it, Master.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altera:**
...This is...fine.

 
**Altera:**
How many times is this now?
How many times have I destroyed like this?

 
**Altera:**
No, there's no way I could keep count.
Then again, it felt a bit different this time around.

 
**Altera:**
It wasn't bad.

 
**Altera:**
If I were to express myself like a human...

 
**Altera:**
It was...fun. I suppose.

 
**Altera:**
 
I don't remember ever showing weakness before...

 
**Altera:**
However, even though you may not remember when you wake up...

 
**Altera:**
I'm sorry for getting you caught up in all this.

 
**Altera:**
...No. Thank you. This was the first time I was able to reject my memory by means other than my own will.
