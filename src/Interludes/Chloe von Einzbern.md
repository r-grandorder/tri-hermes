# Chloe Von Einzbern

<h2>Chloe's Snack</h2>

**Chloe:**
...And that's why things have been a little lacking in the kissing department.

 
**Mash:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did you just say, you little succubus?
 


---
 
**Chloe:**
Don't take this the wrong way.
I'm not complaining about your technique or anything...

 
**Chloe:**
But I just...want to feel something else...like butterflies in my stomach.

 
**Mash:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, not in front of Mash...
 
**Mash:**
No, no, go on.
This may be something I need to hear.

 
**Mash:**
Please continue, Chloe. Depending on what you have to say, I may have to contact the authorities.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, you look a little scary.
 
**Mash:**
This is my default expression. My various emotions are typically not reflected in my catalog of expressions.

 
**Mash:**
So please carry on.
As you can see, I am quite calm.

 


---
 
**Chloe:**
Oh no, did I hit a nerve?

 
**Chloe:**
Normally, I'd keep prodding and hope for some good drama...

 
**Chloe:**
But since Mash is a good girl,
I'll leave it alone.

 
**Mash:**
O-okay...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you were asking if you couldstrengthen your power during battle?


---
 
**Chloe:**
Right. I came over to see if there was anything we could do to improve the situation.

 
**Chloe:**
If you can increase the magical energy supplied to me,
I can increase my output, which will help everyone.

 
**Mash:**
I-I didn't realize that's what you were talking about. I just thought...

 
**Chloe:**
You thought...?

 
**Mash:**
N-no!
Nothing at all!

 
**Mash:**
So this is about getting stronger. I believe this is one of the most important topics to discuss here in Chaldea. Absolutely, yes.

 
**Chloe:**
Yep, yep.
You really are cute, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
I don't know why...but I feel like I was just teased by an older sister or something...

 
**Chloe:**
I think they're around here somewhere.

 
**Mash:**
We tagged along because you asked us to,
but why did you take us here?

 
**Chloe:**
I heard there's good snacks around here.
I figured I could taste them all at once.

 
**Chloe:**
Ah! I smell something delectable over there!

 
**Mash:**
Um...what happened to you getting stronger?

 
**Chloe:**
There they are! Over there!
Hide, so they don't see you!

 
**Mash:**
They are...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tea time♪

 
**Jack:**
Tea, tea, tea...ocha in Japanese♪

 
**Medea Lily:**
T-tee...

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha!!!

 
**Mash:**
Are they having a tea party?
That's so adorable...

 
**Mash:**
...Though they seem to be a bit lacking in terms of vocabulary...

 
**Chloe:**
Heh heh heh... Every single one of them looks to be positively brimming with magical energy...

 
**Mash:**
Gasp!
D-don't tell me you're going to...

 
**Chloe:**
Yep, I'm going to start snacking...

 
**Chloe:**
By sucking their magical energy!

 
**Chloe:**
Down to the last drop!

 
**Chloe:**
Suck suck suck!

 
**Mash:**
Wh-what!?

 
**Chloe:**
If there's a girl that I'm super compatible with,
my charge efficiency will go way up!

 
**Chloe:**
That's why I'm going to sample them one by one!

 
**Mash:**
Th-that makes sense on paper, but...n-no!

 
**Mash:**
Th-that's not right...
In fact, it may be criminal!

 
**Chloe:**
It's fine, it's fine.
I won't do anything that would traumatize them♡

 
**Chloe:**
All I have to do is make sure they don't remember.
That just means I gotta fight them.

 
**Chloe:**
Either way, I don't think they're going to let me suck them directly, so I'll do it after I knock them out.

 
**Mash:**
S-she's thinking like a random serial attacker!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I shall call this “Operation Serial Kisser.”
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Master!?

 
**Chloe:**
That's good!
I'm getting excited now!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tea tea tea tea tea♪

 
**Jack:**
Tea, tea, chachacha!
Chachacha-tea!

 
**Medea Lily:**
Teee...hee hee...

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha!!! We're talking about Chacha, aren't we!?
Wahahaha!!!

 
**Chacha:**
By the way, why are we all only saying “tea” and “cha”?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Eh? Are we allowed to talk normally?

 
**Jack:**
We thought chanting “cha cha” was customary in a Japanese tea party.

 
**Chacha:**
A tea ceremony isn't this wacky! A Japanese tea ceremony is a social gathering that mixes etiquette and being fashionable!

 
**Medea Lily:**
I feel things went off the rails somewhat when Chacha started randomly shouting “Chacha!”

 
**Chacha:**
Chacha!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme & Jack:**
Cha-cha-cha!

 
**Chloe:**
This is so stupid it's hurting my head...

 
**Mash:**
Setting matters of intellect aside,
those girls are all pure and innocent.

 
**Mash:**
For you to attack them and...k-k-kiss them...
I don't think we can permit such an immoral act...

 
**Chloe:**
Yeehaw! Let's go!
It's time to make some flowers bloom!

 
**Chacha:**
Wh-what the!?

 
**Mash:**
CHLOE!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nursery Rhyme:**
Cha...

 
**Jack:**
Chaaaaaa...

 
**Medea Lily:**
I-I feel like we're being handled...

 
**Chacha:**
...crudely!
...Unnnf...

 
**Mash:**
...Battle complete.
...So it's finally happening...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A sacrifice for the greater good.
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure this will also come back to haunt you, Senpai. But there's nothing we can do about it now, is there?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We. Saw. Nothing. Got it?
 
**Mash:**
This is definitely something I won't want to witness!

 


---
 
**Chloe:**
Whew. They fought hard,
but they were no match for the Serial Kisser Squad.

 
**Mash:**
And now we're a part of this shameful group!

 
**Chloe:**
Now that they've all passed out...

 
**Chloe:**
Time for a taste☆

 
**Chloe:**
Hm...

 
**Mash:**
Oh...my...

 
**Mash:**
...Ahhh...w-wow...that sound...ahhhh!
That's too much...!

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai! I don't think this is right!
This is...this is SO wrong in SO many ways!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's just kids playing. It's fine.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's only an exchange of magical energy. It's fine.


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-you really think so?

 
**Mash:**
N-no, you're right. The...methodology may be troubling, but it really just amounts to a medical procedure.

 
**Mash:**
It is just one way to exchange magical energy.
Yes... So there is no problem here...

 
**Mash:**
...No problem...I hope...

 
**Chloe:**
Ummmmmmf... Phew!

 
**Chloe:**
...Wanna try, Mash?

 
**Mash:**
ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!


**--ARROW--:**

**Chloe:**
In the end, none of them were compatible.
I'm disappointed...

 
**Mash:**
I feel sorry for them...

 
**Chloe:**
I was hoping the ponytail witch Medea Lily would be the one... But even though she was unconscious, she had really strong magical resistance!

 
**Chloe:**
She was the hardest to deal with, despite how she looks. She's probably got a lot more going on than meets the eye.

 
**Mash:**
Really? Out of those four, I feel she has the most common sense. ...Although that can be its own burden.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, boss. Who's your next victim?
 
**Mash:**
As much as I respect your adaptability, I don't think it's working in your favor this time, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Serial Kisser Squad's journey continues...
 
**Chloe:**
It's good that you're really into my cause, but quit acting like that, it's gonna end up making things take a bad turn (read: get us shut down).

 


---
 
**Chloe:**
Okay, next. I went after kiddos last time, so maybe I should look for a stronger girl this time.

 
**Chloe:**
Maybe I should find myself a king, or...oh!
Maybe a Berserker...

 
**Mash:**
I predict a whole different kind of disaster from last time.

 
**Mash:**
...To be quite clear,
disaster beyond reckoning is sure to ensue.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it girls only?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't want boys?
 


---
 
**Chloe:**
Eh? When it comes to boys, I wouldn't want them to get serious with me... None of them are my type anyway.

 
**Chloe:**
Oh wait... There are maybe one or two good ones,
but those guys...you know...honestly...

 
**Mash:**
I-I don't know how to respond to that. I can only surmise that you have a very complicated situation here.

 
**Chloe:**
So there you have it.
Now let's keep looking for other girls with potential.

 
**Chloe:**
Girls like the last ones, the sort who aren't challenging, are just boring... I wanna try getting a strong girl to submit to me.

 
**Mash:**
You are much too gung-ho about these morally questionable endeavors!

 
**Chloe:**
Hmmm, is there anyone around? A cute and strong and stimulating girl...and possibly a Saber who's compatible with my class.

 
**Chloe:**
Yoohoo, are there any girl kings swinging their swords around here...?

 
**Chloe:**
After I give her a gentle thrashing, I wanna nurse her back to health with the utmost care and tenderness!

 
**Nightingale:**
Where's the patient!?

 
**Chloe:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A wild head nurse appears.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Welp, you hoped for a Berserker. There you go.
 


---
 
**Chloe:**
No, no, no! She's no good! I was trying to put up a flag to lure someone like Altria or Altera!

 
**Mash:**
That last bit might have pushed her over the edge.
She's gone berserk herself.

 
**Nightingale:**
Do not fret. Now that I'm here, I will thoroughly expunge this mental anguish troubling you.

 
**Nightingale:**
It will not be unnecessarily painful... That is, it will be excruciating, even highly traumatic, but that is only because it is necessary.

 
**Nightingale:**
Sadly, there is no anesthesia to numb pain of the heart or soul. I must ask you to grit your teeth and bear it.

 
**Chloe:**
We can't reason with her! Figures! Wh-what are we going to do with her? There's no way I can handle her!

 
**Nightingale:**
No, no. There is nothing that cannot be handled.
Your perspective in this is all wrong.

 
**Nightingale:**
What cannot be dealt with simply must be amputated. All that is necessary to sustain a patient's life is to keep the vital organs intact.

 
**Nightingale:**
Despair only when there's nothing left to amputate!

 
**Chloe:**
It may sound like we're having a conversation, but you're actually talking to yourself! Argh! This is why Madness Enhancement EX is impossible to deal with!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come on, that's a stimulating girl for you.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought you wanted to have a strong girl submit to you?


---
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai!?
Please don't egg Chloe on!

 
**Chloe:**
A-are you telling me to attack her?
Seriously? Are you NUTS?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can do it, Chloe.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Break through common sense and morality!


---
 
**Chloe:**
...

 
**Chloe:**
...Heh.

 
**Chloe:**
You're right. What was I thinking? Being scared of dessert (read: women) is so unlike me.

 
**Mash:**
U-um Chloe? You're kidding, right?
You're not really going to...?

 
**Chloe:**
The Serial Kissers never turn their backs on their prey! As long as there's a girl around, I'll try to jump them from behind!

 
**Chloe:**
Those lips of yours will be mine!
Brace yourself, head nurse! Or rather...!

 
**Chloe:**
Kill☆Kill☆Nurse!

 
**Nightingale:**
Take my lips...?
Did you just say you mean to take my lips from me?

 
**Nightingale:**
Manpower, medicine, bandages, bed, and other resources are all being taken and running low! And now you're trying to take away my lips too!?

 
**Chloe:**
Oops. I already decided I wouldn't talk to you. Instead of filling your mouth with words, I'm going to fill it with something warm and wet!

 
**Nightingale:**
I understand now. You are poison. You are the danger. You are an infection that must be eradicated!

 
**Nightingale:**
Kill☆Kill☆Germs!!!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
(Gasp!) I'm sorry! I could not intervene during that intense and bizarre back and forth.

 
**Mash:**
But...yes. Commencing battle!
Good luck!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Chloe:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Nightingale:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That...was an intense battle.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Had this been a manga,that battle would have taken three volumes.


---
 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure what you're saying,
but it truly was an epic battle...

 
**Mash:**
And I learned from this battle that fighting can be completely empty and futile... I have never in all my life felt so sad...

 
**Chloe:**
I managed to get a strong woman to submit to me, just like I wanted... It's nothing like I expected, though.

 
**Chloe:**
Whew... I'm beat, so I should go home and take a shower.

 
**Mash:**
W-wait! Did you forget your initial plan?

 
**Nightingale:**
...

 
**Mash:**
If you leave now, what was the point in fighting Nightingale!?

 
**Chloe:**
I forgot.
Oh, right, right.

 
**Chloe:**
But do I really have to?
I'm kind of over it.

 
**Mash:**
After all that effort...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can't give up just because you got sick of it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You need to take responsibility till the very end.


---
 
**Chloe:**
Okay... This is such a mood killer,
but I guess I have to do it.

 
**Chloe:**
Then, here I go...
Hmf...

 
**Mash:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're watching pretty intently, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why don't you have her do it to you too, Mash?


---
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm not looking,
and I don't want to get involved!

 
**Chloe:**
...Pfaaah!

 
**Mash:**
H-how did it go, Chloe?

 
**Chloe:**
Well, you know... I kinda expected it,
but...she tasted like antiseptic.

 
**Mash:**
Ah, well that makes sense,
but I really wasn't asking how she tasted...

 
**Chloe:**
Oh you mean, magical energy? That was so-so too. I suppose I was wrong to expect more from a Berserker in the first place...

 
**Nightingale:**
...Wrong.

 
**Chloe:**
Eh?

 
**Nightingale:**
Wrong...! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!!!
Everything is wrong!

 
**Mash:**
Nightingale's awake!
No, perhaps she was never unconscious...

 
**Chloe:**
So what am I wrong about!?

 
**Nightingale:**
Everything!
Your resuscitation procedure is totally wrong!!!

 
**Chloe:**
Huh?
Resuscitation!? Huh!?

 
**Mash:**
Oh, Nightingale just reached out and grabbed Chloe's throat...

 
**Nightingale:**
First, find the airway! Tilt the face sideways, and if there is anything inside the mouth, scoop it out with your fingers!

 
**Chloe:**
Bleeah... Your finger...! Ack!

 
**Nightingale:**
Lift the chin up, pinch the nose,
and blow in with all your might for one second!

 
**Chloe:**
Hey, I&ndash;hrmgh! Ack!

 
**Mash:**
I don't think you need to breathe with all your might...

 
**Nightingale:**
But most important are chest compressions! Punch the chest one hundred times per minute to force the heart to restart!

 
**Chloe:**
(Cough) ...Heart!? But it didn't stop...
Ow...owowowowowowowowowow!?

 
**Mash:**
Multiple hits with no rest between them!?

 
**Nightingale:**
...You have just witnessed a chief modern medical technique to combat death. It is known as CPR.

 
**Chloe:**
...That isn't...right...

 
**Mash:**
Um. I don't know how to react to that.

 
**Mash:**
That was a wonderful demonstration. The only thing that was unfortunate was that, rather than being a resuscitation exercise, it is guaranteed to kill the targum, patient.

 
**Nightingale:**
Mash. Should your respiratory organs shut down, come to me immediately. I will be sure to resuscitate you.

 
**Mash:**
N-no thank you!
Um, I'm fine with Chaldea's medical equipment!


**--ARROW--:**

**Chloe:**
I-I thought I was gonna die...
Ungh...what did I get myself into...?

 
**Mash:**
Nightingale really was unexpected. By the way, are you familiar with the phrase “what goes around, comes around”?

 
**Chloe:**
Hmmm, nope.

 
**Chloe:**
Oh? There's a flyer posted in the hallway.
Actually, there's a ton out here. Let's see what it says.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Warning: Serial kisser on the loose”

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“Female Servants should stay in their rooms.”


---
 
**Chloe:**
What the heck is this!?

 
**Mash:**
Looks like word of Chloe's evil doings has spread.
Perhaps now your wicked quest will come to an end.

 
**Chloe:**
But I haven't finished playing around... I mean...I still haven't found someone who's compatible with me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Time to quit...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Serial Kisser Squad will be dissolved...


---
 
**Mash:**
Indeed. We got dragged into this because of Chloe's insistence, but that will now come to an end. We cannot overlook your deeds any more.

 
**Mash:**
If you continue to corrupt Chaldea's morals,
I will stand in your way as Chaldea's shield!

 
**Chloe:**
Mash is betraying me now!? Unbelievable...
Desertion will not be permitted!

 
**Chloe:**
Come on! Don't be such a square just because you wear glasses! You dummy! You...Mashmallow Goody Two-shoes!

 
**Mash:**
I never once joined your squad, and I am not acting like a square. Also I don't understand why you'd call me Mashmallow.

 
**Chloe:**
Ungh... That Shielder is so serious.
Fine. Be that way.

 
**Mash:**
Whew. I'm glad she listened.

 
**Chloe:**
But there's one thing I want you to know: it may seem like I was playing around, but I really did want to make myself stronger.

 
**Chloe:**
I want to get strong for Fujimaru...
No, I wanted to be useful for [♂ big brother /♀️ big sister}...

 
**Mash:**
Chloe...

 
**Mash:**
Don't worry. I believe you. Sometimes you may go overboard, but I also know you have an inherent kindness within you.

 
**Mash:**
As for you getting stronger... Let's think about it together. I'm sure we'll find something for you.

 
**Chloe:**
Thanks.
But...it's fine.

 
**Mash:**
Eh? But...

 
**Chloe:**
Is this it?
We're coming in.

 
**Illya:**
Huh, Chloe?
What's going on?

 
**Mash:**
We're in...Illya's room?

 
**Illya:**
Mash! And [♂ big brother /♀️ big sister} Fujimaru too!
What great timing!

 
**Illya:**
Someone in red was teaching me how to make sweets.
I just finished up a batch.

 
**Illya:**
I'll brew up some tea, so let's have them together.

 
**Mash:**
What a wonderful, kind invitation. Even though you're so young, you are very domestic, Illya.

 
**Chloe:**
What is this feeling? I feel secure, as if I'm in my childhood home. And I simultaneously sense a newlywed and old-wifey aura from her...

 
**Chloe:**
Yeah...I knew it all along...
In the end, everyone wants to go back to Illya.

 
**Illya:**
I don't know what you're talking about...
Oh, by the way! Chloe, you should be careful too!

 
**Illya:**
I heard that there's some serial attacker lurking around in Chaldea! There's tons of victims already!

 
**Mash:**
Uh...um...

 
**Illya:**
Hm?

 
**Chloe:**
That's me.

 
**Illya:**
...Come again?

 
**Chloe:**
And now I'm here to make you my last victim.

 
**Illya & Mash:**
...Come AGAIN!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you knew from the beginning.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The one most compatible to you is Illya.


---
 
**Mash:**
W-wait a minute...!
Um...um...what you're trying to say is...?

 
**Chloe:**
Yep. The ones I attacked before were just for fun. I always knew the one most compatible with me was Illya!

 
**Mash:**
I was foolish to believe in Chloe even for a minute!!!

 
**Chloe:**
I'm running low on magical energy from that last battle! I'm gonna suck you harder than usual, Illya!

 
**Illya:**
Eh? What!? What's going on!?
Somebody explain!

 
**Mash:**
Please run, Illya!!!

 
**Illya:**
Waaaaaah!!!
Something like this always happens to me!!!

 
**Chloe:**
Yahoo!!!
It's hunting time!!!


**--BATTLE--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How did we end up chasing her all the way to a forest...?


---
 
**Illya:**
...

 
**Illya:**
... (Cough) ...

 
**Chloe:**
Yep. Delicious.

 
**Chloe:**
That's the familiar taste I enjoyed in Miyama. I think the fact that it's nothing out of the ordinary is proof that I succeeded.

 
**Mash:**
Oh... So in the end, I could not prevent Chloe's barbarism... I failed to defend Chaldea's morality...

 
**Chloe:**
Illya doesn't count. We're like twins.
Just think of it as sisterly bonding.

 
**Illya:**
... (Twitch, twitch)

 
**Mash:**
And this is the result of that bonding?

 
**Mash:**
N-no...I'm not going to comment on Chloe's bizarre morality anymore.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you found an efficient source of magical energy.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can we expect you to be better in battle?


---
 
**Chloe:**
Of course! From now on, if Illya is by my side,
I'll just keep sucking from her!

 
**Chloe:**
I'm kinda disappointed I never found another snack other than Illya, but I'll just keep looking on my own time.

 
**Chloe:**
And whenever Illya's not around, I'm counting on you to supply me with magical energy, okay Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Leave it to me! Always!


---
 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...May I interject?
I just remembered my first question about all of this...

 
**Mash:**
Do you do it...with Senpai...normally?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Silence)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No comment.


---
 
**Mash:**
You know...with Chloe...

 
**Mash:**
DOING SUCH THINGS AS THIS!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Silence)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No comment.


---
 
**Chloe:**
Ahahaha!
I knew Mash was jealous!

 
**Mash:**
Th-that's not what this is about!

 
**Mash:**
The magical energy necessary for a Servant to manifest is supplied by Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
That's why...there should be no need to siphon extra from other Servants...let alone from Master!

 
**Chloe:**
I know. That's why I've been saying “snack” this whole time.

 
**Mash:**
Come again?

 
**Chloe:**
A healthy lifestyle requires three meals a day, plus delicious snacks in between.

 
**Chloe:**
Actually, I can live off of my snacks,
so they really count as my meals! In other words...

 
**Chloe:**
My meals are snacks!!! (BAM)

 
**Mash:**
That doesn't make any sense!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(It's almost time for supplies to be distributed...I'm going to the Command Room.)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Slyly walk away)


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai? Why are you making a mad dash out of here without even looking back!?

 
**Mash:**
Please wait, Senpai! If you're running away, you must be hiding something! Explain...explain yourself!!!

 
**Chloe:**
And there they go.
Mash is seriously cute.

 
**Chloe:**
And Master didn't need to fret. I haven't done anything too bad that Mash would be concerned about. I only took a little sample.

 
**Chloe:**
But if Mash doesn't make a move soon...

 
**Illya:**
U-unnnnnngh...

 
**Chloe:**
Oh I forgot.
I forgot you were lying there, Illya.

 
**Illya:**
H-horrible!
You treated me worse than usual...!

 
**Chloe:**
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
I admit I went a little overboard this time.

 
**Chloe:**
Now come on, stand up.
Let's go home and have some tea.

 
**Illya:**
Tea... Oh right.

 
**Chloe:**
You made some snacks for us, right?
Let's have them together.

 
**Chloe:**
Together for...for now♪
