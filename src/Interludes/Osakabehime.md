# Osakabehime

## Hikikomori Milky Way

**Narration:**
...
...

 
**Narration:**
Dear Ma-chan.

 
**Narration:**
I was officially summoned to Chaldea some time ago...or maybe a long time ago.

 
**Narration:**
Now that I'm here, I want to live up to what's expected of a Servant.

 
**Narration:**
But the thing is...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, there truly is something to be said for keeping one's head cool and one's feet warm. I can't remember the last time my quill flowed so freely!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Somebody grab me one of those tangerines over there!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...Oh, were you talking to me?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Here you go.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Thanks, Purple Shikibu!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
(Gulp) Mmm, deelish! There's nothing better than tangerines. Fresh or frozen, they're always tasty.
Talk about the fruit of the gods!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh, wait, I'm the god here, aren't I! Between the tangerines and the kotatsu, I thought I was turning Japanese! I really thought so!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Does Japan not have its own share of gods, Jaguar Warrior? Could you not be both a god and Japanese?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hm? (Casual whistling)

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, never mind!

 
**Mordred:**
Yo, let me get in on this!
Turns out it's still kinda early for surfing!

 
**Mordred:**
Not that the seasons ever change 'round here!

 
**Osakabehime:**
...
...

 
**Narration:**
I'm surrounded by so many strangers that I'm not quite sure what to do...

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Well, I guess I've met Murasaki Shikibu before, but that writerly aura is still a lot for me to take.)

 
**Osakabehime:**
Chotto a minute! Why are all you Servants hanging out in my room again!?

 
**Mordred:**
Where else're we s'posed to go?
You've got the only kotatsu in Chaldea!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Honestly though, I have to wonder if leaving it out all year is really the best course of action, meow.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Then again, I guess I used to do the same thing. There's something to be said for leaving your kotatsu out even in the summer. Something dark, I mean.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was intruding...

 
**Osakabehime:**
Waaaaaah! How am I supposed to make any progress on my manuscript like this!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh come now, I rather doubt you would have made any progress even in our absence.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Urk.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
It's okay, Lady Osakabehime.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Senpai...?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
If you just let your hair down and be yourself...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...your story will eventually take wing of its own accord...

 
**Osakabehime:**
That only works if you're a genius!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Waaaaaah!
Help me, Ma-chaaaaaan!

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Okay, I'm in Batty's room now, but where's Batty?
 
**Kiyohime:**
Ugh.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I've lost count of how many times she's gone into hiding at the first sign of trouble. It's a terrible habit of hers, isn't it, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Guess Batty isn't home...
 
**Kiyohime:**
Batty? Not home? That is simply not possible.

 
**Kiyohime:**
No, she's definitely in here somewhere.
I'm sure of it.

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Come on, let's search the room for her.
Huh? How do I know she isn't actually out?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hehehe, oh Master.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You saw for yourself how eager Osakabehime was to use Musashi's absence as an excuse to shut herself in, right?

 
**Kiyohime:**
There's no way!

 
**Kiyohime:**
She would ever leave!

 
**Kiyohime:**
We have been friends for a long time, so I know her well enough to say that with one-hundred-percent certainty♡

 
**Kiyohime:**
Now come on, let's look for her.
Baaatty! Where aaare yooou!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Come out now, while neither Master nor I is upseeet!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Olly olly oxen free!


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh? Did you just hear something, Master?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hmm. Now where could that voice have come from...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Under the kotatsu, maybe?
 
**Kiyohime:**
Under the kotatsu?
...Ah, yes, I see.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Go away!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It came from over here...
 
**Kiyohime:**
So it did. Well done, Master♪

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Huh... It looks like this kotatsu is connected to an alternate dimension.

 
**Kiyohime:**
What do we do now, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Simple. We dive in headfirst!
 
**Kiyohime:**
Understood. Okay, Master, here I go!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We go get her!
 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, I'm sure Batty is waiting for us to retrieve her.
All right then, let's go!

 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nooooooooo!!!


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Master. Master! Please, get a hold of yourself!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Of all the places I thought the kotatsu could lead, Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle was not one I even considered!

 
**Kiyohime:**
I've heard you go on about isekai before,
Batty, but this is ridiculous!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Urushaddup! Just go away!
I'm shutting myself in and working on my damn book!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Huh? That sounded like it came from...the castle keep?

 
**Osakabehime:**
This is MY kotatsu now!
Nobody gets in or out unless I seiso!

 
**Kiyohime:**
You said that as if you're just calling dibs, but I'm honestly impressed you made this place its own separate world. You're more skilled than I thought, Batty.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Right?

 
**Osakabehime:**
I've gotten a lot more used to fighting as a Servant than you'd think!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Heh heh heh, and on that note...byeanara,
Ma-chan and Kiyo-yo!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're back again...


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
I guess Batty must have complete control over that Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I'm not sure what we can do if she can send us back here with just a flick of her finger...

 
**Osakabehime:**
Bye now! I'll come back once I'm done with my final draft!

 
**Kiyohime:**
...I don't know about this, Master.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Batty is lying. I don't think she really means to come back at all...

 
**Kiyohime:**
No, that's not it. I think that SHE thinks she can't possibly come back.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hmm, now what are we going to do. I do feel bad that her kotatsu kept getting taken over...

 
**Kiyohime:**
...but that doesn't mean she can just run away from her responsibilities as a Servant.

 
**Kiyohime:**
And I think Batty knows that better than anyone.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Which would mean her lie about coming back after finishing her final draft is actually...

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well, Master? What are you going to do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What else?


---
 
**Narration:**
...In short, I can live here in peace and tranquility.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Kotatsu, kotatsu, I'm so into you, kotatsuuu♪

 
**Osakabehime:**
Don't come to get me, 'cause I don't wanna leeeave♪

 
**Osakabehime:**
Besides, who'd even want to go out when it's raining? Everyone knows rainy days are the perfect excuse to stay in.

 
**Narration:**
...Exactly.

 
**Narration:**
I'm not cut out to be a Servant.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...No, no. No, no, no.

 
**Narration:**
Of course I know that's no excuse. I get it.

 
**Narration:**
But just like a Berserker can't help but go berserk,
I can't help the fact that I'm a shut-in at heart.

 
**Osakabehime:**
So it shouldn't be a problem if I shut myself in for just a little bit now and then, right?

 
**Narration:**
Let's see... I think I should be okay for twenty...thirty...fifty years or so?

 
**Narration:**
I'll still be happy to serve Ma-chan even when [♂ he's /♀️ she's} an old [♂ man /♀️ lady}.

 
**Narration:**
That wouldn't bother me at all&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It might not bother you, but it sure as hell would bother me!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't I get a say in this!?


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Huh?
I... Wha...?

 
**Osakabehime:**
Gyaaaaaa!!!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Wh-wh-wh-what are you doing here again, Ma-chan!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
What do you think, Bats-for-Brains?

 
**Osakabehime:**
Where do YOU of all people get off insulting my intelligence, Kiyo-yo!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
What do you mean "of all people"? I'll have you know I could demonstrate my own intelligence in any number of ways.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...But that is not what is important right now.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I guess the fact that you'd casually consider shutting yourself in for fifty years just goes to show how ridiculous your innately inhuman sense of time is.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I, on the other hand, acquired my inhumanity later on, so my sense of time is so finely attuned I was able to match my breathing to Master's down to the second. I'm keeping count, so there's no mistake!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...(World's longest awkward pause) Right!
 
**Kiyohime:**
Hmm. I'll have to get to the bottom of what that long silence meant later.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you now. Gee, what a coincidence.
 
**Kiyohime:**
(Sniff) You can be so cold sometimes, Master...
But I won't let that bring me down!

 


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Hey! What do you think you're doing!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
That's just what we came here to ask.

 
**Kiyohime:**
As if turning your room into a separate world wasn't bad enough, now you want to shut yourself in it for fifty years!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
From one hime to another, I refuse to let you get away with this!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Nooo! I don't wanna! I'm too scaaared!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Forget it! If you think you can drag me out of here, go ahead and do your worst!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Ugh. I'm sorry you had to see my friend behave so disgracefully, Master...

 
**Kiyohime:**
Still, she was at least being truthful in what she said.

 
**Kiyohime:**
She truly is frightened, and does really want to shut herself away.

 
**Kiyohime:**
But she's also determined to put up a fight to make that happen now. She never had that kind of confidence before.

 
**Kiyohime:**
To put it simply, Master...

 
**Kiyohime:**
...she's just as proud to be your Servant as any of us.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, that pride may have led her to be weirdly confident about all the wrong things, but that's just Batty for you.

 
**Kiyohime:**
All right, Master, let's make our way straight to the castle keep, shall we?


**--BATTLE--:**


---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are those the monkeys we saw on the mountain?
 
**Kiyohime:**
They must have taken a liking to this place.

 
**Kiyohime:**
But I'm afraid they'll just have to move to the Enma-tei, whether they like it or not.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This place reminds me of Mecha Eli-chan...
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my! Talking about another woman when you're here with me!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well I never!

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
At any rate, my nose is telling me we should keep heading up.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Unfortunately, there's a limit to what my Stalking Skill can track when I'm not using them on you...

 
**Kiyohime:**
But, hehehe, the good news is, I don't need them to know where she's hiding.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's in her room again...
 
**Kiyohime:**
Agreed. Now come on, let's head straight up to the top of this castle.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Haha, maybe the kotatsu in her room here leads to yet another alternate world.
 
**Kiyohime:**
So a world inside a world, like a set of Matryoshka dolls? That does sound like an interesting idea.

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Hehehe. All that aside, we haven't had many chances to be alone lately, Master.

 
**Kiyohime:**
We can't let this one go to waste!
Now come on, let's take it niiice and slow.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Like, three steps forward, three steps back slow♡

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not slow, that's literally going nowhere!


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Chotto a minute! Are you just using me as an excuse to get your own fun in, Kiyo-yo!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
I sure am♪

 
**Osakabehime:**
Waaahhh! I thought we were besties!
Have you no kokoro!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Me? Heartless? How rude.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I'll have you know there is no Servant in this entire world whose heart burns hotter than mine.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Right, Master?


**--ARROW--:**

**Narration:**
...All sorts of Servants have started visiting my room.

 
**Narration:**
I know it's probably a good thing.

 
**Narration:**
I used to be sad and mopey all the time.
Now I think I'm leading a fuller life.

 
**Narration:**
Every day here is great. The work, the training, the small talk... It's all so refreshingly straightforward.

 
**Narration:**
I have old friends here I can be myself around, and I've made new ones, too.

 
**Narration:**
If someone asked whether or not I liked this,
my honest answer would be that I do.

 
**Narration:**
But every time I come to that conclusion, I can feel the gears in my heart creaking against the strain.

 
**Narration:**
No, no, no.
This isn't who you are.

 
**Narration:**
That's when I start to feel bad again. Not at how wrongly I'm behaving, but at how right.

 
**Narration:**
...I want to be left alone.

 
**Narration:**
It's just as hard now as it was before. Being around people is tiring, all the smiling gives me a cramp, I can't get any work done on my book...

 
**Narration:**
But at the same time, I can't pretend to be a proud lone wolf. I still get lonely.

 
**Narration:**
Unlike a certain king I could name, I can't really say I'm okay just being all by myself.

 
**Narration:**
It sucks. My feelings are all over the place, and I can't put them into words in any kind of way that makes sense.

 
**Narration:**
I half-ass everything... I can never choose a side...
I'm a bat, a snake, a castle monster...

 
**Narration:**
...I don't know WHAT I am.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...Is something wrong, Master?

 
**Kiyohime:**
You looked as though you were dreaming even while you were walking.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, I guess I spaced out.
 
**Kiyohime:**
Hmph. I can't believe you'd space out when you're here with me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think...I just saw one of Osakabehime's dreams...
 
**Kiyohime:**
Well, this is Batty&ndash;Osakabehime's domain. It's no surprise something like that could happen here.

 
**Kiyohime:**
It's nothing as strong as a Reality Marble, of course. It's just a big papier-mâché delusion stretched as far as it'll go.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I could burn it all now and this would be over in an instant, but Batty really would shut herself away if I did that.

 
**Kiyohime:**
So I'm afraid I'll need you to join me for at least a little while longer, Master.

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Kiyohime:**
What is this writing?

 
**Osakabehime:**
Ah! That's my&ndash;!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is something wrong?


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
...No, everything's fine. Now that its magical energy is gone, it's just a plain old bit of text.

 
**Kiyohime:**
I'll just put it in this box over here and leave it by the wall.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Phew.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You owe me one, Batty.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...I'll do my best to make it up to you.


**--ARROW--:**

**Kiyohime:**
This hall is very long...but my Stalking Skill is never wrong.

 
**Kiyohime:**
And right now, it's telling me it won't be long until we see Batty in person.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Grr. So you finally made it, Kiyo-yo and Ma-chan...

 
**Osakabehime:**
But I'm daijo... I'm okay. You can leave now. I'm essentially just hiding out in my kotatsu, anyway.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You need to go outside sometimes, Batty.

 
**Osakabehime:**
No I don't. What's wrong with staying in?

 
**Kiyohime:**
You're only being halfway honest about this. You want to go out, but you also don't want to go out.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...It doesn't make any sense, does it?

 
**Osakabehime:**
I have been enjoying myself here,
thanks to Ma-chan giving me the push I needed.

 
**Osakabehime:**
But...it's also so exhausting!

 
**Kiyohime:**
I understand. Okay then, let's fight it out.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...
...

 
**Osakabehime:**
...Uh, why?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Master wants to help you,
and you want to turn [♂ him /♀️ her} away.

 
**Kiyohime:**
We could talk it out for days and never get anywhere. Violence, on the other hand, is a much faster solution.

 
**Osakabehime:**
I think you might be spending too much time with Tomoe these days, Kiyo-yo! You're starting to sound just like her!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can we at least try talking this out first?
 
**Osakabehime:**
N-no! There's nothing I want to talk about!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Are you hiding something, Hime?
 
**Osakabehime:**
N-no! Not a damn thing!

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Now that was just an outright lie.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You have something you want to talk about,
and there's something you're hiding.

 
**Kiyohime:**
But you're too embarrassed to share.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Gnnnh...! You big baka lie detector!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Fine then! If that's how you want to play this, then kakatte come on!

 
**Osakabehime:**
If that's what I gotta do to maintain my hiko lifestyle for a while, I'll meet violence with violence!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Osakabehime:**
Yeooowch! Hot, hot, hot!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Mmm, roast bat♪

 
**Osakabehime:**
I knew you were a dragon,
but I didn't think you were a demon too!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Ugh, fine! You win! I give up!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Good. All right, Batty, tell us what's really going on.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...
...

 
**Osakabehime:**
Gnnn...

 
**Kiyohime:**
...(Sigh)

 
**Kiyohime:**
Here, Master, I'll give you two some space.
That's two you owe me now, Batty.

 
**Osakabehime:**
I know, I know.

 
**Osakabehime:**
...I felt us syncing up earlier.
You saw something, didn't you?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I saw what life in Chaldea has been like for you.
 
**Osakabehime:**
Then I shouldn't really need to say anything.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I saw the same you I always do.
 
**Osakabehime:**
...That isn't who I always am.

 
**Osakabehime:**
I could never live with myself if it was.

 


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Basically, I guess...

 
**Osakabehime:**
I've been having a constant stream of visitors in my room lately.

 
**Osakabehime:**
They're loud, and annoying, and exasperating...but I don't have the guts to tell them to leave.

 
**Osakabehime:**
And even if I hole up on my own like this...

 
**Osakabehime:**
...it just doesn't feel like the amazing paradise it used to...

 
**Osakabehime:**
I can't make up my mind how I feel.
I don't make any sense.

 
**Osakabehime:**
When I'm alone, I want company.
When I have company, I want to be alone.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Pretty selfish of me, huh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is it...?
 
**Osakabehime:**
Yes! It is!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wouldn't really call that selfish.
 
**Osakabehime:**
Well it is!

 


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
...That said, this really isn't that big of a deal. Honestly.

 
**Osakabehime:**
I just need to try a little harder.

 
**Osakabehime:**
If I'm alone, I can just go hang out with someone.
And if I'm with someone, I can just go be by myself.

 
**Osakabehime:**
The only problem is, I can't find the courage to do that. I mean, how could I?

 
**Osakabehime:**
The only one who inspires me to be brave like that is...well...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who?
 
**Osakabehime:**
How can you be such a baka!?
I'm talking about you, of course!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait. You don't mean me, do you?
 
**Osakabehime:**
You're really just starting to wakarunderstand!?

 


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Between last winter and this spring the frequency of you visiting me considerably dropped!

 
**Osakabehime:**
This is a huge problem, Ma-chan!
Now look me in the eyes and tell me the truth!

 
**Osakabehime:**
Did you stop visiting because my kotatsu is too hot?
Have I been getting in your way somehow?

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Gyaaaaaah! What am I even saying!?)

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Yabe! I can barely believe what I'm saying,
and I'm the one saying it!)

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Still, there is no arguing [♂ he /♀️ she} hasn't been coming to my room lately!)

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Whatever [♂ he /♀️ she} tells me,
I have to be ready to handle it!)

 
**Osakabehime:**
(At least this isn't a normal Holy Grail War,
so I shouldn't have to worry about getting fired!)

 
**Osakabehime:**
(Although, I guess [♂ he /♀️ she} could force me to go into my spirit form... Iyaaaaa!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't want to get in the way of your writing...


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
...Huh? What're you talking about?

 
**Osakabehime:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is everything okay?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe you should take a little break...


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Sorry Ma-chan, but would you mind being shizuquiet for a bit!?

 
**Osakabehime:**
Rrgh, none of this is working!
I can't seem to get my thoughts in order!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I, uh, I see.


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Done! It's all done!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Congratulations!


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
Now to ride this high and get started on my next book!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm just gonna get going, okay?


---
 
**Osakabehime:**
(Humming happily)

 
**Osakabehime:**
I... I... I...

 
**Osakabehime:**
I was so focused on my books that I didn't even realize how much of a jerk I was being! I'm so soooooorry!

 


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
...Well? Is everything better now?

 
**Osakabehime:**
If by “better” you mean “deeply hazukashii at how badly I treated Master and my completely dumb misreading of the situation”...

 
**Osakabehime:**
...then yes, I guess you could say things are better now.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. I should have said something sooner.


---
 
**Kiyohime:**
Ugh. You really need to stop coddling your Servants so much, Master.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Still, it's obvious that you didn't do this out of malice, Batty.

 
**Kiyohime:**
So if Master is willing to forgive you,
I'll at least hold off on calling in Musashi.

 
**Osakabehime:**
Okay, would you mind not just going from zero to nightmare scenario like it's no big deal!?

 
**Osakabehime:**
Whenever Musashi shows up, she's always smiles and positive energy, and she absolutely destroys my entire gloomy shtick!

 
**Osakabehime:**
But anyway...I'll go back now.

 
**Osakabehime:**
As long as you're with me, Ma-chan,
I can deal with just about anything.

 
**Osakabehime:**
So, um...do you think you might be willing to come visit me again?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!


---
 
**Narration:**
...And so, my selfish attempt at running away&ndash;or running and hiding, in this case&ndash;ended just like that.

 
**Narration:**
Once again, my room became a popular hangout spot...

 
**Narration:**
...but thanks to the little pipsque&ndash;Ms. Beni-Enma's advice, I decided to make a “Do Not Disturb” sign.

 
**Narration:**
It turns out people here can be surprisingly respectful of each other's privacy.

 
**Narration:**
Now, when I need to focus on my books without interruption or intrusion, I just put up the sign.

 
**Narration:**
And if I feel like having company again, I just take it down and the place becomes lively in no time.

 
**Narration:**

...Of course, I told Ma-chan [♂ he /♀️ she} can ignore that sign and come in whenever [♂ he /♀️ she} likes.

 
**Narration:**
I don't usually notice [♂ him /♀️ her} coming in when I'm focused on my book...

 
**Narration:**
...but whenever I turn around and notice [♂ him /♀️ her} sitting nearby, just cheerfully reading manga...

 
**Narration:**

**Narration:**
I'll probably need to come up with a name for this feeling someday...

**Osakabehime:**

**Osakabehime:**
Gyaaaaaah!

**Low Blood Pressure Kunoichi:**

**Osakabehime:**
Are you really asleep? 'Cause you're just saying the letters in “zzz” instead of actually snoring!

 
**Narration:**
...Oh well. This sort of thing just comes with the territory now. And for the most part...I'm really enjoying my life here at Chaldea.
