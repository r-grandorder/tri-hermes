# Nitocris

<h2>Pharaoh Nitocris</h2>

**Mash:**
Hmm? What's that...?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hmm...

 
**Ozymandias:**
This is some cheap wine. Its vulgar body, perhaps fearful at the honor of passing through my throat, pales and fades into nothingness.

 
**Ozymandias:**
I will at least acknowledge its grace, if nothing else.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hah hah hah, perhaps you're trying to say cold wine goes down well? You sure say things in a roundabout way!

 
**Mash:**
Is this a...party?

 
**Mash:**
Look, Nitocris over there seems to be sober.
She might be the most reasonable one here.

 
**Mash:**
Let's try to talk to her, Senpai.

 
**Nitocris:**
Oh, Master, Mash. What's going on?

 
**Mash:**
We just happened to be passing through.
Um...what are you doing here?

 
**Nitocris:**
We're drinking, as you can see. What of it?

 
**Nitocris:**
I was invited by the two pharaohs over there... Well, more like I volunteered myself to join them in their banquet.

 
**Mash:**
But why here in the Command Room?

 
**Nitocris:**
If you're asking about the location, Pharaoh Iskandar said this place is fitting for a king's banquet.

 
**Nitocris:**
If you are inquiring about the purpose of this banquet...

 
**Iskandar:**
Nitocris! What are you doing over there!?
Drink. Empty your cup and drink some more.

 
**Iskandar:**
This is a gathering of pharaohs. That includes you.

 
**Iskandar:**
I called Cleopatra too, but she was so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude and unworthiness that she passed out.

 
**Iskandar:**
So basically, you're the only person that can act as a representative for female pharaohs in Chaldea!

 
**Nitocris:**
...With all due respect, that's how it is.

 
**Mash:**
Now that you mention it, everyone here really does have the title of pharaoh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was Iskandar one too?


---
 
**Iskandar:**
Oh? Master, Mash, I didn't realize you were there!
Did the fragrance of the wine draw you here?

 
**Iskandar:**
It doesn't matter! As our mutual friends, you have permission to join us! Drink up!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Are you trying to cheapen this gathering of pharaohs? Besides, I recall they're at an age where they should avoid alcohol.

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Oh, very well. You're hardly even a pharaoh to begin with, and I do not intend to lambaste them for their age.
I shall permit it. Drink up!

 
**Iskandar:**
Haha, you're quite strict. But I do have a proper regnal name: Setepenre Meryamun!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Is that so?

 
**Ozymandias:**
I too am known by the name Setepenre.
I'm sure it is a common name for pharaohs.

 
**Ozymandias:**
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre... Son of Ra... Ramesses the Great... Amun's beloved...

 
**Ozymandias:**
That is who I, the Sun Ozymandias, am! I shall allow it. Sear that name into your Spirit Core and Spirit Origin! Remember it!

 
**Iskandar:**
By the gods! Then I suppose we're like brothers!

 
**Ozymandias:**
No, we're not brothers. We're not, but...

 
**Nitocris:**
I do believe the great king here is a pharaoh!
...I think that is what Cleopatra would say.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Interesting. You dare go against my will?

 
**Nitocris:**
N-No, great pharaoh, I would not! I just thought of what Cleopatra would say and I could not help it...

 
**Ozymandias:**
Well, it is true she might say something like that.
When did you get that close with each other?

 
**Nitocris:**
Please...forgive my indiscretion. My only lord is the Sun King, and my only alliance is with Fujimaru!

 
**Nitocris:**
Cleopatra is like... a troublesome little sister.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hah hah hah. Don't tease her so much, Sun King. Cleopatra would indeed say something like that.

 
**Iskandar:**
She was the last pharaoh on Earth.
If so, she is like a granddaughter to us.

 
**Ozymandias:**
True enough. Even if she's not related to us by blood, she was the last to inherit the title of pharaoh and its divinity.

 
**Iskandar:**
Yes. But if that's the case&mdash;

 
**Iskandar:**
Nitocris. You. Yes, you.

 
**Nitocris:**
Y-Yes?

 
**Iskandar:**
You're the oldest pharaoh among us.
Wouldn't you be more of a mother figure, then?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Truly an incarnation of the ancient Horus.

 
**Nitocris:**
I-I-I am a mother!?
To Lord Ozymandias!?

 
**Nitocris:**
Does that mean I can do whatever I want?
A mother does all sorts of things for her son...

 
**Nitocris:**
She cooks for him, lets him sleep on her lap...
Even tells old folktales and scary stories!

 
**Nitocris:**
W-Would you be okay with that?
I've never had a child...

 
**Mash:**
N-Nitocris?

 
**Nitocris:**
N-N-No, I am not worthy!

 
**Nitocris:**
Yes, that is too much. And Iskandar&ndash;you are a pharaoh who has accomplished more than I have.

 
**Nitocris:**
You are the King of Conquerors. You traveled far and wide, seizing many lands. I pale in comparison.

 
**Ozymandias:**
What's so great about a king who focused so much on expansion and left nothing but destruction in his wake?
I am a god. I am the sun. I am the true pharaoh.

 
**Nitocris:**
Pharaoh Ozymandias!
That is so obvious I need not say it!

 
**Nitocris:**
You are the king of kings: the god-king.

 
**Nitocris:**
You are so revered that I dare not even try to compare you with others. It would be far too presumptuous of me.

 
**Nitocris:**
...The same goes for Pharaoh Cleopatra. I didn't try as earnestly to protect the country as she did.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Didn't Cleopatra...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She destroyed the country, right?
 


---
 
**Ozymandias:**
If you speak of destruction, the decline of Upper and Lower Egypt became inevitable as soon as I, the true pharaoh, was gone.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Any reign other than my own would thereafter be imperfect, no matter who the pharaoh was.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Just as the Nile flows, the final destination was inevitable. I never had my hopes up.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hah hah hah. I feel I've said this before, but no country escapes downfall. Not even my Macedonia.

 
**Nitocris:**
Yes. If countries are destined to fall, then all things considered, I believe she played her part of pharaoh well.

 
**Nitocris:**
But I...

 
**Nitocris:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She seems kind of sad.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nitocris...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. I agree.
She seems depressed.

 
**Mash:**
For some reason she doesn't look like she's touched her wine.

 
**Nitocris:**
...I guess you can tell.

 
**Nitocris:**
I'm... an inexperienced pharaoh.

 
**Nitocris:**
When I see all these great pharaohs here...
When I subject myself to their gaze...

 
**Nitocris:**
I feel depressed...
N-No, more like ashamed.

 
**Mash:**
But Iskandar said that you're the oldest pharaoh in Chaldea, right?

 
**Mash:**
In other words, you were alive in the Age of Gods.
You're a pharaoh from the ancient times...

 
**Nitocris:**
You think in terms of your magecraft.
The older and greater Mystics possess more power.

 
**Nitocris:**
But to me, time means nothing.

 
**Nitocris:**
It's about how a pharaoh&ndash;the child of a god, a godlike king, a god incarnate&ndash;should be.

 
**Nitocris:**
...I don't know why I'm a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Nitocris:**
Do you know why I was not taken to the eternal afterlife?

 
**Nitocris:**
Ozymandias never chose it to begin with, but me...

 
**Nitocris:**
Me... I'm sure I just never made it there.

 
**Nitocris:**
Fujimaru, my ally... maybe I should talk to you about this.

 
**Nitocris:**
I...

 
**Nitocris:**
I am a foolish pharaoh. I closed off my own path to the afterlife.

 
**Nitocris:**
I took my own life without preparing for what lay beyond. But I have no regrets.

 
**Nitocris:**
I turned into a weapon for the sake of my brothers...

 
**Nitocris:**
...Those treacherous retainers who used pharaohs like puppets... Those fools who mocked the position of pharaoh...

 
**Nitocris:**
I sent them all to the bottom of the Nile... Without mercy, without hesitation, and without regret.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you got your revenge.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So that means... you killed them.
 


---
 
**Nitocris:**
Yes, I slaughtered them with my own hands.

 
**Nitocris:**
Perish, you foul creatures!

 
**Nitocris:**
No one will hear your screams, your groans, or your cries for help!

 
**Nitocris:**
I will kill you all! You should be happy to be embraced by the waters of the Nile as you die!

 
**Nitocris:**
You used my brothers as puppets...
You murdered them all...

 
**Nitocris:**
I will never forgive you. You shall never be forgiven! Never! Never! I've been waiting for this day...!

 
**Retainers:**
Why, Nitocris? We were the ones who helped you become pharaoh!

 
**Nitocris:**
It was for this day. Everything. Everything I've done was to kill you all.

 
**Nitocris:**
That has been my only reason for living.
Just so that you would choose me as your next puppet...

 
**Nitocris:**
I made you think you could control my dignity, my being, my body, my will.

 
**Nitocris:**
And you fell right into my trap. When you heard I had a gift for you, what did you think it was?

 
**Nitocris:**
A lavish banquet? A treasure of gold? Or maybe&mdash;Oh, you thought you could even have me?

 
**Nitocris:**
But this is the end. I will end it all for you.
The hubris of trying to control a pharaoh... It stops here!

 
**Retainers:**
Stop it! No! We don't want to die!
Save us...!

 
**Nitocris:**
Make your pleas to my dear brothers!
To the ones you killed without any mercy!

 
**Nitocris:**
You will not travel to the eternal afterlife. Ha, ha, but rest assured. I am the same. I will follow you soon.

 
**Nitocris:**
I will find you in death and torment you for eternity!

 
**Nitocris:**
I killed them... and then myself.

 
**Nitocris:**
...After putting up with so much, I'd finally taken my revenge.

 
**Nitocris:**
Come to think of it, maybe I'm so short-tempered as a Heroic Spirit because of my deeds in life.

 
**Nitocris:**
I am a puppet of a pharaoh.
At best, all I ever accomplished was revenge.

 
**Nitocris:**
That's why I've tried to be as proper as possible.

 
**Nitocris:**
I punished them for their impiety in attempting to control the position of pharaoh. I tried to restore honor to the pharaoh name.

 
**Nitocris:**
The pride I have as pharaoh does exist within my heart, but even still...

 
**Nitocris:**
If I compare myself to the other pharaohs, I shiver just thinking how small I am...

 
**Nitocris:**
I'm so pathetic... I can't even bring myself to face them...!

 
**Ozymandias:**
...

 
**Iskandar:**
Hey, small one.

 
**Iskandar:**
Let's see. How's this? (Beep, beep.) There.

 
**Iskandar:**
Difficulty setting? Oooh... “Sparta Mode.” That's got a nice ring to it. Must mean it's as strong as them.
That settles it, then...

 
**Mash:**
Iskandar? What are you doing in front of that console...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Hey! Helloooo?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The training program just activated.
Are you guys doing something?

 
**Iskandar:**
Of course we are! The wine has warmed our bodies. How about we swing our swords for a little entertainment!

 
**Iskandar:**
By the way, I'll be assisting the enemy.

 
**Nitocris:**
...!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
I am tired of all the cheap wine.
It might be fun to play along with you!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Rejoice, pretenders! Rather than eradicating you, I will shine from on high.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Even those who are not truly alive weep tears of joy. Sear the light of the pharaoh into you!

 
**Iskandar:**
I see. That puts Master with Mash and Nitocris.
A good team.

 
**Mash:**
When did we say we were all joining in!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't really get what's going on there, but am I right in assuming there's going to be a fight in the simulator?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, just don't get hurt, okay?

 
**Nitocris:**
I... I have to fight a proper pharaoh?
That would just be too disrespectful...

 
**Iskandar:**
I won't forgive desertion.
If you run, you will face the consequences.

 
**Iskandar:**
What do you think, Sun King?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Escape and defeat are not fit for the divinity of the pharaohs! Thus...

 
**Iskandar:**
That's right. If you run, you must renounce the title of pharaoh.

 
**Nitocris:**
...!?

 
**Iskandar:**
Never address yourself that way. Never use the name. And...let's see... Say you're sorry for being a pharaoh up until now.

 
**Nitocris:**
I-I can't...do that...

 
**Nitocris:**
I am a pharaoh, no matter how short my reign was!
I just can't renounce that fact!

 
**Iskandar:**
Then you must fight. I don't have to say this, but you'll face the same consequences if you lose. It'd also be boring if you threw the game.

 
**Iskandar:**
On the contrary, if you win... we'll give you some sort of reward.

 
**Ozymandias:**
You speak too much, King of Conquerors.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Nitocris, even after receiving my endless splendor, will your mirror still reflect darkness, or won't it?

 
**Ozymandias:**
If you're a pharaoh, then withstand it! If you can't, you will fade away. That's all there is to it!

 
**Mash:**
Looks like...we have no choice but to fight!

 
**Nitocris:**
Fujimaru! My ally!

 
**Nitocris:**
I'm an inexperienced pharaoh.
But the fact that I am still a pharaoh is my pride.

 
**Nitocris:**
If I'm going to lose that, then I can't afford to run or lose!

 
**Nitocris:**
I must win this fight no matter what! Lend me your power! No, PLEASE lend me your power!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nitocris:**
(Panting)

 
**Mash:**
That was intense!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You guys won. You won against three pharaohs that symbolize an era!

 
**Iskandar:**
Heh, heh... Ha, ha, ha! We lost! We lost!

 
**Ozymandias:**
I had no intention of holding back. Perhaps that cheap wine and my arrogance came back to bite me.

 
**Cleopatra:**
...

 
**Nitocris:**
Why are you all...

 
**Mash:**
(Cleopatra's here too. When did she join the battle!?)

 
**Iskandar:**
That's not the face a winner should make.

 
**Iskandar:**
I did not hold back. Your determination was just greater than ours.

 
**Iskandar:**
Listen up. You fought and defeated multiple pharaohs&mdash;myself included.

 
**Iskandar:**
O Queen of the Mirror who lived in the ancient world... You're a perfect pharaoh in your own right.

 
**Iskandar:**
I tell you this on my honor.
You should be thankful for this reward.

 
**Nitocris:**
...!?

 
**Cleopatra:**
That's right, Queen Nitocris.
I witnessed it myself. It's just as you said.

 
**Cleopatra:**
I saw your pride as a pharaoh...

 
**Nitocris:**
Cleopatra...

 
**Nitocris:**
(Huh...? How long have you been here?)

 
**Iskandar:**
That's something I lack, to say the least.

 
**Iskandar:**
In that respect, I think you're a better pharaoh than I am. There's nothing to be ashamed of.

 
**Ozymandias:**
A better pharaoh!? Such a useless distinction!
Just being a pharaoh is enough!

 
**Ozymandias:**
It's pure arrogance to wish for any more than that.

 
**Ozymandias:**
After all, it's established fact that I am the best and most venerable pharaoh. Anything more is fighting for scraps!

 
**Ozymandias:**
You could be known only for your dark, vengeful acts... or for your numerous conquests... You could be the last of your kind...

 
**Ozymandias:**
You could even be a young pharaoh who only reigned for a few days...

 
**Ozymandias:**
No matter what kind of pharaoh you are, to me, there is very little difference!

 
**Ozymandias:**
But that is why I understand your admiration towards me. It may be arrogant, but I do understand.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Humans still extend their arms to the sun, even knowing they can't reach it. They attempt to touch the gods.

 
**Ozymandias:**
There is nothing as meaningless as hanging your head in despair because you cannot reach me. That would be true arrogance.

 
**Iskandar:**
Hey, you. You just counted me as a pharaoh, didn't you? It feels like I finally got my certificate of authenticity or something.

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Hah hah! This is some cheap wine! I'm not thinking properly, but my mouth keeps going!

 
**Ozymandias:**
Let's go somewhere else and keep drinking, Rider.
This time get me some wine that will at least let me talk properly!

 
**Iskandar:**
You're a Rider too, you know? We can keep drinking, but there's not much in the way of wine around here...

 
**Iskandar:**
Oh, but I do know a king with a big attitude whose wine happens to be very good.

 
**Iskandar:**
All he'd need to do is fetch some more from the storeroom... I wonder where he is?

 
**Mash:**
He left...

 
**Nitocris:**
...Were the pharaohs... trying to...

 
**Nitocris:**
...tell me that...all along?

 
**Nitocris:**
...Fujimaru.

 
**Nitocris:**
I was a fool who, unable to make it to the eternal afterlife, eventually became a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Nitocris:**
I thought it was a punishment by the gods, but...

 
**Nitocris:**
But then I met Ozymandias and the other pharaohs. And not just them&ndash; I met you too. The best ally I could ever have.

 
**Nitocris:**
This isn't a punishment. It's...

 
**Nitocris:**
...No, never mind.

 
**Nitocris:**
I was just blurting out nonsense. It was just my imagination. Let's just forget it. Forget it!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know I'm not really good at taking hints, but let me say this.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since you guys fought at full force, the simulator's all messed up! It's...pretty tough to clean it up, you know...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just let us do it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Us two will do it.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. That's true.

 
**Mash:**
We'll take care of it, Nitocris, so go on ahead.
Wherever you'd like.

 
**Nitocris:**
...Are you sure?

 
**Mash:**
Of course.

 
**Nitocris:**
...(Bowing)

 
**Mash:**
...Pharaohs... Rulers of Egypt... I'm sure there is some kind of special bond between them...

 
**Mash:**
Especially since it was such a long-lasting tradition.

 
**Mash:**
...Now then, Master. Let's do our best to clean up.

 
**Mash:**
However, no matter how you look at it, this isn't a two-person job. I recommend calling for some help.

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, you are listening, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see. So when you said you two would do it, you were talking about me as well...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hah... The pharaohs sure do everything on a grand scale... including affecting the simulator system... (Sigh)
