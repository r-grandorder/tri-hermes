Narration [George]: Capsule Servant!  
  
Narration: They are somewhat familiar-looking Heroic Spirits? created by the Great Grail.  
  
Narration: It is some kind of battle game enjoyed by the children of the future, derived from a small-scale summoning of pseudo-Heroic Spirits, called Capsule Summoning!  
  
Narration: Well, that doesn’t really matter, but anyway Fuyuki City has once again been caught up in a bothersome disturbance in space-time.  
  
Narration: Servant-like things being summoned one after another.  
  
Narration: Master-esque worldly-minded people appearing in succession.  
  
Narration: Fight, fight on…!  
  
Narration: The powers of darkness and microtransactions eat away at the people’s hearts.  
  
Narration: While everyone falls to their knees in despair, two courageous elementary school students…  
  
Narration: —Shirou and Rin, with the power of the Capsule Servants they obtained by chance, face an array of villains…!  
  
Narration: Over 50 Servants.  
  
Narration: A gathering of evil Masters.  
  
Narration: Who could be behind this?!  
  
Narration: Eh? It’s not a tiger or something?  
  
Narration: Time and space will collapse in only five hours or something like that!  
  
Narration: Can Shirou restore the peace of the town for everyone, and can Rin restore the peace of the town for herself…?!
