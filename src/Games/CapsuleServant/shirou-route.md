**Shinji:**  Welcome to stage 01, also known as the tutorial!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. That’s nice of you!  
  
**Shinji:**  I’m Matou Shinji-sama, who originally was planned to be the boss character “General Shinji” but for various reasons was demoted to the tutorial punching bag!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. What a pity!  
  
**Shinji:**  I was hoping they’d establish that when I was in elementary school I was purehearted and still a relatively good boy, but they didn’t! Here we go!!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. Sorry, I guess!

**Sakura:**  I finally found you. I’ll get revenge for Nii-san…  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay. Who’s he?  
  
**Sakura:**  Um, you see… He’s got a lot of pride but gives off this really strong feeling of unimportance… His hair is gross like wakame…  
  
**Shirou:**  Ah, you mean Shinji from the tutorial!  
  
**Sakura:**  …….(What a wonderful person…) Okay, I got it. If I lose, I’ll become your bride, okay.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, Shinji must have it tough!

**Kayneth:**  Kukuku… Move aside, commoner boy. I’ll be taking all the rare Capsaba!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, you must be really childish to cut in line!  
  
**Kayneth:**  Hmph. When it comes to survival there are no adults or children or young ladies!  
  
**Kayneth:**  Just how much do you think I’ve invested in this? Capsaba is already my life!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yep, then your life will be over when you run out of money!  
  
**Kayneth:**  T-that’s quite wise… Then I must recognize you as a formidable opponent.  
  
**Kayneth:**  Behold this Capsaba Meister’s artfully constructed deck!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, so you’re the type who doesn’t learn until he gets hurt!

**Ayaka:**  ……… (stare)  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay, are you my next opponent, lady?  
  
**Ayaka:**  Mph! What? You’re saying I’m an easy target because I look weak and wear glasses, aren’t you?!  
  
**Shirou:**  No, then should we stop?  
  
**Ayaka:**  You mean you’re ignoring me?! So you don’t like glasses, do you!  
  
**Ayaka:**  I’m right, aren’t I?! What’s wrong with glasses?!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, you’re the bothersome type!

**Waver:**  No way… A kid like this is a Capsaba Master?  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, that’s right!  
  
**Waver:**  We met by chance… then this is destiny…! In that case, I can’t run away! Isn’t that right, Rider!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, then there’s no choice but to fight!  
  
**Waver:**  No, wait. I need to emotionally prepare… U-ummmm… R-Rider!  
  
**Waver:**  Let’s win no matter what…  
  
**Waver:**  Let’s take the grail!  
  
**Waver:**  Let’s take the world too!  
  
**Waver:**  Failure is not an option…!  
  
**Waver:**  All right, I’m gonna do it!  
  
**Shirou:**  Live more carefreely, mister!

**Hakuno:**  …….  
  
**Shirou:**  …….  
  
**Hakuno:**  ……. (smirk)  
  
**Shirou:**  …She’s pretty good!

**Luvia:**  Oooooohohoho, I am Luviagelita Edelfelt!  
  
**Luvia:**  I’m a girl genius who will one day become queen of not only the Capsaba world, but also the wrestling ring!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. You should start small!  
  
**Luvia:**  Hmph, what accurate advice for a first meeting… State your name.  
  
**Luvia:**  You seem to show promise, so I may consider hiring you as an apprentice butler.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. I already know what I want to be, so no thanks!  
  
**Luvia:**  My, you have a good sense of purpose as well! Excellent!  
  
**Luvia:**  I’ll present you the special opportunity to become my manager! Only if you win against me, that is!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. I won’t be your manager, but I’ll give it a shot!

**Kirei:**  Lost lamb… What business do you have at my church?  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, you’re hiding something, huh mister!  
  
**Kirei:**  Hmm, it seems you are quite perceptive in this world.  
  
**Kirei:**  A result of Emiya Kiritsugu’s training, perhaps?  
  
**Shirou:**  Hm? You know Dad?  
  
**Kirei:**  Yes… But that is not important. If I’m “hiding” something, what do you plan to do?  
  
**Kirei:**  Emiya… Shirou-kun?  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, I’m gonna beat you up!

**Tokiomi:**  I am Fuyuki’s Second Owner, the Capsaba uncle, Tohsaka Tokiomi.  
  
**Tokiomi:**  An elegant dandy who is retrieving the Capsule Servants, which are too powerful for children to have.  
  
**Tokiomi:**  I think you can understand what this means. Well?  
  
**Shirou:**  I don’t understand at all! Huh? Tohsaka? Are you with Rin?!  
  
**Tokiomi:**  Oh, are you Rin’s friend? In that case, please get along with her.  
  
**Tokiomi:**  You wouldn’t think it to look at her, but can be careless. I fear she may fall in love with some boy of doubtful origin someday.  
  
**Tokiomi:**  Oh, hahaha, how rude of me. It seems I’m being too much of a doting parent!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, Rin must have it tough!  
  
**Tokiomi:**  In any case, your reckless fighting ends here.  
  
**Tokiomi:**  If I win, I will have you hand over your Serv…  
  
**Shirou:**  What’s wrong?  
  
**Tokiomi:**  Nice joke. It seems I’ve left my Capsaba at home. Would you mind waiting a minute?  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, like father like daughter!

**Master Artoria:**  Are you to be my next opponent, then?  
  
**Master Artoria:**  I am Artoria, a Master fighting the Holy Grail War.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. You’re manly!  
  
**Master Artoria:**  Wha–?! …I did not choose this style of speech!  
  
**Master Artoria:**  It is because of the men of my family that I became this way!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. What a pity!  
  
**Master Artoria:**  What a disgrace to be pitied by a child…  
  
**Master Artoria:**  Regardless, if you wish to pass through here, you must first defeat me!  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay, here we go!  
  
  
  
**Narration:**  Professor Tokiomi, captured by the evil Dimensional Empire MATO plotting to control all parallel worlds, was forced to perform terrible research!  
  
**Narration:**  With the aim of a cross-dimensional assault, he constructed a not-very-original type of weapon…  
  
**Narration:**  That is, a giant humanoid weapon using the Great Grail as a power source!

**Professor Tokiomi:**  That being the case, listen well, Shirou-kun.  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  I managed to escape their base, but I can’t go on anymore.  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  But without their notice I was somehow able to complete the massive humanoid weapon SAKURA.  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Please accept my dying request and fight the Dimensional Empire MATO!  
  
**Shirou:**  What are you doing, Rin’s dad?  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Indeed, I honestly wanted my daughter Rin to fight, but she refused me point-blank a minute ago, you see…  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  This must be what they call the rebellious age… Lately she’s been saying harsh things like how my beard looks like it belong on Paris Fashion Week or how I stink of musk…  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, being too much of a dandy can be a problem too!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Anyway, the only one left for me to turn to is you, who just happened to show up!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Will you accept? If you like, I don’t mind offering you Rin’s hand in marriage!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, you should treat your kids with more care!  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/7bHfTs1.jpg)

**General Shinji:**  Found you, Professor Tokiomi, you traitor! Now, will you come quietly?!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Damn you, General Shinji, one of the top brass of the MATO empire! I won’t let you people do as you like!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Now, Shirou-kun! Activate SAKURA immediately!  
  
**Shirou:**  I got it, but how do I pilot this?  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Fear not! The truth is, Capsule Servants…  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  …were spread throughout the world by me as practice tools to find someone qualified to pilot SAKURA.  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  If you’ve already made it this far, then you should be able to control SAKURA just as you control the Capsule Servants…!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, now that you mention it, this story was about Capsule Servants!  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/kihjN2o.jpg)

**Shinji:**  Wha–?! You were already complete, SAKURA?! Wait, uwa?!  
  
**Shinji:**  (squish)  
  
Shirou & **Professor Tokiomi:**  Ah.  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  …So, what is this? Why did I wake up in the morning looking like this?!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Well, er, I was being menaced by MATO and had no choice, you see…  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  …Is that so. …Then, isn’t there anything else you’ve forgotten to say?  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  E x – F a t h e r ?  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  ……….  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  ……….  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Shirou-kun…  
  
**Shirou:**  What?  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Help me!  
  
  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay, I won, but sorry, I guess!  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  Waaaah! This is a terrible thing to do to your own daughteeer!  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  With my body like this I can never become a briiiide! (glance)  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  Isn’t there anyone who will take meeee?! (glance)  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay, she’s glancing at me for some reason, but what do I do?  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  …So that was it. The requirement to pilot SAKURA was mutual trust…  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Yes… the power of your bond, Shirou-kun.  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, if her dad’s like this, I guess I feel kind of sorry for SAKURA!  
  
**Professor Tokiomi:**  Mph! My Tohsaka Elegant Radar is detecting enemies!

**Commander-in-chief Euryale:**  Huhuhu, don’t get carried away just because you defeated General Shinji!  
  
**Commander-in-chief Euryale:**  He was just an extra who wasn’t particularly one of us!  
  
**High Priestess Stheno:**  We, the Gorgon Sisters, will put an end to you personally!  
  
**Commander-in-chief Euryale:**  Go! Originally big but now even more giant, anti-SAKURA giant humanoid weapon MEDO-SA!

**Medo-sa:**  …Ah, yes, hi there, I’m the giant humanoid weapon… was that it? …Medo-sa.  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  …We both have trouble with family, don’t we, Rider.

**Narration:**  In the near future, mankind’s battle against the MATO empire plotting to rule the dimension begins!  
  
**Narration:**  In the midst of that battle is the boy who controls the world’s strongest humanoid weapon, SAKURA!  
  
**Narration:**  His name is Emiya Shirou!  
  
**Shirou:**  Destroy, Gigantic SAKURA!  
  
**G-SAKURA:**  Eh?! I’m still like this?!

**Liz:**  Illya, when you get off a plane, you have to wear a happi, a happi.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  I’m nooooooooot Illya! Didn’t we decide that my magnificent codename was the mysterious Capsaba champion Celebloomers?!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  No, more importantly, what’s a happi? Sounds kinda fun? Liz, aren’t you a bit too knowledgeable about Japan?  
  
**Sella:**  Milady, the preparations have been made for your press conference, so come this way.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  …Oh, right, right, let’s do it like this.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Ehhh, ahem.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Ohhh, it’s so haaard being the champion, you have to do press conferences day in and day out with no rest.  
  
  
  
The Beautiful, Dignified, Noble and All-Around Amazing Challenger  
  
  
  
**Celebloomers:**  There’s nobody here?!  
  
**Sella:**  T-this wasn’t supposed to…  
  
**Sella:**  Leysritt, you did correctly inform the Japanese government about Milady’s arival, didn’t you?!  
  
**Liz:**  Mm-hmm, I phoned before we left. They said something like “we ain’t no soba restaurant!” though.  
  
**Liz:**  Close enough.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Right, so you didn’t inform them at all!  
  
**Shirou:**  What are you doing?  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Hm? What’s with this kid?  
  
**Celebloomers:**  (gasp)?!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Could he be a Japanese fan who heard that I, the current Capsaba Champion, had arrived and forced his way in?!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Ehhh, this suuure is a problem, I need to run this kind of thing through my manager!  
  
**Shirou:**  Huh, is that so?  
  
**Liz:**  Illya, it looks like this boy doesn’t know anything.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Wh…at…?!  
  
**Shinji:**  Waaaaaaaaaaaait a minuuuuuuuuuuute!!!

**Shinji:**  M-might you be… the reigning champion of the Capsule Servant Battle – or Capsabattle for short – world championships, the mysterious, beautiful Capser…  
  
**Shinji:**  Celebloomers-san?!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Eh?!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Ah, right, that’s right! I’m the reigning Capsabattle champion and the mysterious beautiful Capser…  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Celebloomers-san!!!  
  
**Shirou:**  Is that true, Shinji?!  
  
**Shinji:**  Yeah!  
  
**Shinji:**  Celebloomers-san is the Capsaba champ who uses the orthodox financial-power style, famous for annihilating her opponents with a deck put together by using money!  
  
**Shinji:**  Hey, you’re not bowing deeply enough, Emiya!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, so it all comes down to money!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  No, um, you see, by use of clever tactics and technique…  
  
**Shinji:**  In the end, Capsule Servant is all about how many strong rare Servants you can collect!  
  
**Shinji:**  Normally, everyone reads the mood to keep the game fun, but…  
  
**Shinji:**  Celebloomers-san can’t, so she spent a ton of money loading her deck with rare Servants!  
  
**Shinji:**  To the extent that even I, the son of the noble Matou family, can’t help but be turned off by it, phew!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, phew!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Very well, now die!

**Celebloomers:**  H-how could I lose…?  
  
**Celebloomers:**  A-are you telling me I still haven’t spent enough money?!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, I think there’s something more important than money.  
  
**Shinji:**  Yes, Capsaba is a battle of bonds.  
  
**Shinji:**  What’s important is whether you and your Servants communicate with your hearts!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Liz, clean up this wakame.  
  
**Liz:**  Okay, then come this way.  
  
**Shinji:**  Young Capsers, let us meet again! Phew!  
  
**Sella:**  Milady, please do not be discouraged. However, I would be most grateful if you would take this as an opportunity to grow out of this worthless game.  
  
**Celebloomers:**  No no no no!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  I’m the champ!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  I collected a lot of rare Servants, so I’m the strongest!!!  
  
**???:** Haaahahahaha! How unsightly, Capsabattle world champion Celebloomers!

**Gilgamesh:**  Celebloomers – if that was your name – you have made no mistake!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  The foundation of the game of Capsaba is amassing property.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Witness the power of true excessive spending, to which the likes of you cannot compare!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Aaaaah?! Is that Servant–?!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Wahahahaha, terrifying, is it not? I spent the entirety of my treasury on collecting many super-rare Servants!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Among them is even this Galactica Saber, a super-rare Servant specially drawn by Takeuchi Takashi! I hug it while I sleep every night!  
  
**Celebloomers:**  H-how could it be… How could I, the world champ Celebloomers, lose at spending…  
  
**Celebloomers:**  S-Shirou-kun, you defeated me, so I entrust the rest to you…  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Please, please obtain the legendary ultra-rare Servant that even I could not get…  
  
**Celebloomers:**  “Galactica Saber FE (Final Edition)”  
  
**Celebloomers:**  Please… Guh…  
  
**Sella:**  Milady?!  
  
**Liz:**  By collecting all the Saber editions from limited-time Servant draws…  
  
**Liz:**  …there’s apparently a rare chance of drawing Galactica Saber FE, Shirou.  
  
**Shirou:**  All right! I’m retiring from Capsaba!

**???:** Oh. You there, please wait a minute.  
  
**Shirou:**  Hm? Do you need something, mister?  
  
**???:** Who are you calling mister? No matter how you look at it, I’m a miss!  
  
**???:** …Ah, no, it’s nothing.  
  
**???:** …If I’m yelling at child like this I really need to have more self-discipline…  
  
**???:** Er, I was dispatched by the Heroic Spirit Association in order to save the world from crisis. I am the temp Heroic Spirit Baze… I mean, FRAGA.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. I won’t ask what the Heroic Spirit Association is!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Thank you for being so understanding. The Capsule Servants, which out of all the parallel worlds only exist in this one…  
  
**FRAGA:**  This social power created through the use of the grail…  
  
**FRAGA:**  They are too dangerous for children to have, in the allowance-related sense.  
  
**FRAGA:**  I won’t say anything mean, so please hand all those Servants over to me.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. By the way, mister, you’re dressed pretty normal for a Heroic Spirit.  
  
**FRAGA:**  Eh? Is there something strange about it?  
  
**Shirou:**  Y’see, Heroic Spirits have cool outfits and Noble Phantasms and stuff. I saw it on TV, they shoot beams out of swords and stuff like that.  
  
**FRAGA:**  Eh? Cool outfits?  
  
**FRAGA:**  No, but this suit is order-made and, look, the fabric, the fabric is very nice!  
  
**FRAGA:**  And as for the Noble Phantasm, um, s-see these fists?!  
  
**Shirou:**  By the way, how did you become a Heroic Spirit?  
  
**FRAGA:**  Eh? How, well…  
  
**FRAGA:**  5000 push-ups a day, 5000 sit-ups, and 100km of running.  
  
**FRAGA:**  I kept up that daily routine and kept taking on work and eventually found myself like this…  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. Were you satisfied with that life?  
  
**FRAGA:**  Eh? W-what’s with this boy?  
  
**FRAGA:**  W-well, you could say I didn’t really have anything better to do, or something like that.  
  
**Shirou:**  By the way, what does “temp” mean if you’re a Heroic Spirit?  
  
**FRAGA:**  Urk…  
  
**FRAGA:**  Well, of course I would have preferred regular employment…  
  
**FRAGA:**  Lately there’ve been too many new Heroic Spirits, and I was pretty tied up after graduation…  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, so you wasted your precious new-graduate period!  
  
**FRAGA:**  But I tried hard at job hunting too! I even got an interview in the end.  
  
**FRAGA:**  I got a letter that said, “We don’t have any openings at the moment, but we may contact you at a further opportunity.”  
  
**FRAGA:**  “Would it be okay to contact you at that time?”  
  
**FRAGA:**  So I thought I’d work as a temp while I wait for them to contact me…  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. I hate to tell you this, but that was a rejection letter!  
  
**FRAGA:**  What did you just say?! No wonder they didn’t contact me!  
  
**FRAGA:**  What on earth?! If they wanted to reject me, why couldn’t they just clearly say they were rejecting me?!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, I wonder why. That’s society for you, I guess!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Guh! A-anyway, I have to work now if I want to eat!  
  
**FRAGA:**  If I think about the future my Sunday afternoons will be painful, so for now I’ll immerse myself in battle!  
  
**FRAGA:**  So, to go back to what I was saying earlier, prepare yourself!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, I guess some things are just hopeless!  
  
  
  
**FRAGA:**  I… I lost…  
  
**FRAGA:**  I wonder if my work-related injury insurance will cover this… Ah, I was a temp worker.  
  
**FRAGA:**  Ooh… I’m so envious of how easy the regularly employed Heroic Spirits have it…  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, I don’t know what to say!  
  
**FRAGA:**  I’m not working as a temp Heroic Spirit because I want to.  
  
**FRAGA:**  But even if I turned things around and appeared as a regular Servant…  
  
**FRAGA:**  …a temp Heroic Spirit would never be accepted over an official Heroic Spirit…  
  
**Shirou:**  Hmmm, then how do you become an official Heroic Spirit?  
  
**FRAGA:**  Well, by participating in the Holy Grail War and getting good results, for example…  
  
**FRAGA:**  That is, you just need good achievements!  
  
**FRAGA:**  …But a temp Heroic Spirit wouldn’t get that chance to begin with.  
  
**FRAGA:**  Aah! Who made the Holy Grail War like this?!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, then if I ever participate in the Holy Grail War, I’ll contract with you, mister!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Like I said, I’m not a mister…  
  
**FRAGA:**  What?! Really?! You’re not lying, right?!  
  
**FRAGA:**  It’s not something like, “Would it be okay to contact you when the Holy Grail War takes place?”  
  
**FRAGA:**  Right?!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, so if I participate I’ll contact you, so give me your contact info!  
  
**FRAGA:**  All right, then I’ll give you this earring!  
  
**FRAGA:**  You need a relic to summon a Servant!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Wah, I’m just like an official Heroic Spirit now, hooraaaay!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, I don’t know if I participate or not, but wait patiently, ok!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Yes!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Well then, thank you for everything! I’m returning to the Throne of Heroes (for temp use) to wait, so thank you in advance!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, then see you later!  
  
  
  
**Narration:**  ~7 years later~

**FRAGA:**  Official Heroic Spirits? You act all high-and-mighty at the workplace, but this is all you’ve got! Ability is everything in the field!  
  
**Shirou:**  Ahh, yeah, Baze… I mean, Boxer, that’s enough.  
  
**FRAGA:**  Well then, shall we go smash Berserker next?!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Please leave everything to Boxer, the Heroic Spirit of the fist, Master!  
  
**FRAGA:**  Huhuhu… With these results, I have a real shot at being hired as an offical Heroic Spirit!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yep, the Holy Grail War sure is hell!  
  
**The End**

**See The World By Jeanne**  
  
**Jeanne:**  About 9700km from Domremy, France, I saw a quiet town from the window of a car.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Fuyuki, the town known as the location of the original Holy Grail War.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Most of the people living here have been affected by the Holy Grail War, be it in a major or minor way.  
  
**Jeanne:**  The large temple visible in the mountains is Ryuudou temple, which contains a large natural cave.  
  
**Jeanne:**  The Great Grail with Justeaze as its base is installed there, making it the place where the first and last grails of the Holy Grail War were summoned.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Well, people have still been having Grail Wars all over the place after that, though.

**Jeanne:**  So I, the maiden of Orleans, Jeanne d’Arc…  
  
**Jeanne:**  …am using the Heroic Spirit vacation time that I recieve for completing my work as Ruler to come here to Fuyuki on holiday.  
  
**Shirou:**  ?  
  
**Jeanne:**  Of course, as France’s biggest celebrity, I haven’t forgotten to disguise myself to hide my identity.  
  
**Jeanne:**  It wouldn’t do to see “Shocker! Saint Descends In Far-East Land!” as the headline on tomorrow’s morning newspaper, after all.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Despite appearances, I’m the worldwide super-famous Heroic Spirit Jeanne d’Arc, you know?  
  
**Jeanne:**  It’s so haaard. It’s so haaard to hide my identity even when I’m on vacation.  
  
**Jeanne:**  It’s so haaard to have to hide my name for a different reason than Servants.  
  
**Shirou:**  ?  
  
**Jeanne:**  Oh, this boy… (gasp)?! Could he be…  
  
**Jeanne:**  …a young soldier who was affected by my holy aura, couldn’t contain himself, and rushed to serve under my banner?!  
  
**Shirou:**  ?  
  
**Jeanne:**  Oh well, there’s not much I can do about it, I am a worldwide super famous Heroic Spirit after all.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Anyone who saw the maiden of Orleans walking wearily along the road would pledge to rush through a fleeting yet intense life like a flame in service to her sacred banner, wouldn’t they?  
  
**Shirou:**  Ah! I remember! I’ve seen you on TV!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Right?! Of course you would.  
  
**Jeanne:**  It’s so haaard, it’s so haaard having my uncontainable super famous Heroic Spirit aura (divinity) seep out even if I try to hide it.  
  
**Jeanne:**  But I’m in the Ruler position, so I can’t participate directly.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Even if you said “if I’m gonna summon anyone it’s gotta be the maiden of Orleans, it’s just common sense!”…  
  
**Jeanne:**  …and wanted to summon me, it seems that’s impossible as far as the system goes, so please give up, okay… um… little boy from this country?  
  
**Shirou:**  You’re King Arthur, right?! King Arthur! They showed you on that anime on TV! You’re actually a girl, right, I know I know!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Damn you, England!  
  
  
  
**Jeanne:**  How can this be…?  
  
**Jeanne:**  To think I was actually not such a famous Heroic Spirit in the East…  
  
**Jeanne:**  What were you doing, Xavier?  
  
**Shirou:**  Sorry, seems I mistook you for someone else!  
  
**Jeanne:**  I don’t think I can be that easily mistaken for King Arthur though… My chest, for example…  
  
**Jeanne:**  No, but still, I’m Jeanne d’Arc, you know?! From the Hundred-Year War?!  
  
**Jeanne:**  When you think “hero of France”, you think me, right?!  
  
**Shirou:**  Sorry. But I do know of Napoleon!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Even that little man?!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Grrr…  
  
**Jeanne:**  Here! Please look at this flag, it’s an amazing Noble Phantasm!  
  
**Jeanne:**  One wave of this even made Gilles so full of spirit he went France BASARA on the enemy camp and it was a huge mess!  
  
**Shirou:**  Sorry, it’s kinda plain. A sword that shoots beams is easier to understand!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Waaaaah! Fine!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Stupid, stupid! Pink hair! I’m never coming back to this countryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!  
  
**Shirou:**  Sorry, pretty foreign ladyyyyyyy! I don’t really get it, but sorryyyyyyyy!

**Lancer:**   
  
**Jeanne:**  I will ask you. Might you be my Master?  
  
**Shirou:**   
  
**Jeanne:**  Or whatever. I can’t stand out if I don’t participate!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Being Ruler feels more like a punishment. I wanted to try competing for the grail too sometime!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Oh, my Noble Phantasm? Don’t worry, I brought a really flashy one.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Look at this one-time-use Crimson– Ah, this was a self-destruction Noble Phantasm! (tee-hee)  
  
**Shirou:**  Wait wait wait.  
  
**Jeanne:**  It might finally be coming! The Jeaaaaaaaaanne boom!  
  
**Jeanne:**  There’ll be a Red Jeanne and a Sakura Jeanne, gosh, guess there’s no helping it since I’m such a popular character!  
  
**Jeanne:**  It’s so haaard, it’s so haaard being popular, I’m tired of all these Jeanne clones…  
  
**Jeanne:**  …Do you think I might be well on my way to becoming a star cash-cow like that?!  
  
**Shirou & Lancer:**  Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

**TO-SAKA:**  Welcome, vaguely familiar-looking bad boy!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  I am an envoy from the parallel universe where Heroic Spirit EMIYA was not created…  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  The ultimate, final possibility for a certain perfect young girl…  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Heroic Spirit TO-SAKA!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, so you’ve reached the end of the line!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Yes, I’m the wandering witch, journeying through the dimensions to destroy every grail…  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Magical Witch TO-SAKA!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, please be clear about whether you’re a Heroic Spirit or not!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …On that day, stricken with grief, I was forced to make a most terrible decision.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …Yes, I formed a contract with the world.  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, you had it hard!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Yes, I had to make the contract.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …To repay my excessively large loan!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see, just as I expected, you brought it on yourself!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Anyway, the world said…  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  “Hmmm, they’re having too many Grail Wars over there, we don’t lend out Heroic Sprits for free, you know…”  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  “So since you’re new, TO-SAKA-san, we thought we’d have you destroy the grails in a few worlds so there’ll be fewer Grail Wars…”  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  “Yep, for each grail you destroy that’s 3% of your loan paid off, so thanks in advance!”  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  So I’m busy destroying grails every day!  
  
**Shirou:**  Time flies when you’re hard at work, huh?  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  So I’ll be destroying this world’s grail too!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  The after-effects may blow this town off the map, but it’s to repay my loan, so oh well! Wow!  
  
**Shirou:**  I see. This is too much in a lot of ways and I can’t stand to look, so I’m gonna stop you!  
  
  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  As I expected… I remember now.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  You are… yes, you’re Shirou, aren’t you…  
  
**Shirou:**  I don’t get it, but hang in there, Heroic Spirit TO-SAKA!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Huhu, that tendency to be nice to everyone hasn’t changed.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …No, I’m the one who changed.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Even if it’s to repay my debts, to think I’d contract with the world and be reduced to a destructive witch…  
  
**Shirou:**  I think I’ve heard this story somewhere before, but anyway, let’s end this, TO-SAKA!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …Yes, that’s right. I need to put an end to it.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …Thank you, Shirou. I remembered… my true self… (slump)  
  
**Shirou:**  TO-SAKAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  
  
  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  …That’s right.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Now that I think about it, even if it was to pay back a loan I could never afford on my own, contracting with the world just isn’t like me at all!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  If you can’t pay it back, then just don’t!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Be it the bank, or the world!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, that’s the TO-SAKA I know, even though we just met today!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Right! It’s better to take over the world and loan out Heroic Spirits for the Holy Grail War for a fee!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  I could call it a Heroic Spirit temporary employment agency. Ranging from rank E to A, depending on the client’s budget!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Your reliable partner in the Holy Grail War, TO-SAKA Heroic Sprit Service, awaits your patronage!  
  
**Shirou:**  Yeah, doing whatever you want feels TO-SAKA-like, so that’s fine!  
  
**Shirou:**  Well, I’m going home, so do your best!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Well then, first things first, let’s go beat the world senseless!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  Here we go, Shirou!  
  
**Shirou:**  Ah, I gotta go too?  
  
**Shirou:**  Okay, I thought so, so whatever.  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  As I’d expect from Shirou, even as a child that part of you hasn’t changed!  
  
**TO-SAKA:**  All right, time to start my venture! I’m going to embrace my ambition!
