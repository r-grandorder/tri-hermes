# Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - A Cat, a Bunny, and a Holy Grail War  
  
## Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - Prologue  
  
**Narration:**   
The Holy Grail War.  
  
**Narration:**   
An event in which seven Masters command seven Servants in a battle to the death. The victor gains the ultimate prize: their heart's desire.  
  
**Narration:**   
The rules and scale may vary in each instance...  
  
**Narration:**   
...but it always remains a battle for supremacy.  
  
**Narration:**   
However, there is more to winning a battle  
than simply sending out a Servant.  
  
**Narration:**   
To succeed, decisions must be made. Choices must be considered. Commitment is essential. Agony is crucial.  
  
**Narration:**   
In other words...experience is key.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
So, there you have it.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
  
# Now stand up! Bow!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Very good.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, I still have no idea what's going on here...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have so many questions, but first and foremost:Why are you dressed like that?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I-I'm just as lost as you, Senpai. One moment, we run into Scáthach in the hall, and the next, we're Rayshifting.  
  
**Mash:**   
Can you tell us what's going on, Scáthach?  
And why are you wearing that costume?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Fujimaru. Mash.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Right now, under these circumstances,  
I am not your Servant.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I am your teacher, here to guide you on this new journey.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Teacher? Journey?  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. Listen well, both of you.  
  
**Mash:**   
R-right.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...  
...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...If possible, I would like you to address me as  
“Ms. Scáthach.”  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, Ms. Scáthach!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, Ms. Scáthach!  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Much better.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
The road to humanity's restoration is long and arduous.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Humanity has been bleached away, and those of us who remain are once again fighting for our right to exist.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
And while your Servants may have plenty of experience on the field of battle, you, Master, do not. At least, not when it comes to fighting as a Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess I can't argue with that...  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed, you cannot.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
This is no fault of your own, of course. As the last Master of all humanity, you do not exactly have a wealth of contemporaries to look to for direction.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I suppose we could find a few Servants who have also served as Masters if we were to look hard enough, but&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Wait a moment, Scáthach.  
  
**Mash:**   
Isn't this why we have the simulator? So that Senpai&ndash;Master, can gain the experience [♂ he /♀️ she]  
needs for battle?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
The simulator does indeed work well for practicing individual battles, but that is as far as it goes.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
In a war with all of humanity at stake, we will also need to keep a firm eye on the larger picture.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Let me ask you this, Master. What is the worst thing that could happen in this situation?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me failing to protect humanity?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Wrong. That would only be the ultimate result of this catastrophe.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
The correct answer is your death.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Me dying?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Correct.  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Servants cannot exist without a Master, which makes your continued survival of the utmost importance.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
And since there are no other Masters left in the entire world right now, our fate is entirely in your hands.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
And since all other potential Masters in this world are on the enemy's side, our fate is entirely in your hands.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
As such, it is your duty to  
continue winning at all costs.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
However, that does not mean you must  
always win every battle no matter what.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
What good could it do to win  
the battle but lose the war?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
If you must, at times, flee the field of battle, we can make up those losses later, so long as you yet live.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Today, you will learn from both defeat and victory.  
That is the purpose of this Grail Front!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Grail Front?  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
That's right.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
That is why I have modeled this environment after my own Land of Shadows.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Needless to say, a loss in this  
war will not prove fatal.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
But, should you emerge triumphant...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
  
# I will grant you a Holy Grail!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooou!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just like that!?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
H-hold up! A Holy Grail!?  
Where in the world were you hiding that!?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Those are the kinds of things you need to disclose right awa&ndash;  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on! Did you say a Holy Grail!? You've just HAD one all this time!?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We can't just have those things floating around willy-nilly. Can you just skip the pageantry and give it to us now!?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
I'm just guessing here, but I don't see her just handing it over.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
I know that look well. It's the same one Toole always had during her “This is for your own good” lessons.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Aw man...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed, Chaldea is currently starved for resources, so I can only imagine how desperately you must want this grail.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
But, I am the one who found it,  
so it is mine to do with as I will.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Ugh. Why is every hero from the  
Age of Gods always like this?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
(Sigh)...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'd heard heroes from the Age of Gods were...a lot,  
but this is ridiculous.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
And of course,  
there is a Master on the enemy's side as well.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
While there may not be Masters to  
be found in every Singularity...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...there is most assuredly one orchestrating the battle somewhere.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Remember, there are other Masters calling themselves Crypters on the enemy's side.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
So gaining experience in determining what an enemy commander is thinking will only work to your benefit in the future.  
  
**Mash:**   
G-good point. There ARE other Masters on the enemy's side, after all!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
As for the Master you will be facing here...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Well, while I do get the impression he is somewhat...unbalanced, he should still suffice as a worthy opponent.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder who it could be...  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
W-well, you will find that out soon enough.  
  
**???:**  
Heh.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah.  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
My name is of little consequence,  
but if you must address me, you may call me...  
  
**???:**  
Mister M.  
  
**Mister M:**   
Yes, that will do nicely!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(Well, the “M” clearly doesn't stand for “Mystery”...)  
  
**Mash:**   
So Senpai's goal is to defeat Mister M's Servants then?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. But unlike the battles you have faced thus far, this will be an intense and brutal series of skirmishes.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Of course, while I have no desire to tell you to fight ceaselessly, even if it should result in your death...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
N-no, I certainly do not wish to say that...  
  
**Mash:**   
(She wants to say it really badly, doesn't she, Senpai?)  
  
**Scáthach:**   
No! I am not going to say it (Biting her lip)  
Grr, when did I get so stodgy?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
At any rate, since this is meant to provide a special combat experience, I have prepared both real battles and training battles.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
The live battles will constitute the Holy Grail War, and for the training battles...take a look!  
  
**Mash:**   
All the fighters who came here for the training battles... A ton of materials... A gift shop... Wait! Does this mean...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wooo! Roulette time!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Woohoo! Now we're talking!  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
(Obviously proud)  
  
**Scáthach:**   
That's right. No longer will anyone be able to mock me by saying my disciples only “graduate” when they die.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
In addition to my stick, I have also arranged for,  
um... What is it that goes with sticks again?  
  
**???:**  
Cannons, woof!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, that's it. For this event, I have arranged for festivities to accompany my harsh training&ndash;the cannon and the stick, so to speak.  
  
**Mash:**   
All right, Scáthach, I understand what's going on here now. However&ndash;  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Yes?  
  
**Mash:**   
Well...  
  
**Mash:**   
You still haven't answered the question  
we asked you earlier. Namely&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you dressed like that?  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...  
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! Does it have something to do with  
this Grail Front!?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
No, it does not.  
  
**Mash:**   
Did you modify your Spirit Origin  
using Primordial Runes?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
No, I did not.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
When I awoke this morning, well...  
I found myself dressed like this...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's it!? They're not even trying tojustify this kind of thing anymore!  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
W-well, never mind how I got this outfit.  
It does look good on me, does it not?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well... Yeah, I can't deny that...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
While I agree that it does look very good on you...  
  
**Mash:**   
...I can't help but think Mas&ndash;er, everyone might find it more than a little distracting!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
  
# That's the point!!!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Sure, it may not be the best thing for Master's moral upbringing, but sometimes, you've just gotta give the people what they want!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
A cat can't survive on bargain bin canned food alone. Every now and then, you've gotta crack open the top-shelf stuff.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
All of which is to say that Scáthach's brand-new bunny britches are a gift from yours truly!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I was going for something both sexy and deadly, and the bunny has long been known as the strongest of the solitary animals, though admittedly at the cost of dying alone.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Would you like me to whip you one up too, Mash? Who knows? It might help bring back some...dangerous memories.  
  
**Mash:**   
M-me!?  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh, wait. Cat scratch that. I only had enough material on me for Scáthach's.  
  
**Mash:**   
I-I see...  
  
**Mash:**   
Well, it's not as though I wanted to wear one, but...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I still don't understand.  
Why did you make me a bunny outfit?  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
You have to ask!?  
Don't try to hide it from me, Scáthach!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I know how you've been keeping your nose to the grindstone lately. I've got a nose for that kind of thing myself.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I also know that yarn about the elves and the shoemaker, and this cat's never been big on leather.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Which is why I worked my toe beans off to make you that outfit! I always had a feeling it'd look good on you, and besides, you can't take the lead on a big production like this in your usual outfit!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
So go on, enjoy it!  
Consider it your reward for all your hard work, woof!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I-I see. So this is what they mean nowadays when they talk about practicing self-care!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hang on. Something doesn't add up here.  
  
---  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
If you got a problem with my fashion sense, any and all complaints must go through our Servantverse office.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
All right then, farewell, my fellow CAGs (short for “Chaldea Animal Girls”)! See you in the finals!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh, and if you ever want to make that new outfit permanent, just give me a holler!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...  
...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Ahem!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
At any rate, you will have a great deal you  
must consider over the course of this war.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
For example, there is no guarantee that the Servants you are able to summon will be suited to every environment in which you will do battle.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
You will need to consider their affinities, their skills, their Noble Phantasms, their personalities, and more.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Will your victories be flawless, or will you only succeed by the skin of your teeth?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Will your losses be painful injuries,  
or opportunities for further growth?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
You must be prepared for everything to change in the blink of an eye. That is what it means to wage war.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Fujimaru!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
From here on out, you and your Servants must think together, fight together, and win together!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Make sure you have a full grasp of your party's capabilities before you head into battle.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Now, are you ready to get started?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Go for it!  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Good. That is just what I like to hear.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Then with that, let this Grail Front...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
  
# Begin!!!  
  
  
  
## Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - Epilogue  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Enough!!!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-oh man, I'm exhausted!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Congratulations on your victorious campaign, Senpai!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, you fought well indeed.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Now then, let us gather the other Servants together for a victory party!  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Stew's all ready for anyone who wants some!  
  
**Jason:**   
Phew, glad that's finally over with. Huh? Oh, you wanna talk performance too? Sure, knock yourselves out. Just leave me out of it.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
See? I knew we shouldn't have sent in the Archer here.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
In retrospect, the potential rewards of doing so were great, but so were the risks.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Perhaps we should have opened with a different move.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Hey now, don't rule that sort of thing out too quick.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Even if trying to overpower your opponent with brute strength doesn't succeed on its own, it has a knock-on effect of throwing them off-balance.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
And you can't underestimate knock-on effects.  
  
**Altera:**   
Indeed.  
  
**Altera:**   
There is rarely a time when Chaldea is not at a severe disadvantage in this campaign we are fighting, after all. More so when fights are drawn out.  
  
**Altera:**   
In some ways, it feels as though we are constantly laying siege to an impenetrable castle. Keeping fights as short as possible is not bad civilization at all.  
  
**Hektor:**   
You sure you don't mean “strategy” instead of “civilization”?  
  
**Altera:**   
I know what I said.  
  
**Mordred:**   
Hmm.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Oh, hey, Mordred.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Say, you're a Knight of the Round Table.  
What do you make of all this?  
  
**Mordred:**   
...Well, I like brief showdowns  
as much as the next knight...  
  
**Mordred:**   
But aren't you guys forgetting that Chaldea's got almost zilch in the way of supply lines?  
  
**Mordred:**   
So we've basically got no choice  
but to go full guerilla warfare.  
  
**Mordred:**   
Forget short-term or long-term warfare.  
If I had to sum up our strategy... Hmm...  
  
**Mordred:**   
I guess I'd call it general mid-term warfare?  
  
**Mordred:**   
So we're prolly better off assessing the situation early on, then findin' an opening in the mid-game and hammering it as hard as we can.  
  
**All:**   
...  
...  
  
**Mordred:**   
What? What is it?  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I didn't know you could be so, you know, thoughtful.  
  
**Mordred:**   
You want a piece of me, Celt!?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Now, now, no need for that.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Really, we shouldn't be surprised. Of course the Knight of Treachery would know about that sort of thing.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Honestly, I wouldn't have guessed that about you in a million years, but it does make sense when you think about it.  
  
**Mordred:**   
You guys want me to Clarent all your asses? Is that it?  
  
**Mordred:**   
...Ah, never mind. You all seem like you could take a Clarent to the face and be standing when the dust settled.  
  
**Mordred:**   
Hm? Hang on. I just had a revelation.  
  
**Mordred:**   
If you can all take a hit from my Clarent,  
why SHOULDN'T I go ahead and cut loose?  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going!  
  
**Mordred:**   
Know what? I'mma go for it!  
Come to me, red lightning!  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Would you just chill for a minute!? Damn!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's just take it easy, okay!?  
  
---  
  
**Mordred:**   
Grrr...  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Easy there, comrade.  
Deep breaths. Deeep breaths.  
  
**Mordred:**   
Tch.  
...Well? Anyone disagree with me?  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Hahaha, of course!  
For example, what if&ndash;  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Well, as you can see, even some of the greatest heroes in history can have different opinions when it comes to a long and unpredictable war.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, hmm...  
You know, this HAS been fascinating.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Oho, if it isn't Leonardo da Vinci.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I am glad to see that even an artist&ndash;no, a scientist like yourself can see the appeal of this sort of thing!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well sure I can!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Wonderful.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
There have been times when I thought our tastes were incompatible, but I am pleased to be wrong.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, I wasn't known as  
THE Renaissance man for nothing♪  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Now hurry up and get back here, Fujimaru!  
I want to hear what you and Mash thought of this, too!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Now I get it.  
This really is fascinating!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, the little Da Vinci.  
Hehe, was the excitement a bit too much for you?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahaha, maybe♪  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Wait. You're not serious, are you?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But never mind that now.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
This was certainly all very interesting.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'd love to hear what you and Mash thought  
about all this too, Fujimaru.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
What do you say we have a little confab after you get back?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You got it!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
A lot's happened since we came here,  
but at least the Grail Front is now over.  
  
**Mash:**   
Congratulations once again, Master.  
Now, what do you say we head back home!  
  
**Narration:**   
Some time later...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...Hmm.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I have an idea for a new Grail Front, but it would involve fierce competition for magical energy resources.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
As such, there is no way to know when I may be able to&ndash;  
Hm?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
What is it?  
Is there something going on?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, hello, Scáthach. Did you see this yet!?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
See what?  
...A-another Grail Front!?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There we go.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The Holy Grail War simulator is now complete!  
  
**Mash:**   
Congratulations!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Amazing work!  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I gotta say, it took a while to put together,  
but I think it'll all work nicely.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'll spare you the details, but suffice to say, it runs on recycled magical energy, so it'll still be a little while before we can try it out.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But hey, once it's all ready, we'll be able to hold events like this on a regular basis!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There. All done!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Voilà! The Holy Grail War simulator is now complete!  
  
**Mash:**   
Way to go, Da Vinci!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Hmm. I don't see how this is going to be of much use.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
I feel like I just wasted our finite and all-too-precious resources on some trivial entertainment...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That's where you're wrong, Gordy.  
This entertainment's anything but trivial.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Remember, this is a full-blown Holy Grail War simulator.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Granted, we won't be able to use it until the recycling system gives us some more resources to run it...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But once it does, it ought to provide some really valuable experiences!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Oho... Oho, oho.  
I see, I see...  
  
**Mash:**   
Scáthach!  
  
**Scáthach:**   
It was a lot of work,  
coming up with this Grail Front system.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I had to gather a great deal of magical energy resources as I went around making intricate modifications to a minute Singularity, and now...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...  
...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
(Sniff)

**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay, Ms. Scáthach! We still need you to be an advisor!  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
An...advisor?  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yeah, Mentor.  
I know the system's already been put together...  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...but the enemy Masters and Servants aren't gonna position themselves, right?  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
So we're still gonna need someone who knows the ins and outs of battle to set things up. Someone like you.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
(...That oughta do it, right?)  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I see... An advisor, huh?  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Right, of course.  
Well, in that case...  
  
**Scáthach:**   
I suppose my effort wasn't for nothing after all. And if it will help Chaldea bolster its fighting forces further, I certainly have no objections.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Besides, I have already received a fine reward in this outfit. My self-care regimen, if you will.  
  
**Scáthach:**   
It seems I am truly in Tamamo Cat's debt. I'll have to be nice to any other cats I meet from now on.  
  
**Mash:**   
I agree. Thanks to you and Cat, this first round of the Grail Front as turned out wonderfully.  
  
**Mash:**   
On that note, Senpai, it looks like we've got a special new regular event to look forward to.  
  
**Mash:**   
Let's make sure they're all as successful as this one!

You said it!
