## Opening: Arctic Servants

**Narration:**
A bleached white Earth.

**Narration:**
A bleaching of humanity.

**Narration:**
Indeed, everything on the surface has been bleached.

**Narration:**
“Oh?”

**Narration:**
“Even a place such as this was bleached?”

**Narration:**
There is no color on a blank slate Earth, and there’s no life moving on it either.

**Narration:**
It’s a horizon of pure white as far as the eye can see.
No matter where you looked in the world&mdash;no matter what place you even see&mdash;there’s not much of a difference.

**Narration:**
“I thought perhaps maybe in the far north.”

**Narration:**
“Hmm.”

**Narration:**
“It really is all white.”

**Narration:**
“The Arctic Circle... The Arctic Ocean.”

**Narration:**
The place that she was looking at&mdash;originally&mdash;should have been a sea covered in an endless amount of dense ice.

**Narration:**
It has been bleached to a blank slate; the very land itself was bleached.

**Narration:**
I see. So the bleaching of humanity is not as simple as land mass conversion.

**Narration:**
If that’s the case, does it depend on some kind of mystery—---? 

**Narration:**
“Empty as far as the eye can see.”

**Narration:**
“Excellent.”

**Narration:**
“With the way this is, then it’s doable.”

**Narration:**
“&mdash;Precisely. Hey, isn’t this a great place?”

**Narration:**
She laughs at the whitened land. 

**Narration:**
It wasn’t a smile you could call human.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
The time has come...

**Scathach-Skadi:**
In my hand is the Holy Grail, and before me is the whitened land.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Fufufu......

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Fufu, fufufufufufufufufufufufu.
If I, Skadi, can stop this, then I shall!

![](https://i.imgur.com/2G3h02k.png)

**Thrud:**
Please stop this at once, Skadi-sama!


**Thrud:**
To get away this far from Chaldea......
Why would you be doing this?!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z4kOtBZ.png)

**Hildr:**
She’s right, this isn’t like you at all, Skadi-sama!
Let’s go home and eat some ice cream!

**Ortlinde:**
That’s right...
Master will be saddened too!

![](https://i.imgur.com/baanmLA.png)

**Ortlinde:**
Even if you’re using Primordial Runes, it’ll be a burden doing this all alone, long-term.

**Ortlinde:**
Come, let’s go back.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Hmm.....

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Master, huh?

**Hildr:**
(Twitch!)

**Hildr:**
Yes, yes, Master--!
They’ll be sad to hear if you went out of line and brought out a Holy Grail!

**Thrud:**
Where did you even get one of those to begin with?! That Holy Grail!

**Thrud:**
The underground vaults are currently sealed and managed under tight security. If that’s true, then...

**Ortlinde:**
...That’s a brand new Holy Grail.
Is that the case, Skadi-sama?!

**Scathach-Skadi:**
...Fu.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Fufufufufufufufufufu.
That’s right, you could say in a way that’s how I got this Holy Grail.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
No one can stand in my way. Yes, not even if it’s Master.

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Behold&mdash;

**Scathach-Skadi:**
Fufu... What do you think?

![](https://i.imgur.com/2G3h02k.png)

**Thrud:**
# A Swimsuit Saint Graph?!

**Thrud:**
W-Wait, if you wanted to just change your Saint Graph, you could have just used your Runes...

**Hildr:**
But to use the Holy Grail for just something like that...

**Ortlinde:**
It can’t be!

**Scathach-Skadi:**
It is what you suspect. But you’ve realized it too late, Ortlinde.


**Scathach-Skadi:**
With all my love, here in the very Arctic&mdash;
I will paint a new Singularity. 

**3 Sisters:**
!!

**--ARROW--**

**Valkyrie?:**
I’ve found one of them.

**Valkyrie?:**
Hey, can you spare one second?

![](https://i.imgur.com/BvP3PU3.png)

**Erice:**
Sure?

![](https://i.imgur.com/BjZRVi3.png)

**Valkyrie??:**
You two over there, can you spare a moment?

**Jeanne Alter:**
Heh, what do the Valkyries of Scandinavia want with us-----?

**Jeanne Alter:**
H-Huh? 
Isn’t your Saint Graph a bit different than the norm?

**Jeanne:**
Well, well it’s fine! They could be Swimsuit Saint Graphs, no?!

**Jeanne Alter:**
Swimsuit Saint Graphs~?

**Valkyrie??:**
(Grin)

![](https://i.imgur.com/EB1SjNZ.png)

**Valkyrie???:**
&mdash;。

![](https://i.imgur.com/AqLkS73.png)

**Sei Shōnagon:**
Hnghh~ That’s uber cute! Valkyrie’s Swimsuit Saint Graph is too cute~!

![](https://i.imgur.com/MaC9wdG.png)

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I get it. How fascinating.
Um, wait one second.

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Is that what I think it is?
Could this be a midsummer military style?

![](https://i.imgur.com/NYSlXw0.png)

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
Well, that’s what it looks like to me.
It looks lovely and come to think of it,

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
It reminds me of the Summer Saint Graph of Osakebehime’s.
It suits you well. Um... what was your name again----?

**Sei Shōnagon:**
Huh?

**Sei Shōnagon:**
It isn't <ruby>Thrud<rt>S u r u r i n</rt></ruby> or <ruby>Hildr<rt>Hirurin</rt></ruby> or <ruby>Ortlinde<rt>Orurin</rt></ruby> ...

**Sei Shōnagon:**
Where did this girl even come from?

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
?!

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
Indeed, they’re not any of them, yet they have the same scent.
If that’s the case&mdash;what do we call you?

**Valkyrie???:**
I wonder if I should say they’re spot on.

**Valkyrie???:**
All of the Valkyrie Saint Graphs should be exactly the same, but they saw through me so accurately.

**Valkyrie???:**
Nice to meet you, Chaldean Heroic Spirits.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EB1SjNZ.png)

**Valkyrie???:**
My name is Ers,. The formal name is Gerskögul.

![](https://i.imgur.com/IZoNGRP.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/CzZ5yMs.png)

**Valkyrie?:**
The name of this particular unit is Rindr. Nice to meet you.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JUgZlkp.png)

**Valkyrie??:**
Orun. Ah, but my official name is Ölrún!
Pleased to make your acquaintance! 

**Örun:**
We’re the new three Valkyrie sisters.

**Örun:**
We are the freshly summoned Valkyries, different from our big sisters.

**Jeanne:**
I see. I understand now.
I saw that you had a good shot----Are you an Archer?

**Jeanne:**
No... judging from how your presence was concealed, are you an Assassin?

**Jeanne Alter:**
Ooh, a new Servant, huh?
Didn’t hear anything from Master about this, though?

**D：Örun:**
You’re sharp!

**D：Örun:**
You’re right, we’re not Chaldean Servants.

**D：Örun:**
We’re the Valkyrie sisters, summoned by the North Pole Queen, Scathach = Skadi!

**Jeanne Alter:**
Skadi~?

**D：Örun:**。
Oh, we’re Servants of Pan-Human History. Make no mistake about it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZXf1PR4.png)

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
So&mdash;

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
On what business is a Servant outside of Chaldea here for?
Scathach = Skadi is one of us...

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
Surely you’re not suggesting a rebellion are you?

**C：Ers:**
...

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
If you dare turn against Chaldea and Master, I’ll cleave that Saint Graph of yours on the spot&mdash;

**Sei Shōnagon:**
That’s a rather quick judgment call?!

**Sei Shōnagon:**
Hey listen, Rico-pin, they’ve got firearms.
Shouldn’t we be hearing them out first?

**Sei Shōnagon:**
If they wanted to have a brawl, they would’ve done it already long ago.

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
Fufu, I guess that’s true.
I was rather quick to judge.

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
It is that time of year, you know. Never could know what prohibited Saint Graphs would start rebelling.

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**
So as a mother&mdash;or rather&mdash;as Chairman of the Shadow Disciplinary Committee, I have to steel my mind…

**Sei Shōnagon:**
True, it’s already summer before we had even realized it...
We should get our swimsuits ready soon too---

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Um, the current matter is not really about swimsuits...


**C：Ers:**
Oh, that! Yes, that!

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
Y-Yes to what?

**C：Ers:**
Swimsuits! That’s us sisters&mdash;

![](https://i.imgur.com/CzZ5yMs.png)

**D：Rindr:**
We’re the Three Sisters, the Three Valkyrie Sisters with Swimsuit Saint Graphs!

**Erice:**
Three Valkyrie Sisters with Swimsuit Saint Graphs...?

**D：Rindr:**
Yeah, you got it. Understand?

**Erice:**
I underst...

![](https://i.imgur.com/xCGHiZx.png)

**Erice:**
......

**Erice:**
.........??

**Erice:**
Nono, I don't. I don’t get it at all! What even is a Swimsuit Saint Graph to begin with?!


**Erice:**
Sure, when it's summer...
There were Servants who had their Saint Graphs modified,

**Erice:**
But I haven’t heard the specifics, and I’ve never even got to ask Master myself...

**Erice:**
I don’t actually know&mdash;

**D：Rindr:**
Ohh, so that’s the fuss.
It’s not a problem! 

**D：Rindr:**
Not only do we need those who had experience with Swimsuit Saint Graphs, we also need new Servants too!

**D：Rindr:**
I choose you! Come, let’s go!

**Erice:**
Go where...?

**D：Rindr:**
O Primordial Rune!
Grant her a Summer Get-up, right here!

**Both:**
!

**A：Jeanne:**
We’ve changed to our Swimsuit Saint Graphs, haven’t we...?


**Jeanne Alter:**
You could’ve avoided that! The hell did you grab my arm so quickly for?

**Jeanne Alter:**
*I* could’ve avoided that!!

**A：Jeanne:**
She said Summer Getup---In other words, no danger.

**A：Jeanne:**
And on the bright side, look!

**A：Jeanne:**
We’ve changed into the two sisters in a swimsuit!
Please, don’t you think it’s a little bit nice?


**Jeanne Alter:**
Hell no I don’t!
You pretending to be a Big Sis this year too?!


**A：Jeanne:**
姉気取りではありません。
姉です。[♂ 三姉妹＋弟 /♀️ 四姉妹]です。
I’m not pretending. I **am** a Big Sis.
I have [♂ three sisters and a little brother / ♀️ I have four little sisters]!


**Jeanne Alter:**
As usual, your intelligence plummets when you don that swimsuit, you octo-saint!
