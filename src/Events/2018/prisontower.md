# Vengeful Demon's Wail at the Prison Tower

## 1st Door: The Dark Haired Demon
 
**B：???:**
&mdash;Have you ever envied someone?

 
**B：???:**
Have you ever faced someone with the talent, opportunity, and riches that you lacked, and knelt down before them in defeat?

 
**B：???:**
This world is rife with inequality, and so we shed our tears as we ruminate on the sanctity of fairness. Have you experienced that?

 
**B：???:**
Do not answer. There is no need for you to.

 
**B：???:**
Peer inside your heart. Do not turn your eyes from what you see. For that is what every heart holds. None can escape it.

 
**B：???:**
It is what leads us to covet and begrudge one another, then shed tears of regret.

 
**B：???:**
The sin of envy.

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
Um, is something the matter?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why do you ask?
 
**Mash:**
Oh, it's just... You suddenly stopped walking and broke off in mid-speech.

 
**Mash:**
You just kept standing there in silence, so I thought maybe something was worrying you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good morning, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Good morning.
I mean&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, were you doing your special move, the REM REM Trance? As in, sleeping while standing?

 
**Mash:**
I was wondering if that was the case since you suddenly stopped walking and broke off mid-speech...

 

 
**Mash:**
Your expression sort of looked vacant too.
Are you not feeling well?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I haven't noticed anything.
 
**Mash:**
Oh, okay... Just in case, let's go get you a medical check-up.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just daydreaming?
 
**Mash:**
It's possible. Let's get you checked out in case it was caused by magecraft.

 

 
**Mash:**
First, let's get you to your room, Senpai.
I'll call the Doctor over&mdash;

 
**B：???:**
Welcome to the Prison Tower on the Isle of Despair, Senpai!

 
**B：???:**
Sinner by the name of Fujimaru! This is a place beyond love and hate, thus any soul may be imprisoned here!

 
**B：???:**
You are no exception.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm in Chaldea.
 
**B：???:**
Chaldea? No. You are certainly not.
Ha, ha, ha, your beloved little friend is not here.

 
**B：???:**
And neither is that meddlesome Doctor, nor that pervert who is so pleased with his own body's modification. You are the only one here.

 
**B：???:**
...Though, of course, I am here too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Who are you?
 
**B：???:**
A Heroic Spirit who does not belong in this world.
To borrow a phrase from your adorable friend.

 
**B：???:**
A name comes to mind, does it not?
Or have you already forgotten?

 
**B：???:**
That is fine. Forget it all. Only a vengeful soul would seek to carve all things indelible upon itself.

 

 
**B：???:**
Oh, that's right&mdash; Did you find that First Tower fun? No, it's all right. Don't speak. I don't actually wish to hear your opinions.

 
**B：???:**
It was but an automatic reflex of hospitality. Like an involuntary reply to someone calling out your name.

 
**B：???:**
The Second Tower welcomes you.
Do enjoy it to its fullest extent.

 
**Unknown Spirit:**
Uu...uuuuuuuuu...
Uuuuuu...

 
**B：???:**
See, they are all coming out to greet you. It seems they don't find the warm pulse of your soul likable.

 
**B：???:**
It may not be like the First Tower, but a large number of dead souls have congregated here as well.

 
**B：???:**
They seem severely agitated, don't they?
They're resentful. And envious.

 
**B：???:**
Of you! You, who stands in this room and yet still lives!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They're going to attack me?!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...That's totally unreasonable!
 

 
**B：???:**
Haha, calm yourself, Master.
There are so many things you still need to know.

 
**B：???:**
For instance, where, exactly, are you right now?
And who am I?

 
**B：???:**
That said, most of the information that awaits you will be quite trivial, but...you can at least learn one thing of importance.

 
**B：???:**
For instance... Yes, the ugliness of you humans&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
With just one blow...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just exactly who are you!? Where am I!?
 

 
**B：???:**
This is Hell. Namely, the Château d'If, the prison tower that lies beyond love and hate.

 
**B：???:**
And I...

 
**B：???:**
...am a Heroic Spirit. A part of a tale that you should know quite well. I am one piece of the curse that has laid its shadow upon this world.

 
**B：???:**
I, born of sadness and given form through my unending resentment, rage, and hatred as an Extra Class...

 
**B：???:**
Yes&mdash; You can refer to me as Avenger.

 
**B：Avenger:**
For so long as I live&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
Survive this, and you shall learn a great deal of things, though they may be twisted. This is a place for that.

 
**B：Avenger:**
However, I am under no obligation to spend time teaching you how to obtain them.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I have no intention of becoming your very own Abbé Faria. I shall have your soul battered and tossed about until I am sated.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Abbé Faria?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...First of all, I've never even heard of an Avenger class.
 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha! I told you it was an Extra Class, didn't I?
Of course you've never heard of it.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
However, I shall teach you the absolute minimum of things you need to know, briefly that is.

 
**B：Avenger:**
First, your soul has been imprisoned.
To escape, you must pass the seven Halls of Judgment.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Your voice shall not reach Chaldea, nor shall its voice reach you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you're defeated and killed in the Halls of Judgment, you die. If you do nothing and seven days have passed, you also die.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That is all.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you doing this?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about Mash? And Chaldea?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Ha, ha! Who can say?

 
**B：Avenger:**
This Château d'If is very different than the one that existed in history.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It bears some similarity to the Singularities you have seen, but again, it's something else.

 
**B：Avenger:**
This is a hunting ground.
A type created by the King of Mages.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hunting ground for what?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Grand Caster?!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Who can say?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Now then, the first Hall of Judgment awaits. The first stage to mount in order to survive the Seven Nights.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Seven Lords are waiting for you.
Every single one of them is itching to kill you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Behold this! Savor this!
First up is the Phantom of the Opera!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Seeking a beautiful voice and detesting all things ugly,
he is a monster of Envy who has come to kill you!

 
**Phantom:**
Christine...
Christine, Christine, Christine!

 
**Phantom:**
I shall sing to you in your sleep...with all the love in my heart.

 
**Phantom:**
Ahh, but tonight, a new star stands upon the stage!
Ahh, who are you? You are not Christine!

 
**Phantom:**
Here, my soul and my voice are bound up as one!
Which is to say...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's attacking me now?!
 
**B：Avenger:**
Of course he is!
I already told you he was a monster that would kill you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could it be due to a Mental Corruption skill?
 
**B：Avenger:**
No, not at all! Hahaha! Try listening for a change!
He has dominion over this room, and is here to kill you!

 

 
**Phantom:**
Look not upon my face! Look not! Look not!
You are not Christine, so I cannot bear it!

 
**Phantom:**
Whoever you may be,
I... I...cannot let you live.

 
**Phantom:**
Oh, Christine! My love!
Oh, Christine! My masterpiece!

 
**Phantom:**
Let me dig my nails into a voice the equal of yours! Let me rip apart a throat the equal of yours and see it gush red!

 
**Phantom:**
How I want... And want... And want... I am inconsolable tonight.

 
**Phantom:**
...Oh, how I envy all people, near and far!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Take a good look, Master. This is man. This is a caricature of the human beings your world is overrun with!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Fight. Kill. You don't have time to hesitate. Because&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
It makes no difference whether you believe me or not. There'll be no reasoning with him. He will kill you!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahaha! Look! Just look! He can barely contain how badly he wants to add your throat to his collection!

 
**Phantom:**
Sing! Sing, my angel! Tonight, there's no song better than your dying scream!

 
**B：Avenger:**
What will you do? Only defend yourself?
Or will you fight?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'll defend myself.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'll fight.
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Then take my hand! We will show this black-haired masked demon a true dance of death!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Avenger:**
How fragile! How fragile! You poor thing, all you can become is naught but an ugly monster!

 
**Avenger:**
Château d'If is not the place for your soul!
You are far too pitiful to be a murderer!

 
**Phantom:**
From the end of time... I see a light...
Does it open...an emotionless hole in my heart?

 
**Phantom:**
Oh, my heart... Where are you?
Oh, my love... Where are you?

 
**Phantom:**
Christine... I offer my heart to you...
Christine... I offer my love...to you...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're singing of love, huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What a sad song...
 

 
**Avenger:**
Are you certain? Listen carefully.
That is the other song that black-haired murderer sings.

 
**Avenger:**
My vengeful strike has shattered his Spirit Core and he has little time left, but his song will last till the very end.

 
**Phantom:**
Christine... My love... I love you, but... Christine... I simply cannot endure...

 
**Phantom:**
Noble Christine... The people who live with you... Beloved Christine... Everything in your world...

 
**Phantom:**
The people who spend time with you... The world where the morning sun rises... I... I...

 
**Phantom:**
&mdash;Sometimes... I envy them... And it drives me mad&mdash;

 
**Avenger:**
Hahaha! Hahahahahaha!
Hahahahahahaha!

 
**Avenger:**
Phantom of the Opera, I have witnessed your envy.
I have killed you, and I shall carry your ugliness in my heart and move onward!

 
**Avenger:**
Be proud in hell.
For you are a true human.

 
**Phantom:**
...Please, be careful.
Fujimaru, my Christine.

 
**Phantom:**
There is only one who will protect you in this twisted Château d'If.

 
**Phantom:**
And that one may not necessarily be good.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What do you mean?
 
**Phantom:**
I'm sorry, Christine, my love.
I can say no more.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Weren't you just killed?
 
**Phantom:**
I was indeed slain in the Hall of Judgment.
But what died was my ultimate ugliness.

 
**Phantom:**
However, we never...

 

 
**Avenger:**
Hahahahahah! So this is what it's like to fight with a Master!

 
**Avenger:**
I commend you on the brilliant moves you made.
It may be a temporary contract, but you are a true Master!

 
**Avenger:**
You mastered the use of a Heroic Spirit you'd only just met! Me! An Extra Class, an Avenger, no less!

 
**Avenger:**
Now, on to the second Hall of Judgment!
Six more Lords await!

 
**Avenger:**
Roar like a tiger.
For you are allowed to do everything.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Hold it.
 
**Avenger:**
...Hmm?

 
**Avenger:**
Oh? Are you scared to go with me?
Are you uncertain you're walking the right path?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can I really get out of here?
 
**Avenger:**
...Heh.

 

 
**Avenger:**
Very well. I have but one thing to say in answer to your doubts.

 
**Avenger:**
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope.

 
## 2nd Door: The Devil of Purgatory
 
**Mash:**
The Château d'If?

 
**Mash:**
It was a prison tower that existed in France, in the Bay of Marseille. It was a fortress built in the 16th century.

 
**Mash:**
It was primarily used to hold political and ideological offenders.

 
**Mash:**
But the prison was closed at the end of the 19th century, and now it's just a historical site.

 
**Mash:**
It became world-famous after Dumas wrote his novel&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Can you hear me, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I was just in Chaldea now.
 
**B：Avenger:**
I guess you should properly recognize the reality.

 
Haha. Listen. You're still in Chaldea right now.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Of course you are, your body is still there.
Have you not noticed?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? Where's Mash?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Your pretty little friend is still in Chaldea.
And so is your body.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hah. I love the shocked look on your face!
That's right, your body is still in Chaldea!

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
What is trapped here is your soul.
I said that before, didn't I?

 
**B：Avenger:**
I know it's hard to wrap your head around the concept. The flow of time and the concept of space are different between here and there.

 
**B：Avenger:**
These seven days may only be a single day in Chaldea.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd hate if it was the other way around.
 
**B：Avenger:**
Humph. It makes no real difference.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Could it be seven years in Chaldea?
 
**B：Avenger:**
It's very possible.
Hah, your expression just changed, Master.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you want to stop the separation of your soul and body, it's simple. You must pass through the remaining six Halls of Judgment.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But we're back in that cell.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Do I have to start over?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
The concept of space is different here.
Oh, I said this already.

 
**B：Avenger:**
We always start here, but our destination will be different.

 
Let's go. The second judgment awaits you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Oh, that reminds me.
Feel free to lay on that bed there if you want.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Wait for a hand to reach out from somewhere to save you, and long for a miracle.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That's the simplest solution.
The rest will be taken care of automatically.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...What happens if I do that?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Your soul rots, and you'll never wake up in Chaldea again. That's all.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...No, I'll pass.
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Humph. Then let's go.

 
**C：Woman's Voice:**
...Someone...

 
**C：Woman's Voice:**
Someone...
Oh...Is there no one there?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Mmm&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I heard a woman's voice!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard something!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
What's that look?
You seem as if you want to help her.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Is that your sense of justice?

 
Hahaha. You don't seem very concerned for yourself!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Or do you just not understand the situation? Very well. Go help the voice, but...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Stay on your guard.
Or you'll die.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;There they are. Is that it?

 
**C：Woman:**
...Help me...

 
**C：Woman:**
I woke up here...
...alone in the darkness...

 
**C：Woman:**
Where...am I?
It's so dark... I'm so scared...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay?
 
**C：Woman:**
Thank you.
I just found myself here...

 
**C：Woman:**
This place is so dark, and so sad...
I don't know why it feels this way...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you the second Lord?
 
**C：Woman:**
What? I don't understand. I just found myself here...

 
**C：Woman:**
It's so dark and cold...
Like a scream was frozen and hanged in the air...

 
**C：Woman:**
Am I...dead?
Have I gone to hell?

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Woman. Do you have a name?

 
**C：Woman:**
I... I...
No, I don't know. I'm sorry.

 
**C：Woman:**
I don't know why I'm here, or where I am.
And oh...my name!

 
**C：Woman:**
I can't remember my name.
Um... I was looking for something important...

 
**C：Woman:**
...I think I was...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. A woman whose name and memories were stolen? Interesting. Call yourself Mercédès, then.

 
**C：Woman:**
...Mercédès...

 
**B：Avenger:**
It was the name of a woman dear to a man who was robbed of his name, and everything he had, at the Château d'If.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a good name.
 
**B：Avenger:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A man who was robbed of everything?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. You'll learn someday.
That is, if you pass through all the Halls of Judgment.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Now, Master. Fool, who would save this tainted world. What will you do with Mercédès?

 
**B：Avenger:**
I will leave it to your judgment.
Leave her here, or put her in a cell.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I-I don't want to be alone...
It feels like something bad is staring at me...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Shut up.
The choice isn't yours to make.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'd feel bad leaving her here.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'll take her with me.
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Fine.

 
**B：Avenger:**
No matter who this woman is,
it doesn't change what you must do.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
You... You would save me, even though you don't know who I am?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course.
 
**C：Mercédès:**
...Thank you.
May the blessings of God be upon you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, and hope.
 
**B：Avenger:**
Heh. Indeed. Indeed! No matter what happens, that is the only thing allowed by you humans!

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Have you ever felt lust?

 
**B：Avenger:**
That is my question for you in the second Hall of Judgment, Master.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Have you ever longed to touch the body of another human being, with a properly developed personality?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Have you ever driven reason and wisdom from your mind and given in to mad, bestial urges?

 
**Fergus:**
Of course I have!

 
**Fergus:**
Great Spin of Heaven and Earth! That's the way of the world! Of course, I do it all the time!

 
**Fergus:**
How can you be a warrior or a hero without bestial lust? If you say what I do is a sin, very well! Hahaha!

 
**Fergus:**
Then I stand here as the greatest of sinners! I am the leader of the Red Branch Knights, and former King of Ulster!

 
**Fergus:**
AND I MOSTLY LOVE WOMEN!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's spun so much he doesn't care anymore!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mostly?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Look into his heart. Do not avert your eyes.
It is something all humans have, and none can escape it.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That which seeks others, which shakes, which leads to sordid tears.

 
**B：Avenger:**
The sin of lust&mdash;

 
**Fergus:**
Who are you calling sordid!? I eat when I want to eat, and bed someone when I want to bed them!

 
**Fergus:**
That is the true way of mankind!
That is the greatest pleasure in life!

 
**Fergus:**
Hahahaha! And of course, now is one of those times!

 
**Fergus:**
You there, woman! I can tell! You're one who's worthy of respect, and difficult to bed!

 
**Fergus:**
I find you quite attractive!
Especially those protruding breasts!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
M-Me?

 
**Fergus:**
I was scared I'd have to drink and sleep alone here in this moldy prison, but my night's looking up already!

 
**Fergus:**
YOU WILL BE MINE!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
!!!

 
**Fergus:**
And you, Fujimaru, and the new Servant!

 
You're, you know. Whatever. I don't need you.

 
**Fergus:**
You're in the way. I'll kill you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Huh?
 
**Fergus:**
I said I'll kill you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're kidding, right Fergus?
 
**Fergus:**
No, I'm not. I'm a Celt.
I've decided I'm going to kill you for real.

 

 
**Fergus:**
This is a self-evident principle. The law of survival.

 
**Fergus:**
You're trying to kidnap my woman, aren't you? I can tell. Yes, I can tell. You're trying...

 
**Fergus:**
...TO STEAL MY WOMAN! AND! IT! AIN'T! HAPPENING!

 
**Fergus:**
My sword lies in both heaven and earth, and my power spins in the heavens! Great Spin of Heaven and Earth!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's gone crazy!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Mutation!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Oh, I see.
You're unaware of the Vision of Tnugdalus.

 
**B：Avenger:**
What did you think that was?
It's not Fergus, warrior of the Ulsters.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It was what was seen by the medieval knight Tnugdalus, who fell into another world and came to know fear.

 
**B：Avenger:**
In the fourth torture chamber of purgatory, created by the glory of the Almighty, lies a guard lifting up the jaw of a beast like a burning hill&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
It is the Devil of Purgatory!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
The legend of Purgatory from medieval Europe, and the suffering of the soul... For some reason, I know them...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Once the Almighty captured those pious heroes who offered their worship to a foreign god!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Of course, that's likely an interpretation brought by the passage of time, but this is the Château d'If! The prison of despair!

 
**B：Avenger:**
If it's a place that has once proven that God shall not save everyone...

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Then it's only natural the unworthy would gather here!

 
**Fergus:**
GIVE ME THAT WOMAN!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Aah!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Now what will you do, Master?
Give this woman you don't know to the lusty hero?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Or, despite not even knowing her name&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Avenger! Lend me your strength!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Very well! Let us see if the vengeful tiger's fangs can defeat the bestial demon of Purgatory!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Senpai? Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
...Um, are you sure you're not sick?
You don't look good.

 
**Mash:**
Um, do you understand me?
Do you remember what we were talking about?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Château d'If.
 
**Mash:**
I'm glad. Your consciousness is intact.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was it again?
 
**Mash:**
!!!

 
**Mash:**
I knew it. Your mind isn't fully here.

 
**Mash:**
Your eyes go out of focus as we talk and you keep mumbling&mdash;

 

 
**Mash:**
I'll call the Doctor. He didn't see anything in that brief physical yesterday...

 
**Mash:**
...but I think you need a full medical checkup.
It must be all those Rayshifts...

 
**Fergus:**
Hey, excuse me, Master.
Oh, you're here too, Miss Mash&mdash;Wait, what's going on here?

 
**Fergus:**
You don't look good. You're pale.
Actually, you're as white as a ghost!

 
**Mash:**
Fergus, good timing!
Can you help me with Senpai?

 
**Mash:**
It's probably better to take Senpai directly to the medical room than wait for the Doctor...

 
**Fergus:**
Of course. I had a feeling something might be bad.
Looks like I was right.

 
**Fergus:**
But I don't think that medical-whatsits are gonna help much. No point in worrying about it.

 
**Mash:**
No point?

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Well done. You have cleared the second Hall of Judgment.

 
**B：Avenger:**
The Devil of Purgatory was defeated, and met his end. Now we proceed to the third hall.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
U-Um...
What am I supposed to do now?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go together.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I won't leave you here.
 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Thank you... I don't even remember my name, but I'll do my best to be helpful.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Do you have the strength to spare for a woman like this?

 
Haha. I'll admit that you have a generous spirit.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That's right. It's too early for despair.
You should just keep walking forward.

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you despair and think you cannot fight anymore, tell me. I'll kill you, without waiting for the seven days to pass.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But if you wish to continue&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Wait, and hope,” right?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Hahaha! That's right, my temporary Master!

 
## 3rd Door: Monster of R'lyeh
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All vitals look fine. I'm not seeing any issues with the magical circuit either.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But this certainly isn't normal.
Fujimaru, can you hear me?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No response.
The eyes seem to be looking at us...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...but the mind isn't here, and we're not getting any response from our answers. Even if the eyes are open, that's all that is.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...

 
**Mash:**
I've been with you all the time these past three days... I should've realized something was wrong from the start.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I do see occasional magical circuit activity.
That might be our hint.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinci and I will keep doing a detailed diagnosis and analysis.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fergus seemed to know something, right?

 
But he wouldn't answer my questions.

 
**Mash:**
Me neither. He said there was nothing we could do from here...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai&mdash;
Wake up, Senpai!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
How are you feeling?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Oh, please keep lying down.
There's no need to force yourself out of bed.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
You seemed to be having a bad dream so I spoke to you. I apologize for scaring you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was dreaming.
 
**C：Mercédès:**
About your memories?
You haven't lost yours like I lost mine.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
The reason you can be so courageous...
Is probably because of your memories.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I... I could never be like you.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I saw Chaldea...
 
**C：Mercédès:**
That's where you belong, isn't it?
Chaldea...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I've never heard that name.
But it's important to you, isn't it?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
When you say the name, I can see the nobility in your eyes.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I'm so...jealous.
I'm sure you know what you must do in life.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
But I... I don't even know who I am.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
How does it feel to have a woman care for you?
It's not a bad thing, is it?

 
**B：Avenger:**
You're probably the first to turn a woman into a maid at the Château d'If, Master.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You do like to sleep, though.
You were out for an entire day.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good morning.
 
**B：Avenger:**
There is no morning or night here. It is completely isolated from the outside world, so it's meaningless.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hello, my temporary Master.
I have a question for your addled head.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait. Was I out that long?
 
**B：Avenger:**
The soul seeks rest of its own volition.
You may not always be this way, but today you are.

 
**B：Avenger:**
How does it feel to wake up, my temporary Master?
I have a question for your addled head.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Have you ever been slothful?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Have you ever known what you must do, but instead of exerting effort, given in to the temptation of rest?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Have you ever acted, not as a gear in the machine of society, but as one who seeks only their own pleasure?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Oh, there is no need to answer.
That's what you're doing right now.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...That's going too far, Avenger.
Fujimaru is too exhausted to get up...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Oh I'm sure. The connection between soul and body is becoming unstable.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You're spending less and less time with your mind in Chaldea, correct?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Do as you please. You can sleep here, or you can stand and face the third judgment.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Whatever it is, you must choose.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'll get up.
 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Fujimaru!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha, yes. That's perfect! As long as your soul continues, I shall witness its end!

 
**B：Avenger:**
I am not going to slow my pace down. If you don't wish to be left behind, try your best to keep up.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Focus on the existence of your magic circuits. You are human. You can only gain power through reason.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Weave the magical energy from your body at Chaldea like you've done so far, to fuel your spells.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Fight. Kill.
Just as you've done on your way here.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Silence.)
 
**B：Avenger:**
...Haha. Did that anger you? Forgive me.
These words and actions are the way of an Avenger!

 
**B：Avenger:**
We gather malicious intent just by existing.
You cannot escape hating us.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You hate. Kill. Grind down. And then forget. Even though it is precisely that infinite cruelty which creates avengers of darkness.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was it okay to leave Mercédès?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Let her wait in the cell.
The Hall of Judgment that awaits is yours alone.

 
**B：Avenger:**
To be precise, yes, this is your Château d'If.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Your trapped soul forces fragments of the souls you've formed relationships with to come here, across time and space.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes. You've forged a relationship with that woman.
Or perhaps you will in the future.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Don't think too much about it.
Just keep killing the enemies you see.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...I would hope you'd understand by now...

 
**B：Avenger:**
...but the third judgment will pit you against the avatar of Sloth.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
&mdash;Oh Lord!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Was it you who has brought me to this stage? Very well then! I shall perform, be it tragedy or comedy!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
But be warned. All of my performances shall be blasphemous!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Shining one, tremble before my blasphemy!
Holy one, let my mockery bring you to down to earth!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Oh! Ooh! Blessings be upon this place!
My heart is pounding like never before!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
I shall offer up to God the ultimate COOL!
Yes, perhaps the soul of a hope-filled hero!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How is that sloth?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He looks ready to go to me!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahahaha! What?
That is the greatest sloth imaginable!

 
**B：Avenger:**
He has forgotten his purity as a knight, and even what it was his Saint stood for!

 
**B：Avenger:**
He let his soul rot, and fall!
His is the lowest state of humanity!

 
**B：Avenger:**
He is a manifestation of the worst that humanity can become!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Your words honor me!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Yes! Yes! And so my comedy shall make a mockery of the Lord!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
You, dark laughing man who doubts in the Lord, to hell you shall go! Along with that holy light!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
A soul filled with hope, refusing to give up hope that they will someday return, even in an eternal prison! How wonderful!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
No, no. It's never going to happen.
No matter how much hope you have, you will end here.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Did you know?
The soul can feel pain.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
If I break the fingers of your soul, sever its limbs, slice open its belly, stir its intestines and rip out its eyes&mdash;

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
You will fall into despair immediately!
Faster than a shooting star in the night sky!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll pass.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's crazy!
 

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Noble soul who would save the world!
I shall send you to the pits of hell!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Kill! Kill! Kill!
He knows how to devour your soul!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...Hmm. That's not good, Fujimaru.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
You're not responding to even Lady Mash or the Doctor's calls? Your soul must have wondered off to some abyss indeed.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
I'm sorry. It seems a fragment of me has caused you problems...

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
What a strange state you are in.
I cannot save you.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
But don't worry. As far as I know, the light of your soul is without peer.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
You will someday return here, as long as that light does not go out.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...Of course, at my level, I have no way of knowing everything on your mind.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
But even so...

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
May the blessing of my Holy Maiden be with you.

 
## 4th Door: God Doesn't Speak
 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
&mdash;Oh, good. You're awake.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
You can hear me, right Fujimaru? I can tell.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
There's something I want to tell you.
It's a record from a long time ago, a tale of vengeance...

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
A story of emotions that never faded, even if everyone forgot about them.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
It is the story of a man.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...Good morning, Fujimaru.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I'm sorry I'm whispering.

 
You see, this morning... I'm not sure if it's morning, though...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Avenger seems rather angry about something.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
So... You should probably try to not aggravate him.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's always angry.
 
**C：Mercédès:**
Is he? He doesn't seem that way to me.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Usually he looks like he's having fun.
But today...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is he that mad?
 
**C：Mercédès:**
He usually seems to be having fun.

 
...Huh? Is that wrong?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
It's not obvious, but he does seem to be enjoying himself...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
But things are different today.
He seems very upset...

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...You're awake.

 
**B：Avenger:**
We're going to the fourth Judgment. Don't fall behind.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You're right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's gloomier than usual?
 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Yes, that's right.
Oh, and please take care today.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I'll be praying that you come back safe, and don't get hurt.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...I'll say this before we start.

 
**B：Avenger:**
What you will kill this time, in the fourth Hall of Judgment, is the avatar of Wrath.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Wrath. Anger. Fury.
I define these as the strongest feelings.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It can be a private rage that exists only within oneself, or an open rage against the entire world.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Righteous rage draws people more than anything. Sometimes they even praise the tragedies it brings.

 
**B：Avenger:**
A splendid vengeance, they call it.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It doesn't matter who you are, or where you are.
All humans love stories of revenge.

 
**B：Avenger:**
And!

 
**B：Avenger:**
That bastard refuses to admit this! She denies anger, the most pure emotion!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Even placed in the role of the fourth lord, she still speaks of salvation and forgiveness!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Unforgivable. Unforgivable!
False salvation makes me want to vomit.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you like wrath that much?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Don't ask something so stupid. Let's go.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
“That bastard”?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Indeed! That bastard! People may forgive, and God may forgive, but I will not!

 
**B：Avenger:**
You! You will fight her in the next Hall of Judgment!
You can use me in the next battle all you want.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I shall gladly aide you!
It will be an honor to rip her apart!

 

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
...You're here, then. Enemy of the righteous, who would lead the lost soul to further abyss.

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
The other me was inflicted with madness, but I am Gilles de Rais, the knight who stands with the holy banner!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
My blade of righteousness shall condemn you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Saber Gilles de Rais!?
 
**B：Avenger:**
He's slightly different than the last one.
That bastard must have dragged him here.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Right behind that knight.
Behold.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The fourth Lord...
 
**B：Avenger:**
No. The fourth Lord is standing behind him. Look.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Look! There she is! Bearer of the holy banner! She who foolishly calls herself a mediator, who speaks of God's blessing!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Servant Ruler!
I know your true name&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
Cursed Jeanne d'Arc! The woman who willingly came to the prison tower to stand in my way!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...Avenger.
Yes, your words are true.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
I have come here to stop you.
As one who was once a leader, I stand in your way.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Holy Maiden Jeanne!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's the avatar of Wrath?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
That's right! Jeanne d'Arc is the avatar of Wrath!
You should know this by now!

 
**B：Avenger:**
She believed in humanity, believed in God, and was betrayed and burned at the stake!

 
**B：Avenger:**
An eternal flame must burn within her heart.
No, that flame should be her core!

 
**B：Avenger:**
You should know sadness! You should be black flames of anger, hatred, and rage!

 
**B：Avenger:**
You! You are the one most worthy of the fourth judgment!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
No, Avenger.
I never felt wrath.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
I will not judge Fujimaru.
I lack the right, and the will.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Even if I did not manifest here properly... it matters not.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...What?

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
It is you, Avenger.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Poor, raging soul who is destined to hate the world and humanity forever.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
I will save you. Just as the holy banner still shines within the Château d'If.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

 
**B：Avenger:**
SHUT UP!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Jeanne, please stand back! My blade belongs to you and God, and now is the time to wield it!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Gilles!
No, he needs my&mdash;

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
That dark presence! That black hatred! In this prison tower, even the salvation of the Lord cannot reach his soul!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
Oh Holy Maiden, that is not the soul you think it is!
A soul gone mad must be judged by the blade!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahahahaha! That's right! I am an Avenger, from beyond the horizon of love and hatred!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Everyone says that is what I must be.
They tell me to hate, to kill, to bury all my foes!

 
**B：Avenger:**
And so that is what I shall be! I shall exact my vengeance on the world, as you wish me to!

 
**B：Avenger:**
My beloved Haydée isn't here, nor is the noble Abbé Faria. So even God cannot save my soul!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Haydée? Abbé Faria?
 
**B：Avenger:**
You too! My temporary Master, you won't save me either!

 
**B：Avenger:**
You cannot! These black flames shall never disappear!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha! Hahahaha!
Hahahahahahaha!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Say it in a way I can understand!
 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes, you're right!
I'm saying I'll kill the fourth lord for you!

 
**B：Avenger:**
I shall tear her banner of hope in two!
Her light, her holiness, they mean nothing to me!

 
**B：Avenger:**
That which is noble! That which is holy!
It's all equally worthless!

 

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...I have no choice.
I cannot stop you with words.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
I will fight.
Gilles, lend me your power!

 
**Gilles de Rais:**
As you wish! Oh Holy Maiden, may victory go with you and the banner of the Lord's light!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahahaha! Come! Come!
I always wondered what God thought of me!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Listen, Master! No matter what she says, she is a lord of the Hall of Judgment!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Thus, you must fight, and win!
If you want to survive&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Kill that Holy Maiden!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...It's the story of a man.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The man was a sailor in Marseille.
A happy man betrothed to a beautiful woman.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
But the man fell victim to a cruel trap.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He was falsely convicted...
And sentenced for the crime of treason.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
No one came to his aid.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He was denounced in secret,
betrayed by an old friend.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Even the judge became his enemy out of greed.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
And the man...was sent to a prison tower in the bay of Marseille.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Yes. The prison tower. The island of despair.
The Château d'If, from which no one returns alive.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He was trapped inside a living hell,
his days and years stolen from him.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Sometimes the man wished that he might starve to death, so great was his despair.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
And then...

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
There was someone to give him a bit of guidance.
An ancient wise man imprisoned there, Abbé Faria.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The Abbé brought him hope. He was a tiny light shining at the bottom of the darkness.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The man learned much from the Abbé,
and when the priest died he escaped.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He took the place of the Abbé's corpse in its bag, and escaped from the prison.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
By the time he made it out... fourteen years had passed.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
With the treasure of Monte Cristo, he began his revenge.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He enacted revenge upon those who had forgotten him for fourteen years. On the cruel world which had allowed his betrayal.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The man took the life of those who had sent him to that hell one by one...

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...Yes, it is a very cruel, brutal story.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
But the people loved it. They applauded him for bringing righteous wrath against evil.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He called himself the Count of Monte Cristo.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The one man to return alive from the living hell made by man and society.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The man who abandoned pity, ethics, and everything good in the human heart, and chose revenge.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He... He is the world's most well-known seeker of vengeance.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
His name is&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha! Hahahahahahaha!
A mere fragment of a soul!

 
**B：Avenger:**
...You cannot extinguish the flames of my vengeance! Behold! Your knight has fallen in battle!

 
**B：Avenger:**
And now it's your turn!
Jeanne, you false saint!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...I admit it.
This battle is yours.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
But I won't give up.
I will stop you. All of your plans&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
She's gone! Haha!
There's nowhere to run! Someday I will kill you!

 
**B：Avenger:**
This is the Château d'If!
None can ever return alive!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha! Hahaha!
HAHAHAHAHAHA!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who are you, Avenger?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Why are you asking this now?

 
**B：Avenger:**
I am the one who guides your soul.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I didn't tell you where we're going, did I? Oh, it's not to the Lord whom that Saint and her knight worship.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I will only take you to one place... A place beyond the horizon of love and hatred.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Whether you give up or not, your soul is going there.

 
**B：Avenger:**
When that happens, will you return alive? Or...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Will you be trapped forever, despair, go mad, and die?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Look forward to it.
I know. That is what I should have said.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Wait. And hope.

 
## 5th Door: Heartless Moonlight
 
**C：Mercédès:**
...I'm sorry?
You asked where Avenger went?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Um, he just left. He said something about scouting outside.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
He should be back soon.
He said there's no need to follow him.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Outside always seems the same.
 
**C：Mercédès:**
Does it?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
No, I never leave this cell...
But it's strange.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
The hallway beyond these bars never changes.
It always just goes one way.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
But at the end of it, there's always a different Lord in the Hall of Judgment, they say.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...Avenger says that the hallway, and the Hall of Judgment, change each day.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
You're getting further each day.
Deeper and deeper in.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
This cell moves deeper, along with you.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
That's what Avenger said.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Avenger's actually a nice guy.
 
**C：Mercédès:**
...You're right.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
He may be rough with his words,
but he doesn't seem to dislike you.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
In fact...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
No, never mind.
Perhaps I'm imagining it.

 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...You're fighting every day, aren't you?
With the Lords in the Hall of Judgment.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
The day you saved me, it was like something out of a myth.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
The way you fought that monster who called itself Fergus...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
It was like an ancient hero. It didn't seem real.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Avenger said that the souls gathered here were trapped by something.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Even Heroic Spirits... Powerful souls greater than humans...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I'm nothing like that.
I couldn't be a Heroic Spirit.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
But I... I'm here in Château d'If as well...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I am a trapped soul. Perhaps I was chosen as the avatar of some sin, too.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's probably the work of the King of Mages.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It might just be bad luck.
 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Thank you, Fujimaru.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I wonder if anyone can truly exist without sin.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Anger, envy... The degrees may vary, but they're both the workings of a functional mind.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
If they are sins, who but God could judge them?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Have you awakened, my temporary Master?
Then stand.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Let us go. The fifth Lord awaits you.

 
**Caligula:**
...Lost one.

 
**Caligula:**
To be lost and uncertain is man's destiny.

 
**Caligula:**
But perhaps it's not quite right for me to speak of what life should be.

 
**Caligula:**
Hmmph. I see surprise in your eyes. My madness is a gift of the lunar goddess, and sometimes it is lost.

 
**Caligula:**
It doesn't happen normally, but this is the pit of hell. Even the goddess' eyes cannot see you here.

 
**Caligula:**
...But without madness, I cannot touch my beloved child. It is upsetting.

 
**Caligula:**
I manifest as a Berserker class.
I am not allowed to speak without madness.

 
**Caligula:**
Only here, as your body and soul separate ever further, can I speak to you.

 
**Caligula:**
Oh, Nero&mdash; Beloved child, the living image of my sister Agrippina.

 
**Caligula:**
Please, please... Enjoy some happiness, no matter how small.

 
**Caligula:**
I shall take with me madness and rage.
May the path you tread be filled with roses of blessing.

 
**Caligula:**
...I'm sorry. I should be speaking to you, but instead my lips speak of my beloved niece.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Nero's great, huh?)
 
**Caligula:**
...I can see your thoughts in your eyes.
Yes. Yes, you're very right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I understand.)
 
**Caligula:**
Yes. ...Yes.

 

 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyau, kyaaau!

 
**Caligula:**
Oh, beautiful beast! Will you guide me?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou.

 
**Caligula:**
Yes, there is little time.
I must speak to you, Fujimaru.

 
**Caligula:**
&mdash;Have you ever tried to devour everything?

 
**Caligula:**
Have you ever eaten and eaten and been unfulfilled, as if you were a starving man?

 
**Caligula:**
Have you consumed and consumed, making yourself a slave to the hunger of the soul?

 
**Caligula:**
I have.

 
Or was that all I was?

 
**Caligula:**
I ate. I consumed. I filled my unloved body with my desires.

 
**Caligula:**
The sin of Gluttony.
The malignant tumor of Rome.

 
**Caligula:**
...My life may have been evil.
Indeed, I'm sure that's what later generations said.

 
**Caligula:**
The moon goddess may have toyed with me, or perhaps I was born evil.

 
**Caligula:**
But my soul was carved into history as a Heroic Spirit, not an Anti-Hero. And that...

 
**Caligula:**
I must believe that somewhere in my heart, some tiny bit of love was left.

 
**Caligula:**
And thus&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
I'll tell you who this Lord really is...
He is the avatar of Gluttony.

 
**B：Avenger:**
An avatar of evil, who devours all the pleasures of the world and still seeks more.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Thus, he should be a very simple opponent.
No need for complexities like last time.

 
**B：Avenger:**
There's no need to think at all.
You will win, if you stay true to yourself.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Kill. All you have to do is kill.

 
**D：???:**
...Gggggaaahhaaaaaaahhh...

 
**D：???:**
Wooaaahh...
Ooooh...

 
**Caligula:**
ROOOAAARRRH!

 
**Caligula:**
I will... kill... kill!
Oh... Oh goddess... Forgive my deeds!

 
**Caligula:**
My deeds are... fate!
I will...

 
**Caligula:**
DEVOUR EVERYTHING!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Caligula!
 
**Caligula:**
...OOHHHHHH...

 
**Caligula:**
Where is Nero...
Oh, please... Please, just let her...

 
**Caligula:**
ROOAAARHH!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I just met you...
 
**Caligula:**
???

 
**Caligula:**
What are you? Would you stop me? I am... Emperor...

 
**Caligula:**
I will eat! I can't even taste it anymore! But I will eat!
I don't even know why anymore, but...

 
**Caligula:**
The goddess Diana has allowed it all!

 
My deeds...are...

 
**Caligula:**
...I will simply...obey... fate!

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahaha! It seems he has failed to calm himself!
He will not stop until he devours your soul!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Feel free to keep talking to him.
If you want to die here, go right ahead.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You can stop going forward whenever you like. You can always give up.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But your soul...doesn't seem to want to give up!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Look, here he comes!
If you don't want to die, then move!

 
**Caligula:**
ROOAAARRRHHHH!

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you want to survive...
Kill! All that stands in your way is your enemy!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caligula:**
&mdash;And thus...

 
**Caligula:**
Because I believe in that tiny remnant of love. Because I should be an Anti-Hero, but am a Heroic Spirit...

 
**Caligula:**
I put some tiny bit of feeling into my mad screams.

 
**Caligula:**
It's so small...
But this is how I resist my cursed fate.

 
**Caligula:**
...Fujimaru.
Even I can do this.

 
**Caligula:**
So one who knows love cannot fall.

 
**Caligula:**
I believe in you, child who keeps going forward.

 
## 6th Door: Vengeance is Mine...
 
**B：Avenger:**
The sixth judgment. The sixth Lord&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
You will see for yourself that human desire has no limits.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I've never seen a man more greedy than he.
It is astonishing.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Even the man who tried to offer his own daughter for wealth, money, and riches comes nowhere near him.

 
**B：Avenger:**
His greed is for the world itself.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You sound like you're having fun.
 
**B：Avenger:**
...Fun, you say?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. That's how I look to you?
Then I must have very wicked tastes.

 
**B：Avenger:**
First there was sorrow and tears. Then pain and suffering. Then he arrived to a great wish that could be called greed.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It was never achieved, but his vengeance was the purest and noblest in the world.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You would say I find that&mdash;fun.

 
But I do not deny it. I have given up all that is good in me.

 
**B：Avenger:**
What is left must be like a demon.
One who mocks the noble wishes of man.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha. Hahaha. Fascinating!
Indeed, you may be right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you like him(?)?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. Yes. I've never thought about it, but perhaps I do.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He sought an answer. If there was no true righteous man in the world, he said...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Or perhaps you could say he believed in nobility, and in human good, and thus denied a world where evil reigned?

 
**B：Avenger:**
We will never know. Though, perhaps someone like you could understand him.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes, he is the man who tried to do good for the entire world.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He's very like you.
He tried to save the world.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Either way&mdash;
I have a certain respect for him.

 
**B：Avenger:**
His boldness. His nobility. His greed!
They are worthy of acclaim!

 
**B：Avenger:**
And thus...and thus...
With the greatest respect...

 
**B：Avenger:**
My black flames shall destroy them all. My flames burn brightest against righteousness and noble wishes.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Be prepared, Master. You...

 
**B：Avenger:**
You must crush this Greed that would devour the world. Kill, or be killed.

 
**B：Avenger:**
To put it simply, yes&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
He is a tough foe. Let your guard down, and you will die.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...You're here then, Avenger.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Last time I was defeated, but this time I've made my decision. I will defeat you, and stop you.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
I believe now that this is the way to guide you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
No, no, no!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes, I won't let you escape. I'll kill you someday.
But not now! You're interrupting me, Holy Maiden!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Your timing is almost as bad as Caderousse!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you so mad at her?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You don't like Jeanne?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
It's because of who I am!

 
**B：Avenger:**
If she refuses to admit the existence of wrath, it's the same as denying my existence!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Keep raging, Avenger.
Rage is, as you say&mdash;

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Not easily dispersed. I can understand that.
I've seen it many times.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Your anger will burn brightly, like straw set to flame.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Until it burns the one who rages, and much of what surrounds him, to cinders.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
But...even if there is rage in your heart...
You can still wish for forgiveness and salvation.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Shut up! You would speak to me of forgiveness and salvation?

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Yes, because&mdash;
You have experienced it once for yourself, right?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha...hah...! Hahahahahaha!
BWAHAHAHAHA!

 
**B：Avenger:**
“That” is not me!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Do not speak of my vengeance, woman!

 
**B：Avenger:**
My black flames seek not salvation!
My rage brings no forgiveness!

 
**B：Avenger:**
“Tyger, tyger, burning bright. For if you travel to the horizon beyond love and hatred.”

 
**B：Avenger:**
I am the Count of Monte Cristo! An eternal avenger!
A wicked shadow carved into mankind's history!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
He truly is the Avenger of Château d'If.
The man who returned to Paris and had his revenge...

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
His true name is Edmond Dantès.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
In his bloody revenge, he also called himself...
The Count of Monte Cristo&mdash;

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
It must be the same name as the hope given to him by the Abbé, the treasure of Monte Cristo.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
But...
His deeds brought only despair.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Even beyond the horizon of love and hatred, his rage continued to burn bright.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
The Count of Monte Cristo.
It is the name of a devil born only to seek revenge.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I understand now, Holy Maiden.
You and I can never get along!

 
**B：Avenger:**
So I'll kill you here! I shall show you the true form of my resentment and grudge!

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
!!!

 
**D：???:**
Some feelings cannot be shared by mere words.
Holy Maiden, you should know this well.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...I know. I know.
But I just can't give up.

 
**D：???:**
&mdash;And that is why God still loves you, I'm sure.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;I've been waiting for you, other Ruler!
Avatar of Greed!

 
**B：Avenger:**
I see. What a wonderful idea!
Meet an exception with an exception!

 
**B：Avenger:**
One Avenger and two Rulers.
Interesting. Truly interesting.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Servant Ruler!
Amakusa Shirou Tokisada!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
&mdash;Hello, Avenger.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
In a different place, we might have had a very different meeting.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
You call yourself the Christ of Vengeance.
Words and prayers will not reach you, I'm sure.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But I believe in you.
More than you could know.

 
**B：Avenger:**
???

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
If you know what a living hell is, then you should know what is truly valuable.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
You did not join in the King of Mages' plan. Therefore...

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Shut up.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He has no hatred in him. I've no interest in a being that exists outside of love and hatred.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Don't get the wrong idea about me, Amakusa Shirou.
I've never helped save the world.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...That's true.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Oh well. I don't like fights, but I guess this is how I shall guide you.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Jeanne d'Arc. I'll ask for your help. As a fellow Ruler, not as one placed in the Château d'If.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
&mdash;Of course, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Thank you.

 
...Do you feel a little conflicted about this?

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
We can forget the past for now.
I want to save him. As do you.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
So we must fight together, and there is no better ally I could ask for than you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're fighting two Rulers?
 
**B：Avenger:**
They have two, and we have one, huh?
it does seem we're at a disadvantage, then.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But that's wrong, Master!
I have you, and your Servants!

 
**B：Avenger:**
This is the Château d'If! God's light does not reach here, and he will not play favorites!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It's like we're the bad guys!
 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahahahahaha! That's a funny joke.
Nothing could be more ironic, Master!

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
I once learned that God does not save us!
So now I will kill you, the avatars of His salvation!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I don't know about that&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
Let's go, Master.
You and I are as one, now.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Here in the Château d'If, where there is no salvation, if one continues to hope, and truly wants to go home...

 
**B：Avenger:**
They must be guided!

 
**B：Avenger:**
And I shall be the one to guide you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I'm going back to Chaldea!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know that already!
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahahahahaha!
Yes! Yes! You roar like a tiger too!

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Kill! Steal! Take back all that is yours!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...Avenger.
We wish to save you.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Both Jeanne d'Arc and I fought for the same reason. ...Am I right, Holy Maiden?

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Yes... But once again I wasn't strong enough&mdash;

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Vengeance is not man's to perform.
One does not need to refer to scripture to know this.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
This is neither a prediction nor a prophecy,
but a statement from me to you, Avenger.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Those black flames will someday destroy you as well.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Are those your last words, Rulers?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Even God himself cannot change my state as an eternal Avenger. Do you speak, knowing that?

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...Nothing is eternal.
Evil, in particular.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Weak. Weak. What weakness!
I cannot even bring myself to laugh!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Know that weakness is what trapped you here as avatars of Wrath and Greed!

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you had manifested in your true forms, you would not have been so easily...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
No, I won't say it. We'll meet again in another hell.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You who do not lose your nobility, even here.
I mock your God, but I do not mock you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You, Holy Maiden who forgives all without Wrath. And you, Saint of Greed, who stands against an evil world.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Farewell.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...I pray your soul...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...finds rest, somewhere far from here.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...I've kept you waiting, my temporary Master.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Only one Hall of Judgment remains.
Perhaps you shall return alive after all.

 
**B：Avenger:**
If you never give up, and you keep killing and pressing on, that is.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Were we really supposed to defeat them?
 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Who can say?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Their interest was in me. If they'd gotten what they wanted, what would've happened to you?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Perhaps you would've been saved.
Perhaps you would have been trapped here forever.

 
**B：Avenger:**
There's no way to tell now, though!
Whichever it was, you can do nothing but believe me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Silence)
 
**B：Avenger:**
...Hmm. I like the look on your face.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
We're going back to your cell.
This time, even I'm feeling tired&mdash;

 
## 7th Door: The Count of Monte Cristo
 
**F：???:**
...The man was saved, in the end.

 
**F：???:**
When he finally achieved his bloody revenge, he abandoned all the evil he'd built up.

 
**F：???:**
He regained once more the nobility he thought he'd lost.

 
**F：???:**
His emotions. His love&mdash; His human goodness.

 
**F：???:**
The man's name... His name, after he threw away the name of Count of Monte Cristo...

 
**F：???:**
He became Edmond Dantès. The man who regained love, even after becoming a terrible avenger.

 
**F：???:**
As he threw aside his revenge and set out on a journey, they say you could see a foreign princess at his side.

 
**F：???:**
But...
But now he is...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...

 
**Fou:**
Kyuu, fou...

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Fou. It's fine.
I'm sure Senpai will wake up tomorrow.

 
**Mash:**
We can't let ourselves get down.
We must stay strong.

 
**Mash:**
When Senpai wakes up, we can't be seen feeling sad.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyuu!
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I think so. We need to be ready for Senpai to come back at any time&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Where is the woman?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. Don't look so confused.
The woman. The one I called Mercédès.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Where'd she go while I was gone?
There's no place to go in the Château d'If.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? She disappeared...
 
**B：Avenger:**
You've no idea then, I guess.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Hall of Judgment, maybe?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes, that's the only part of this hell that you know.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But the prison tower you've seen is only a small part of the whole that is the Château d'If.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You have all you need, but there are many other wonderful rooms inside it.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Well, it doesn't matter.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Let's go. Get ready. The last Hall of Judgment has been prepared.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Kill the seventh Lord. Do not hesitate. Do not be uncertain. There is only one path, anyways.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You are very lucky.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Not only that I'm personally at your side, but that you know naught of most of the hells within this place.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Something must love you very much.
A rain of tortures do not assault your senses.

 
**B：Avenger:**
The screams of the imprisoned and dying do not assault your sense of hearing.

 
**B：Avenger:**
The endless stench of death does not assault your sense of smell.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's a good thing.
 
**B：Avenger:**
Hah! You're right about that!
You're right about that indeed.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How do you know so much about this place?
 
**B：Avenger:**
Because of what I am. This is different in several ways from the real Château d'If...

 
**B：Avenger:**
...and in many ways its closer to what I am.
Neverending grudge has altered its very essence.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Well, whatever the reason...

 
**B：Avenger:**
...the only thing that assails you is the Halls of Judgment. Not that I envy you&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
But you walk a very different path than I do.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Hmmph.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No one's here?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't you say it was prepared?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Let me tell you an old story.
It'll help pass the time.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...I'd love a smoke, but I suppose I'll do without.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It's a simple old story. But some say it's the greatest tale of revenge the world has ever known.

 
**B：Avenger:**
There once was a fool who lived by the sea.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He was an honest man.
He didn't know that the world was full of evil.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That was how the man fell into a trap.
He was falsely convicted and sent to the Château d'If...

 
**B：Avenger:**
He spent fourteen years in that hell,
and when he escaped alive&mdash;he became an avenger.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He threw aside all that was good in man,
and attained the cunning and power of a devil.

 
**B：Avenger:**
In his wrath, the man put all he had into his revenge.

 
**B：Avenger:**
One by one he terrified and slew all those who had sent him to that hell.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Heh...
Oh, I can still remember their faces!

 
**B：Avenger:**
The shock when I told them my name! The despair when the evil deeds they'd forgotten came back to haunt them!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha&mdash;Hahahahahahaha!
That was true vengeance! Righteous revenge!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was that man you, Avenger?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hmmph. Don't be in such a hurry.
Let your elders finish their stories.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But that's most of what I have to say.
The man achieved his revenge, but let the last one go.

 
**B：Avenger:**
...Some say he abandoned his wickedness.
They say at the very end, he regained his goodness.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;That he gained love.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Why are you so mad?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...The man did indeed stop seeking revenge.
He probably did regain the love he lost.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He disappeared, along with the captive princess who had loved him.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A happy ending.
 
**B：Avenger:**
Yes, it was.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I've heard that story somewhere...
 
**B：Avenger:**
...I'm sure you have. A wicked author wrote it all down, and it became known throughout the world.

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
The man's life became a story.
Or perhaps the story was his life.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Whichever way it was&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
The story received unparalleled acclaim, and countless emotions turned it into a myth of revenge.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Once the man cried out for the god of vengeance, but sadly, in the end, became that god himself.

 
**B：Avenger:**
The man's place was carved into history, in the vengeful form that existed in man's imagination.

 
**B：Avenger:**
His soul became a Heroic Spirit, and when the King of Mages tried to incinerate time itself&mdash;

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...It became a very unique Servant.
An Extra Class.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
&mdash;And that's you, isn't it Avenger?

 
**B：Avenger:**
...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
In the end, I...
I never did remember who I was.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
But I know you.
I don't know why, but I know you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mercédès?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you the seventh
 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Hello, Fujimaru.
No, not you.  The one in black, I...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Move!
I prefer not to kill women.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're kidding me!
 
**B：Avenger:**
...Hmmph.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You went all out with Jeanne.
 
**B：Avenger:**
That was a Ruler. A human fortress.
In body and soul, she's far too sturdy to be a woman.

 

 
**C：Mercédès:**
This tower is a wicked thing, and so are you, Avenger.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
You...cannot be allowed to exist in this world.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Oh, interesting.
Another woman uttering those same words, eh?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Mercédès. No, no, woman who has lost herself and wanders. Would you deny me? Here in the Château d'If?

 
**B：Avenger:**
You are no weak woman. You are strong.
Your strong soul rivals even that Holy Maiden.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Show me what you really are!
If I must not be allowed to exist...

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;Then reveal yourself!
Use your full power to kill me!

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I still don't know...
Why, why am I here?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...But there are those who will lend me strength.

 
**Wraith:**
...We will lend you strength...woman...

 
**Wraith:**
...We are wraiths who could not become Heroic Spirits...

 
**Wraith:**
...But we have never forgotten you for a moment...

 
**B：Avenger:**
A convergence of the curses within the Château d'If?
No. There's no hatred. No rage.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Are those fragments of the souls that admire you? Hahaha! Splendid! Even the dead love you, woman!

 
**B：Avenger:**
You must have walked quite the path in life.
Perhaps you are a famous Heroic Spirit.

 
**B：Avenger:**
&mdash;But a wraith without hatred is just a whisper on the wind.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
!!!

 
**Wraith:**
Moooaann!
Avenger! Pitiful...me!

 
**Wraith:**
This woman is our light, our one salvation.
You must not reject&mdash;even her!

 
**Wraith:**
No salvation... No salvation!
At least, then, die! Like a moth burning at the flame!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**C：Mercédès:**
...Oh, don't force yourself to move.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Stay where you are.
Though I doubt you could move at all.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Don't let it bother you.
I've simply done what I felt I must.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Did the wraiths help me for the reason he said...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Because of who I was in life?

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I am supposed to be the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment. One of the obstacles set to slay you.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
For some reason I lost that role, as well as my memories.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I still can't remember.
But...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I pray that the light shines down upon your path.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
Much of what he says is lies, but one thing he said remains in my heart.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
...What sad words, but what a strong wish that lives within them...

 
**Avenger:**
Hahahaha!
Die! Die! Leave nothing behind!

 
**Avenger:**
Without hatred, you are weak!
True, you had an advantage over me&mdash;

 
**Avenger:**
But your blade could not touch me, woman.
It was far too kind.

 
**C：Mercédès:**
So it...seems...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I'm not the real Mercédès, but...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
I pray that the light shines upon your path.
Avenger... No...

 
**C：Mercédès:**
&mdash;Edmond Dantès.

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's gone...
 
**Avenger:**
...Heh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was she a Heroic Spirit too?
 
**Avenger:**
...Who cares!?

 

 
**Avenger:**
Haha. Hahahahaha!
How hilarious! Those were her last words?

 
**Avenger:**
Me, Edmond?

 
**Avenger:**
No! No! First the Holy Maiden, then her! I am not him!
I am not Edmond Dantès&mdash;

 
**Avenger:**
That's the name of a miserable, innocent prisoner. The name of a man who was saved...

 
**Avenger:**
...by a miraculous love&mdash;

 
**Avenger:**
That is not me.
I am an Avenger! An eternal being of vengeance!

 
**Avenger:**
The name of a human who lived and died as a man!
How could it be worthy of me?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that your True Name?
 

 
**Avenger:**
...We're done talking.

 
**Avenger:**
The Château d'If's role will end soon.
The seven judgments have been destroyed.

 
**Avenger:**
All that's left is to go outside, into the sunlight. But...

 
**Avenger:**
No human has escaped the Château d'If.
With one exception.

 
**Avenger:**
It is the same even now that a million hatreds have reformed this place. Only one may leave.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But there are two people here.
 
**Avenger:**
Yes. Yes, there are&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I figured this was coming.
 
**Avenger:**
Very perceptive.
No, I suppose it's to be expected.

 

 
**Avenger:**
The one who remains shall become the new Abbé Faria.

 
**Avenger:**
They will end their life as one who shatters despair and guides towards hope. It's a meaningful way to end one's life.

 
**Avenger:**
You, or me.
One of us will survive and one of us will die.

 
**Avenger:**
&mdash;Come, my temporary Master. Prepare yourself.

 
**Avenger:**
Of course, I have no intention of dying.
I was lucky enough to come back to this world.

 
**Avenger:**
I will do as I please. I'll make you a second Abbé Faria, and live.

 
**Avenger:**
Your story will end. It's that simple.

 
**Avenger:**
Let us end this. In the last act of the play, your soul shall truly die.

 
**Avenger:**
But if...

 
**Avenger:**
If you say you will continue!
If you have not yet lost hope!

 
**Avenger:**
&mdash;Then slay me!

 
**Avenger:**
To me belongeth Vengeance! I am the avatar of Pride, the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment!

 
**Avenger:**
Fight me, and save the world&mdash;
Hold nothing back!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**B：Avenger:**
...Heh, heh.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Amazing. I see. You've learned how I fight...
Your time as my temporary Master was well-spent.

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahaha! This feels good!
Indeed! I wanted to taste this once!

 
**B：Avenger:**
To be like the one person who gave me guidance...
The noble Abbé Faria!

 
**B：Avenger:**
I... I can be a tiny light of hope...

 
**B：Avenger:**
To an innocent person&mdash;
who fell into a terrible trap&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Edmond Dantès...
 
**B：Avenger:**
...So you would call me that...too?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Avenger!
 
**B：Avenger:**
Haha! That's right!
You understand me, Master!

 

 
**B：Avenger:**
I shall admit it! You have done me a favor by killing me! You have guided me to victory&mdash;

 
**B：Avenger:**
You don't understand?
...Yes, I'm sure.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I knew naught of victory.
Even as I found my place in history as an Avenger...

 
**B：Avenger:**
Because Edmond was saved at the end...

 
**B：Avenger:**
I, the one who failed to taste victory and achieve his revenge, continued to exist.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But...you, Fujimaru. I guided you to victory, and you overcame the obstacles and escaped the prison tower.

 
**B：Avenger:**
What an ending...
...filled with hope.

 
**B：Avenger:**
I was without victory, and you allowed me to guide you, and earn that victory.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You're so generous&mdash;Haha, Fujimaru!

 
**B：Avenger:**
“We” have won! Not even the King of Mages is all-powerful!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So this was Solomon's...
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
Fool. You may speak of the King of Mages, but do not use his True Name carelessly.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That name has become a curse. Just saying it aloud is enough to place that curse on you.

 
**B：Avenger:**
That is how you came to be in this hell.

 
**B：Avenger:**
You stared into his eyes in London, did you not?
That was enough for him.

 
**B：Avenger:**
It's called the Evil Eye.
You were given a fatal poison then.

 
**B：Avenger:**
He didn't let you go.
He decided that you were already finished.

 
**B：Avenger:**
But&mdash;Haha! Hahaha!
This was the result! Too bad, King of Mages!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Your single whim, your single cunning trap has met its end here!

 
**B：Avenger:**
That's what you get for choosing me, you fool!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Walk forth! Keep struggling! You have been released...from this prison of the soul!

 
**B：Avenger:**
Someday you shall save the world!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Will you disappear forever?
 

 
**B：Avenger:**
...You would wish to meet me, an Avenger, once more?

 
**B：Avenger:**
Hahaha! HAHAHAHA!
Then there is but one thing I can say!

 
**B：Avenger:**
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope!

 
**A：???:**
...Senpai!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou, kyauu!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!
It looks like Senpai's awake!

 
**Mash:**
If I'm not dreaming, this means...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. Looks like a full recovery.
Really, it's amazing...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning, Fujimaru You were asleep a long time. Do you have a headache?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, kyau!
Kyuu!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai. Good morning.
...I'm glad you're back.

 
**Mash:**
I'm so glad&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm home, Mash.
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes&mdash; Welcome back, Senpai.
