# All the Statesman!
 
## Section 1: A Giant and a Forest

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ungh...
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where...am...I...?
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who am I...what is space...what is the Root...?
 

 
**Mash:**
...Sen...Sen...pa...

 
**Mash:**
...pai! Senpai! This is an emergency!
Please open your eyes!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So if 1+1=2...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why was Fou just running...?
 

 
**Fou:**
Fou? Fooou?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please calm down.
It's just an illusion! Just your imagination!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Oh I'm so glad!
Yes, it's me, Mash Kyrielight!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fou...is now a ★4?
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!
Fofou, nkyu?

 
**Mash:**
...You must be confused.
It's me, Mash Kyrielight!

 

 
**Edison:**
♪ Nants ingonyama, bagithi Baba!!!
I am Thomas Alva Edison!

 
**Edison:**
Ah, my apologies. That may have been a bit much.
Allow me to explain our situation.

 
**Edison:**
A mere twenty-seven minutes ago, we observed a slight space-time fluctuation over Chaldeas.

 
**Edison:**
It was a very small anomaly, but showed no signs of natural decay, and so you Rayshifted to accompany us on a mission to investigate...

 
**Edison:**
Sadly, we've lost communication with Chaldea. Currently, we're working to repair the Spiritual World Communicator and restore communications.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you haven't given up on the Communicator.
 

 
**Edison:**
Of course not. With Miss Blavatsky's help, the Spiritual World Communicator has been strengthened!

 
**Edison:**
With the power of science, we shall debunk all the world's many misconceptions! And if the spiritual world proves to be real, we can expand our consumer base!

 
**Mash:**
We'll listen to Edison's ramblings later.
Master, can you get up?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, I think so.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks, Mash.
 

 
**Edison:**
Ah, good! You had no trouble getting up! I would expect no less from a seasoned Master like you! Ever reliable once you are properly alert!

 
**Edison:**
Now we need only gather information.
Geronimo is currently out scouting.

 
**Geronimo:**
I'm back, king of inventors. Based on the vegetation and the stars, we're definitely in North America.

 
**Geronimo:**
However, I did not see any airplanes or satellites.

 
**Edison:**
Hm, so it is safe to assume we are in America prior to the 19th century. Or at least a world very similar.

 
**Edison:**
Still, we're not at all clear on our situation.
We had to Rayshift quite suddenly.

 
**Edison:**
There is a possibility that we are in a distant future where humanity becomes extinct, but let's not think so pessimistically.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Edison:**
Let's just work on not getting worked up over nothing.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Geronimo:**
Looks like the animals are getting along nicely.
Now, about our precise location&mdash;

 
**Monster:**
Grrrrrr...!!!

 
**Edison:**
Oh-ho. Has a primitive being made its appearance...?
No, could that be&mdash;

 
**Edison:**
(It looks...human...?)
Geronimo, what in the world is that!?

 
**Geronimo:**
A humanoid monster... A wendigo!?

 
**Geronimo:**
A man-eating spirit of legend passed down by the Algonquin people. There's no returning one possessed by a wendigo to their normal human form!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know what the heck's going on, but...!
 

 
**Mash:**
Roger that, Master!
Mash Kyrielight, moving to the defense!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Wendigo:**
Guoooooo!!!

 
**Wendigo:**
Uryyyyyy!!!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Are you all right!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine. Actually, I like the pain!
 
**Mash:**
I'm glad...!

 
**Mash:**
...Uh, um...
What was that bit at the end?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whoa. Sooo red!
 
**Mash:**
M-Master...!? That look you're giving your wound...it's not...hungry is it!?

 
**Mash:**
U-um, no! Don't! Don't try to eat it!
It will taste bad! It's bad! No good!

 
**Mash:**
We need to end this event while we can still keep our characterization consistent!

 
**Geronimo:**
(...Mash is losing her cool too... Hm...I hope this is not some type of Mental Corruption...)

 

 
**Edison:**
I must admit, we are quite thoroughly surrounded. Troubling...

 
**Edison:**
This campsite may be protected by the Territory Creation Geronimo and I have, but...

 
**Geronimo:**
Right. I'm not certain we can take an attack like this.
If necessary, I can go out and attack them.

 
**Edison:**
No, hold on. I have every confidence in your skill in battle, but I am not sure how well Mash and I can defend Master alone... Hm?

 
**Mash:**
What is this rumbling...?

 
**Geronimo:**
Something truly gargantuan is coming this way...!
Is it a Phantasmal? No... It's...!

 
**Mash:**
Th-that is...!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
An attacking...titan!?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
Impossible...! A Spirit... A Divine Spirit...
No, it can't be...!

 
**E：???:**
Are you okay?
I'll help you!

 
**Wendigo:**
Gyaaaaaaaaa!!!

 
**Mash:**
A-amazing...! The wendigos are going down like it's some massive game of whack-a-mole!

 
**E：???:**
Okay! Keep this up!
Let's go!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**C：???:**
Are you okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ye...yeah, barely.
 
**Mash:**
You really helped us out...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sooo biiiiiig! No need for explanation!
 
**Mash:**
No, Master! This definitely needs explanation!
This person is obviously not normal!

 

 
**Geronimo:**
...At least I don't sense any hostility from her.

 
**Geronimo:**
Giant one, what Spirit has guided you to us?
I am a warrior of the Apache from the south.

 
**Geronimo:**
I have many names, but those closest to me call me Geronimo.

 
**Geronimo:**
I would ask you for your name. Without it, I cannot show my gratitude or tell my ancestors of you.

 
**C：???:**
...Bunyan.

 
**Mash:**
Eh?

 
**Bunyan:**
Paul Bunyan. That's my name.
I come from far away, and I go far away.

 
**Bunyan:**
Bonjour and nice to meet you, unknown Mage.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
She really...is huge...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bigger is ALWAYS better!
 

 
**Mash:**
That's not the point, Master. Talking is one thing, but one wrong step, and you will get pancaked!

 
**Edison:**
It's like we're conversing with a small mountain. Geronimo may be used to it, but this is inconvenient.

 
**Bunyan:**
Huh? Where did everyone go?

 
**Mash:**
Oh? Could it be...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doesn't seem like she can hear us.
 

 
**Edison:**
Hm. It is likely very much like our inability to hear the footsteps of the ants around us.

 
**Geronimo:**
Ah! Master, step aside!
The giant Spirit is starting to walk!

 
**Bunyan:**
Alone...again...
I'm so lonely...

 
**Mash:**
And she's gone...
Should we follow her?

 
**Geronimo:**
No, even if we follow her, she will not hear us.
Let us follow the Spirits' guidance to our destiny.

 
**Edison:**
Hm. What a rational way of thinking. Then let's set forth! So long as we keep moving, we will eventually reach civilization!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just...more...forest...
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes. We've been walking here for over three hours.
It's like we're going in circles...

 
**Geronimo:**
I am afraid that I am not familiar with the forests of the north... My apologies. For an Apache scout to get lost... This is an embarrassment to my tribe.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not your fault, Geronimo.
 

 
**D：???:**
Heeeeeey!

 
**Mash:**
Is that...?

 
**Bunyan:**
Wh-what a relief!
I finally found you guys!

 
**Mash:**
Is she...smaller?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She is.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Small is kinda, uh, relative here...
 

 
**Edison:**
Hmmm... What unknown work of science could this be!? How interesting!

 
**Geronimo:**
...Strange and rare Spirit, I am grateful that you have answered our call.

 
**Bunyan:**
Heehee. Me too.
I got scared because I couldn't hear you guys anymore.

 
**Geronimo:**
This is my Master.
[♂ His /♀ Her] name is Fujimaru.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice to meet you, Bunyan.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Yep. Nice to meet you!

 
**Mash:**
This is wonderful, Senpai.
Bunyan seems like a wonderful person!

 
**Bunyan:**
Hehehe.

 
**Edison:**
All right, Paul Bunyan. I am Edison.

 
**Bunyan:**
Ehhh!? This fluffy thing is Edison!?
Where's the zipper in his costume?

 
**Edison:**
Stop! There's no one inside!
I am Edison! No more and no less than the man himself!

 
**Bunyan:**
I-I'm sorry. I just get this urge to take stuff apart when I see something so intricately made...

 
**Bunyan:**
Oh, but I really respect you!
You are the king of all the world's inventors, after all!

 
**Edison:**
Harumph. That's right. Children needn't know that I am also called the king of lawsuits!

 
**Edison:**
It is wonderful that you are so innocent!
Here, take a Mini Edison Lion Badge.

 
**Edison:**
Collect ten, and you can exchange it for a Mega Edison Lion Badge. Surely the big badge would suit your big body!

 
**Bunyan:**
!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou!

 
**Edison:**
Ah, but I digress. We are wondering just what in the world you might be, Bunyan.

 
**Bunyan:**
...I'm a lumberjack! And I'm okay! I got summoned by someone, and ended up in this forest.

 
**Bunyan:**
This whole time...I've been alone in the forest...

 
**Mash:**
When you say you were summoned...does that mean you're a Servant?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like it.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Servant... Yep, probably.
I think...I'm a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Geronimo:**
...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you low on Magical Energy?
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Yeah. I'm...hungry.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Very well! Then a Master is what you shall have!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please lend us your strength to correct this Singularity!
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Is that...okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Okay! I think, I can be useful!
Ask me anything, okay?

 
**Edison:**
Then let's get down to business. Where in North America are we? We aren't familiar with this place.

 
**Bunyan:**
I think...it's North Dakota.

 
**Edison:**
North Dakota!?

 
**Geronimo:**
...Well, we certainly ended up in a dreadful place.

 
**Mash:**
I'm not that versed in American geography...
Is North Dakota really that bad?

 
**Edison:**
...To be blunt...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Blunt?
 

 
**Edison:**
It's the boonies!

 
**Geronimo:**
North Dakota is about 183,000 square kilometers in area. It is the equivalent of the majority of the British Isles or an island nation like Japan.

 
**Edison:**
But the entire population is about 760,000 as of 2017. It's been like that for years.

 
**Mash:**
Which means, in a state with such a low population, we may walk for hours and hours without finding any trace of civilization whatsoever.

 
**Fou:**
Fooou. (Nods)

 
**Edison:**
If worse comes to worst, we may be stuck in this forest forever!

 
**Geronimo:**
The forest is teeming with Spirits. We even run the risk of using up all our magical energy, or Master's!

 
**Demon:**
Grrrrrrrrr...!

 
**Edison:**
Speak of the devil... I mean Spirits!
Can you help us, Miss Paul Bunyan!?

 
**Bunyan:**
Yep! I'll chop 'em all up with my axe!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...It's so...vast...

 
**Edison:**
Hm...indeed it is. This is the problem with the countryside... Not so much as a streetlight in sight.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sleepy, I'm hungry, I'm tired...
 

 
**Geronimo:**
If only we could reach a village...
We can only camp out so many times.

 
**Geronimo:**
The weather around here can change in a blink of an eye. If a snowstorm were to start, Master will definitely be in trouble.

 
**Bunyan:**
If only I had my favorite axe, this would be easy.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Favorite axe?
 
**Bunyan:**
Yep. My special axe for chopping down trees!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tell me it's a limited ★5 CE, isn't it!?
 
**Bunyan:**
What...are you talking about?

 
**Mash:**
Master, it's okay this time!
We don't need to farm anything in this event!

 
**Geronimo:**
(Yet another bizarre outburst... Could there be something in the air causing this strange behavior?)

 

 
**Edison:**
I see. If Miss Bunyan did have her favorite axe, she could open up this forest to create a path for us.

 
**Bunyan:**
But the person who summoned me took my axe away...

 
**Bunyan:**
They said it was really dangerous...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A mage?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are they like?
 

 
**Bunyan:**
...I don't remember.
They went really far to the east...

 
**Mash:**
That is interesting.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. They might know something about the Singularity.
 

 
**Geronimo:**
That's more reason we need that axe...
Unfortunately, my magecraft is not up to the task.

 
**Edison:**
Dwahahaha!
What are you saying!?

 
**Edison:**
What a strange question to axe!

 
**Edison:**
...Is the sort of wacky nonsense one might say, but that one will not be THIS one! Why? Because I'm a genius, of course!

 
**Mash:**
Edison?

 
**Edison:**
Miss Bunyan! As a denizen of the United States, you must realize you are forgetting one critical thing!

 
**Edison:**
That's right.

 
**Edison:**
Do it yourself!

 
**Bunyan:**
DIY... Make...it...myself...

 
**Edison:**
Indeed! The pioneers all started out in small shacks and eventually built their own world!

 
**Edison:**
Just like me! I started out in a small, poor lab, but eventually expanded into a giant corporation!

 
**Edison:**
What are your hands for!?
What are your arms for!?

 
**Edison:**
Yes! To build your future! Don't hesitate! Break through! Fight it! And if you can't fight it, sue it!

 
**Edison:**
That's the frontier spirit!!!

 
**Bunyan:**
Frontier Spirit...
The pioneering mentality...

 
**Geronimo:**
Great Spirit Bunyan. I also agree.

 
**Geronimo:**
Once in the past, the coyote stole the source of knowledge from the sun, giving the world its light.

 
**Geronimo:**
Steadfast determination changes the world a bit at a time. We shall lend you a hand, O Spirit.

 
**Bunyan:**
Okay. I have the plans... As long as we can make a workstation, we can probably make the axe.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay! Time to farm materials!
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is this enough?
 

 
**Mash:**
I believe so. We have just about everything Bunyan requested.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad. Just a bit more.
 
**Mash:**
Yes! Let's keep going, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If only we could collect mats like this.Curse you, developers!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! I completely understand how you feel, but please calm down!

 
**Mash:**
Besides, how do Gears and Proofs of all things enhance my skills? It doesn't make any sense!

 
**Geronimo:**
(There's a change in the air again... Are the Spirits agitated? Is...something terrible about to happen...?)

 

 
**Monster:**
Gyaaaoooooo!!!

 
**Bunyan:**
Another monster!?

 
**Mash:**
Ugh! Senpai, prepare for battle!
It seems the monster has decided we're enemies!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah, this situation brings back memories.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why is it always when the good stuff happens?Those bastards...
 

 
**Mash:**
Oh, yes! Sorry to interrupt, but here come the wyverns!

 
**Mash:**
I'm sure it doesn't even have any good materials to drop, but let's just grit our teeth and power through!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Geronimo:**
...The Spirits have stopped stirring.
It seems that was the last of the wyverns.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's been a while since I saw wyverns.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wonder what Siegfried's up to...?
 

 
**Siegfried:**
Sorry, I do not have much to say or do here...

 
**Siegfried:**
Please watch “Fate/Apocrypha”...now streaming on Something-or-another-flix...

 
**Siegfried:**
The light novels are...well, you could import them...
I'm counting on you, Master...

 
**Mash:**
He just...plugged his title...and left...

 
**Geronimo:**
Master... Who are you talking to?
Is it a Spirit that I can neither sense nor see?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, nothing... Nothing. Never mind.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Something...incredibly terrifying...
 

 
**Edison:**
Hm. Perhaps this is the same principle as the Spiritual World Communicator. Fujimaru...you're...um...

 
**Edison:**
Perhaps you may have heard the voice of a ghost...someone very much like you, yet different...

 
**Geronimo:**
...I-I see...

 
**Geronimo:**
You must have some notion that I cannot quite fathom. If it's all right with Fujimaru, it's fine, though.

 
**Geronimo:**
Anyway, Bunyan said that the workstation is complete. Come with me.

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Bunyan:**
Tiiiiiiiiimmmbeeeeeerrr!!!

 
**Mash:**
This is amazing...!
The trees are falling like dominos.

 
**Edison:**
Hm. Even the logging machines humanity has developed are no match for Bunyan's axe!

 
**Mash:**
B-but don't you think she's going a bit overboard?
At this rate, there won't be any forest left!

 
**Bunyan:**
Don't worry.

 
**Mash:**
Eh?

 
**Bunyan:**
I chopped them down so they can be used as lumber, and I cut them so they could grow back!

 
**Bunyan:**
I'll create a path to civilization for you, and then bring all that to the lumberyard!

 
**Mash:**
Um, about that...

 
**Bunyan:**
Come on, let's go!

 
**Mash:**
Th-the forest really is gone...!
All that's left is a neatly stacked pile of lumber!

 
**Edison:**
Ah! I knew it! Paul Bunyan!
I've heard that name before!

 
**Geronimo:**
What!?
You know her, Edison!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hmmm, I feel like we've had this conversation before...
 

 
**Edison:**
Don't fret about the small things!

 
**Edison:**
Not every player has played every event, you know!

 
**Edison:**
Isn't this what a proper global social mobile RPG targeted at a broad audience should be like?

 
**Edison:**
Within me, George Washington is saying the only thing to not fear is not fear but the mundane itself!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are...you sure that's right, Presi-King?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mundanity is scary.
 

 
**Geronimo:**
...At any rate...
Who is this Paul Bunyan?

 
**Geronimo:**
I have not heard of this Spirit.
Is it one you revere, or perhaps an angel or saint?

 
**Edison:**
Hm. I believe I recall that in newspapers she is said to have been the greatest lumberjack in all of America.

 
**Edison:**
A single blow of her axe created the Mississippi River, and a blow from her fist could dig an oil well that would reach clear through to China!

 
**Edison:**
She could drain all five Great Lakes dry in a single gulp. A swing of her pickaxe could shatter the entire Rocky Mountain range!

 
**Edison:**
Even the Great Plains of the Midwest are said to be what remains of Bunyan cutting down a forest!

 
**Edison:**
In a way, she's a great being who created the United States by hand! That's who Paul Bunyan is.

 
**Mash:**
A legend that created America...
That kind of Servant was summoned here?

 
**Geronimo:**
...I see. I understand now.

 
**Geronimo:**
But if all that were true...

 
**Geronimo:**
A being so powerful must be a Divine Spirit. Summoning such a thing should not normally be possible.

 
**Edison:**
(...Hm... There is a more important, immediate reason Paul Bunyan cannot be summoned...)

 
**Edison:**
Let's set those questions aside for now!
She is, after all, standing before us!

 
**Edison:**
The question is: who summoned Miss Bunyan? Considering that they summoned a Servant, they must also be in possession of a Holy Grail!

 
**Edison:**
And that tells us that the person who summoned her must be the person who created this Singularity.

 
**Geronimo:**
Yes. O Spirit, O Bunyan...answer my&ndash;

 
**Bunyan:**
Wait.

 
**Mash:**
Eh?

 
**Bunyan:**
...Something's coming.

 
**Mash:**
What's that!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something...something shiny...is descending...!?
 

 
**Billy:**
Uh, dispatch, this is Deputy Billy.
I've got eyes on the site of illegal deforestation.

 
**Billy:**
...Did I get my line right?

 
**F：???:**
Correct. Illegal deforestation is bad civilization!

 
**Bunyan:**
Huh!? Bad...civilization...!?

 
**F：???:**
Yes! And so I, Wyatt Earp, shall destroy you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wyatt Earp?
 

 
**Edison:**
Ah, the legendary Wyatt Earp! I know of him from my own lifetime! He is a legendary gunslinger of the West!

 
**Edison:**
Truly, there is no question that Wyatt Earp would be a Heroic Spirit! But you're...erm... Who are you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Altera. That is Altera.
 

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
I know nothing of this “Altera” you speak of.
I am Wyatt Earp. Yes. Wyatt Earp.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Master from a faraway land, no matter who you have contracted with...

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
I am absolutely not them.
I am a lawman. Wyatt Earp.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh-huh. Sure, Altera.
 

 
**Billy:**
Honestly, just go with it. No use arguing.

 
**Billy:**
We definitely didn't have the budget for a bunch of new art and stuff. So, for today, she's Wyatt Earp.

 
**Billy:**
Just like how I'm a sheriff's deputy here.
I guess that makes me our Doc Holliday?

 
**Geronimo:**
These new stories are overwriting the Heroic Spirits we know... So that's what happened...

 
**Edison:**
I've just received a spiritual message from the developers. “Don't think too hard about it.”

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This spiritual communicator is BS, like Mahatm&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, COME ON! Wyatt Earp Servant WHEN!?
 

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Good. That's the reaction I wanted.
That adaptability is your greatest strength. Cherish it.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Save it for the trial.
You destroyed a forest illegally, after all.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
For such crimes, you must be punished.
Right here. Right now.

 
**Bunyan:**
Wait!?
We just wanted to reach town&ndash;

 
**Bunyan:**
I was about to ship all this out because I didn't want to waste the trees I chopped down!

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Make efficient use of the results of your destruction...
I see. Those words cut deep...

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
But none of that matters! I see the crime you committed, and that is that. Excuses get you nowhere.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
What I question is your responsibility of your actions. Paul Bunyan.

 
**Geronimo:**
(This Spirit of judgment has appeared to pass sentence on Bunyan... Truly that proves that Bunyan is a Heroic Spirit that shouldn't be&ndash;)

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Giant, destructive lumberjack, receive your punishment.

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Ugh! I've been struck in the head by an axe-like blunt instrument!

 
**Bunyan:**
It's over!
Don't bother us again!

 
**Mash:**
Altera! Please, listen to us!

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
...You are mistaken.
I am absolutely not Altera. No.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
When the morning star shines in the eastern sky, a single ray of light will shine upon Chicago.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
That shall be me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have absolutely no clue what you're on about.
 
**Wyatt Earp:**
...Actually...

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
I'm really not sure what this Heroic Spirit is about myself...

 
**Mash:**
Well, then no one understands!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just jump. You have Saint Quartz, right?
 
**Wyatt Earp:**
...I-if I had any...if I did...I wouldn't be going through all of this...

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Quartz... So small...but so rare...

 

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Ugh! I used up all my time making silly small talk with you! I can only fight for three minutes at a time.

 
**Wyatt Earp:**
Farewell, for now. You shall be properly tried next time, Paul Bunyan.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She disappeared!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did she really just take off and fly to Chicago?
 

 
**Edison:**
It appears so. Wyatt Earp...what type of Altera was it!?

 
**Billy:**
...And I've been abandoned.

 
**Geronimo:**
Billy the Kid.
The young hero, the Thunderer. O, brave assailant...

 
**Geronimo:**
Where did you come from, and where do you go from here? Please, tell us.

 
**Geronimo:**
You and I are both Heroic Spirits. We are both Spirits of the dead who have come from the Throne of the Root.

 
**Billy:**
I'm really not into this whole mysticism junk...
Eh, whatever.

 
**Billy:**
So me, Wyatt Earp, and even Bunyan...were all Summoned by the same mage.

 
**Bunyan:**
...!!!

 
**Billy:**
She's in Chicago.
And she's controlling everything from there.

 
**Edison:**
Chicago...that's far to the east of here!

 
**Geronimo:**
And Altera headed over there too...I see.

 
**Billy:**
Can I go now?

 
**Billy:**
Playing sheriff was okay, I guess.
But next time, I'd rather play the outlaw...

 
**Bunyan:**
...Let's go.

 
**Bunyan:**
I'll pave the way...to Chicago!

 
## Section 2: Hamburg Steak and Parsley
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So vast...
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Un-freakin'-believably vast...
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes... It's just endless grasslands...

 
**Edison:**
We are in Wisconsin's Central Plain.

 
**Edison:**
It is a V-shaped region in the center of the state and is particularly well-suited to dairy farming.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe we can find a farm that can give us food!
 
**Mash:**
Farm life... That is the slow life. Right, Senpai?
Actually, I have always wanted to try milking a cow.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe there's a farm with about a trillion or so QP.
 
**Geronimo:**
That seems quite unrealistic, Master. Besides, that is the mindset of a pillager. Though... I don't mind...

 
**Geronimo:**
We should earn QP honestly, by raiding treasuries.
I do like the golden doors that drop golden boxes...

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 

 
**Bunyan:**
But... I'm getting really hungry...

 
**Bunyan:**
I want either a lake full of oatmeal, or an oil field-sized plate of yakisoba...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep. It's tough being giant.
 
**Bunyan:**
Yep... I could eat a horse or twenty-seven...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've eaten yakisoba before!?
 
**Bunyan:**
Yep! When I was digging an oil field on the West Coast, some Chinese workers made some for me.

 
**Bunyan:**
It was so good...

 

 
**Edison:**
My apologies. If only we needed to improve cooking appliances, I could help out...

 
**Geronimo:**
And there is no suitable game to hunt...
I suppose we can find squirrels.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can eat squirrel!?
 
**Geronimo:**
Oh, it is hardly strange, Master.
I usually eat them raw or skewer them.

 
**Geronimo:**
I've also had it in a bleu cheese fondue.
That was good in itself.

 
**Geronimo:**
It tastes like a lean beef filet.
Master, you should try...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don’t see that being enough for Bunyan.
 
**Edison:**
No. We could probably hunt the entire North American squirrel population to extinction and do little more than make an appetizer for her.

 

 
**Mash:**
W-well, let's put the topic of squirrel on hold...
Hey, is that a house up ahead?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah! There's a house!
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Let's ask if they can spare us some food!

 
**Mash:**
Hellooo!

 
**Jack:**
Yeees!

 
**Edison:**
Is your mommy home?

 
**Jack:**
Who are you, Mister Lion?

 
**Edison:**
Heh heh. I'm not Mister Lion. You may not believe it, but I am the Presi-King of the United States!

 
**Geronimo:**
...You're making this more complicated than necessary. Step aside.

 
**Geronimo:**
My name is Geronimo. We've been traveling from the west. Could you spare us some food?

 
**Jack:**
You're hungry?
Wait a minute, okay?

 
**Jack:**
Um, we have visitors.
They say they're hungry.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh? Visitors? Have we perhaps met in some strange and strangely separate story?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But, oh! I'm dejectedly disappointedly sorry.
I'm afraid I am have been summoned by someone else.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I don't know you!

 
**Jack:**
Yep. We're waiting for Mommy.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
“Mommy”...?
 

 
**Jack:**
Mommy is the one who summoned us.

 
**Jack:**
And since we're Servants, we're waiting for Mommy to come.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But Mommy went to Chicago.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Chicago, Chicago! That toddlin' town!
It's a wonderful city of civilization!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm sure Mommy was captivated by Chicago.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Because Chicago is humanity's wisdom itself.
It's eccentric and metafictional.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's corrupt and self-referential.
It's a city that deconstructs and subdues modernity.

 
**Jack:**
You always say really weird and complicated stuff!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tee hee. That's just how wonderful Chicago is!

 
**Edison:**
Hm... Chicago and civilization...
What's this sudden, sinking sense of dread...

 
**Bunyan:**
Hey, I'm hungry!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
My! What a BIG friend you have!

 
**Jack:**
No wonder you're so hungry.
People get sad when they get hungry.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's grill up some hamburg steak!
Hamburg steak!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Wonderful hamburg steak.
Mommy's hamburg steak!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Bread crumbs and onions, mixed together...even if it makes your eyes ache! Chop chop chop! Mix it all up to make hamburg steak!

 
**Jack:**
There's one hamburg steak left in our fridge.
We will share our last one!

 
**Bunyan:**
That was good.
Thank you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But one hamburg steak's not enough...

 
**Bunyan:**
Yeah...B-but it really was delicious!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!? Are you all right!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something...hit the house...!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It's buffalo!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We've noticed that the buffalo herds have become violent recently!

 
**Geronimo:**
A stampede!?
Or could an evil Spirit be possessing them...?

 
**Geronimo:**
This is bad, Master. If we don't do anything, a ramshackle house like this will be trampled!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah...we should go out there to beat up the herd!
 

 
**Bunyan:**
I'm gonna join too. I won't let this nice shack that somebody made get destroyed!

 
**Jack:**
Oh...really?
We won't be able to pay you back for it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We don't need anything in return.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai!
I knew you would say something like that!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh I better get so many Hearts outta this!
 
**Mash:**
That is obviously just wishful thinking Please, snap out of it, Senpai!

 

 
**Edison:**
Let's go... It's an ambush!
Let's show them the power of the dawn of civilization!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We ate them all...

 
**Mash:**
Yes...
An entire herd of buffalo...

 
**Mash:**
Seasoned with salt and pepper, Worcester sauce, ketchup, cheese... Broiled, stewed, and fried...

 
**Mash:**
I feel as if we ate a lifetime's worth of hamburg steaks...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's the difference betweenfried hamburg steak and buffalo croquettes?
 

 
**Edison:**
Nuahahahahaha!

 
**Edison:**
What do you think of the new Edison Brand Salisbury Steak Maker™!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Salisbury steak?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They weren't hamburg steaks?
 

 
**Edison:**
Yes. Nowadays, I hear fancy shops try to pass it off by calling it a German dish.

 
**Edison:**
But here in the States, it was called Salisbury steak!

 
**Edison:**
During the turmoil of the Civil War, Dr. Salisbury developed a mincemeat steak using red meat!

 
**Edison:**
Not only is it healthy, but it can be mass-produced!
Such is the dish that I, the genius Edison, improved!

 
**Jack:**
Um, we haven't heard of that. So it's basically hamburg steak, right? Maybe they're even just hamburgers?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
In French and German books, they all say
“hamburg steak,” so shouldn't we just go with that?

 
**Edison:**
Hmmm, but since we are in the States, I would prefer to call it Salisbury steak, the American way...

 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed. Even if it is unremarkable, being prideful of one's own culture is important.

 
**Edison:**
H-hm. Coming from you, and with a straight face,
I couldn't help but laugh aloud...

 
**Edison:**
...if only I had nerves of steel! But what do you think, Geronimo!? Was the dish to your liking?

 
**Geronimo:**
Yes... A buffalo hunt, then sitting with my comrades to eat our catch brings back memories.

 
**Geronimo:**
My tribe once hunted buffalo on horseback.

 
**Geronimo:**
But there are no more buffalo. They were driven near to extinction by firearms and railroads.

 
**Geronimo:**
Now, buffalo living in nature preserves are all that remain... Mere memories, like us Heroic Spirits.

 
**Geronimo:**
...I was able to taste that again. I suppose some good fortune befalls one even as a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Bunyan:**
Yep. It's really, really, really tasty!

 
**Jack:**
We're glad! This is a dish that Mommy taught us!
Eat a lot, okay?

 
**Bunyan:**
Oh, but I don't want parsley.
I just want hamburg steak.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's no good, Bunyan!
Good children must eat everything on their plates!

 
**Bunyan:**
But...it's bitter.

 
**Jack:**
You shouldn't leave friends behind, okay?

 
**Edison:**
Indeed. Parsley is a wonderful vegetable chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

 
**Bunyan:**
O-okay. If everyone says so, I'll try my best to eat it.
I'll savor everything on my plate.

 
**Mash:**
...Please...take the rest of my food... I'm so full of hamburg steak I think I'm going to burst...

 
**Bunyan:**
Yay! It's been a while since I ate with a bunch of people!

 
**Bunyan:**
I was always alone in that forest!

 
**Edison:**
Glad to hear it! Then next I shall cook Salisbury steak teriyaki style!

 
**Edison:**
After grilling it rare, using this Edison-made portable cooking stove...hm?

 
**G：???:**
Unnntouchable!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oops, Altera did it again...
 
**G：???:**
I am not Altera!
And I am not Britney Spears either!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want some hamburg steak?
 
**G：???:**
Yes. I will have a plate.

 
**G：???:**
...Yes. This is...(munch)...somewhat...good civilization. (Munch, munch)

 
**G：???:**
But I know better. There are far better and tastier hamburg steaks out there in the world. And I know they're full of umami.

 
**G：???:**
Ghh! No...not that.
Bribery will not work on me!

 

 
**G：???:**
I am Park Ranger Buffalo Bill!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, but you're Altera, though.
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Our two weapons are Spirit Origin and magical energy...and Noble Phantasm...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...She flew east...!
 

 
**Mash:**
I wonder what that was about...?
And that was three weapons...

 
**Jack:**
Did she want to eat hamburg steak?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That must be it!
Because hamburg steaks really are delicious!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Anywhere can be paradise with delicious food!

 
**Edison:**
Yes, yes. Grow big and strong, you hear?

 
**Bunyan:**
Ah!

 
**Mash:**
What's wrong, Bunyan?

 
**Bunyan:**
She's back.

 
**???:**
Unnntouchable!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Altera's back!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We need a cool name for this: Alteranate? Wait, no...
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
No! I am Park Ranger Buffalo Bill!
Our THREE weapons are...

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Spirit Origin, magical energy, Noble Phantasm, and moderation!

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
I...I got it wrong again!
Math is bad civilization! I'll come in again!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait.
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Wh-what!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't have to do it again.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're getting nowhere.
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
I see. True.
Everyone makes little mistakes sometimes.

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Then I'll start over. Anyway...
We have tons of weapons. Got it?

 
**Edison:**
That's fine. One does not make a great nation by sweating the small stuff.

 
**Edison:**
So, what is it this time...um, Buffalo Bill...?

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Do I need to spell it out? You have committed the heinous crime of killing the endangered buffalo! That is, the American bison!

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Now come quietly, or there will be trouble.

 
**Geronimo:**
Wait. I can't ignore what you just said.

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
What?

 
**Geronimo:**
The buffalo do not belong to anyone.
That is to say, they are gifts of nature.

 
**Geronimo:**
We hunted a berserk herd that was threatening humans. We did not pursue the herd that fled.

 
**Geronimo:**
Bunyan made sure to use their bones, hides, and horns so nothing was wasted. Every piece of meat was ground up to make hamburg steak.

 
**Geronimo:**
We have done nothing wrong. There was no malicious killing. Do you still believe we committed a crime?

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Yes. What you did cannot go unpunished.
Time to taste my Winchester War God Sword!

 
**Geronimo:**
If that is the case, I am an Apache before I am a Heroic Spirit. I will not permit anyone to deny the Apache way of life!

 
**Geronimo:**
Nor will I allow Master or the children to be punished for sharing the blessings of the buffalo!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Take that!
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
...How? How could you possess such strength...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Our bonds... That's what Chaldea is all about!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's all about the embers, Ascension,and a carry from good support!
 

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
I see...
So that is your strength...

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
But go no farther, Master who has come from the outside world... You are trying to do something that must not be done.

 
**Geronimo:**
What? What do you mean, Buffalo Bill? Spirit who takes the name of the legendary buffalo hunter.

 
**Buffalo Bill:**
Goodbye-ffalo!

 
**Mash:**
She's...gone...

 
**Bunyan:**
Did I...do something bad?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, not at all.
 
**Jack:**
That's right. You were just eating lunch with us.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You didn't do anything bad!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nobody can really say what's good or bad.
 
**Edison:**
Yeah. If we hadn't killed the buffalo, the children would have gotten hurt.

 
**Geronimo:**
This land is unforgiving. There is no universally agreed-upon justice to be found.

 
**Geronimo:**
Justice comes through victory...whether it be by swords, magecraft, or words.

 

 
**Bunyan:**
If that's so, merci.

 
**Bunyan:**
Thank you for fighting for my sake.

 
**Bunyan:**
Now that we're full, let's go. We need to go meet the person who summoned me in Chicago.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Then Jack and I will go too.

 
**Jack:**
We're tired of waiting.
And Bunyan's our friend now.

 
**Bunyan:**
Master? Is...that okay?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course!
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Okay! Then off to Chicago!

 
## Section 3: Flourish and Fabrication
 
**Bunyan:**
So this is...Chicago...!

 
**Fou:**
Fo...fooou?
Foufofofofofofofofouu?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, definitely Chicago...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If it's a city, it's Chicago...
 

 
**Jack:**
Wow! It's like London!
Exactly like London!

 
**Fou:**
Foufofofofofofofofooo?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Jack, shh! This is Chicago. We just have to make that clear with our words. No mentioning that.

 
**Jack:**
Ohhh. We don't care where we are.
As long as it's a city that Mommy might be in, we're fine.

 
**Bunyan:**
I wonder where we should go...? Ah!

 
**Passerby:**
Hey, outta my way!
Get that huge body of yours off the street!

 
**Bunyan:**
I-I'm sorry...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't need to apologize.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey! We're walkin' here!
 

 
**Passerby:**
Sh-shut up...! Tsk!

 
**Bunyan:**
Th-thank you, Master...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
For what?
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Well...because...I'm so big.
I just assumed that I would be a burden to everyone...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Everyone's different.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You should see some of the folks at Chaldea.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
R-really...?

 
**Mash:**
You're right... There are some pretty...unusually large people, like Kiara and Gorgon...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it so much! It'll turn you gray!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's what makes you unique.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
What...makes me...unique...

 
**Edison:**
Hm! As long as it is not illegal, uniqueness is to be embraced. That's what the U.S. is all about!

 
**Geronimo:**
Now to gather information. That mage will probably have left some trace of their activities.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
So we're going to split up and search!
Like detectives!

 
**Jack:**
If we find Mommy, can we dismember her to make sure it's her?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stay, Jack, stay!
 

 
**Jack:**
Okaaay. We'll hold back.
Could you make more hamburg steaks for us, then?

 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, team, circle up!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sound off!
 

 
**Mash:**
One!

 
**Bunyan:**
Two!

 
**Jack:**
Third!

 
**Mash＆Fou:**
Fooou!

 
**Edison:**
So, status? Report, everyone.
Sidenote: I have nothing.

 
**Edison:**
One look at me and everyone from animal control to the police came rushing in. There were even heroes who kept calling me villain.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Guess what? I ate a pizza THIS big!
It was really tall and delicious!

 
**Bunyan:**
Yep! It was really good!

 
**Jack:**
You should try it next time, Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, okay!
 

 
**Geronimo:**
...Well, that's all very...useful.

 
**Geronimo:**
I have one thing to report.

 
**Mash:**
Oh that's a relief...! I was afraid this would only end up being about our dining experience...

 
**Geronimo:**
There was this shop called “Club High Society,” where a group of occult fans gathered.

 
**Geronimo:**
Many of them are not mages at all, but such a place almost certainly has the backing of the Mages' Association.

 
**Edison:**
I see. It may be a good idea to check them out.

 
**Edison:**
Let us head over to “Club High Society”!

 
**Bouncer:**
Hey, stop right there. No kids allowed.

 
**Edison:**
Hm? Are you speaking of Master?
[♂ He /♀ She] may look young, but I assure you, [♂ he /♀ she] is no child.

 
**Edison:**
Maybe this will change your mind.
(Passes him something under the table)

 
**Mash:**
Edison just handed over a huge wad of money to the bouncer...!

 
**Mash:**
The obvious go-to move for a successful businessman!

 
**Bouncer:**
Well, when you put it like that... (Fumble, fumble).
But I still can't let those little girls in.

 
**Jack:**
You can't?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I'm sure I'm older than you.

 
**Bouncer:**
No can do, little girl.
Now be good little girls and stay outside.

 
**Jack:**
Awwww, we want to dismember too.

 
**Bouncer:**
Dismember...? Whatever. There's a coffee shop open twenty-four hours just around the corner.

 
**Bouncer:**
I'll let them know a couple of kids are coming.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Do they have any sweet taffy?
Or maybe a nice cake?

 
**Bouncer:**
Of course they do.
Chicago donuts are the best donuts in the world.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, donuts! The holes in donuts must be a portal to a wonderful world!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Let's go, Jack. But... I'm a little sad that we're not going to be with Bunyan.

 
**Jack:**
Yep. Master, take good care of Bunyan.

 
**Bunyan:**
Wait right there. We'll be right back.

 
**Bouncer:**
Ready? New customers coming in!

 
**Celebrity:**
Hahahahaha. What did you think of the medium reading the other day?

 
**Celebrity:**
Ah, it was so incredible. Spiritual enlightenment is a once in a lifetime experience, after all!

 
**Celebrity:**
I'm planning to head to THAT town next. I hear there's a grimoire that's been there since its early days as a settlement.

 
**Mash:**
They seem to be talking about some complicated things...

 
**Bunyan:**
I don't get it. They all look so serious.
Why don't they just talk about useful things?

 
**Geronimo:**
It's mostly a bit of harmless misinformation. The Mystics of the Spirits would never truly be revealed to the untrustworthy.

 
**Edison:**
Concealing Mystics, huh?
So you agree with the Mages' Association?

 
**Geronimo:**
It's not about the Association. It's simply that in our tradition, those with the lineage of the Spirits must live up to that position.

 
**Geronimo:**
Should knowledge of the Spirits be made public, it would become mundane; it would lose its value.

 
**Edison:**
That's an opinion worth listening to. I'd like to hear more, but looks like we don't have the time.

 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed. You can see it too, right, Master? That woman there is the only one with actual magical energy.

 
**Bunyan:**
The...pretty lady...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mata Hari...!
 

 
**Mash:**
Please be careful.
That is not the Mata Hari we know.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep. That's not the Chaldean Heroic Spirit.
 

 
**Mata Hari:**
Tee hee. Welcome to Club High Society.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Mata Hari, this club's mistress.

 
**Mata Hari:**
I wonder how long it's been since a real mage has set foot in here...

 
**Mata Hari:**
And now...goodbye.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ugh...getting dizzy...
 

 
**Bunyan:**
What's...this?
My head's getting fuzzy...!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Director...let's go wrestle...magical circuits!
 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, what were you just thinking!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come here, my little eggplant!
 

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai!? Wh-what did you...!?
What do you mean, “little eggplant”!?

 
**Mash:**
Please...stop!
You mustn't...you mustn't...you mustn't stop!

 
**Mata Hari:**
Tee hee...that's right...drown in your pleasure.
I am Mata Hari, the woman with the eyes of the sun!

 
**Mata Hari:**
There's no way you can escape from this charm.
Goodbye, strange mage from another world.

 
**D：???:**
Not a chance.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh...!? Wait, what the...!?
 

 
**Mata Hari:**
Impossible!?
But I used my Noble Phantasm on them...!

 
**Edison:**
How unfortunate for you.
Did you think Geronimo and I would be unprepared?

 
**Geronimo:**
We've set up a barrier around this club.

 
**Edison:**
We asked Miss Nursery Rhyme to act if anything unusual happened.

 
**Geronimo:**
Don't think for an instant that a lone Assassin's magical energy would suffice against three Casters!

 
**Mata Hari:**
I see.

 
**Mata Hari:**
I knew this would happen. Fine. Much as I do not approve of the male manner of problem-solving...

 
**Mata Hari:**
Get them, men.

 
**Bouncer:**
What's the problem here?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Club High Society is my castle.
Don't you dare think you can get out of here alive!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Bunyan:**
Take...that...!
Please get out of the way!

 
**Bouncer:**
Gyaaaaaah!!!

 
**Mata Hari:**
So this is the end.
Tee hee...you're so strong...

 
**Bunyan:**
Please, tell me.

 
**Bunyan:**
Where is these girls' “Mommy,” the mage who summoned me?

 
**Mata Hari:**
...I suppose it's about time someone told you.

 
**Mata Hari:**
The World's Columbian Exposition.
Go there, and you will meet the one you seek.

 
**Geronimo:**
...

 
**Edison:**
...World's Columbian Exposition?

 
**Mata Hari:**
Listen, Paul Bunyan.

 
**Bunyan:**
(She's petting me...without getting scared.)

 
**Mata Hari:**
Humans...even if you are a Heroic Spirit...can live on just by being loved.

 
**Mata Hari:**
You are loved by your Master. That's why you were able to reach this place...despite your unlucky stars.

 
**Mata Hari:**
Someday...there will be a Master who will use a Grail to power me up to level 100 too...

 
**Mata Hari:**
Perhaps...the me in your Chaldea is like that...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mata Hari...
 

 
**Geronimo:**
...We are transient existences, ephemeral guests in this world, spiritual forms of what was once human...

 
**Geronimo:**
Yet, when we do exist...each time we are summoned, we are given new consciousness.

 
**Geronimo:**
Master. The bond that you and the rest of the Servants have formed is a real one.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That is neither dreams nor fiction.
 

 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Master.
To the World's Columbian Exposition!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Bunyan:**
So this is the World's Columbian Exposition...!

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Historically, this is the World's Fair held in 1893.

 
**Geronimo:**
So it is an event to showcase the current culture and innovation of modern nations. Is this sort of boasting really necessary, though?

 
**Geronimo:**
I would normally think that cultural exchange without combat is a good thing, but this fair is proving to be the exception to that rule.

 
**Geronimo:**
This place is fairly dripping with the arrogance of privilege. Hideous. It is truly hideous.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. During the 1893 World's Fair there were many...“exhibitions” of minorities.

 
**Edison:**
Agreed! This is far from rational!

 
**Edison:**
The worst part is this horrible use of electricity! It's AC! They're using AC!

 
**Edison:**
The Edison Tower's DC should have been more than sufficient!

 
**Geronimo:**
You're like an argumentative spiritual leader in the guise of a thunder god worshipper. But I still respect you... If you still can call that rational.

 
**Edison:**
Indeed! That's the DC way of thinking!

 
**Bunyan:**
I know this place has its flaws.
But it's still fun.

 
**Bunyan:**
There's lots of buildings. There's lots of detail put in them. The carpenters, the plasterers, and the gardeners...they all put in a lot of effort.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you like buildings, Bunyan?
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Yep. I like to destroy, but that's my job.

 
**Bunyan:**
Making something is really fun.
And I love to see what other people make too.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tee hee. I agree. I enjoy them too.
Because things made by others are always wonderful.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
It doesn't matter who the storyteller is. It's an intimate contract between the reader and the work.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Such things are everywhere, but not anywhere.
That's why it's so wonderful! Right, Jack?

 
**Jack:**
Yep. You're right.

 
**???:**
But your story ends here. Abruptly.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I figured we were about due for this again.
 

 
**???:**
Like a shooting star that cuts through the sky...like a wavering candle flame...

 
**???:**
Even if you think it has some shape, it will disappear. That's the fate of all stories.

 
**Davy Crockett:**
I am Davy Crockett, guardian of the fading pride, and protector of order.

 
**Edison:**
Ah. So you're a guardian of the World's Fair this time. Then I have one question for you.

 
**Davy Crockett:**
Very well, Edison, king of inventions. What is your question? You have the right to ask, as you are one of those who began the Age of Reason.

 
**Edison:**
WHY AC!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Called it.
 

 
**Edison:**
I ask of you: why use AC!!??

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It's obvious. Because the great genius, Nikola Tesla is right here.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
AC can shine its light in any darkness.
It promises quiet and stability.

 
**Davy Crockett:**
Yes. AC is good civilization.
DC is bad civilization.

 
**Edison:**
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?

 
**Davy Crockett:**
Putting that aside, I cannot let you pass beyond this point.

 
**Edison:**
That's our line! I'm going to skewer you on the Edison Tower and make you into a decoration!

 
**Edison:**
I, as a gentleman, am reasonably, justifiably angry! Understand, Master!? Note that in my biography!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes. Totally. Reasonable. Uh-huh.
 

 
**Edison:**
Good! I will use mathematics and Newtonian mechanics to destroy everything efficiently! Scientifically!

 
**Bunyan:**
So you're saying we're going to solve this with violence?

 
**Edison:**
Ultimately, yes!
And that's really the whole notion! I'll make them cry!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Then I shall show you who it is that truly rules the heavens as the modern-day thunder god!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The World's Fair's power engine...the Allis Engine has stopped...! Impossible...! What is that power...!?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Didn't you know, mister professor?
Unpredictable things can happen anywhere, at any time!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's what storytelling is. Coincidence trumps certainty. That's how the good ones always go!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I see... I shall take that into account in my future theories... That way, we needn't say AC lost to DC.

 
**Edison:**
Wait a minute, you bastard!
What did you just say!?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
See you later!
Good luck on the rest of your journey!

 
**Edison:**
Why you! Hey! Don't you dare think running away makes you the victor! Though... I suppose my technology doesn't get used so much later on.

 
**Mash:**
...I didn't know that...

 
**Mash:**
I don't blame Edison for being so emotional...let's just leave him alone.

 
**Mash:**
And this is your final stand, Davy Crockett.

 
**Davy Crockett:**
So it is.

 
**Davy Crockett:**
Let me give you a warning, Paul Bunyan and Master.

 
**Bunyan:**
...

 
**Davy Crockett:**
You should not proceed further.
If you do, you will be faced with your worst nightmare.

 
**Bunyan:**
Nightmare... Are you saying there's a nightmare waiting ahead?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, Bunyan.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We've got your back.
 

 
**Jack:**
That's right. We are with you, and Master's also here. Mash, Mister Lion, and Geronimo's also with you.

 
**Bunyan:**
Thank you...!

 
**Bunyan:**
Let's go in further...to the center of the World's Fair!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Bunyan:**
Is this the center of the World's Fair?

 
**Edison:**
Hm. There's a Japanese pavilion with a Japanese garden. It seems Japanese craftsmen built all of this.

 
**Edison:**
Even today in 2019, this site is preserved in Jackson Park as the Osaka Garden.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Edison:**
The street light that I made using a bamboo filament from Kyoto is also displayed. DC all the way!

 
**Geronimo:**
But why is the Japanese pavilion the center?
I doubt it's anything to do with magecraft.

 
**Jack:**
No point wondering!
We've already been through enough!

 
**Bunyan:**
Let's go. The Japanese pavilion is farther in.

 
**Bunyan:**
This is the pavilion? What a strange building.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, this is... I don't know to express it...but everything is just...wrong...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Feels like everything's getting jammed together!
 

 
**H：???:**
...This is a story where endless wandering, unnecessary repetition, and lies have all clumped together.

 
**Bunyan:**
Who's there!?

 
**H：???:**
At the end of all these nonsensical digressions and drawn-out plots...you have finally managed to reach your final destination.

 
**H：???:**
That's right...none of you are destined to reach the third anniversary!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can't be...!?
 

 
**Mash:**
No way! A...(mumble, mumble) that resembles Senpai!?

 
**G：？？？:**
My name is [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]

 
**Nameless Master:**
I'm a Master from a Chaldea different than your own...from one of the many parallel worlds.

 
**Nameless Master:**
That's who I am.

 
**Jack:**
Mommy... You're Mommy.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Yes. Jack the Ripper, Nursery Rhyme, and all the Servants you defeated...

 
**Nameless Master:**
I'm the one who summoned them all.

 
**Nameless Master:**
But it may be easier for Fujimaru to understand if I say that I got them all from the gacha.

 
**Bunyan:**
Tell me. You summoned us and created a Singularity. What is your plan?

 
**Nameless Master:**
Paul Bunyan.
I didn't summon you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh!?
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
You're not a Servant. You're just a phantom, no more than an urban legend roaming about.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Paul Bunyan was just a joke amongst the settlers of North America. Then some trash tabloids wrote some articles on it for shits and giggles.

 
**Nameless Master:**
She has no basis in myth, and nobody actually believes in her existence. She's the very lowest form of spiritual existence: a hazy shadow without a will.

 
**Nameless Master:**
But then I let her possess udon dough, and gave her shape.

 
**Bunyan:**
I'm... I'm...not a Heroic Spirit...!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why the hell would you do that?
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
That should be obvious! To make a welfare Servant to give out for the second anniversary of FGO!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Don't “huh?” me!
You're a Master. I KNOW you know!

 
**Nameless Master:**
For F2P Masters like me, welfare Servants are the most important Servants!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not that I don't understand...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sorry, during GSSR, I...um...
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
No more boring small talk! The great thing about social games like this is that anyone can enjoy playing without thinking about them or even paying attention!

 
**Nameless Master:**
An idyllic world where everyone is equal!
To make that so, strong gold Servants are necessary!

 
**Nameless Master:**
That's why I used udon dough to create Bunyan's Spirit Origin. My plan was to produce a giant! To make the goddess who shapes the very world!

 
**Geronimo:**
...I get it now. Bunyan's legend contains mankind's universal belief in a deity of creation.

 
**Geronimo:**
It's not possible to summon an actual god, but an artificial one, possessing godlike qualities...

 
**Bunyan:**
I see...that's me...

 
**Nameless Master:**
Right. That's why I poured all my Grails and QP into you! But even so... EVEN SO...

 
**Nameless Master:**
What we actually got was just a wacky...useless thing!
If we gave YOU as a welfare, Chaldea would be DEAD!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait.
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Eh?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You. Called. Bunyan. A. Thing.
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Oh come on. What the hell else would I call it?

 
**Nameless Master:**
I mean, it's a ★1. ★1!
You get those in the FP gacha!!!

 
**Nameless Master:**
That thing is absolutely worthless!
No Servant below ★4 is worth a damn!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're wrong.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The number of ★s has nothing to do with trust.
 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...!

 
**Nameless Master:**
Oh, big talk, huh? Trust is just something the weak use to cover their weakness! So why hasn't my little eggplant turned into a ★5?

 
**Nameless Master:**
Strong bonds don't overcome lack of rarity.
You should know that as a Master...

 
**Nameless Master:**
In the end, only the Masters who post Servants over Lv. 90 get picked as Support!

 
**Nameless Master:**
They have a handful of limit broken Kaleidoscopes, and they have a surplus of event CEs!!!

 
**Nameless Master:**
A world that celebrates only the ultra-whale Masters, where only they get all the glory and friend requests! That is what I am trying to put a stop to!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Listen, you.
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Everyone has their own way of playing.
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And!!!
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We can only spend so much money,but we have infinite love to give!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What matters is embers, mats, skill gems, Grails, and time!!!
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Hnnnnnnnnnghhhhhh!!! Your logic is...
I don't even have a comeback for that!

 
**Nameless Master:**
Humph. But let's chill it out a minute here.
Sure, our playstyles differ.

 
**Nameless Master:**
But... Do you really want to give your loyalty to a development team who won't give you an NP animation skip button, and die with this useless Servant?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So that's why you trapped Bunyan in this Singularity.
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Obviously! The only Servants we need are beautiful female Saberfaces!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wrong!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You need to stop right there before you curse us.
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
There's no value in something without use.
Bunyan is... Well, she was a failure.

 
**Nameless Master:**
So, I wanted her to vanish into a secluded forest.
But noooo, you had to bring her all the way here...

 
**Nameless Master:**
What I want are ★5 Servants, or the one exception to that rule: my cutie, Astolfo.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Now that you've come this far, I'll have to eradicate Bunyan and all of you from this other world.

 
**Both:**
How horrible! Just horrible!
Bunyan's our friend!

 
**Bunyan:**
Master, I...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It'll be okay, Bunyan.
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Eh? What, are you thinking of fighting me?
Even though we're both Masters? Seriously?

 
**Nameless Master:**
It's all your fault. If you guys hadn't just waltzed out here, this worthless Servant would've disappeared!

 
**Edison:**
...I see.
You may be right...and yet!

 
**Edison:**
Paul Bunyan is right here before us!
We cannot turn a blind eye to that fact!

 
**Geronimo:**
...Agreed. Even if her lore was a joke in the early States,
I cannot ignore that she stands before me!

 
**Geronimo:**
The only thing that must disappear is you, Master from another world.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Eh? Are you seriously going to fight me?
Come on, take a joke! This is like...a tiny prank!

 
**Nameless Master:**
I mean, I also saved Humanity.
Don't I deserve Servants that I prefer and want?

 
**Mash:**
Shut up! This is a bad dream, Master that is not mine!

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, but this is part of our job!
We will destroy your evil ruse!

 
**Nameless Master:**
Oh-ho. Look who's acting all big, my little eggplant.
And you're so cool. Much more than usual.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Not that I'm unhappy about your change, but I'm not wild about this biting the hand that feeds you crap.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Fine. If you're going to defend Bunyan, I just have to fight you.

 
**Nameless Master:**
I'm afraid you know too much, and now...you must die.

 
**Nameless Master:**
It's your prim and proper party versus my poor but beautiful party.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Let's see which Chaldea reigns supreme!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nameless Master:**
Gwaaaaahhhh!!!
My C, B, AND A teeeeeeammms!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You've got plenty of ★5s!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why you...why you!!!
 

 
**Nameless Master:**
Oh. Well, yeah. Of course I have some ★5s.
I've been playing since launch!

 
**Nameless Master:**
And yet...all my cute, precious Servants...
You defeated them so easily...!

 
**Mash:**
Well... They were all so under leveled...

 
**Edison:**
Being lazy and failing to level your Servants has finally come back to bite you. Now be a good Master and go back to your own world!

 
**Nameless Master:**
But...! In this Singularity, I was able to Summon to my heart's content without using any Quartz...!

 
**Nameless Master:**
Ahhh, I'm awakening from my dream...
help me, Jack, Nursery...!

 
**Jack:**
We're not gonna help.
Cuz you're not our Mommy.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
You closed the book on your own.
So, it's the end for you now.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
The one promise you as a reader made with me, the story was to believe in me.

 
**Nameless Master:**
Nooo... I... I just wanted everyone to have a laugh!
And I wanted to do so many other lewd things...!

 
**Edison:**
Yep. Begone!

 
**Nameless Master:**
Gwaaaaaahhhh! Ah crap!
I let the truth spill out there at the last moment!

 
**Geronimo:**
Master.
You don't need to be sad about this.

 
**Geronimo:**
She was consumed by her evil ambitions.

 
**Geronimo:**
She was no longer human...or maybe she wasn't from the start? Anyway, she was not a good Master.

 
**Geronimo:**
We saved a soul who was swallowed up by an evil Spirit... That's how we should remember this.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-okay. Thank you, Geronimo.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess I'd better be careful myself.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
...Let's go home.
There's nothing left here.

 
**Bunyan:**
I'm hungry. I want to eat hamburg steak.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go home, Bunyan.
 

 
**Mash:**
Goodbye, other person who might have been another Senpai...

 
**Mash:**
I'll...try not to wonder too much why the other me wasn't here with you...

 
## Section 4: Freedom and Justice
 
**Mash:**
...I wonder how much time has passed...

 
**Mash:**
It feels like it was only yesterday...
Then again, it feels like ten years have passed.

 
**Mash:**
Ever since “that person” from the distant land was defeated, Bunyan expanded the city in a fervor.

 
**Mash:**
She chopped down trees, broke up mountains, and changed the course of the river. It was as if the city of Chicago was moving, like a living being.

 
**Mash:**
The people who gathered came from various places eventually grew to number in the hundreds of thousands, and in time created a megalopolis.

 
**Mash:**
Chicago's eastern end had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Iberian Peninsula, while the western end reached Japan's Nerima District.

 
**Mash:**
Master and I have been in this city the whole time.
I feel we've been enjoying our stay here.

 
**Mash:**
Except for Edison...who has been cooped up in a laboratory at the Japanese pavilion.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, Mash!
 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Where shall we go today? To India Town?
Or maybe to Little Italy?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm in the mood for curry.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pastaaaaaa! And gelato!
 

 
**Mash:**
Then let's do that!
We might as well enjoy our vacation with enthusiasm!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No point in getting impatient.
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes! We just need to be patient until Edison fixes the Spiritual World Communicator so we can get back in contact with Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
...Oh? Is that Geronimo heading our way?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou?

 
**Geronimo:**
Master, Mash! There you are!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
Edison's laboratory has exploded!!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What...the...heck...!?
 

 
**Mash:**
I-it's completely engulfed in flames!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Edison, where are you!?
 

 
**Jack:**
Master...?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Don't come over here...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jack, Nursery Rhyme!
 

 
**F：???:**
Edison's dead.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Altera...!?
 

 
**F：???:**
I am not Altera. I have borrowed her body, but I am not the one you know as Altera.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, this Altera...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know. This one's super serious.
 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
I am the goddess Columbia.
The guardian of this land.

 
**Mash:**
Columbia?

 
**Geronimo:**
A goddess who is a symbol for the United States.
She is related to the Roman goddess Libertas.

 
**Geronimo:**
Rather than being a deity for worship, she's more like a personification of the nation. Like Uncle Sam.

 
**Geronimo:**
Treating her as a goddess is actually quite insulting to indigenous people like me. I never imagined that I would actually see her in person...

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
I guard all those who live on this land.
Geronimo... You and I are of the same ilk.

 
**Geronimo:**
Great Spirit, I only pray that you are the same goddess who brought forth corn and great harvest.

 
**Mash:**
So why was Edison...

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
He...got too close to the truth.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Truth?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
Edison and I were investigating the truth behind this world and Bunyan...

 
**Geronimo:**
His Spiritual World Communicator opened up the door to this world, and the giant Spirit Bunyan is the core of this world. Am I correct?

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...Correct.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
If your theory has gotten you this far, I suppose there's no need to hide it any longer.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Have you not noticed? This place is not a Singularity that the other Master created.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
This world is Paul Bunyan's own consciousness.
It is similar to what you call a Reality Marble...

 
**Geronimo:**
Impossible. Paul Bunyan's Spirit Origin could not possibly maintain a Reality Marble of this caliber.

 
**Geronimo:**
Living beings exist in this world.
Sentient people are living day-by-day here.

 
**Geronimo:**
It's neither a dream nor illusion. This world is real. It exists. So you're saying it's a Reality Marble that can contain something of that sort?

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
You know perfectly well of just what could make that possible.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A Grail!
 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Which means that the nameless Master turned out to be a formidable Master, after all.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
That Master possessed a Grail.
And mixing it with udon dough...created Bunyan.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
The Third Magic that can grant any wish...
That Master did not understand the meaning of it at all.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
The Grail's wish was distorted by the udon dough, which is how Bunyan manifested.

 
**Geronimo:**
So you're saying...that this unnatural world itself is Bunyan's inner world?

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Correct, Medicine Man...wise one.
It is the memory of the States.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Because it's a memory, it was warped into something ideal, into a mere fleeting dream.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
That other Master meant to seal Bunyan in here.
But the opposite happened. It brought her here as well.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Bunyan possesses an infinite potential for destruction and creation. It's potential the United States as a nation has in itself.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Thus, Bunyan will continue to shape and develop this world... And once it reaches its limit, all will be destroyed.

 
**Mash:**
Is that why that Master took away her axe?

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Correct. Though it was a futile effort.
This loop is already at its 12,520th cycle.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
And now that you have given Bunyan an axe, the cycle of creation and destruction has resumed.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
And Bunyan has seen outside this world. She has seen your Chaldea through that Spirit World Communicator.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No... That can't be...
 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Yes. At this rate, Bunyan's world will begin to encroach upon your world as well.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
The humanity that you all worked hard to restore will tolerate even a fabricated Heroic Spirit like Bunyan.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
And as such, some manner of chaos must ensue.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now you mention it, everyone was going bonkers...
 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Exactly.
Do you understand now, Master of Chaldea?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now you mention it,everyone beside me was going bonkers...
 
**Mash:**
Um... I hate to tell you this...but you were no exception, Senpai...

 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Thus, you must live here as part of Bunyan's world forever. Just like that other Master.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The hell I am! This isn't the fate I signed up for!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm going to free Mash, the others, AND Bunyan!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...I see. I knew you would say that, Master of Chaldea... Strong one.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Then I have no choice. I must destroy you, then remake you to incorporate you all into this world.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
I must maintain balance in the multiverse. For nine people to be happy, one must always be sacrificed!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even still!
 

 
**Mash:**
We will never give up, no matter what!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Ungh... I cannot believe how strong you are!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
You fought valiantly even against my true self...
The me not veiled by history's memories!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...But I must still seal Bunyan away!
She is...too dangerous!

 
**Bunyan:**
Dangerous? I'm dangerous?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bunyan!
 
**Bunyan:**
I'm too big. That's why I can't live in a city.
That's why I wanted to expand and make the city bigger.

 
**Bunyan:**
I thought there would be somewhere I would belong as long as I searched for it. That's why I created, created, and created...

 
**Bunyan:**
But...that was all for...nothing?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Bunyan! That's not
 
**Bunyan:**
I get it. I'm just something added on to this world. An extra. Just a piece of parsley put on a plate of hamburg steak as garnish...

 
**Bunyan:**
That's why...

 
**Bunyan:**
I'm going to end all this.

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...The world...!?
 

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
Hnnng...where are we?

 
**Geronimo:**
...We are probably in Bunyan's inner world.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Weren't we already in her inner world?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
The area before was just her consciousness on the surface. But now we are deep in her unconscious. This is a realm even I cannot fathom.

 
**Geronimo:**
This is a world so deep in her heart, that only a tremendously knowledgeable mage, an experienced spirit-tamer, and the guidance of the Spirits could help you reach such a place.

 
**Geronimo:**
Were you to be swallowed by such darkness, no mere layman could help you escape.

 
**Geronimo:**
Master, Mash, I mean no offense, but do not leave my side.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.
 

 
**???:**
Kyaaah!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's Nursery Rhyme!
 

 
**Monster:**
Grrrrrrrrrrrr!

 
**Jack:**
...! No...don't...kill...my friend...!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Jack! Stand back, Jack! You're still a child!
I don't want you hurt just for my sake!

 
**Jack:**
You're my friend.
You. And Bunyan.

 
**Jack:**
...That's why...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...That's enough!
 

 
**Jack:**
Fujimaru...!
You came for us.

 
**Geronimo:**
Wendigo...! I get it now.
Those Spirits were being created within Bunyan!

 
**Mash:**
Let's do it, Master!
First, let's protect those two!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Waaah! Thank you, everyone!
You saved us!

 
**Jack:**
That was a close call.
Whitechapel flashed before our eyes.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
No, Jack.
Remember, your Mommy is not there.

 
**Jack:**
...Yeah, you're right.

 
**Jack:**
Let's go look for Bunyan.
She must be around.

 
**Geronimo:**
She should be, yes. Let's go!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Jack:**
Take this!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
And THAT!

 
**Mash:**
One hundred... Two hundred...!
The wendigos just keep multiplying!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't tell me they're residents of Chicago...!?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
If they are, we'll be up against more than a million of them!

 
**Mash:**
The fear and sadness within Bunyan have turned them all into monsters, and they're gathering here.

 
**Geronimo:**
Master, I'm going to fully unleash my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Geronimo:**
I will open up a path. Then run.
Don't hesitate, and don't turn back.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're not...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A...suicide attack!?
 

 
**Geronimo:**
In the end, Heroic Spirits are simply familiars.
Mages should not hesitate. Soldiers should not fear.

 
**Geronimo:**
Let's go!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Waitwaitwait&ndash;
 

 
**???:**
Yes, exactly! Hold that thought, Geronimo!
Your actions are ungentlemanly.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That voice...!
 

 
**Mash:**
Edison!

 
**Edison:**
Haven't you heard of the phrase:
a genius strikes when you least expect it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Edison!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I so expected it!
 

 
**Edison:**
Self-sacrifice is indeed a noble thing to do.
It's much like Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

 
**Edison:**
But he would also say something like this: a true gentleman's triumph would be to come back from the dead to rejoin the group!

 
**Edison:**
A hero does not become so by dying, but by pursuing their hopes and dreams till the very end!

 
**Geronimo:**
...You never cease to surprise me. Despite your clownish face, you always have a resolve for truth...guide of the lion Spirit.

 
**Edison:**
I'd rather be called the incarnation of the thunderous lion!

 
**Edison:**
I was merely playing dead, a truly ungentlemanly thing to do, for this very opportunity!

 
**Edison:**
And all the better with all the monsters now gathered here! Allow me to show you my Noble Phantasm!

 
**Edison:**
The brilliance of my light shall erase all ignorance, and free those trapped in the prison of imbecility!

 
**Edison:**
Illuminate the girl's darkened heart!

 
**Edison:**
WFD: World Faith Domination!
ANNIVERSARY EDITION!

 
**Civilian:**
Huh...? Where am I?
Why am I in a place like this?

 
**Civilian:**
What the...? I thought I was at a Cubs game.
Why the heck am I here?

 
**Civilian:**
Aw, crap, I'm late for the handoff.
I don't know what the boss will say if I mess this up!

 
**Mash:**
The Wendigos are turning back to people!
And the city...!

 
**Edison:**
Precisely! My Noble Phantasm strips away all things mysterious, and exposes all hidden truths!

 
**Edison:**
The scene of this peaceful city is precisely the truth that Bunyan pursued.

 
**Edison:**
I will use my WFD™ to continue to keep things this way.

 
**Edison:**
Go, Master! Bunyan should be at the edge of the city!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it, Edison!
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you've come, Columbia!
 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
She has awoken from her dream.
Bunyan can never return to her endless loop.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Cooperate with me. Seize Bunyan's Grail, and destroy it before she is given status as a Heroic Spirit in the Throne of Heroes.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
She is merely a being from folklore unworthy to be a Heroic Spirit. Destroying her should be possible.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't let you do that!
 

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's right! Once a story's been told, it's real! Nobody can say it didn't happen... Not even the original author can do that!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's the rule of storytelling. It's an absolute rule that can't be broken. Why? Because here there are people who also believe in us.

 
**Geronimo:**
I cannot accept a world where minorities are trampled upon.

 
**Jack:**
We're going to be here. Even if we can't be with Mommy, we're going to stay. With Master.

 
**Mash:**
Please...
Let's think of a way to save Bunyan!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...I understand. But I am also a fabricated goddess...a divinity who resides within the hearts of those who yearn for freedom and equality.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Even if it be an audacious wish, or an impossible fabrication...I shall manifest such an illusion!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
In order to let ten million people live, I will kill one! The greatest good for the greatest number... That is the truth that I cling to!

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
I, the Goddess Columbia...in the name of freedom...shall make you change your mind!

 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...So you would even defy a goddess to achieve your aims. I see. That is a kind of freedom, too.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's all about that DIY.
 

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
I suppose.
Your destiny is yours alone.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
Go. Bunyan is deep in the forest.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
...It may not be my place to say... But I have been watching over her since the beginning.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
She was always crying.
But then you all became her very first friends.

 
**Goddess Columbia:**
If instead of just watching over her, I had&ndash;If only&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, everyone.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go save Bunyan.
 

 
**Mash:**
Right!

 
## Section 5: Civilization
 
**Narration:**
I keep chopping down trees.

 
**Narration:**
Chop, chop, and chop them down to make them into lumber, and ship them out.

 
**Narration:**
Make houses with lumber, pave the roads, and a village is made. The village turns into a town, and the town turns into a city.

 
**Narration:**
I repeat it over and over. Make one hundred oil fields...one thousand mines. Develop! Grow! Expand!

 
**Narration:**
But then people always yell at me:
“It's all your fault that everything got destroyed!”

 
**Narration:**
If it wasn't for you, the world would have stayed beautiful!

 
**Narration:**
Why is that?
I just want people to smile.

 
**Narration:**
For the babies who die before being born...the elderly who shiver in the cold...farmers who suffer from famine...workers who cry from loneliness...

 
**Narration:**
I wanted to save all humans...help everyone.
That was why I swung my axe and expanded the world.

 
**Narration:**
Why am I always unwanted?
Why am I always treated like parsley?

 
**Narration:**
Oh. I get it.

 
**Narration:**
The thing that I needed to destroy...was me.
Because I have a heart, I hurt others.

 
**Narration:**
Then I'll become a mechanical system. A bronze system. A system that will grant everyone's wish.

 
**Narration:**
Because that's probably what everyone wants!!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're...totally...wrong!
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Wha...!?
Why is everyone here!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We all want to be with you.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We love you, Paul Bunyan.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
But...didn't you hear?
I destroy everything that I love.

 
**Bunyan:**
My hands are too big...and my wish is too grand.
I always hurt someone.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It doesn't matter!
 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if you destroy everything in front of you...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Seize your own life!
 

 
**Jack:**
We all belong here.
No matter what or how we were born, we are here.

 
**Mash:**
Even me...a Demi-Servant, the fusion of a human and a Servant.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Even me...who was given a name even though my story has no name.

 
**Jack:**
Even us...who were born from the children that...weren't.

 
**Geronimo:**
...And even this hero who soaked his hands in blood and stewed himself in revenge...who lived shamefully during the last years of his life.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We all belong.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're all family now.
 

 
**Bunyan:**
Master...I...

 
**Bunyan:**
I want to go home!

 
**Bunyan:**
I want to eat hamburg steak!
I'll even eat all the parsley! So please&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me! I'm your Master!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If the Grail is holding you down, I'll drag you out!
 

 
**Mash:**
Right! Mash Kyrielight, set to engage!
We'll drag our friend out of the Grail's udon dough!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
It's no use...
But we're so close...!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bunyan won't stop growing!
 

 
**Jack:**
Hey... Our body...!

 
**Geronimo:**
I get it...as Bunyan continues to expand the world and grow even more, she loses the ability to sense us!

 
**Mash:**
Just like how we don't see the germs on our bodies...

 
**Geronimo:**
And in this world, anything that isn't sensed doesn't exist! Master, at this rate&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just...need to get the Grail...!
 

 
**F：???:**
...I was simply going to observe, but if the opponent is lamenting over her own size, then I cannot stand here and be quiet about it.

 
**F：???:**
...I shall aid you, Master of Chaldea.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Altera!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Erm... Who are you today?
 

 
**Altera:**
I am Altera. No more, no less.
But I am not the Altera you are familiar with.

 
**Altera:**
...But I have heard your voice.
Your plea to try to save that girl.

 
**Altera:**
Driving that girl into a corner is bad civilization.
It cannot possibly be good civilization.

 
**Altera:**
Even if this cold world demands the sacrifice of one to allow one billion to live...

 
**Altera:**
Even if continuous development is a direct attack on the old world, and a more dangerous option awaits you somewhere in your future...

 
**Altera:**
The mere act of continuing to resist in itself should be great civilization!

 
**Altera:**
Take my hand, Master of Chaldea! We shall form a contract, temporarily sharing magical energy!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it! Mash, support me!
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes! My Noble Phantasm will continue to recognize Senpai's presence until the very last minute!

 
**Altera:**
Contact, confirmed.
Mars Effect...overkill.

 
**Altera:**
...Crest of the Star...revival.
You are not the only one who is a great giant deity.

 
**Altera:**
The time to awaken has come...dream of pioneers! Teardrop Photon Ray!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that the Grail!?

 
## Epilogue: Master Returns to the Cafeteria
 
**Mash:**
Senpai... Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Senpai, please wake up.
Something terrible has happened!

 
**Fou:**
Foufooou, fofofoufooou!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey! Morning, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, good morning!
I-I mean...! It's utter chaos!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This feels somehow familiar.
 
**Mash:**
Please don't say that!

 
**Mash:**
Andersen says that people are actors on a foolish stage called redundancy, and people are still able to progress even within that mindless cycle!

 

 
**Mash:**
Just please come to the cafeteria!

 
**Emiya:**
I...I didn't think it would end this way!
Sous-chef! What's the status of our food supply!?

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
We don't even have a sprinkle of cheese left! We're out of emergency rations, and my cat cans are in danger of getting used!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
But I have some rice seeds I secretly stashed away. These seeds are meant to be used for the future, so now's the right time to go ahead and cook them!

 
**Emiya:**
...We have no choice.
Quick, cook those rice seeds.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Seriously!? Talk about hard-boiled!
But this cat can't stomach serving bad food!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I'm gonna try my darndest to make it an appetizing rice dish! Maybe mix in some corn or saffron.

 
**Bunyan:**
Corn! I can make a ton!
Leave it to me!

 
**Bunyan:**
Oh...but the corn I usually make is for making oil...and that's not edible...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that...Bunyan!?
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's Bunyan!

 
**Mash:**
When you Rayshifted back, she came to Chaldea along with you!

 
**Mash:**
The Grail that created her was destroyed, and it lost its power as a Grail...

 
**Mash:**
But it appears that Bunyan was registered to the Throne of Heroes as a Servant in exchange!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see... Guess we couldn't do anything about it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Grail... Well, I'm sure we'll find others...
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes. It's a shame about the Grail, but the Singularity has disappeared, and Chaldea gained a new friend.

 
**Mash:**
This is probably the best way it could've ended.
That's why Emiya is entertaining her with food.

 
**Mash:**
To celebrate our anniversary&ndash;I mean, a new Heroic Spirit.

 
**Bunyan:**
Is the food ready yet?
I want to eat hamburg steak!

 
**Emiya:**
Wait. We're preparing it. Honestly...she ate an entire day's worth of food for the whole staff of Chaldea...

 
**Emiya:**
This... I sense a new gluttonous character rising! SOMEBODY will need to step up her game to keep up!

 
**Bunyan:**
Oh! Hey there, Master!

 
**Bunyan:**
Let's eat together!

 
**Jack:**
Eat! Eat!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Tee hee. Eating together makes food even more delicious.

 
**Edison:**
Hm. Inspiration begins with breakfast. That's why every household needs an Edison brand toaster!

 
**Geronimo:**
By sharing a meal, we all grow closer.
You need nothing more than that.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Here! One hamburg steak! Don't hound me about what went into it! It's...probably good for you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks for the meal!
 

 
**Andersen:**
...And so...

 
**Andersen:**
The annual farce reached its climax in typical fashion.

 
**Andersen:**
That other world will continue to live within Bunyan's heart.

 
**Andersen:**
Bunyan will continue to “live” here in Chaldea, all the while carrying her loneliness...

 
**Andersen:**
Her existence is different from ours...we who bear the records of the dead. Yet she is also not a living being.

 
**Andersen:**
An unusual, even bizarre girl... I suppose at least one of them can exist in Chaldea.

 
**Andersen:**
After all...urban legends, Demi-Servants, phantoms, and AI are all possibilities here.

 
**Andersen:**
While humanity is still unstable, all “what-ifs” are accepted and used. That's what Chaldea is.

 
**Andersen:**
The ultimate defense for this world...staffed by a chaotic rabble...and a Master named Fujimaru.

 
**Andersen:**
How will this story unfold?
I'll just keep an eye on this interesting tale.

 
**Bunyan:**
Thank you Master...! I may be the parsley of Heroic Spirits, but don't leave me on the plate, okay?

 
## Prologue: Master Heads to the Cafeteria
 
**Voice:**
They say truth is stranger than fiction.

 
**Voice:**
After all... The world we live in is just a construct of our own senses.

 
**Voice:**
And so we live in this unending mummer's farce, clinging to the delusion of hope.

 
**Voice:**
That is, if we Heroic Spirits, who are no more than the shadows of the deceased, could be said to “live.”

 
**Voice:**
Truth put to paper is merely a story, and experience itself is no more than a narrative constantly being revised within one's mind.

 
**Voice:**
To borrow Shakespeare's words, “All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players.”

 
**Andersen:**
Yes. We establish our own existence, all of it based upon the decisions we make on this stage!

 
**Mash:**
U-um, Andersen!?
What are you blabbing about?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did something happen, mister author?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's up, professor kid?
 
**Andersen:**
Who are you calling “professor kid”!? How dare you characterize me so simply and shallowly!?

 
**Andersen:**
Defining a character solely by their appearance is the first step in hack writing! Come on! Think!

 
**Andersen:**
Ugh, postmodernists. Honestly...

 
**Mash:**
But Andersen, you're the one wearing a lab&ndash;Well...never mind.

 

 
**Andersen:**
Never mind. Pour me a cup of coffee.
Hot and strong. One drop of milk.

 
**Andersen:**
... (Sigh) I knew there were worse places I could be.
At least I won't get roped into any of the folly.

 
**Andersen:**
So I'm going to borrow your bed now.

 
**Andersen:**
I haven't had a good night's rest lately. Count yourself lucky I'm gracing your crap bed with my slumbering presence.

 
**Mash:**
Not rested...?
Why, Andersen...?

 
**Andersen:**
Hmph. I won't waste my time explaining.
You'll see just as soon as you step outside. (Yawn)

 
**Mash:**
Hm...did you hear that, Senpai?
Andersen's fast asleep.

 
**Mash:**
What should we do?
Shall we go out to the halls?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's almost time to go to the cafeteria anyway...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have a bad feeling about this...
 

 
**Emiya:**
Hey, quiet! Quiet! And you call yourselves Heroic Spirits! Make a nice single file line!

 
**Mash:**
Oh my... What a huge crowd! It seems like every Servant here is crowded into the cafeteria!

 
**Mash:**
Let's line up too, Master. After all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

 
**Emiya:**
Hey. Morning, Master. Hurry up and order.
You're holding up the line.

 
**Emiya:**
I fully opened up the cafeteria because we've gotten more Heroic Spirits, and shocking no one, the turnout is so huge I'd need a small army to handle it.

 
**Mash:**
S-sorry! I'd like crab fried rice and soup, please!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Sautéed pork chops, crispy with slices of apples, if you please.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, and of course, a tomato and herring omelet on the side. A bit runny if you would, my good man.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, and do leave out the parsley.
I'm afraid I am not a parsley man, if I must be honest.

 
**Mash:**
That's not good, Mr. Shakespeare.
You need to eat your veggies.

 
**Emiya:**
...Another complicated dish...
Fine. Got it. Master, what about you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Warm hot pot.
 
**Emiya:**
Wh-what a crazy order in the blazing summer heat.

 
**Emiya:**
I suppose there's no seasons here. Got it. Hot pot, right? I have some frozen cod around here somewhere...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Saumon en Papillote, s'il vous plaît.
 
**Emiya:**
That's not a balanced meal.
I'll add a bowl of rice and salad. Got it?

 

 
**Emiya:**
You hear that, sous-chef!?
I'm taking care of Master and Mash's orders!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Yep! An order of oily grains with two dumbo ears coming right up! A meal fit for a mastermind playwright!

 
**Shakespeare:**
What!? I must be tired from all my play writing. All I see in front of me is a mound of rice and potstickers!

 
**Spartacus:**
Being chatty in line can be its own oppression!
You are all approaching TYRANNY!

 
**All Three:**
(Staaaaaare)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry sorry sorry...!
 

 
**Altria (Alter):**
I wish to order only two things:
Spam, spam, and spam! Ah, wait, that is three...

 
**Eric:**
Spam, spam, Spaaaaaam!!!

 
**Gawain:**
And chips!!!

 
**Altria (Alter):**
Come now, hurry up, Archer!
Give it all you got!

 
**Emiya:**
Opening up a can of spam hardly requires everything I've got... What a bunch of savages!

 
**Mash:**
...Whew. Thank you for the meal.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mmm-mmm, good!
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, that was delicious, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
By the way, have you noticed anything odd?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Everyone looks so excited today.
 
**Mash:**
Yes...
Was it always so chaotic here?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong, my little eggplant?
 
**Mash:**
H-huh? Wh-wh-wh-what do you mean “little eggplant”!?

 
**Mash:**
That's not what I am talking about! Don't you think everyone's strangely excited about something!?

 
**Mash:**
I think it's utter chaos.
I can't put my finger on it, but something's different...

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're right. Things do feel different.
 
**Mash:**
Yes.
Somewhere, somehow...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think it's a sign that things are peaceful.
 
**Mash:**
That's...true.
And humanity has been restored...

 

 
**Operator:**
Command Room to all staff. Emergency.
All staff to your designated positions...

 
**Operator:**
Repeat. Command Room to all staff...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go! To the Command Room!
 

 
**Operator:**
Contact with unmanned observatory stations five, eight, and fifteen lost. They're not accepting our commands!

 
**Operator:**
We've also lost contact with the thirty-sixth weather station! Status: unknown!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm. I don't see anything going on with our outside feeds. Any other abnormalities?

 
**Operator:**
No irregularities in the atmosphere.
But all the staff who are at the scene are all...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Are all, what?

 
**Operator:**
They're all terrible, lazy, and just...worthless! They say they don't want to work, or just want to sleep!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Huh? I think that all the time!
Wait...does that mean I'm worthless, too...?

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, no, that's not possible. Even if I were, I'm a genius before I'm worthless. Bullet dodged!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, recovering the staff we've lost contact with is our first priority.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll handle the analysis.

 
**Edison:**
I shall assist, as I have been doing so since last night! Miss Da Vinci, we have results in from Sheba!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Thanks, Edison.
Now let's see here...hrrrng!?

 
**Edison:**
What is it, Miss Da Vinci?
Do you see something you recognize in the data?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm... Maybe. Although the signature doesn't match Guda Guda Particles or Magical Girls...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Aaanyway, it looks like there's another Chaldea meddling with our Chaldea!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry we're late!
 

 
**Mash:**
What's the situation!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Thirty-two minutes ago, while experimenting with Edison's Spiritual World Communicator, the observation assembly detected an abnormality.

 
**Edison:**
We initially thought it was something to do with the Spiritual World Communicator. But it looks like there's a lot more than that going on here.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't tell me it's a Singularity...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
SKIP! It's an event, right? Gimme materials!
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai!?
Senpai is acting strange!

 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci, is this another Singularity!?

 

 
**Da Vinci:**
Yep. It's a Singularity.
That's why I had Edison help me out.

 
**Da Vinci:**
There's a region in North America that we can't observe with Chaldeas right now. That's why Edison and I were looking into it.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Doing that has made us vulnerable, so someone took the opportunity to invade our world! And now we need to get out there and see what's going on!

 
**Da Vinci:**
So there you have it, Fujimaru.
Ready to Rayshift?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll roll that prize roulette until my finger snaps off!
 
**Da Vinci:**
Um, sorry to break it to you, but there's no prize roulette this time around.

 
**Mash:**
Oh no! You killed Senpai!
S-Senpai, please get up!

 
**Mash:**
...Eh? An NP animation skip button?
I don't think...that's in the game either...

 

 
**Edison:**
Hm... I see. I get it.

 
**Da Vinci:**
What? Did you figure something out, Edison?

 
**Edison:**
Haven't you noticed? Fujimaru has been acting and talking strange.

 
**Edison:**
No, it's not just [♂ him /♀ her].
Everyone in Chaldea has been acting strange.

 
**Mash:**
You're right...Andersen suddenly started speaking in bad poetry, and the other Servants suddenly started to have Altria-level appetites...

 
**Edison:**
Hm. This is just a hypothesis, but it is possible that my Spiritual World Communicator contacting a Singularity like this...

 
**Edison:**
...has resulted in everyone's deteriorating mental and intellectual states!

**Fujimaru 1:**
I dunno what that means but I like the way it sounds!
 

 
**Mash:**
What? No, Senpai!
That sounds bad. Really bad!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Right. It's not about stringing together important-sounding words.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe everyone's acting highbrow because it's so peaceful here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I do sometimes get an urge to run around naked. Even Andersen is said to run around naked in elation when he finishes a manuscript.

 
**Mash:**
(Absolutely did not need to know that.)

 
**Edison:**
Well, I can't really deny that. It is worth noting, though, that things that threaten humanity may not always appear stylish, or even intelligent.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Preach, Edison.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I might turn into a silly version of myself and chew up Chaldea.
 

 
**Edison:**
Exactly.

 
**Mash:**
What a bizarre conversation...

 
**Edison:**
And now we have discovered a Singularity! The only way, then, to investigate my theory is to apply the proper scientific methodologies!

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Yeah, can't argue with you there.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Then, as acting commanding officer for Chaldea, I am officially issuing a new Order!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Get to that Singularity, investigate, and resolve it!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood, roger that!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yahoo! Woo-hoo!
 

 
**Mash:**
There's something really wrong with Senpai!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Mash! Don't think. Feel!
Commence Rayshift!

**Altria Alter:**
We broke through the wall.
It's finally time for our meet-up.

 
**Nero:**
Umu, you can go out first.
The light is hurting my eyes.

 
**Altria Alter:**
Mission complete.
We need a new spoon.

 
**Nero:**
Give me a break. Shouldn't we at least have smuggled in a shovel?

 
**Nero:**
Ah, I see light!
We managed to get by again!

 
**Altria Alter:**
...Hm? Sorry, I fell asleep.
Even maids need rest.

**Edison:**
Such an outcome is only to be expected when the three of us combine our powers, but being called the number one hole digger is not something to be happy about!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Heh heh...a mole...a mole-lion...

 
**Helena:**
Cut it out! Don't tease him.
Besides, being the best at digging is wonderful.

 
**Helena:**
Eh? Does that mean we dug the most?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Say what...? It's true that I was serious, but I never expected this outcome...

 
**Edison:**
So this is the true power of DC...or at least a part of it... Wonderful...just wonderful, is it not...?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
WHAT???

 
**Helena:**
Yes, yes, don't get all testy over the little stuff. Let's just be happy about our accomplishment! Yay!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Y-yes. Good work!

 
**Helena:**
I'm beat!
We dug a lot, so let's take a break!

 
**Edison:**
I agree... Zzzzz...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Even geniuses need rest... Zzzzz...

 
**Helena:**
Oh my... They both fell asleep standing up.
Teehee... Even big as they are, they're like children.

**Professor M:**
Crawling through the sewer pipes is quite romantic for us villains.

 
**Fran:**
W-we're no villains!
The only villain around here is Papa!

 
**Professor M:**
That's why I said this: “Behold, this grand physique! It is like tempered steel!” Yes, indeed, that is what I said!

 
**Babbage:**
Wait. Where are you going with that?

 
**Professor M:**
Have you not heard the phrase
“Stay tuned for the next episode”?

 
**Fran:**
Rrrrrrrr...
Get back to work, you two!

 
**Professor M:**
Owww! My back, my back! It made a sound backs should not make! Miss Fran, would you mind bending me back into shape?

 
**Fran:**
Okay, Papa!

 
**Babbage:**
Dodgey professor, asking her to realign your back with her weapon is extremely dangerous.

**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
First place?
First place in what?

 
**Sanzang:**
What was it...? Oh, right, prison breaking...
 I think it's about the outcome of the prison break!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh my...
Right then! We need to escape, and quickly!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Keep going!

 
**Sanzang:**
(Sigh) I'm beyond tired. I don't mind physical activity,
but it's such a downer when I can't see the sunshine.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
I would agree.
However, escaping is our current priority.

 
**Sanzang:**
We should be fine. We have the blessings of the Buddha. We will definitely get out!  Because we didn't do anything wrong! ...We haven't, right?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Of course not.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Wehave been busily digging. It is quite the deep exercise. I am learning a great deal.

 
**Sanzang:**
Digging...quite deep...?
Hmm, did you just make a pun...?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
N-no. Absolutely not!
I would never do such a thing!!!

**Oda Nobunaga:**
Ah yes, now I am one step closer to getting out of here. It's only a matter of time until I become the Demon King of the Prison Break Heaven!

 
**Mysterious Racer X:**
Prison Break Heaven... Heaven, you say?
Like heavenly food...angel food cake...mmm...

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
I may be locked up, but no lock can stop the rock! Oh,
don't forget to give us supplies when you come visit.

 
**Mysterious Racer X:**
I demand sweets!  The food here freakin' sucks!

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Huh, maybe we should forget about escaping, and just take the place over? I'll be Warden Nobbu.

 
**Mysterious Racer X:**
Then I shall be Mysterious Executioner X.

 
**Oda Nobunaga:**
Not much of a difference than now, is there!?

**Nitocris:**
Shine forth, light! Sure we can call this the new dawn  for the just and true age of the pharaoh!

 
**Caster of Storytelling:**
The light of dawn...
Indeed, seeing it always gives me a sense of relief.

 
**Nitocris:**
Digging and burying are basically the same thing. I am the incarnation of the god of the underworld and the master of burial! I could not possibly lose at this!

 
**Caster of Storytelling:**
Cave-ins, lack of oxygen, flooding underground...
We were fortunate not to be literally buried...

 
**Nitocris:**
(Gasp) ...! I was so intent on listening to your stories, I didn't realize we managed to dig through! We did great, didn't we!?

 
**Caster of Storytelling:**
I am humbled to receive such praise.
Then we shall revisit the story another time...

 
**Nitocris:**
(It's wonderful that we lost track of time, but it's bad to be so wrapped up in what comes next, right?)

 
**Nitocris:**
(I wonder how that story ends...?)
