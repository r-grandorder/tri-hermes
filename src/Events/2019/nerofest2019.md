# Nerofest Autumn 2019
 
## Return of Nero Fest - Autumn 2019 (First Half)
 
**Nero:**
Ah-hem!

 
**Nero:**
Uh...uh... Testing, testing.
Okay, everything's fine. All right, here we go.

 
**Nero:**
A festival is...

 
**Nero:**
A party that brings joy to all people,
no matter where or when they are from.

 
**Nero:**
It is no exaggeration to call this festival I host famed throughout both Rome and Chaldea!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She started her speech already!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hear, hear!
 

 
**Nero:**
Umu. Thanks for your cheers. My audience truly knows how to behave the third time around!

 
**Nero:**
And that makes introductions unnecessary.
Let's get down to business!

 
**Nero:**
I will leave nitpicking about the definition of a festival to the more cultured Servants.

 
**Nero:**
My glorious Nero Fest, a festival only possible through the cooperation of Rome and Chaldea!

 
**Nero:**
Now it begins again!

 
**Nero:**
Surely many Heroic Spirits look forward to this martial tournament set in this great Colosseum.

 
**Nero:**
A festival of power, modeled after the festival of Olympia! Attendees will praise the warriors' courage!

 
**Nero:**
Honed physiques and unparalleled skills in fierce competition! What could be more beautiful, more noble!?

 
**Nero:**
As people love to admire a blooming rose, so too do they enjoy seeing a human being reach their very limit!

 
**Nero:**
And that is itself my Rome...the festival of Olympia!

 
**E：Crowd:**
Rome! Rome! Rome!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rome!
 
**Nero:**
Umu! All of humanity is indeed Rome!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All hail the Emperor!
 
**Nero:**
Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.

 

 
**Nero:**
But, as emperor, I shall permit it!
Enjoy this glorious festival!

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Hola, ¿cómo estás? I heard that there's going to be Lucha Libre at the Arena México, yes!?

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Hehehe, I cannot wait, no!
This will be the perfect time to test out my new plancha!

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Master, my cute [♂ hermanito /♀ hermanita].
Why not participate as a [♂ luchadore /♀ luchadora]?

 
**Beowulf:**
Haha. Not a bad idea!
Training Master once in a while wouldn't hurt!

 
**Beowulf:**
...Hey, I'm only kidding.
Don't look at me like that, Master.

 
**Beowulf:**
Only those who truly WANT to slug it out should participate. Like me or this tall lady here.

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Hnnn, no, no. You make it sound so barbaric, yes.
Lucha is a clash of honed out skills.

 
**Beowulf:**
Ah, you got me there. Well, you know, there's all kindsa ways to say the same thing.

 
**Beowulf:**
There are some punches used in Lucha Libre, right? They call it, uh, “golpe,” or “patada,” or something?

 
**Beowulf:**
Besides, this is all between Servants!
Even if I really cut loose, nothing bad would happen!

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
...Ay yi yi.

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
You have yet to understand the true essence of Lucha.
I shall demonstrate it for you myself, yes!  
 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
It's finally time for the long-awaited Servant Lucha Libre tournament. The sacred site for Lucha, the Arena México, has been rented out.

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
This is the perfect chance to spread the wonderful word of Lucha to everyone!

 
**Fergus:**
Lucha, eh? From what I hear, the flow of the match is predetermined, and the proper protocol is to take whatever move comes head on.

 
**Fergus:**
Truly it would take a steely spirit that relies on sheer trust of your opponent. Uh, but you know, Quetzalcoatl...

 
**Fergus:**
If you have the battle go by your own bare-knuckle rules, none of the Good-aligned Heroic Spirits would be a match against you.

 
**Fergus:**
Besides, this isn't a Lucha tournament,
and this isn't the Arena México.

 
**Fergus:**
And...the Colosseum is not in Mexico City.

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Qué!?!?!?

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Lalalala! Not listening!
Fergus, you meanie, yes!

 
**Beowulf:**
You bastard! I was just going along with what the goddess was saying, then you sweep in to ruin it all! You're spoiling all the fun!

 
**Beowulf:**
We're gonna end up slugging it out with our bare hands anyway, so might as well call it Lucha, jackass!

 
**Fergus:**
You say that... And I suppose it is only right for a warrior to answer the call of Lucha.

 
**Fergus:**
Lamentably, I am no more than an amateur when it comes to Lucha. The only finishing hold I know is Tirabuzón.

 
**Beowulf:**
Tirabuzón, the Cobra Twist!?
Old man, you're totally a Lucha enthusiast!

 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha!!!
Miss Quetzal has challenged me a few times already!

 
**Fergus:**
Many times, in truth!

 
**Beowulf:**
Oh come now, tell the truth. When you say she's challenged you, what you really mean is that you practiced Lucha in the simulator.

 
**Fergus:**
Ah yes. In the simulator room with nobody around at night...a Lucha Libre in the dark!

 
**Beowulf:**
Shut up!

 
**Fergus:**
Three matches in just one hour!

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
Ah-ha! I knew it, yes! I hear true Lucha matches do happen mostly at night, yes!

 
**Quetzalcoatl:**
So during the day...the Roman Pankration! And at night...a carnival of Lucha where the air is filled with bulging muscles flying about!

 
**Beowulf:**
Uh, that's not what I meant...
Damn, you're just making things even worse, old man!

 
**Fran:**
Uuuurrrr...

 
**Fran:**
Try...best...
(Makes fist)

 
**Babbage:**
Wonderful, my dear! What intensity you have. Your passion and heat are like a steam engine on the verge of critical pressure.

 
**Babbage:**
And so I have no choice but to aid you in your efforts. That's right...consider it a continuation of the dream we both shared this summer.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Hmmm, it would seem you've beaten me to the punch.
I do, however, share your sentiments, Babbage.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
My lovely daughter is so very excited. As her papa, I could do no less than to aid her in her quest for victory with all my strength!

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Yes...that is the duty of a proper papa!

 
**Fran:**
(Stare)

 
**Fran:**
Nnnngh... Nnnnnggghhh...

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
...Yes, of course, my lovely daughter.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
I shall, using every conceivable means, with every imaginable trap, employing every possible act of villainy, dispose of all your competition!

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
I had meant to relax awhile, but perhaps this is a good time to truly apply myself.

 
**Fran:**
Uuuuuurrr!

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Ah, yes, quite right. No cheating, of course! As such, papa will fire his magical bullets from the front line!

 
**Babbage:**
Steam power at full throttle, steam power at full throttle. We shall aid the daughter of Victor on her path to glorious and dazzling victory!

 
**Mordred:**
...C'mon. You call yourself an Assassin?
Shouldn't you be good at spying and scouting?

 
**Mordred:**
Why is finding some missing people taking so long!? You should be able to pick out which ones are NPCs and which ones are Servants!

 
**Jekyll:**
S-sorry.
I...actually don't have skills for that sort of thing...

 
**Jekyll:**
The best I can do is to conceal myself within a crowd.

 
**Mordred:**
You lack PRESENCE!
Just hurry up and find Fran, you shut-in.

 
**Mordred:**
I've got this sinking feeling&ndash;err, well actually,
I have a feeling something exciting's about to happen.

 
**Jekyll:**
Yes, yes.  Strange. She was with me just a minute ago.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
...There's some kind of commotion.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
I heard something regarding a festival of combat prowess, but that it was intended solely for amusement. I see no point in participating in such a thing.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
What point or purpose is there in such restraint?
What I yearn for is true and earnest combat.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
That is all.
There was no purpose in summoning me here, Caligula.

 
**Caligula:**
I do not...wish...for bloodshed...

 
**Caligula:**
Nor...do I desire...battle...

 
**Caligula:**
Only...Nero...my love and hope...for her sake...I shall...

 
**Caligula:**
GATHER MEDALS!!!

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
M-medals!? What!?

 
**Caligula:**
Ooohhhhhhhhh!!!

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
Wh-what is the meaning of this!?
Calm yourself, Emperor Caligula!

 
**Caligula:**
MEDALS...WANT!!!

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
...!!!

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
...I see. So that is it.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
While I remain uninterested in trivial diversions, the fact remains that I manifested in Chaldea as a Berserker, like you.

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
I also harbor a flame that I cannot seem to extinguish. Yes...it burns within me...

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
Fine, Caligula.
Then I shall aid you temporarily!

 
**Caligula:**
Oooooooooooohhhhhh!!!

 
**Berserker of El Dorado:**
Your fearsome temperament has impressed me.
You may yet keep up with my strength!

 
**Blackbeard:**
Hmmmm. Two Berserkers interacting with each other... Makin' me kinda jelly.

 
**Blackbeard:**
A tournament with the silver-haired sporty-spice Berserker! The ferocious lion within me...okay, well, maybe it's not a lion...

 
**Blackbeard:**
Maybe a killer whale or a shark.
Well, let's just say a carnivore is about to awaken!

 
**Blackbeard:**
That physique, glistening with sweat from battle! And that iron ball that looks like a sea urchin! Hrnnngh! I'd definitely be a goner if that hits me!

 
**Blackbeard:**
...So. You're okay with what happened?

 
**Hektor:**
Well, there's no point in this old man intervening.

 
**Hektor:**
She said she wasn't interested in “trivial diversions.” And yet she's getting all fired up for this event. Things are just getting more complicated, is all.

 
**Hektor:**
It's not as if we are strangers, and I would recommend that she calm down. But then again...

 
**Hektor:**
She's really not the type to listen to anyone past a certain point. I just pray no one does anything stupid.

 
**Blackbeard:**
I see. Does that mean you'll be with me to...

 
**Blackbeard:**
...Watch the tournament. Carefully record it. Admire the beauties who move so beautifully around the tournament stage...

 
**Hektor:**
The only thing we agree on is that we both hope to get through this event without having to fight, Captain. Of course, if a storm is brewing, it won't matter whether we're audience members or not.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I like playing outside, but hitting each other isn't a good game for girls.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Playing tag or hide-and-go-seek would have been better. Oh, this event is more for boys.

 
**Jack:**
You think so?
We like dismembering!

 
**Jack:**
But if you don't like it, Nursery, then we don't either.
It's not fun if we can't play together.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Teehee. Thank you.
Do you agree too, Ibaraki-Douji?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Um...unnngh. W-well, normally I reeeally try to enjoy smashing, tearing, and pillaging as an oni should...

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
But I'm with Jack on this one. If Nursery Rhyme doesn't like it, then I won't force it on you.

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
So what should we play?
House is fun, so is ball...but I want some excitement...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I know.
Let's ask the other kid!

 
**Jack:**
Other kid?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Hm? Who's that?

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
Could it be!?

 
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**
...Kuhaha. I didn't expect you to see through my Presence Concealment! You guys are good!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I don't think you tried too hard to hide.
I kept seeing your pretty dress flapping.

 
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**
Indeed. My overwhelming beauty just cannot be hidden!
You are a wise Caster, you know that?

 
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**
I shall praise you.
And you shall be rewarded.

 
**Jack:**
Wow, a reward? What is it?

 
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**
My prized torture device! It's a cute fruit-shaped torturing tool! I just so happen to have three or four of them lying around, so you can have one!

 
**Ibaraki-Douji:**
G-giving a torture device as a reward is...a little weird...and it's shaped like fruit...fruit...?

 
**Jack:**
Uh, we might have SOME interest in it. Maybe.
Is it cute?

 
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**
Of course it is!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
I do love a good scary story, but being given a tool for torture is...well, you know...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...It makes me feel a little like...a dragon...you know?

 
**Elisabeth:**
Ah-choo!

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh my. Hehehe. The children are all running about the halls so energetically.

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Seeing them like this brings back memories of my own little Kintoki when he was young...

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Oh yes. And I can only imagine Master was a cute little child too. Heehee.

 
**Boudica:**
It sounded as if those children were talking about torture or something... Well, I suppose I can let that slide.

 
**Boudica:**
I'm just glad to see children so happy.
Children...children...

 
**Boudica:**
There seems to have been quite the increase in the number of children around here. Well not exactly, since they're actually Servants...

 
**Emiya:**
Yeah. Maybe it's time we thought of adding kids' meals to the menu...

 
**Emiya:**
We do have something like that for young Servants who can't eat full portions, but that's not much fun.

 
**Emiya:**
A dish beloved by many, yet both popular and easy to eat... I've been avoiding it this whole time because it's so easy...

 
**Emiya:**
But maybe it's time to offer the forbidden mild-flavored curry?

 
**Boudica:**
I like it!
Good idea!

 
**Boudica:**
...But we're going to be slammed during Nero Fest. Do we really have the time to be adding new dishes to the menu right now?

 
**Emiya:**
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Besides, we have more Servants to help in the kitchen now.

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Say no more.
When you think of curry, you think...hurry for curry!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Which means, we need someone who's speedy in the kitchen! This cat knows just the one to fit that bill!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
A man who's only effective when the sun is in the sky!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
That would be Sir Gawain! He's sure to cook up a great pot of curry real fast, since he's only got so much time to work with!

 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Yeah, but let's not invite Lip over. We wouldn't want Sir Gawain to be distracted and stop his work, now would we?

 
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**
Heh. Oh my. So he is only powerful when the sun is out? What a wonderful trait.

 
**Boudica:**
You really...think so?

 
**Ozymandias:**
...What? I do not want to hear of this, even from you.

 
**Ozymandias:**
I have no wish to involve myself in such trivialities. To think you would come to visit me, only to babble about the Roman Emperor's absurd festival.

 
**Ozymandias:**
I always thought of you as a brave man who might be frivolous even on the battlefield, but this is something else entirely.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Begone, Archer.

 
**Arash:**
Oh? That's an unexpected response from you, Pharaoh.

 
**Arash:**
You don't like festivals? I thought you were the type of king who didn't mind your citizens having fun.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Of course not. I do not care what the citizens do for  pleasure. The whole universe is within my grasp! I am a tolerant pharaoh, you know!

 
**Ozymandias:**
But listen. I and I alone decide what I do. The very thought of the great pharaoh participating in an ancient Roman festival is laughable!

 
**Arash:**
Maybe so, but why don't you think it over?
Think of it as a breath from our hectic lives...

 
**Arash:**
But it wouldn't be bad to go and test your strength either. Think about it: we're in Chaldea, where all sorts of Heroic Spirits gather from around the world.

 
**Arash:**
Your participation would make this festival even more exciting.

 
**Ozymandias:**
...Hmph. You are a smooth talker.

 
**Arash:**
Besides.
I think it's about time you met the other guy.

 
**Arash:**
When you two meet, it should be on an appropriate stage where Servants can safely fight. A battle between you&ndash;the Sun King&ndash;and him would be much too dangerous to take place in Chaldea itself.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hm?

 
**Arash:**
No, nothing...

 
**Nitocris:**
...

 
**Nitocris:**
(I-is that...)

 
**Nitocris:**
(Could that be Pharaoh Ozymandias!?
So he is finally attending the ancient Roman festival!)

 
**Nitocris:**
(I-I cannot stand idly by! Should the Pharaoh be on the move, Nitocris must also take action!)

 
**Ozymandias:**
Nitocris.

 
**Nitocris:**
Yes! Pharaoh Ozymandias!
What is your order!?

 
**Ozymandias:**
I have warmed to the idea of going.
I trust you to hold the fort while I'm away.

 
**Nitocris:**
...Eh? Uh...um...well, I...!

 
**Arash:**
Hahaha. Leave the guarding to the Sphinx. It's no fun for her to stay behind during a festival. Don't you agree, big bro pharaoh?

 
**Ozymandias:**
Heh. Indeed.

 
**Ozymandias:**
We will go together then, Nitocris!
Ready yourself!

 
**Nitocris:**
Yes!

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Okita:**
...

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Okita:**
...

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Okita:**
Mr. Hijikata? Hijikata? How much longer do you plan on sitting there munching pickles?

 
**Okita:**
The event's starting. The event!
I know it's not a super giant one, but...

 
**Okita:**
But with all the Servants who're participating,
this might actually turn into a big deal!

 
**Okita:**
This is one of the best opportunities to demonstrate Tennen Rishinryu&ndash;err, the Shinsengumi, that we'll ever get!

 
**Okita:**
This is also our chance to get ahead of Nobbu!

 
**Hijikata:**
...

 
**Okita:**
Come on now! I know you like things like this,
Mister Hijikata!

 
**Okita:**
...Well, okay, so you may not measure up to me when it comes to official matches...

 
**Okita:**
But you have your eye-blinding, sand throwing, anything goes killer “Baragaki” technique.

 
**Okita:**
Using your ultimate Tennen Rishinryu spirit that the audience would sure to be judgmental of, let's show who's boss!

 
**Hijikata:**
...Quit your yapping.

 
**Okita:**
Awww.

 
**Hijikata:**
...Well, I couldn't say much for other events like races, but I suppose a festival like this is a different matter.

 
**Hijikata:**
I like the idea of fighting these other folks to the death.

 
**Okita:**
...Um, killing isn't allowed.

 
**Okita:**
Hey, wait a minute. Mr. Hijikata? I thought you were munching on pickles because you weren't interested?

 
**Hijikata:**
...Don't get the wrong idea. I was just filling up so I wouldn't be fighting on an empty stomach.

 
**Hijikata:**
Let's go, Okita.

 
**Okita:**
That's the spirit!

 
**Okita:**
Ah, brings back memories of our training hall days.
I'll get a few great Okita victories under my belt!

 
**Hijikata:**
Talk big when you win, Okita.
You're embarrassing yourself. Okay.

 
**Hijikata:**
Shinsengumi, move out!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Yo, hold it right there, Miss Dark Saber.

 
**Altria Alter:**
What?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Aren't you that alternative Servant of the King of Knights of the Round Table?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Yet you're different than usual. I sense a tenseness...a tingling sensation from you. You're so revved up, it's electrifying.

 
**Altria Alter:**
What is your point?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Okay. Let me get straight to the point, straight as the cutting edge of a blade!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're a Rider, right? That means you got some kinda mount or machine, yeah?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I saw ya race a while back, but that was that red'n'gold emperor's ride, right?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Bumpin' into you must be fate!
Would ya mind showing me your darkness machine!?

 
**Altria Alter:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu. Show a bit of mercy if he's bothering you.
This little brat was itching to join the race.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But NOBODY asked him to participate.
He was so dejected, he's acting all funny.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Boys are such strange creatures.
So keep that in mind and don't get too angry, okay?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Wh-what!? What the hell!? When did you show up!?
And you're wrong! No! Absolutely not! No, no, no!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I ain't dejected or actin' weird, okay!?
Quit makin' up stuff about me!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fine, fine. Look at those pouty lips.
You're just like a child.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Want a piece of candy?
Or maybe a soft dumpling that's easier to chew?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
HEY! Quit treatin' me like a kid!

 
**Altria Alter:**
...I see now. If he is no more than a child,
there's no need for me to raise my mop over this.

 
**Altria Alter:**
Sakata Kintoki. If you seek a place to direct your pent-up youthful energy...

 
**Altria Alter:**
I suggest you participate in the tournament that Emperor Nero is holding. I'm sure a handful of hot-blooded folks have gathered again this year.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, I ain't&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yes, yes. Be a good boy and stop bothering this nice lady. Now, let's go to the festival.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh yes. Fufufufu. If you behave yourself,
maybe I'll buy you a candy apple...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I said NO THANK YOU!
Geddit through your head!

 
**Sanzang:**
Hnnnn! This is going to be my year!

 
**Sanzang:**
I, Xuanzang Sanzang, will win for sure this year! A whole buncha stuff happened last year that prevented me from winning!

 
**Sanzang:**
So...Touta!
I choose you to accompany me!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Wait a minute. You've got it all wrong.
Think back on what happened last year.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
It's true this is a competition for Servants to test their strength, but this tournament's different. It's not about finding a single victor.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
It's neither an elimination competition nor is it a round robin battle. They're just one-off battles on a grand stage, each for a brief moment.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Besides, you're a monk.
A great monk at that.

 
**Tawara Touta:**
Getting enthusiastic over brawls wouldn't be right. I'm just saying you should probably focus on hitting the wooden drum Mokugyo.

 
**Sanzang:**
Oh, that hollow-sounding thing! Nice!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
...That's your reaction?

 
**Sanzang:**
Well, yeah. It's not that everyone's fighting to kill. Everyone's participating to better themselves, as a part of training.

 
**Sanzang:**
They're not focused on winning.
But since it's for training, we should go beyond all out!

 
**Tawara Touta:**
I guess...you could think of it that way.

 
**Sanzang:**
And so! This year for sure!
I will! Positively! Win! (Grin)

 
**Tawara Touta:**
(Hmmm. So this is what desire looks like... Now then. At this rate, I wonder when will the great Monk Sanzang actually reach enlightenment...?)

 
**Jing Ke:**
No assaults in the night, no assassination, and no surprise attacks, huh? And on top of that...

 
**Jing Ke:**
No killing. What a buzzkill.
This event really will be hard on us Assassins.

 
**Spartacus:**
Hahahaha. Then the only thing you can do is REBEL. Wonderful! All forms of treachery will be permitted!

 
**Spartacus:**
Ah, Rome! Ah, the emperor! Truly a vain embodiment of a multitude of tyrannies and oppression, all in one place!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Oh hey, Spartacus.
You get my drift.

 
**Jing Ke:**
What do you think? Want to try running amok without restraint one time? Surely you're tired of living in Chaldea with a bunch of emperors and kings all around.

 
**Jing Ke:**
If you're in it, then I will...

 
**Spartacus:**
Hahahaha! Indeed! We have the right to rebel against all these tyrannies, smash down insolence, while the pride of the mighty is crushed!

 
**Spartacus:**
And at the same time, we shall use this opportunity to clear the air of our pent-up grudge! We have the right to such joy at this festival!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hmph. I get it now.

 
**Jing Ke:**
This may be an event run by an authority, but you will allow such a thing to be run as long as there are people who enjoy such event. Am I correct?

 
**Jing Ke:**
You seem more calm and levelheaded than I am,
Spartacus, the forever rebellious one.

 
**Andersen:**
Oh, it's you, Master.
Go away.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, an expression of opinion similar to one oft expressed! I regret to say this myself, Master, but I am of the same opinion as he.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Getting right to the point in a story is important, and he is the right man for the job. What he means is: anything mightier than the pen is positively brutish!

 
**Shakespeare:**
That is to say, we are unfit to participate in this particular event.

 
**Andersen:**
A recreation of the festival of Olympia? An elegant and beautiful show of battles in the Colosseum?

 
**Andersen:**
No.
Wrong.

 
**Andersen:**
This tournament is quite clearly an event for the physically fit. The question, though, is one of what is being promoted here.

 
**Andersen:**
It's simply a shot in the arm made to entertain the readers&ndash;I mean, the citizens.

 
**Andersen:**
Nothing more. Nothing less. I must regretfully inform you that we are not needed here.

 
**Cleopatra:**
Seriously? I thought this was a festival glorifying me! What a surprise! I didn't think THAT was its purpose!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Well, I do not recall permitting such festivities, as they have nothing to do with pharaohs...so I did have a sneaking suspicion...

 
**Cleopatra:**
Either way, it is a good thing for a nation to thrive!

 
**Cleopatra:**
I am sure the economic effects are great.
If proper measures were put in place beforehand, that is.

 
**Cleopatra:**
I wonder if Her Imperial Majesty had that in mind? I wouldn't mind taking a bit of her time to give a presentation...

 
**Andersen:**
Go do that on your own time. This study is exclusively for the writer-Servants of Chaldea.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh come now, don't say such a thing. I'd rather not simply confine myself to the same perpetually glum faces, ever harassed by deadlines...

 
**Shakespeare:**
This beaming pharaoh's presence certainly brightens up our space, after all. The light of her divine beauty...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Ah, what better inspiration to get our creative juices flowing!? As you can already see, my creative motivation is on the rise!

 
**Cleopatra:**
Why thank you, Shakespeare. But I am afraid you are somewhat lacking in muscle. You really must take better care of yourself.

 
**Andersen:**
You certainly do favor married women...

 
**Shakespeare:**
No, no, no! Nothing like that! And to prove it...I have the perfect individual to back me up!

 
**Andersen:**
Well, he IS here,
but...well, as long as you're all right with it...

 
**Caesar:**
Hm? It appears study room A is a bit rowdy.
Do you suppose Master stopped by?

 
**Caesar:**
Well, no matter.
It is just the two of us in study room B, after all.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
...

 
**Caesar:**
Beautiful. You truly are beautiful. You may be concealing that beauty with a veil, but I can tell.

 
**Caesar:**
You are an exquisite beauty who shines not by the sun's light, but a beauty who whose luminance is best viewed at night, by starlight.

 
**Caesar:**
Yet as a fellow Servant, I'm sure you have considerable power on the battlefield.

 
**Caesar:**
You show no sign of that, though.
Beautiful as you are, you are surely dangerous as well.

 
**Caesar:**
And that is what truly intrigues me.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
...Please stop, Lord Caesar.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
I am a Caster. Just a simple Caster. I am merely one of many Servants who has formed a contract with Master.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
You may try to woo me with honeyed words,
but I dare not answer them.

 
**Caesar:**
Say no such thing.
You can trust me.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
...

 
**Caesar:**
I am an able man.
Let me prove that much to you.

 
**Caster of the Nightless City:**
You mustn't...

 
**Cleopatra:**
Lord CAAAEEESAAAR!?

 
**Caesar:**
Wha...!?

 
**Cleopatra:**
You have apologized and begged my forgiveness countless times...and STILL you... Who exactly is that...woman...!?

 
**Caesar:**
I...well...

 
**Caesar:**
Oh.

 
**Cleopatra:**
Do not “oh” me, Caesar. It seems your heart is as clogged with junk as your belly.

 
**Cleopatra:**
It just so happens that a martial tournament is about to begin. So I have a wonderful idea.

 
**Cleopatra:**
I will have you, Lord Caesar, participate and ask a bunch of Sabers to help you slim down.

 
**Caesar:**
I...well...I don't...

 
**Cleopatra:**
Yes?

 
**Caesar:**
...Uh... Yes ma'am.
That might...not such a bad idea.

 
**Caesar:**
(...Oh, my Caesarion. What shall I do?
What do you think I should do?)

 
**E：Voice of Caesarion:**
(It would help if you slimmed down a bit.)

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Mentor, Mentor!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I just heard! There's going to be a tournamament to test the strength of all Chaldea's Servants!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
...Um. This tournamament isn't going to require that Santas partici...um, join, right?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Not strictly speaking, no.
But since it is such a grand event...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
It would be a shame to simply ignore it.
First of all, let's think about seasons.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Seasons?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes. Seasons change from summer to fall, fall to winter.
I hear that fall is quite short.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But I digress a bit. Anyway, it would be best to take time to train in the seasons prior to winter...

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh I see! So if I train well during this tournament, I would become a great Santa by the time winter comes! How logimical!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The word is logical, and it isn't!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's obviously a super sporty event!
And Amakusa, stop talking nonsense!

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Oh, hello, grown-up me. Please do not shout in the halls. You will bother the other Servants and staff.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
And playing the role of Santa is a tough job. It requires a good, strong body, too, you know. Yes, it does. Argument won!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Don't give me that sh&ndash;crap!
And stop saying “argument won!”

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Calm down, me. She's like our little sister.
Make sure to treat her better than that, okay?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Ah, yes.
You and I are surprisingly on the same page.

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
...Even that may happen once in a while...

 
**Jeanne d'Arc:**
Right, Alter?
As an older sister, you should&ndash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
HELL!!! NO!!!

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...Heh.

 
**Marie:**
Don't lurk in a corner like that.
Why don't you come out and talk with the others?

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
...My queen.

 
**Marie:**
See? Everyone seems to be having fun.
Those good friends are talking with other like family.

 
**Marie:**
So many Jeanne d'Arcs. Their existences and relationships are quite mysterious and...

 
**Marie:**
Wonderful.
Don't you agree, Count?

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
My Queen. I'm afraid I have just happened to pass by.

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
I have nothing to add to that scene. I have no strong feelings. Same goes with what I think. You might as well ask your general.

 
**Marie:**
Oh. You think so?

 
**Count of Monte Cristo:**
I do.

 
**Marie:**
Oh...he disappeared.
Did he dematerialize?

 
**Nightingale:**
Hm. So he fled. With just a few more minutes, and I would have been able to treat his mental state.

 
**Marie:**
Oh, hello, Nurse.
What's going on?

 
**Nightingale:**
Nothing. I have been attempting to treat that man for some time now, but he flees every time. He is not aware that he is injured.

 
**Marie:**
Hehehe. Give him a rest.
It's not nice to pester him so much.

 
**Nightingale:**
No. It is, I assure you, a part of the treatment.

 
**Marie:**
I see. Then if d'Eon or Amadeus goes overboard during this festival, please treat them, okay?

 
**Nightingale:**
Of course.
You need not worry about that, Marie Antoinette.

 
**Nightingale:**
Whenever an event or battle should arise, I will never hesitate to treat the wounded, regardless of what it may be that ails them.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Wasteful.
So terribly wasteful.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The event itself is not the problem. A break is good for morale. No one can remain sane constantly staring down the jaws of death itself.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But! This may be a simulator, but a waste is a waste!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The device operates on Chaldea's system, too!
Using it thoughtlessly is wasteful!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Besides, what benefit is there to training so many Servants? If you want to train someone, train me! Me!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmmm...the king of Uruk is surprisingly miserly.

 
**Nero Bride:**
I thought he was a king of luxury like me...who would spend extravagantly without a second thought...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fool. I'm not stingy, but I am also a man who saves up! Listen well: one should only spend extravagantly after making a fortune!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But look at Chaldea! Its power always runs at capacity, and its employees' wages are never raised!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Basic salary should always be increased every year,
the fools!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I'm not saying that you need to be considerate of the older workers. I'm only saying that one should be compensated according to their skills!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm. That is sound advice. I'll keep it in mind.
But being so stodgy and all-business is such a drear way to live.

 
**Nero Bride:**
The more glorious the festival, the better.
Don't you agree?

 
**Nero Bride:**
I understand your perspective, of course, but a simulator exists to be used, doesn't it?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Then just bear in mind the sheer amount of data that will create. The thing that's called...Sheba?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If that thing's running at full capacity, day and night,
Da Vinci is sure to get frustrated. The first part of the festival should be run modestly.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
After all, the preliminaries are mere battles between those up until four stars. It shouldn't concern a five star Servant like me!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fwahahahahahahahaha!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Fuwahahahahahahahaha!
I'm just laughing along with you!

 
**Nero Bride:**
Ah, that's the king Gilgamesh I've heard of! The arrogant but mischievous sort that you just can't hate for some reason!

 
**Romulus:**
...Ah, the one who walks the never-ending path.

 
**Romulus:**
You are now in Chaldea, a place where numberless destinies intersect. Yet I notice that you purposefully avoid interacting with others.

 
**Romulus:**
A foolish choice.
Humans cannot live or act in isolation.

 
**Romulus:**
So too with Rome.
You must reflect and look back on your own path.

 
**Arthur:**
...My apologies.

 
**Arthur:**
Holy Progenitor, Romulus.
I am not Rome.

 
**Arthur:**
Still, I shall keep those words of yours in my heart.
But remember, I once fought against Rome itself.

 
**Romulus:**
No, you are Rome.

 
**Romulus:**
You are human, therefore you are Rome.
Make no mistake: Rome and love reside within all people.

 
**Romulus:**
Enjoy yourself. Even should you keep your face concealed, none will judge you.

 
**Romulus:**
My Rome is the source of many joyous festivals.
Do not forget, my child. People cannot live without joy.

 
**Romulus:**
In other words...

 
**Romulus:**
Enjoy! Smile!

 
**Helena:**
Okay, here we go!

 
**Helena:**
...Mahatma Change!

 
**Helena:**
Our summer vacation has been extended! Hot places are still hot, so there's no reason not to let loose!

 
**Holmes:**
I see. This is not bad at all. However, I believe I shall join the authors to escape the summer heat.

 
**Helena:**
What are you talking about? You can't. You need to be out in the sun and move that body of yours sometimes.

 
**Helena:**
Contrary to what you say, you're well-versed in such activities, aren't you, Master of Baritsu?

 
**Holmes:**
Only in times of emergency.
Besides, my Baritsu is intended for self defense&ndash;

 
**Helena:**
No more excuses!
Come on, hurry to the Colosseum! Get to it!

 
**Holmes:**
...Seriously?

 
**Helena:**
Yes, of course.
You and I both are going on a mad dash!

 
**A：Mash:**
Ah, so many...

 
**A：Mash:**
All the Servants with dauntless courage have assembled in Chaldea... Everyone seems very excited.

 
**A：Mash:**
This festival shall be of some use and serve you well for the future.

 
**A：Mash:**
I am...also excited.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's work hard to collect medals!
 
**A：Mash:**
Yes, Senpai, my Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh?　Ma...sh...?
 
**A：Mash:**
Yes. It's me, Mash.
Don't worry, Senpai, my Master.

 

 
**A：Mash:**
...I...will try...my best...

 
## Return of Nero Fest - Autumn 2019 (Second Half)
 
**Narration:**
...I have come to the conclusion...

 
**Narration:**
During the Emperor's festival,
where all Heroes of Chaldea assemble...

 
**Narration:**
A brief moment of pleasure and respite in the fight to save humanity...

 
**Narration:**
Surely it is a very noble event. Battles to fulfill the purest of all competitive desires without profit or gain...

 
**Narration:**
The stress of our daily lives, the exhaustion of so many battles eased, if only for a moment.

 
**Narration:**
It's a wonderful thing. A festival is necessary.
Yes. I do understand that this event is important.

 
**Narration:**
But...that is why I have come to my own conclusion...
I also want to fulfill my efforts...

 
**Narration:**
My powers have diminished compared to what they were during my lifetime, but I still want to be of some use to you.

 
**Narration:**
I do not want to impede the path you take. I just want to be of help. Be your strength. I want to serve my purpose.

 
**Narration:**
That's why...I want to...

 
**A：Mash:**
I can't stop this anymore...can't stop this feeling.

 
**A：Mash:**
I am a warrior of the Valkyries,
created by the great god Odin.

 
**A：Mash:**
I once served the gods...was no more than an automaton. Soon I met my love, Sigurd, and perished as a woman.

 
**A：Mash:**
I am the Heroic Spirit Brynhild. I sit in the Throne,
but have lost all my Authority as a god.

 
**A：Mash:**
My sealed powers...many functions equivalent to Authority are awakening. I want them to. They're beginning to work. I want them to work.

 
**A：Mash:**
Because...tonight, all the conditions will be met.

 
**A：Mash:**
Many Heroes and great men participating in battle.
So many warriors I am compelled to love.

 
**A：Mash:**
But...yes, yes... I must choose.
Watching all these heroes do battle...

 
**A：Mash:**
The time has come to select the most valiant of all heroes.

 
**Brynhild:**
...Though not much blood will be spilled...

 
**Brynhild:**
It will be all right. I will claim no souls. Valhalla, built for my father, the great god, is far from here.

 
**Brynhild:**
Even with much of my power and functions sealed, such things are nothing if I use a Primordial Rune.

 
**Brynhild:**
If I make even the slightest error in my calculations,
I may lose my Spirit Origin...

 
**Brynhild:**
...But I don't mind.

 
**Brynhild:**
Before I disappear, I will fulfill my purpose...all that is asked of me.

 
**Brynhild:**
For you, I shall train the selected Servant and construct them anew.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O...kay.
 
**Brynhild:**
Yes.

 
**Brynhild:**
I shall do it without Nótt,
the goddess of night, detecting me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait...Mash...I mean, you're...
 
**Brynhild:**
It is fine.
It will be fine.

 
**Brynhild:**
There is nothing to worry about.
Please leave everything to me, Senpai, my Master.

 
**Brynhild:**
So please don't give me that sad look.

 

 
**Mash:**
...Altering Heroic Spirits.
A pseudo-Palingenesis without a Holy Grail.

 
**Mash:**
So that's what she meant.
Now I understand.

 
**Mash:**
The single most valiant Servant in Chaldea is selected, and a perpetual enhancement is applied by using the Primordial Rune...

 
**Mash:**
That is likely her intent...

 
**Mash:**
This is exactly what Scáthach and El-Melloi mentioned!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash!?
 
**A：Mash:**
Senpai, my Master.

 
**Mash:**
No, that's Brynhild!

 
**Mash:**
I'm the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Two...Mashes!?
 
**A：Mash:**
Senpai, my Master.

 
**Mash:**
No, that's Brynhild!

 
**Mash:**
I'm the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!

 
**Mash:**
And yet Senpai is confusing the two of us. It must be because of the Runes. Am I correct, Brynhild?

 

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Mash:**
We can avoid disaster if you just stop now.
Well...the only thing that's really gone wrong so far is...

 
**Mash:**
Nero, who figured something was going on, started to pout because her tournament was essentially used as a tool...

 
**Mash:**
But if you stop now, I'm sure she'll just laugh and forgive you. After all, nothing has happened yet.

 
**Mash:**
Please, Brynhild.

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Brynhild:**
...You really are a gentle child, Mash.

 
**Brynhild:**
Yes. You are indeed fit to be alongside Master. While you may not be overflowing with courage, you are full of determination.

 
**Brynhild:**
You certainly could be a Valkyrie of this modern era.

 
**Brynhild:**
But I'm sorry.
Truly sorry.

 
**Brynhild:**
I've already begun to fulfill my purpose! Hero selection! Spirit Origin strengthening! Pseudo-Palingenesis!

 
**Mash:**
Brynhild!

 
**Brynhild:**
I can't stop it!
It won't stop!

 
**Brynhild:**
From here on, Chaldea's mightiest Heroic Spirit must be found to defeat me! My purpose is to modify, build, and strive for divine creation!

 
**Mash:**
But such a feat is impossible to fulfill as a Heroic Spirit! Scáthach and El-Melloi said so!

 
**Mash:**
Surely you understand this, too!
So that's why you kept saying you may disappear...

 
**C：???:**
Words will not reach her.
She's quite stubborn, you know.

 
**Mash:**
What...!?

 
**Mash:**
That voice!

 
**Altera:**
I am afraid you need to beat it into her.
I recall a similar situation in the past.

 
**Altera:**
Put a swift end to it and resume the tournament.
After all, stadium food is good civilization.

 
**Mash:**
Altera!

 
**Siegfried:**
I was wondering why I couldn't hear the incessant voice longing for Sigurd during the tournament.

 
**Siegfried:**
I never imagined you were so consumed by this, Brynhild.

 
**Siegfried:**
I apologize. I didn't realize your dilemma.
But I will not neglect your cries anymore.

 
**Mash:**
Siegfried!

 
**Scáthach:**
It is, of course, not only those two who have gotten involved, Mash.

 
**Scáthach:**
As I was the one who put some of these ideas in your head, it would be wrong of me to sit back and watch.

 
**Leonidas:**
I knew something was strange!
I thought Mash was less shield-y than usual.

 
**Leonidas:**
Rather, I suspected she was more lance-y...and it turned out to be true!

 
**Leonidas:**
Because a shield + lance = me, Leonidas! Which means, according to my calculations, you are not Miss Mash!

 
**Mash:**
Leonidas! Scáthach!

 
**Leonidas:**
And it's not just us! All the Servants who sensed Miss Brynhild's unusual behavior have come!

 
**Leonidas:**
We have assembled here!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Well, it's a bit embarrassing to be introduced like that. The truth is that we just sensed something hinky.

 
**Passionlip:**
Um...I believe you sensed it better than that. You looked really worried... You looked almost like a pervert looking at prey.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm no pervert. Stalker at WORST!
Besides, how would you know what I was thinking?

 
**Passionlip:**
Eh...? Well the moment you looked at Mash,
you were oddly irritated and grumpy...

 
**Passionlip:**
You already have shifty eyes to begin with, but then you got even more awkward...and I was like “ack.”

 
**Robin Hood:**
(Irritated) Listen, you: I do not have shifty eyes.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Chaldea is kind of like a campsite. It's only natural to monitor the health and wellness of everyone here.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Who's not feeling good...who's acting strange...who's talking weird. Stuff like that.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm well versed in scouting. I'd never miss any signs of anything or anyone about to go off an betray us.

 
**Passionlip:**
I see... But the fact remains that you look creepy when you're staring at everyone around the cafeteria.

 
**Robin Hood:**
That's not the point. Were you even listening!? I think all the blood that should be in your brain ended up going to your breasts!

 
**Passionlip:**
I-it did not! And please stop scolding and punishing me like a know-it-all!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Oh, man, that is just, like, MEGA cringe.
How 'bout you downvote that creeper style. For real.

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
So this is the real Greenie? Super skeevy? Is he, like, out for the shrine maiden fox's number one spot?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Like hell! I'm a hunter! That fox and I are rivals when it comes to who hunts and who gets hunted.

 
**Leonidas:**
Now, now, Lady Suzuka. The punishment in this case would be about muscle. There's no doubt he's talking about training one's muscles.

 
**Leonidas:**
There is no difference in the muscles of men and women! Therefore, there is nothing to cringe about!

 
**Suzuka Gozen:**
Seriously? Is that what Chaldea's like?
Chaldea's all about that dudebro life, then?

 
**Leonidas:**
No, we are a group of intellectuals who prize careful calculation!

 
**Leonidas:**
But I can see that Lady Passionlip, Lady Suzuka, and Sir Robin get along well. Did you all fight alongside each other at some point?

 
**Leonidas:**
Anyway, Lady Mash and Fujimaru!
The French contingent has come as well!

 
**Gilles:**
If the holy maiden commands me, then I shall not waver. I had no idea that a Valkyrie of Northern Europe had concealed herself within this festival.

 
**d'Eon:**
I'd like for this to end peacefully.
If you stop now, it will be as if nothing happened.

 
**d'Eon:**
Let us have some tea instead.
This message I bring from the queen herself, Brynhild.

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Leonidas:**
There are still more warriors here to support you! Behold!

 
**Alexander:**
Hey! We're here too! Come on, teacher!
Don't lag behind! Come to the front!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Why would you put a Caster on the front line?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Ah, now I see. Brynhild of Northern Europe.
Even if you do really possess a true Primordial Rune...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
It would be best not to use its full strength here. Those runes hold the power of the great god of the Norse, Odin.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Worst case scenario, not only will your Spirit Origin be destroyed, you may create an anomaly that spreads through all of Chaldea.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Should that happen, even Master would not survive. For example, there may be a flux in magical energy through magical circuits...

 
**El-Melloi II:**
And phenomena that are otherwise impossible may occur within the space taken over by a Primordial Rune.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
But...why?

 
**El-Melloi II:**
You do not appear to be quite so mad...

 
**Kid Gil:**
Teacher, you're talking too much!

 
**El-Melloi II:**
I do not recall accepting you as my pupil. What a peculiar twist of fate, considering who you become.

 
**Alexander:**
Oh don't be so mean, teacher.
Gil came by because he is genuinely concerned.

 
**El-Melloi II:**
Gil... Unbelievable...

 
**Leonidas:**
Ah, this display is almost like a teacher with his students on a school trip. It certainly lightens the mood here!

 
**Leonidas:**
So there you have it, Lady Brynhild!
You may be a demigod...

 
**Leonidas:**
But you must see that you are outnumbered! Out of respect for Lady Mash's shield and everyone's concern, why don't you put down your lance?

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Altera:**
The king gifted with brilliance is correct, Valkyrie.

 
**Altera:**
According to legend, you are seen as my younger sister in a way.

 
**Altera:**
As I am now, I have no memory of that...but the fact remains that we are somehow related.

 
**Altera:**
I cannot have you destroyed here.
I have yet to properly speak with you.

 
**Altera:**
...My sister.

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Brynhild:**
...Lord Attil&ndash;Altera...

 
**Brynhild:**
The man so like my Sigurd...
No, I am restraining my desire for Sigurd...

 
**Brynhild:**
I will do what must be done...
It is as simple as that.

 
**Brynhild:**
...I also wanted to speak with you.
But...

 
**Hektor:**
Why can't you? We're at a festival.
There's no point in holding back.

 
**Hektor:**
Use this place to air out dirty laundry or get on good terms with each other.

 
**Hektor:**
I don't think it's a bad idea. This old man thinks you should just talk when you have the chance.

 
**Hektor:**
Well, if you can't, that's fine too.

 
**Beowulf:**
Argh! Dammit! That's annoying! Doesn't matter what is...you just gotta solve it with your fist!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
That's just shortsighted, Bear-Wolf Guy!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Getting' rough with girls ain't golden.
After all, Riders are heroes!

 
**Beowulf:**
Women and children got nothing to do with it if we're up against Heroic Spirits! And sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm a Berserker!

 
**Hijikata:**
Hmph. At least someone gets it...

 
**Hijikata:**
If there's no choice but to push through, all you have to do is to stick to your values until the very end!

 
**Emiya:**
He's right. It's not about being a woman or child.

 
**Emiya:**
Such a rule will always apply in places where lives are at stake. Be it Heroic Spirit or human, there's no difference.

 
**Emiya:**
Indeed. Though that does not mean it is futile to try to communicate.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha!
Ah, my sides hurt from all this laughing!

 
**Ozymandias:**
That woman was crazy enough to point her lance at a God King's grand temple, MY temple! Words won't stop her!

 
**Arash:**
I suppose. I agree with you there.

 
**Arash:**
...Oh hey. You're here too, Master. If you're back to your old self, you'd better get serious quick!

 
**Arthur:**
Yes, I agree.

 
**Arthur:**
Her lance hasn't grown yet, so she doesn't have the power to wipe us all out in one swing.

 
**Arthur:**
If the plan is to restrain her, we must be quick.
And then the rest is up to you, Master.

 
**Ozymandias:**
Hm?

 
**Ozymandias:**
You're a new face, aren't you?
Wait. Wait a moment. That armor...that voice...that bearing... Could you be...?

 
**Arash:**
Yeah, yeah. Right now we need to focus on the Valkyrie!
If we don't stop her soon, we'll be goners!

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop this.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't need to modify Servants!
 

 
**Brynhild:**
...How troubling.

 
**Brynhild:**
I do not know what to say.
Master, are you saying this has all been unnecessary?

 
**Brynhild:**
When you look at me like that, it is clear that there is no need for me to continue down this egotistical path I have taken.

 
**Brynhild:**
Yes...behavior so selfish must be stopped immediately, I&ndash;

 
**Brynhild:**
...I want to stop...at least I think I want to stop.
But at the same time...

 
**Brynhild:**
...I feel I must create the strongest possible Heroic Spirit...

 
**Mash:**
No, Brynhild!

 
**Brynhild:**
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

 
**Brynhild:**
I...I cannot hold myself back.
I truly am an unstable Heroic Spirit.

 
**Brynhild:**
It...it will happen automatically.
I will begin to love automatically.

 
**Scáthach:**
Magical energy surge!
Master, her Primordial Rune is activating!

 
**Altera:**
I leave the commands to you, Master. It seems we have no choice but to settle this with our swords.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for battle!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's stop her!
 

 
**Altera:**
Understood, Master!

 
**Brynhild:**
...Give me a blade. Show me all your power! The one who ends my life will be given the protection and blessing of Palingenesis!!!

 
**Brynhild:**
Warriors! Be chosen!
Heroes! Stop me!

 
**Brynhild:**
Me me me...
Me me me me me me me me meee!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Brynhild!
 

 
**Brynhild:**
Master...!!!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
...And that's how it went.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Chaldea's Master and [♂ his /♀ her] Servants managed to stop the out-of-control Valkyrie.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Oh, and the Valkyrie is quite safe. Her Spirit Core, too.
In the end, she did not use a Primordial Rune.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Though this is indeed an interesting case study...

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
It all, luckily, ended well.
As to what caused her to go berserk in the first place...

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
El-Melloi had some idea, but unfortunately he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
The important bit is that Chaldea is safe and sound.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
None of its systems, Sheba included,
went out of control.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
It turned out not to be possible to locate another Holy Grail.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
At any rate, sorry to get your hopes up.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...What are you talking about?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
If I recall, you mentioned something might happen before this tournament started.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
I had absolutely nothing to do with this.
I am just relieved everyone is safe.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Let's just leave it at that.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
I was interested in what you were going to do if you obtained a Holy Grail, but... Hahaha. You're a more cunning man than I expected.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Then I shall take my leave.
You should at least enjoy this festival until its end.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
It's being held so everyone can relax.
After all, everyone deserves a breather once in a while.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
On the other hand...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Perhaps a minor bit of wickedness like that is more relaxing to you than anything else.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Hahahaha! I believe I'll have to duck that particular question, young man!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...Farewell.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
He really is a cunning man. Intriguing.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Now then. I suppose it's punishment time.
I know you're skulking about, O Great Detective.

 
**Holmes:**
Not running away or hiding is unlike you. Have your habits changed now that you've become a Servant?

 
**Holmes:**
Either way, you are the culprit.
You were the one who caused Brynhild to go berserk.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Have you any proof?

 
**Holmes:**
No physical evidence, obviously.
I would not expect you to be so careless.

 
**Holmes:**
But of course, I did come across the truth.
Besides, Lord El-Melloi was the detective today.

 
**Holmes:**
The reasoning via magecraft techniques approach is certainly interesting. But either way...

 
**Holmes:**
Even if there is no clear-cut evidence, there are always ways to find the culprit.

 
**Holmes:**
While such a thing may be impossible for an ordinary man, it is surely not so for the Great Detective. I trust I needn't elaborate?

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Heh. So what you're trying to say is...

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
I'm busted.

 
**Holmes:**
(Nod)

 
**Holmes:**
The only thing that remains unclear is whether you knew her rampage could be stopped at the last minute.

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Hope for tomorrow!

 
(Runs away)

 
**Holmes:**
Baritsu!!! (Gentlemanly kick!)

 
**Archer of Shinjuku:**
Ow...it looked like you didn't put your whole weight on it, yet it still stings...! Are you sure that move's not against the rules!?

 
**Holmes:**
Helena was right. I'm glad I participated in the festival.
It was good to move about a bit.

 
**Brynhild:**
Master...I wish to formally apologize.

 
**Brynhild:**
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.
I am a terribly unstable Servant...

 
**Brynhild:**
But Master. Please know that I will do my utmost not to make trouble for you anymore.

 
**Brynhild:**
Leonardo da Vinci gave me a gift.

 
**Brynhild:**
She used a portion of Chaldea's resources to create a device that will make sure my operational status remains normal.

 
**Brynhild:**
It may not be completely flawless,
but I feel more secure than I did before.

 
**Brynhild:**
Should I...act strange...again...

 
**Brynhild:**
...

 
**Brynhild:**
...Please do not hesitate to break me.
Until that time comes, I will be your strength.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't break you.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's okay. You'll never go berserk again, Brynhild.
 

 
**Brynhild:**
...Yes, Master.
