# Almost Weekly Santa Alter

## Prologue: The Dark Santa
 
**Mash:**
I must say, Senpai, it's a great day for gift-giving&mdash;
and Chaldea is in Christmas mode!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou!

 
**Mash:**
...Huh?
Senpai's gone, Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Are you taking a shower, Senpai?
Or using the toilet?

 
**Mash:**
How... ...Nowhere to be found...
But there's no doubt Senpai was in this room...

 
**Mash:**
There's no record of a heat signature leaving this room in the last hour either&mdash; It's as if...

 
**Mash:**
Clearly, there's been some kind of foul play here!
Let's go get the Doctor!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Huh?
 

 
**???:**
Emerging from the Rayshift tunnel, your eyes were met with the sight of a field blanketed in snow...

 
**???:**
A most literary beginning. The use of the second-person lends a certain subtlety to the sentence.
Don't you think, Fujimaru?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 That voice! Could it be&mdash;?!
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Ha! A lively response. I am possessed of a sudden desire to kick you in your arse.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Though our contract is but a temporary one,
any Master seeking to transport me must be as so.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 You were in the Massive Cavern?
 
**Santa Alter:**
...No. This is my first meeting with you.
Can you not tell from my attire?

 
**Santa Alter:**
I've certainly never been defeated by you, and have, under no circumstances, been brooding over it.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I was simply in a foul mood, especially my stomach.
All because Archer wouldn't cook a sound meal.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...No, that is not it.
I am precisely as you see me to be.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A mi-miniskirt... Alter
 
**Santa Alter:**
...A m-miniskirt, you say?
Well, I suppose one could see it as such.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But mind it not, and allow me to say this in advance.
One who would be Santa is unbothered by the cold!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Santa Alter.
I am a Santa Claus of Evil who slashes apart the icy breath of Midwinter!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...You seem to misunderstand me. I merely wish to express my daily gratitude by delivering presents to all.

 
**Santa Alter:**
However&mdash; After going through the trouble of gathering presents, I have lost my means of transporting them.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The reindeer that I had hired previously to pull my sleigh have all run away in fear.

 
**Santa Alter:**
What a bunch of cowards. All I did was use Excalibur Morgan as a jet engine to propel us into the stratosphere.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I could pull the sleigh myself, but such a thing would tarnish the dignity of Santa Claus.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I cannot capture the heart of children everywhere without a reindeer. Which is why&mdash; You understand, don't you, good Fujimaru?

 
**Santa Alter:**
It is for that purpose alone that I have unsummoned you here by force.

 
**Santa Alter:**
As a part of my daily gratitude to you,
I bestow upon you the honor of being my reindeer.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 This is part of your duty as a king?
 
**Santa Alter:**
No. I am not a king here, but a Santa Claus!
Kindly refer to me in those terms.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You didn't have anyone else you could ask, did you?
 
**Santa Alter:**
That is untrue! Of those I considered there was one, at least, with promise!

 
**Santa Alter:**
But they were rather hesitant, and worse yet,
extremely frail. Thus, I sent them packing.

 
**Santa Alter:**
However, their eyes were so bright they would have made a perfect red-nosed reindeer...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Honestly... Even if it is Christmastime, one should have limits to how much one lets loose.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...No, wait a moment.
It seems the presents have drawn some uninvited guests.

 
**Santa Alter:**
And I was in the middle of my presentation...
But there's nothing to be done about it. Take up your sword, Fujimaru.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Your body shall know what it means to go into battle with Santa&mdash;!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Santa Alter:**
As you can see, many try to target Santa Claus.
Reindeer must be as strong as their master.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Now then, you understand what I'm saying, don't you?
You are now my reindeer. I won't hear any objections.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Rest assured, I am a Santa and not a demon.
If you work hard, I shall grant you your life, at least&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, ma'am, I'm ready to start right now!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, Santa Alter!
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Humph! That was a quick response!
Are you a lion cub, unschooled in fear? How promising!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Nonetheless, it was a good answer. I am pleased.
Now, let us start immediately.

 
**Santa Alter:**
First, let us storm this house nearby.
As Santa, I must attack from the skies.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Now, board the sleigh, Master!
I shall enlighten you on the ways of Santa!

 
## 1st Night: Little Darius
 
**Santa Alter:**
Forward, my soldiers! Tear through the darkness!
Plunge into the blizzard! Wander! Wander!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This sleigh really flies through the air!
 
**Santa Alter:**
Naturally. One who would be Santa must be able to traverse the skies. We must deliver presents to the children around the world.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I've dubbed this sleigh Llamrei Unit II.
You may relax your guard and entrust yourself to it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why are you yelling?!
 
**Santa Alter:**
Insolent fool!
I am not yelling. I am singing!

 
**Santa Alter:**
By announcing my presence this way, I can also avoid running into airplanes! It's common sense for a Santa!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Good. We are approaching our destination.
Prepare yourself, Fujimaru.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The return address of this “Dear Santa” letter is in Persia. A request from Darius, aged 3.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Hmm. The writing is so black and smeared I can't read it at all. Well, I'm sure once I see his face, I'll know what present he'd like.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let us go! We shall enter from this magnificent chimney!

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!

 
**Phantom:**
Ahh... The iron lament that surpasses the vocal cords...
Echoing from the depths of the hollow, the enamored yet hate-filled voice of a young girl's lingering affections as she “sings” of death...

 
**Phantom:**
Specifically, I should call it the raging moans of a girl who can no longer abide her hunger. Ahh, how unsightly yet adorable&mdash;!

 
**Phantom:**
Though it's a far cry from my own taste, she conveys her feelings so well it truly pains me.

 
**Phantom:**
A cry that would pierce Heaven itself. You who spews forth such hatred, I'd liken you to... Yes, a carp swimming up a waterfall.

 
**Phantom:**
Actually, you are more like a carp banner. How auspicious. Ahh, how very auspicious indeed...
And hateful, too!

 
**Phantom:**
Christine! Christine has gone so far from me! Why?
Why does fate endeavor to tear us apart yet again?

 
**Phantom:**
Couples! Christmas! Santa Claus! Whenever I hear that this is a night for loved ones, it makes me sick!

 
**Phantom:**
Don't you agree, Sir Carp Banner? Why must we, upon such a night as this, be a company entirely of men?

 
**Santa Alter:**
...What a ferocious cry from the soul. It stirs the heart too greatly. Surely, that Servant is an actor of some renown.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 Yeah, that was quite an elegy.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 Ehh, it was certainly a self-indulgent soliloquy.
 

**Santa Alter:**
What a splendid performance. He probably has more passion in his pinky than that cursed Tristan...

 
**Santa Alter:**
...But I can't imagine that either of them is Darius.
Also, that object in the middle of the floor...

 
**Santa Alter:**
There's nothing here but that tree-like candle in the center of the room. Does that mean Darius isn't here?

 
**Santa Alter:**
That's fine, then. I should simply turn around and leave now, but I do pity these two.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Merlin has said that when a man is widowed, his suffering surpasses the pain of Death. As Santa, I can't just leave them be.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let us go, Fujimaru!
We shall be like the Christmas Carol that saved Scrooge!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Bow down, little ones!
Prepare to receive your presents from me!

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]???

 
**Phantom:**
Oh, Christine!
You've come back to me, Christine!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Ugh. Halt, Black Mantle!
Do not approach my reindeer.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Laying hands upon your audience is a third-rate performer's action. Are you not a world-class actor after all?

 
**Phantom:**
What? I, a world-class...actor, you say?
I, the specter of this miserable underground hovel?

 
**Santa Alter:**
I never engage in flattery. You rave as though mad,
but your cries are filled with truth. So much so I am moved to tears.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But more importantly, where is the master of this castle?
The sender of this letter to Santa should be here.

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!

 
**Phantom:**
Santa... Ahh, Beautiful One, what tragedy is this?
Now that I look more carefully, you are, indeed, Santa Claus!

 
**Darius III:**
Ohh... Oooohhhh!
Santa... Santaaaaaaa!

 
**Santa Alter:**
?! This candle tree moves?!
You two, just what is the meaning of this?

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!

 
**Phantom:**
Die, please. Repent! And surrender what's in that bag!
Santa Claus is the one who should be struck from this world!

 
**Darius III:**
Oooohhhhh!
Presents! Gimme!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well! Only naughty little children try to take things by force like that! We've no choice. Prepare to fight,
Fujimaru!

 
**Santa Alter:**
After all, it is also Santa's duty to give dreamy-eyed children a cold jolt of reality!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, but I don't see any “little children” here!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Santa's more violent than I'd imagined!
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Minor details. Worry not!
All one really needs to be Santa is to hand out presents.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Not even Picts, and raising such a ruckus indoors?
Such poor manners. It's Christmas. Take this fight outside!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Santa Alter:**
Have you learned your lesson, ruffians? The form of Santa Claus pleases me greatly but it is only a temporary one.

 
**Santa Alter:**
My true form is that of Britain's Red Dragon,
Altria, the King of Knights. Remember it well.

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]...
...(looking dejected)

 
**Darius III:**
Ohhh... Santa... Claaaus...
Santa... Claaaaauuss...

 
**Phantom:**
Anguish... Anguish... Anguish...
When I think of what we've done... Oh, the anguish...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Doesn't he look a little odd?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Well, Your Majesty, don't welook like the bad guys here?
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Yes, it is starting to feel that way to me as well.
This being my first job, perhaps I got a bit too hot-headed.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You there. You understand the speech of these other two, correct? Is that tree Darius, aged three, by any chance?

 
**Phantom:**
Yes, he is... His king is, in fact, the green light that burns in Hell, the Lord Cyalume... And who might you be, my lady?

 
**Santa Alter:**
I already told you I was Santa Claus.
Now, accept your presents.

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!

 
**Darius III:**
Ohhhh!
Presents! Gimme!!

 
**Santa Alter:**
There, there.
This is for you.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Since you would die before you could ever use a Noble Phantasm, use this to amass a little motivation, or perhaps a little love.

 
**Lu Bu:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!

 
**Darius III:**
Hurraaaaay!

 
**Santa Alter:**
As for you, Black Mantle, I shall give you... Yes, this.

 
**Phantom:**
Oh! This is the very thing I have lost! My love, my light!
Christine! You've brought her back to me!

 
**Santa Alter:**
As I said, do not come near my reindeer.
We are busy. We have a mountain of work to do.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let us go, Fujimaru. Santa should be as a passing breeze. We must not stay long.

 
**Santa Alter:**
And it is painful to have to leave a party early, since my hunger is never satiated.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well, then&mdash; Farewell, little ones!
Let us meet again next year! Merry Christmas!

 
**Santa Alter:**
All right. They were the perfect companions for some light warm-up. Now it's time for you to work, my reindeer.

 
**Santa Alter:**
From now until the end of Christmas, many more battles await us, I am sure.

 
**Santa Alter:**
At each stop, gather the stockings and bring them to me.
Stockings are the crystallizations of the hearts of children seeking presents...

 
**Santa Alter:**
It is by the power of such magical energy that Santa Claus traverses the globe. In other words, you could call it our fuel.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The more you gather, the greater the reward I shall bestow upon you. Remember that as you go about your work.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The next “Dear Santa” letter is on the 2nd.
Let us build up our party until then!

 
## 2nd Night: Her Name is Little Marie
 
**Santa Alter:**
Good work with your reindeer training. You're fighting Christmas monsters when you have time, right?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Thanks to your efforts, the fuel for my sleigh...
The Santa Points have been building up nicely.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Now I can deliver the next present.
Good work, Fujimaru.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let's go over this one more time Christmas celebrates the birth of a certain person.

 
**Santa Alter:**
It is the mass of Christ, hence the word Christmas.

 
**Santa Alter:**
These days, Christmas Eve is December 24th,
and the 25th itself is Christmas.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But the original period was much longer. His birth was celebrated for days, reaching its peak on the 25th.

 
**Santa Alter:**
In other words, beginning my advance this early is Santa's old way of doing it.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're doing it the classic way.
 
**Santa Alter:**
Of course. Function follows form. Destroying everything thoroughly is the classic way to win.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Advance? Like a military advance?
 
**Santa Alter:**
...
...

 
**Santa Alter:**
I see our destination. Give me your magical energy, Reindeer!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
This “Dear Santa” letter is from Marie, a girl who lives in France.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Two of her friends are always fighting, so she wants a present to bring them together, it says.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Humph. How stupid.
Santa only grants one's own wishes.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I have no presents to bring happiness to other people.
What does this Marie think Christmas is about, anyway?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds like a mistake Marie would make.
 
**Santa Alter:**
That's right. If she wants to bring them together,
she should pick a present herself.

 
**Santa Alter:**
She should do what I did. I once sent two knights who were fighting a single horse, and told them this...

 
**Santa Alter:**
“This is for the one who thinks they're better than the other.” I knew this would test them and form a friendship.

 
**Santa Alter:**
It worked perfectly. They stopped arguing in front of others. Although they were trying so hard not to snap at each other when they smiled, but oh well.

 
**Santa Alter:**
That was Agravain's idea.
Aggy always gave me the best advice.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sounds like a mistake you'd make.
 
**Santa Alter:**
I'm not making any mistakes.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Santa brings gifts.
She does not bring happiness.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Whether the gifts bring happiness depends on if the little ones have been good or not.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Hmm? This should be the insertion point...
But it's a snowy field.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The French Marie is without a doubt a member of the royal family.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I was expecting her Christmas party to be nationwide chaos, with mountains of expensive turkeys...

 
**???:**
Found you!
That's your last airspace violation, Santa Claus!

 
**Santa Alter:**
What!? We're 2,000 meters in the air!
Don't you think that's crazy?

 
**???:**
That's my line!
What's with that hippo sleigh? Are you kidding me?

 
**???:**
Also a date in the sky with Master was going to be my thing! Don't steal it from me!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is that eagle...bird?
 
**Santa Alter:**
That's a hippogriff, Reindeer.
It's often mistaken for a griffin.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I mistake them often myself. Neither is as good as a dragon, so don't waste time remembering.

 
**???:**
ARGH! Don't think that firepower equals strength!
How short-sighted can you be?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wow, that's so cool!
 
**???:**
Huh...it is? Am I... Cool?
I'm used to being called cute...

 
**???:**
...but “cool” is new. You're making me blush... Hehe.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Maybe I'll crush them. More specifically,
I'll smack you hard right between the legs.

 
**???:**
Humph. I don't like that kind of sexual prejudice.
That's not a weak point for me anyway.

 

 
**???:**
Hmmph, target sighted!
Marie, up here! Fire everything you've got!

 
**Santa Alter:**
What!?

 
**Santa Alter:**
We've been hit!
Grab on, Reindeer! We're crash-landing!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Tch. They shot down Santa Claus!
Is this the French way? I knew I shouldn't trust them!

 
**d'Eon:**
That's my line, you suspicious woman!
Go back to Santa Claus village!

 
**Marie:**
Oh my. That's rude to Finland, d'Eon.
The fault lies entirely with this wicked Santa.

 
**Marie:**
Hehehe. I've never felt so violent before.
It's exciting! Shooting a cannon is fun♡

 
**Santa Alter:**
Not interested in negotiations, huh?
You're after my sack of presents, aren't you?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Very well. Santa is destined to be a target for thieves.
I'll deal with you before I go see Marie.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let's go, Master!
We can ride that merry-go-round after we're done!

 
**Marie:**
...Huh? Do I have the wrong person?
Maybe Astolfo's got bad eyesight...

 
**Marie:**
It doesn't matter. Tonight's a festival night!
Little problems will melt away with the snow.

 
**Marie:**
Vive la France!
My dear, gallant Santa, do you like snowball fights?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**d'Eon:**
...Such amazing bladework.
This couldn't be Santa, could it?

 
**Marie:**
Oh, didn't you realize when the fight started?
This isn't the same Santa Claus as before.

 
**d'Eon:**
I-I'm sorry... I wasn't thinking straight...
But my queen, if you noticed then why didn't you stop?

 
**Marie:**
I'm sorry, but I wanted to keep the momentum going!
You had fun too, didn't you Santa?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Of course. It's good to revisit one's childhood.
I'm sorry for being so rough with your knight.

 
**Santa Alter:**
By the way, that well-bred dog...
Are you perhaps Marie?

 
**Marie:**
Yes, I am Marie.
You read my letter, didn't you, Santa?

 
**d'Eon:**
(Dog... That Chimera was a dog? That definitely wasn't a papillon, but if the queen says so...)

 
**Astolfo:**
I'm here! ...Wait.
Is the fight over already? I don't get to fight?

 
**Santa Alter:**
So this is everyone, huh? It seems there was a misunderstanding, but it's solved now.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I'll give you your presents then.
Line up, you violent children.

 
**Marie:**
Okay!
Come on d'Eon, Astolfo, let's line up!

 
**d'Eon:**
Huh? ...I get a present too? Are you actually a nice person, even though you don't look like one?

 
**Santa Alter:**
That last part was unnecessary.
You and I should get along. You have my respect.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Men's attire in France is really elegant, isn't it, Knight?
Give me more details later. I like those frills.

 
**d'Eon:**
I am not cross-dressing!
I am a man as you can see!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...You heard them.
Anything you want to say, Hippo?

 
**Astolfo:**
Why are you asking me?
What's wrong with a girl dressing like a boy?

 
**Astolfo:**
People should wear the clothes that suit them.
I think d'Eon's letting clothes run their life, though...

 
**d'Eon:**
You're too free-spirited! You, Roland...
Are the 12 Paladins filled with nothing with perverts?

 
**Astolfo:**
Huh?
Comparing me to Roland isn't fair!

 
**Astolfo:**
He's the type who wind up in handcuffs.
I get my name in the papers!

 
**Santa Alter:**
I'm glad you're all getting along.
Let me see...

 
**Santa Alter:**
This is for you, Marie.
I hope it gives you inspiration for the Merry-Go-Round.

 
**Marie:**
Oh my! A glass horse!
Thank you, Santa!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Next is the Knight. You get this.

 
**d'Eon:**
A m-maid?
Why do I get a maid outfit? Am I supposed to wear this?

 
**Santa Alter:**
It's a message to at least make better food than the cat.
That is, if anyone will take you at this point.

 
**d'Eon:**
I'll be single for the rest of my life!
Even as a Servant!

 
**Santa Alter:**
I see. I think we'll get along well there, too.
Give me your contact info later.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Now then.

 
**Astolfo:**
...(Excited)

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let's go, Reindeer.
Farewell, and see you next year!

 
**Astolfo:**
H-Hold it&mdash;!
What about me? What do I get, Santa?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Nothing! He who does not fight shall not get presents!
You were too lazy to save Orleans!

 
**d'Eon:**
She's got you there.
Even Atalante showed up as an enemy.

 
**Astolfo:**
What!?
That wasn't my fault!

 
**Astolfo:**
The France chapter ended a long time ago!
That means I couldn't possibly&mdash;oww!?

 
**Marie:**
Oh my. I guess Santa gave you a present after all.

 
**Marie:**
A Halloween pumpkin...
What does that mean?

 
**Astolfo:**
Um... Maybe that I'm cute like a pumpkin?

 
**Astolfo:**
Aww, she said those mean things but she actually loves me... Tehehe.

 
**d'Eon:**
No, I think she's saying you're an idiot who was late for the party. This is a Craft Essence that's past its expiration date.

 
**Marie:**
Oh, I get it! It means
“You won't be in anything until next year's Halloween.”

 
**Astolfo:**
What? &mdash;I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-LE!
That can't be right! I'll be back sooner than that!

 
## 3rd Night: Heartbreak☆Jean Kay
 
**Santa Alter:**
So here we are. This time our “Dear Santa” letter is from Jean Kay, address unknown.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I guess she makes a living as an assassin, so has no specific address. Right now she's hiding in those caves.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you talking about Jing Ke?
 
**Santa Alter:**
It's Jean Kay, I think. How am I supposed to know how to pronounce it, I don't speak Chinese.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did she ask for?
 
**Santa Alter:**
The mental fortitude to remain calm in adversity,
and a pair of easy-to-draw double daggers.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
By the way, Fujimaru.
Do you hear that strange sound?

 
**Santa Alter:**
It's like someone's repeatedly hitting heavy meat with a blunt object, or endlessly pounding a bag filled with sand.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...I've got a bad feeling about this.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I can guess who that is.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
You're pretty perceptive. I wouldn't have guessed.
...Well, once we go inside, we'll find out even if we don't want to.

 
**Santa Alter:**
This time it's a cave, so there's no chimney here.
We'll go in through that door in the front.

 
**Martha:**
Hahh! Hahh! Whew!
What's wrong! With people! On Christmas?!

 
**Martha:**
They say it's about celebrating His birth, so why!
Are all these couples! Exchanging presents!

 
**Martha:**
No, it's fine. It's fine, Martha.
Showing your beloved how you feel is a good thing.

 
**Martha:**
The problem is! Wimps! Who can't even ask a girl out!
Unless it's on Christmas!

 
**Martha:**
And His birthday was October, anyway!

 
**Martha:**
And why are they playing!
Sappy pop songs! On a day! Like this!?

 
**Santa Alter:**
...It fell. No, it snapped.
The chain holding that sandbag just snapped.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I saw 
 

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You've got that right, Martha. If someone wants to send presents, they can do it any time.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I went and got the enemy general's head for my brother the instant the idea came to me. He refused it for some reason, though.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...My Lord said something similar, actually.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I went hunting monsters, and they said they wanted a demon's heart, not their head. “Stop that, it's scary,” they said.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Hehe... Both them and my brother want so little.
It's such a virtue to be so not-greedy.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I think they said something about needing eyeballs a while ago.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
If they want me to do it, I'll pull all the eyeballs off a Demon God pillar, but...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Unfortunately, I've been given no such order.
I wish they'd give me some kind of mission...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...so crazy that it could make you shiver just hearing about it...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Fujimaru, do you know that woman who doesn't know how to work out her stress problems,
or the loyal dog with the broken brakes?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well, it doesn't matter. Excuse me!
I'm told Jean Kay is here!

 
**Martha:**
Huh? Who's there!
How long have you been there?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Since just now. I mean it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I saw nothing. I saw nothing.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Reindeer is right.
We're here to see Jean Kay.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I'm not at all interested in the things you were saying that would freak out Master if they heard them.

 
**Martha:**
&mdash;Ahem. So you're here for Jing Ke, right?

 
**Martha:**
Welcome to this distant cave, which normally no one should ever visit.

 
**Martha:**
I can see you're two... Um, two travelers, right?
Please, sit down.

 
**Martha:**
I'll get dinner ready. Once you have some warm soup,
please kindly get out, okay?

 
**Santa Alter:**
No need for that. Once we're done here we will leave.
Where is Jean Kay?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
You mean Jing Ke?
Oh, she's...

 
**Jing Ke:**
What's up?
Did somebody call me&mdash;?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Oh, looks like we've got more company!
Hey Martha, are you going to cook?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Add in an order of seared beef, too.
Some sea turtle soup would also be great!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Everything you make is delicious, Martha. I don't know why the world's men aren't banging down your door.

 
**Martha:**
You're so lazy! All you do is lay around and you never help with the cooking.

 
**Martha:**
If I had my staff I'd be teaching you a lesson, Jing Ke!
What happened to the normal, gallant you?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Aww. C'mon, just make it! Pretty please!
I really like the meat dishes you make!

 
**Jing Ke:**
Yukhoe? Is that what you call that stuff? Those thin slices of beef you eat raw. It's so good with wine!

 
**Jing Ke:**
But how do you manage to grind the meat without a blade?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Wha&mdash;t is this?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Definitely a drunk!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Definitely a cutie!
 

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hmm? Ushiwakamaru, did you get smaller?
What's with the black clothes? Going to war?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I'm sorry, honored guests.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Jing Ke began drinking to recover from a traumatic event, and that was ten days ago. Now she's totally toasted.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I see... She couldn't wait for me, huh?
I should've come here first. Forgive me.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But don't worry. Santa Claus is here for you,
little drunkard... No, I mean office lady!

 
**Santa Alter:**
I've come to deliver your present!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
What? Did you say Santa Claus?
Now that you mention it, you do dress like one...

 
**Martha:**
...Heh, you've got guts. What makes you think you can just come back and... Never mind.

 
**Martha:**
I'm gonna smash up your face!
Get ready, you villain!

 
**Jing Ke:**
What? Another Santa? Give me a gift card for a good yakiniku place! I want some beef tongue!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I knew they'd attack us!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did Santa do?
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Looks like this is starting to make sense.

 
**Santa Alter:**
There's lots I want to ask, but it can wait until after the battle.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You young ladies who want to spend your Christmas having a party in a gloomy cave&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
This is a royal order! Once I beat you, go try and find yourselves boyfriends!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jing Ke:**
I lost&mdash;!
So close! I just needed nine more steps!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
I give up&mdash;!

 
**Martha:**
Tch... How could I lose twice to this thief...
Is it the staff? ...Am I not cut out for a staff after all?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Hmph. You've finally calmed down, huh?
You seem to have it out for Santa Claus.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Something happened, right? Tell me.

 
**Martha:**
What do you mean? A Santa Claus came here before.

 
**Martha:**
When I said, “Yay! Presents! Santa, I want a new set of German cooking knives!” and got all excited...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...That Santa made us sign some weird form and then put our stamp on it...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...and the next thing we knew we were forced to buy expensive presents with our own money...

 
**Martha:**
That's not all. When they found out we didn't have enough money, they confiscated our stuff!

 
**Martha:**
What is that? Some kind of new sales technique?
When did Santa Claus turn into a shady company?

 
**Santa Alter:**
That's impossible!
Santa Claus is a friend to children everywhere!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...But it seems your story is true.
As a fellow Santa, I am upset.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That Santa must be a fake.
 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Come to think of it... Santa Alter's wearing black.
I didn't realize that she was Santa Claus at first.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
But the other Santa looked just like you'd expect Santa Claus to look.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Santa Alter is a good evil Santa Claus.
 
**Jing Ke:**
Hmm. That's a complicated way of calling her.
So, is she good or bad?

 
**Martha:**
...A dark Santa, huh? One that gives awful presents to bad kids.

 
**Martha:**
Kids might think she's a mean Santa, but objectively speaking, she punishes evil kids so they'll mend their ways.

 
**Santa Alter:**
That's not true at all.
I just give people the gifts they need.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I have no intention on lecturing anyone.
If you want one, you can ask an Avenger.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Anyway, I'm sorry that happened to you. Let me see...
I didn't expect to need presents for three people.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You, cold-looking woman. This is for you. The real one isn't here, but if you have this with you you'll find it.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
A-A ship? I might be able to do something with a small boat, but a ship this large...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Well, whatever... If I sneak aboard at night and take the boss out first, the crew will all belong to me.

 
**Santa Alter:**
That's a dangerous thought. As expected from a genius dog like you. I can see why your brother has such trouble.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Next...

 
**Martha:**
Huh? I get something too?
You show compassion, even to those you fought?

 
**Martha:**
I'm sorry. I misjudged you.
You are pure-hearted, and a real Santa Claus&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
This is for you. You like these, right?

 
**Martha:**
Oh my.

 
**Martha:**
...Wait a minute! I don't need this!
Why would a Saint want to get buff?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Hey, what do I get?
Don't I get a present?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Of course. You get this, Jean Kay.

 
**Santa Alter:**
This talisman will help you do your job elegantly,
and not panic in front of your target.

 
**Jing Ke:**
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She loved it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...She thinks it's funny?
 

 
**Jing Ke:**
Wonderful! I love this bearded guy&mdash;!
Wow. That kinda got me. That hit me right in the kokoro.

 
**Jing Ke:**
I'm gonna go assassinate this guy&ndash;! He's got a face that just makes you want to stab him from behind&mdash;!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He was already assassinated...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's crazy...
 

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
...I'm sorry. Jing Ke almost never gets drunk,
but when she does she's like this...

 
**Martha:**
She's been drinking ever since that Santa Claus got her... It's understandable.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Hmm... This Santa Claus was good enough to deceive tough-looking girls like you, huh?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well, it doesn't matter.
My job is done here.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let's go, Fujimaru!
To the next set of troubled children!

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
They left, huh?
She turned out to be a good Santa, but...

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Why was my Lord wearing a reindeer costume?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
No, it was very cute, so it was a good Christmas present for me.

 
**Martha:**
Y-You think she's just into that?
That's how Riders are. Anyway&mdash;

 
**Martha:**
...I don't see Jing Ke, do you?

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
Oh.

 
**Ushiwakamaru:**
&mdash;Okay, it's too late!
Let's forget about the bearded gentleman!

 
## 4th Night: Penname, Daddy-Long-Legs
 
**Emiya:**
The keel's done for! It'll break any moment now! Isn't it time a certain someone took responsibility for this mess?!

 
**Robin:**
Don't look at me! This isn't my fault! This whole thing was supposed to be the two of us going on a fishing trip!

 
**Robin:**
Being equally matched at hunting in the woods, we were supposed to take our contest to sea, so to speak.
That's when&mdash;

 
**Emiya:**
That's when&mdash; A certain idiot stowed away on our boat and waited for his chance while the two of us were busy in the hold.

 
**Emiya:**
And saying how he wanted to meet the ladies of the Southern Lands, steered our boat straight out to sea!

 
**Emiya:**
Isn't that right?

 
**Emiya/Robin:**
“King David!”
“Old Man David!”

 
**David:**
Hmm... It's one thing when young ladies call my name...
But having it shouted by you gentlemen is rather unpleasant.

 
**David:**
Now, you two. Weren't you ever taught that you must respect your elders?

 
**David:**
By the way, I'd rather like to return to the shore now. What do you say?

 
**David:**
What? The sail got broken and we ran out of our magical energy?

 
**David:**
Then this is an emergency!
Quickly, you two! Jump into the water!

 
**David:**
The boat can still hold my weight if I'm alone.
The magical energy stored should hold out too! It's simple math!

 
**Robin:**
Arrrghh! It's no use, I am about to snap&mdash;! Old man,
how can you act so high and mighty at a time like this?

 
**Emiya:**
That's how every one of the Kings of Old behaves!
In fact, I can think of one who's like a walking mass of arrogance...

 
**Robin:**
Wah! This isn't the time to stand around glaring at each other! Let's hurry up and toss some cargo overboard, at least!

 
**Robin:**
If we get done in by something like this, we'll be the laughingstock of the Servant World!

 
**David:**
The Servant World? So that's how you refer to it?
That's good to know. Thank you!

 
**David:**
Then in that case, may I ask who the current top comedian is there? I'd like to know for future reference.

 
**Robin:**
Oh, probably that one girl... The one with the dragon wings and the horns growing out of her head.

 
**Robin:**
There are lots of other talented ones too, but they fall short of her.

 
**Emiya:**
What are you babbling on about? As of now, I'd nominate the three of us for the biggest stooges!

 
**David:**
Oh yes, I'm sorry! That reminds me, do the two of you know the tale of Carneades?

 
**David:**
When a ship sank upon a stormy sea, one man was fortunate and survived the wreck by clinging to a small piece of driftwood.

 
**David:**
But there was another fortunate man who survived as well, and he swam toward the first man. Therein arose a problem.

 
**David:**
The driftwood was large enough to keep one man afloat,
but with two, it would certainly sink. Thus, the man&mdash;

 
**Robin:**
Hey, Red Mantle! What do you say we lighten our load by one person right now? Then you and I can continue our contest afterward!

 
**Emiya:**
For once, I agree with you, huntsman!

 
**Emiya:**
This is a good chance for us. We can compete to see who's the better Archer right here and now!

 
**David:**
That saddens me. Nothing ever comes from contention...
And, it's already known that I am the superior Archer...

 
**David:**
But I suppose if I were to knock you off the boat defending myself, none could blame me for it. So I shall join in your contest!

 
**David:**
Despite my appearance, I was a King of many victories.
I must warn you that I am skilled. Extremely skilled.

 
**David:**
If there were a ranking of “Most-Victorious Kings” in the Servant World, I assure you, I would occupy its top spot.

 
**Robin:**
Oh, is that so? Fine by me. Killing kings is what I do,
so I'll put you out of your misery now!

 
**???:**
Most-Victorious King? Superior Archer?
Hmph. You 3-Stars certainly talk a big game.

 
**Robin:**
!!! Look above!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Hohoho!
Step aside, you're in the way of my landing!

 
**Robin:**
...And who might you be?
We were in the middle of something just now, you know?

 
**Santa Alter:**
The invincible Santa that descends upon Christmas like this storm! That is who I am.

 
**Robin:**
Huh? Santa? Really?
But wait! The sky? You came from the sky?

 
**Robin:**
Meaning, you have some means of getting off this boat?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Naturally, I do. Due to this storm, I have left my sleigh and reindeer waiting for me above the clouds.

 
**Santa Alter:**
A proper Servant must think upon their Master's safety.
Isn't that so, Red Archer?

 
**Robin:**
Oh-hoh! Is this Servant an acquaintance of yours,
Red Mantle?

 
**Emiya:**
&mdash;(remains silent with an unreadable expression on his face)

 
**David:**
Abishag! It's you, Abishag! O Beautiful One, there can be no doubt that you are my Abishag!

 
**David:**
Ohh, to think that we would both become Servants and meet again like this! I am truly blessed!

 
**David:**
Come, warm this chilled body of mine as you did in the past. Come, hesitate not.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You are mistaken, King David.
I am Santa Alter, not Abishag.

 
**David:**
??? But with beauty such as yours you must be Abishag.
Ah. Perhaps you do not recognize me as a youth?

 
**David:**
I was an old man when I took you as my wife.
But fear not, for my heart is as true as ever it was.

 
**David:**
Be I shepherd, king, or aged man, I declare that the contents of my mind, at base, are ever unchanged!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Oh? That is well, then. In that case, you were of sound mind when proclaiming yourself the “Most-Victorious King”?

 
**David:**
Huh? Uh, yes, I suppose that...
I was indeed powerful in war.

 
**Emiya:**
...Fool... You've dug your own grave...

 
**Santa Alter:**
Then I shall see your strength tested.
Gift distribution can wait till after.

 
**Santa Alter:**
En garde, Archers!
This sword shall rectify your arrogance!

 
**David:**
Sorry, one moment, please! As I, personally, am not terribly powerful, won't you assist me, gentlemen?

 
**Robin:**
Huh? Are you completely mad?
All we want is to catch a ride on that flying sleigh...

 
**Robin:**
Though she just might do our bidding if we defeat her.
If it's a fight you want, I will gladly comply.

 
**Robin:**
A Saber-class challenging Archer-class Servants to a fight. This won't even be funny.

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Robin:**
Gwaah&mdash;?! Man, I messed up... Now that I look closer, you're actually a Rider-class, aren't you?

 
**Santa Alter:**
You have an Archer who attacks with a staff.
A Rider who attacks with a sack of presents should be fine as well.

 
**David:**
Hahaha! Well, there's no comeback we can make to that.
That said, my Noble Phantasm is pretty Archer-like though.

 
**Emiya:**
...Ahem. I assume we're all calmed down now?
Why, exactly, did you come here, Santa Rider?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Fool. I did not come here at my own behest.
I came in response to a “Dear Santa” letter.

 
**Emiya:**
...I see. I have a pretty good idea who the sender was.
I'll bet he asked for jewels to delight his many wives with, right?

 
**Emiya:**
Really, writing letters to Santa as a full-grown man...
What a problematic adult. Seriously.

 
**David:**
Yes, seriously problematic.
One should limit one's childish dreams.

 
**Emiya:**
What? King David... Um.
Pardon me, but wasn't it you?

 
**David:**
Of course it wasn't.
The only one I send my prayers to is our Lord in Heaven.

 
**David:**
And anyhow, isn't the idea of Santa Claus a bit scary?
It's nothing but trouble to receive gifts from someone who wishes nothing in return.

 
**Emiya:**
If it wasn't me and it wasn't King David,
that means&mdash;

 
**Robin:**
All right, all right! It was me, okay? I sent it!
Call it a temporary fit of madness&ndash;!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Don't be embarrassed. All are equally accepted in the eyes of Santa Claus. Especially you in the green. You have worked hard.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Your method of supporting your Master from the shadows rather than coddling them is most praise-worthy. Though a tad under-handed.

 
**Santa Alter:**
In contrast, you in the red. You spoil your Master too much. What are you, the mother of an exam student preparing for Exam Day?

 
**Emiya:**
Uh-uh! I object strongly to that!
I'm not at all overprotective...

 
**Santa Alter:**
These presents are for you two.
Accept them gratefully.

 
**Robin:**
!!!! Black Key Assortments?

 
**David:**
Wow, what an impressive-looking sword!
(rather half-heartedly)

 
**Santa Alter:**
Don't get too happy yet. Your real present is being prepared elsewhere. I sent word ahead of time, so it should arrive soon.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Farewell, then.
Keep your fights moderate during Christmas times!

 
**Emiya:**
She comes and goes like a storm.
I didn't even realize the real storm had passed.

 
**Emiya:**
Ah, well. At least this means we won't have to listen to the tale of Carneades now.

 
**David:**
What? Who spoke of Carneades' tale as an example to follow? That's horrendous. Let us put that man to death.

 
**Emiya/Robin:**
It was you! You haven't learned anything since the Uriah incident, have you?!

 
**David:**
Now, now. No matter how strained the situation, I am not the kind of man who would be so insensitive as that.

 
**Robin:**
...Maybe we really should just toss him overboard?
We'd be doing his Master a favor, don't you think?

 
**Emiya:**
...Agreed. His existence will only be a bad example.
Let's just say King David went back to Okeanos.

 
**David:**
I apologize, it seems your words were true. I know I am wrong now, please forgive me. Our Lord in Heaven says so, too.

 
**David:**
Rather, why don't we reflect on our battle just now?
Despite our loss, don't you think the three of us make a good team?

 
**David:**
Nameless One, with your AOE Noble Phantasm.
And Faceless One, with his single-target Noble Phantasm.

 
**David:**
And I, using aggressive evasive tactics to avoid harm,
sealing the enemy's special attacks before they are launched.

 
**David:**
Even humbly speaking, wouldn't we be a rather invincible team? We should become friends, shouldn't we?

 
**Robin:**
Hmm, that's true enough.
We wouldn't have any blind spots as a team.

 
**Emiya:**
True. We wouldn't be the most powerful team, but we're all elite Archers. With the three of us combined, there'd be no enemy who could&mdash;

 
**Elisabeth:**
Hi! I received your order and have come accordingly!
This is the location of the special Christmas concert, right?

 
**Emiya:**
Ugh, a Lancer?!

 
**Elisabeth:**
According to the client's order, since we are floating out at sea, I can let loose and sing as loud as I want...

 
**Elisabeth:**
I won't let anyone escape me tonight! Now let's jump straight into my opening number, “Love is Dracul!”

 
**Robin:**
Ah, this is the end. We're all going to the underworld with that AOE Noble Phantasm...

 
**Santa Alter:**
It seems the Home-Delivered Concert from Hell has begun.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh! Those accursed Archers, will drop like flies.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 Welcome back, Santa.
 
**Santa Alter:**
Th-thank you. So you've learned to give Santa a proper greeting after all? You seem to be understanding your role as a reindeer better.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 Did something happen down there at all?
 
**Santa Alter:**
What? I merely sent them an event worthy of Christmas.

 
**Santa Alter:**
After all, they were wondering who the top comedian in the Servant World was at present.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
In any case, that concludes our detour.
Our next “Dear Santa” letter&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
...comes from Uruk, from a boy named Gilgamesh?!

 
## 5th Night: Little Gilgamesh
 
**Santa Alter:**
This is the address of our next letter-sender, but&mdash;

 
**Gilgamesh:**
My letter should be arriving soon. Not that I normally take any notice of Christmas or whatever it is&mdash;

 
**Gilgamesh:**
That wretched Saber is sure to dress in that manner of getup. Such frivolity... Who would've thought she would answer to such needs so faithfully.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It is praise-worthy for a king to endeavor to meet his subjects' expectations. Even I could perhaps learn from her example. But of course, I won't.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
No, that is not the vital point in this. What I should truly take note of is the institution of Christmas!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It is said that however reserved and modest a woman can be, on Christmas, she cannot help but speak the truth of her heart!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ahh, I can't imagine any future but one in which she will confess her feelings for me! Very well. I shall allow it! Thank me for the good service!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now, come quickly, Dark Santa! I shall make you understand our difference through my treasury!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fwahahaha! And then, perhaps I will say something like,
“You, yourself, are my Christmas present, aren't you?”

 
**Santa Alter:**
We're leaving, Fujimaru.
This house appears to be empty.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 Yes, indeed.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 Yes, indeed.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Reindeer! We have the night off thanks to Gilgamesh's grand delusions.

 
**Santa Alter:**
And we happen to be floating above a great city.
What don't we enjoy ourselves in its entertainment quarter?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Though there are but rustic eateries here in ancient Uruk,
they should have good, simple food to dine upon.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I, myself, favor that dish of wheat flour mixed with water and stuffed with various fillings that is then baked upon an iron plate and then basted with sauce afterward.

 
**Santa Alter:**
 
I imagine even you could make something like th&mdash;
What?

 
**Santa Alter:**
We've been encapsulated by a strange space!
Don't leave my side, Fujimaru!

 
**Santa Alter:**
!!! ...Where are we?
This does not appear to be a normal place...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...Pardon me... Hello there.
Miss, are you Santa Claus?

 
**Jack:**
You are Santa, aren't you?
I mean, you're carrying all those presents, after all.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Yes, I am Santa. And what manner of beings are you?
Are you the ghosts that haunt this place?

 
**Jack:**
We...are not ghosts or phantoms, I think...
But I don't think we are human either...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes... Neither Jack nor I really know what we are...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We didn't have names either...
All we could do is lie here and look at the town...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But tonight, um...

 
**Jack:**
Since it's...Christmas...
We were thinking we'd like something warm too.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...Yeah. That's why, even though we knew that it was wrong...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...we forcefully summoned you here “inside” ourselves.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...I see. You must be the unfulfilled spirits of young girls.
Your lives ended while still innocent, and ignorant of love.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I see you've gained a sense of self under the light of Christmas. ...Though only due to your sense of loneliness.

 
**Jack:**
We aren't that complicated.
But Alice only had memories of the hospital, so...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
What? Well, you only had memories of a dark sewer,
Jack. I don't think that's a good thing. Not at all.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
That's why... At least for one day today, we...
We wanted to feel “chosen” by someone too...

 
**Santa Alter:**
...I see. So you've never had your names called,
or have never been chosen by another?

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;Upon this extraordinary day, the two of you felt that you, alone, were not special?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 This sounds like a job for Santa Alter.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 Aren't you going to give them presents?
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
That I cannot do. I cannot give presents to any who have not written me letters.

 
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**
...

 
**Santa Alter:**
However! If you wish it from the bottom of your heart,
declare it! Wanting something just because you're lonely means nothing!

 
**Santa Alter:**
You should want something because it looks like fun, or simply because you want it! There, now. Show some courage!

 
**Jack:**
O&mdash;Okay.
T-to be honest, we...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
We want to play like everyone else does!
We want a dream that's more fun than this!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Please, Santa Claus!
Please give us presents too!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well spoken. I shall answer to this courage. If you have no letter, then come take your presents by force!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Apologies for keeping you waiting, little ones.
Now, let us begin this merry party!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**
Aww... We...lost...
I guess there won't be...any Christmas for us...

 
**Santa Alter:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Augh&mdash;!
I&ndash;have&ndash;been&ndash;defeated&mdash;!

 
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**
...Huh?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Well fought, my brave little ones!
As promised, I shall now give you Christmas presents!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Ms. Santa!

 
**Jack:**
Ah... Ohh...
Presents... So many presents!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Santa!
 
**Santa Alter:**
Your face says, “So you do have some good points,”
Fujimaru. ...Of course, I do. I am the ally of all children.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 Alter-chan!
 
**Santa Alter:**
Do not call me, “Alter-chan!”
Know your place as a reindeer and show some restraint!

 

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Thank you... Thank you, Santa Claus! But is it really okay for us to have so many presents&mdash;?

 
**Jack:**
Th-that's right... Aren't there many other children waiting for their presents too?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh. You needn't worry about that.
I have only one more stop to make.

 
**Santa Alter:**
What's more, these are merely the spoils of your victorious battle. Now, what shall I give you for your actual, individual presents&mdash;?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Here, take this!
These are the presents I have chosen especially for you!

 
**Jack:**
Ohh... Ohhhh&mdash;!
This... This is...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Hurray&mdash;! It's a reindeer&mdash;!
A humongous, humongous reindeer&mdash;!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Two little girls running in gleeful circles around Asterios...
Heh! That's what a proper Christmas should be.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...So you already had a reindeer, 
 
**Santa Alter:**
Fool, that one is only for show. If Asterios were to start running, lightning would streak the sky.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Which would frighten all the little children.
The best thing for this prince is to have him do nothing.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Should we go call Euryale?
 
**Santa Alter:**
Certainly not. If that wicked goddess were here,
she would turn these pure, young girls into demons!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...In any case, our work here is done. Even if it is only a dream for one night, enjoy yourselves heartily.

 
**Jack:**
Ah... Wait, Santa!

 
**Jack:**
...Thank you.
Never mind me, but thank you for granting Alice's wish.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Yes, thank you, Santa, and thank you, Jack.
Even though I was scared at first, the party was fun!

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
But I'm glad. It was only because we waited patiently like the fake Santa told us to...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
...that we got to meet the real Santa Claus.

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;Wait.
What do you speak of?

 
**Jack:**
...Right. Before you came here, another Santa Claus came too. But...

 
**Jack:**
...while that Santa was talking with us, they suddenly said, “Uh-oh. This won't do!”

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
“Since I'm not the real Santa Claus, I won't be able to fulfill your wishes. But the real Santa Claus is sure to show up soon.”

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
“Please be good girls and wait patiently until then. What? If you can't do that, I'll try to do something for you next year.”

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
And after saying that, that Santa disappeared somewhere. She may have been a fake, but she was a cool Santa too!

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Well, good-bye, Santa! And Santa's reindeer!
Thank you for bringing presents all the way out here!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...A fake Santa. I'd been ignoring it, but now it seems a showdown is inevitable.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Before I deliver my final present, I must punish this insolent cur. Fujimaru, next up - a showdown!

 
## 6th Night: Fake Santa, Caesar
 
**Caesar:**
Welcome to the snowy fields of the final showdown!
Of course, I was the fake Santa!

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;(Tired Sigh)

 
**Caesar:**
W-What's with that sigh? A duel in a blizzard should be incredibly exciting!

 
**Caesar:**
Now, let me answer all your questions!
I'm ready!

 
**Caesar:**
Why did I become Santa Claus?
Why is Caesar so plump?

 
**Caesar:**
What kind of beauty was Cleopatra?
What's the present going to be on the last day?

 
**Caesar:**
Everything! Everything! My swift tongue shall melt away all your anger and doubts!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Shut up, you red igloo!
I've no interest in your babbling!

 
**Caesar:**
Igloo? Oh, those houses they make out of snow.
I stand strong against adversity, so it's a good metaphor.

 
**Caesar:**
But are you sure you can't wait just a little?
Don't you want to know the story?

 
**Caesar:**
No, you should learn the whole thing!
It was on a starry night, when I went to Darius' castle.

 
**Caesar:**
He mistook me for Santa Claus, and became very happy.
I had no choice but to take his things.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That makes no sense!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why didn't you have a choice?
 

 
**Caesar:**
Am I supposed to tell someone who's overjoyed to see Santa that they've got the wrong guy?

 
**Caesar:**
I could do not that, for I am Caesar.
But I had no presents to give out.

 
**Caesar:**
So I borrowed things from Darius.
So I could use them as presents, you see.

 
**Caesar:**
Though I did have Phantom, who just happened to be there, sign off as the buyer.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you a demon!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did Phantom ever do to you?
 

 
**Caesar:**
But in the end, I was just a temporary Santa Claus.
I couldn't give them what they truly wanted.

 
**Caesar:**
Unable to bear their sad crying, I crossed the river and the next thing I knew I was in France.

 
**Caesar:**
There was a very pure-hearted knight. She... No, he?
No, She? Anyway, I did my work there, too.

 
**Caesar:**
I heard they wished to sell their old possessions and I bought everything they owned.

 
**Caesar:**
I was fortunate to have the funds from Darius.
One of their possessions was a treasure of the French Royal family.

 
**Caesar:**
They begged me to return it,
so I sold it back to them for ten times the price.

 
**Caesar:**
“Are you really a famous spy, d'Eon?
Maybe the enemy just lets you go because you're cute?”

 
**Caesar:**
I couldn't bear to see the Queen bullying her like that.
She was almost in tears.

 
**Caesar:**
So I went to the mountains and hid, where I found an oriental beauty plotting to assassinate an Emperor.

 
**Caesar:**
“This time, the Emperor shall die by my hand&mdash;”

 
**Caesar:**
Could any man not be struck by the sight of her meditating beneath that waterfall?

 
**Caesar:**
Fortunately, I'm half an emperor myself. I told her I could give her good advice, and persuaded her to lend me her daggers&mdash;

 
**Santa Alter:**
Enough! Silence!
You're a walking fraud machine!

 
**Caesar:**
Humph. I'm a victim too, you know.

 
**Caesar:**
Everywhere I go, people call me Santa Claus!

 
**Caesar:**
I'm a general and a politician. You could say it's my job to live up to people's expectations.

 
**Caesar:**
Thus, even if I knew I was fake, I had no choice but to play the role. Though I did have fun.

 
**Caesar:**
By the way, do you know why they all think I'm Santa Claus? I have no idea.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I mean, you look just like...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Surprised you survived this far, actually.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
...I see.  I'm forcing myself to wear this embarrassing outfit, yet you don't have to do anything for children to love you...

 
**Santa Alter:**
I have no choice but to kill you!
For the sake of the world, and Santa Claus!

 
**Caesar:**
Hahaha! That's the true Santa Claus for you!

 
**Caesar:**
To be honest, I was getting tired of being mistaken for Santa Claus and having to run away!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Then stop causing trouble!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You can't live without making trouble, huh?
 

 
**Caesar:**
I'm bored, though!
Nero and Caligula won't play with me!

 
**Caesar:**
And Cleopatra is avoiding me! How can I be Caesar if I don't cause trouble for all these lovey-dovey couples!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you just have a grudge against people!?
 

 
**Caesar:**
Hahahaha! I guess you found me out!
It's time to fight, then!

 
**Caesar:**
If I defeat you, I will take the presents, and become the True Santa, that's fine with me!

 
**Caesar:**
The throne of the rare Servant shall be mine!
Now hand it over, Dark Santa!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caesar:**
Humph... The wind...stopped...
Is this the end...of my battle?

 
**Caesar:**
But...it's not so bad... It was hard for me, too...
After falling at the hands of the true Santa, I can finally...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mr. Caesar...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mr. Igloo...
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;Humph.

 
**Caesar:**
Jump!
Hahaha! That was close! The snow is so slippery!

 
**Santa Alter:**
He moves around so fast...
He's like a seal on ice!

 
**Caesar:**
I'd prefer you called me a dancing snowman.
Hmm, but I can't stop. I can't stop!

 
**Caesar:**
My plan to take over the role of protagonist and grab the star of glory is ruined!

 
**Caesar:**
But this is for the best!

 
**Caesar:**
The star of the festival should be a beautiful Servant,
not someone like me!

 
**Caesar:**
Farewell Dark Santa! Farewell Reindeer! The Christmas nights are at an end, and the 25th is upon us soon!

 
**Caesar:**
Gather stockings, and a Christmas Eve miracle shall be yours!

 
**Santa Alter:**
...He rolled all the way home, huh?
We won't be able to catch him.

 
**Santa Alter:**
But this solves the problem. The fake Santa is gone and will never deceive people again.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't think we're done with Caesar...
 
**Santa Alter:**
...True. To be honest, when I heard “fake,”
I was imagining a different Roman emperor.

 
**Santa Alter:**
There's another Red Saber...
Someday, I'll have to settle things with her.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A Christmas Eve Miracle?
 
**Santa Alter:**
I-I wouldn't know.
Forget it. It's for your own good.

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Fujimaru, there's one night left.
There's still one Dear Santa letter.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I look forward to finding out what kind of child awaits us.

 
## 7th Night: Attack! The Alter Next Door
 
**Santa Alter:**
At last, it's time, Fujimaru.
Tonight shall be our last and greatest work.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The last “Dear Santa” letter is from an Alter, address unknown.

 
**Santa Alter:**
An evil Servant, crawling in the abyss of a curse...
In other words, like me.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Her present request is for
“A board game everyone can have fun playing together.”

 
**Santa Alter:**
It's a game like the Japanese sugoroku, where you roll the dice to advance your piece, and buy up properties on a game board.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The players buy land, charging tolls and usage fees to strip the other players of their fortunes and become rich.

 
**Santa Alter:**
There are many ways to clear the game, but the most common is to reach a certain amount, or bankrupt all the other players.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Below us is a Servant who would desire such a game.
Exciting, isn't it?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Let's go. Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to pray. Don't forget to be sadistic.

 
**Santa Alter:**
As Evil Santa Claus,
it's time for me to perform my last job!

 
**Santa Alter:**
I have arrived!
Santa Clause descends to the sound of jingling bells!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;This is awful. This is the worst.
The worst possible woman who could've come.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne d'Arc Alter?
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I thought it was just that disgusting Servant,
but you're here too, huh Fujimaru?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What does a pure-hearted Master want with a fallen woman like me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
L-Lovely Christmas decorations!
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How?
What part of all this is luxurious?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The spirits did this on their own.
It's not my taste. I would've used a burning stake motif.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Or what? Will you be my straw doll Fujimaru?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
A straw doll, crucified and burning.
I like that. It's enticing.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If you will, I'll forget about what happened before.
It won't matter, because you'll be dead!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
Don't you dare bite my Master, rabid dog.
You're the one who sent me a letter.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh&mdash;I was shocked when I saw the name on the envelope. A girl who's nothing but hatred towards what is good, making a wish?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Also, the handwriting was very easy to read.
I thought you couldn't write.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I studied! Is that bad!? Those scribblings I made were so ugly it made me retch.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Heh. That's just like you,  getting rid of anything you don't like.

 
**Santa Alter:**
And why does it matter if they're ugly?
No one will see them.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Humph. You're not thinking hard enough. I'm a perfectionist. You know, if you sign a contract with bad handwriting&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Enough about that.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Why are you calling yourself Santa?
Bring out the real Santa.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Are you blind? Or just stupid?
I've brought many presents to children.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I may not be a Saint, but I'm a real Santa Claus.
Fujimaru's trust is proof of that.

 
**Santa Alter:**
The reason I started this was to fling this present in your face, but now this is my real job.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I can't be a Saint, but I'm not a fake.
Right, my Reindeer?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Santa Alter is a real Santa Claus.
 
**Santa Alter:**
Indeed. You may deny my words, but not those of Fujimaru. Right, Dark Jeanne?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Santa Alter is a veteran Santa.
 
**Santa Alter:**
I don't know if there are veteran Santas.
But maybe you're right.

 

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hah&mdash;
I see. This is an elaborate way of pranking me, huh?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You probably thought I was spending Christmas lonely by myself, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But too bad! I'm having fun every day!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I've got so many wonderful friends here with me!

 
**Pierres A to G:**
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”

 
**Santa Alter:**
A horde of spirits?
You haven't been using them to&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's right! We're all having fun playing a board game!
Games are fun! Games are great!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The weak endlessly trod the path of the weak,
and the strong endlessly take from the weak&mdash;

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Stealing the flesh and blood off the other players as they scream and cry is wonderful.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Yes&mdash; I am in first place by far! I have the most capital! Monopoly is fun! Monopoly is great!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Hmm? It doesn't seem like that much of a difference...
There's about a 10,000 dollar difference between 1st and 2nd place&mdash;

 
**Pierre D:**
“Help me!”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He just took the lead.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Jeanne owes Pierre a million dollars...
 

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, I'm sorry. My hand slipped.
Let's start over. Too bad!

 
**Pierre D:**
“Help me!”

 
**Santa Alter:**
...How wicked.
You haven't repented at all, have you?

 
**Santa Alter:**
You'll never make any friends like this, and you definitely won't get to be a Servant.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Humph. I don't want to be a Servant.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't need a Master.
Why would I want to join you, anyway?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I'm fine being alone. I'm fine being alone.
I should atone for my sins all by myself.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't want anyone's help&mdash;least of all the help of Fujimaru, the one who defeated me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Jeanne Alter...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, are you sympathetic? Or disgusted?
It doesn't matter. You're annoying me anyway.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You need to play the game fair, though...
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
How rude. I play fair!
Wait, is that what you're thinking about here!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I just used Jeanne Rule #3:
Jeanne gets to do whatever she wants three times!

 

 
**Santa Alter:**
I guess nothing we say matters...
We'll have to fight.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's just what I want. Pierres, get ready.
You want to work off some of that stress, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Torture them. Just like the trials you gave to me in life! Torture them slowly!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Humph, by the way... I've been wondering,
but did you forget how to talk like a Saint?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, I haven't forgotten. This is just for today.
I mean, you wouldn't want me using fancy words, right?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Can't you tell? I'm trying to match you. I'm trying to use words your puny, violent brain will understand!

 
**Santa Alter:**
It must be hard. I understand your pain.
I recognize your frustration myself.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Because I was trying to match your level, and it's been making me want to throw up.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you're both good friends!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're both Alter!
 

 
**Santa Alter/Jeanne Alter:**
Would you shut up!?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Humph. I guess that's all you can expect out of spirits.
The only ones I can rely on are Gilles and the wyverns.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
So, what will you do? Keep playing?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I spend my days doing nothing but cursing at the bottom of the Earth. I'll fight as much as you like.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She hasn't changed at all...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She hasn't learned a thing!
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
That's right, Fujimaru.
The battle will continue until we defeat her mentally.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Losing won't teach her anything.
She'll just try and claim we never won.

 
**Santa Alter:**
This particular child needs an especially nasty punishment.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...What?
Do you have some kind of trump card?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Of course. Will you still talk about staying down here forever after you get this present?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, her expression changed.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, I kind of know how you feel.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
How does it feel to look at your light... Light?
Well, I guess it's light.

 
**Santa Alter:**
This is what will happen if you stay down here.
At this rate, there might even be Jeanne Lily.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
&mdash;I'm going back to purgatory.
I've got better things to do than play here.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'll build up my Spirit Origin and become a Servant,
and next time I'll impale that stupid wannabe Saint!

 
**Pierres:**
“Oooh!” “We're free!” “We're free!”
“We're saved!” “Thank you!” “Thank you!”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Oh, but first, I forgot something.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Let's go, Bishop. You're going to help me with my trials in purgatory, okay?

 
**Pierres:**
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”

 
**Santa Alter:**
...All right. That's the last of the Dear Santa letters.
We've handed out all the presents.

 
**Santa Alter:**
My job is done.
Good work, Fujimaru.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I couldn't have finished this without you.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Without you, I would've given up after the first person.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...I may not look it, but I get bored easily and have a short temper. I'm sure you didn't notice.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sure, yeah.
 

 
**Santa Alter:**
I like that. It's good for a Master to be able to get along with their Servants.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...
...

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Hmm. So even that's not enough to get my point across, huh? Fine. Get on your knees and lower your head.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I will point my sword at your shoulders, but I won't cut you. Just bear it for a moment.

 
**Santa Alter:**
&mdash;Once again, I recognize you,
Fujimaru. I won't forget what has happened over these last 10 days.

 
**Santa Alter:**
You are my knight, my follower, and my leader.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Please keep your light shining into the future.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...Now then, the time has come, it seems.
Our busy Christmas is over.

 
**Santa Alter:**
I have one final present for you.
A justly deserved reward. Take it.

 
**Santa Alter:**
...In other words, a new fighter.
I don't need to say anything more, do I?

 
**Santa Alter:**
Chaldea's system has its flaws, so you'll have to start over from scratch. But that's all right.

 
**Santa Alter:**
Thanks to its flaws, and its vagueness, so many encounters are possible. It's a good thing.

 
**Santa Alter:**
My blade is with you!
You can ride on my sleigh any time you want!

 
**Santa Alter:**
Farewell, my Master!
&mdash;Merry Christmas!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!?

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, it's Senpai!
They suddenly appeared in an unoccupied bathroom!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What&mdash;!
Did that bathroom have a hidden room or something?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My head feels... Weird...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I saw... Santa...
 

 
**Mash:**
Good, you seem like you're okay.
Oh, but this is&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
Senpai is REM-REM-ing and looking very tired.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is that right? Long-term Rayshifts are mentally draining,
so it's good to get a lot of sleep, but...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, their health looks okay.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was worried when you grabbed me and told me Chaldea was in trouble. I'm glad it was nothing.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And disappearing only to reappear later is quite the Prestige! It'll be a great trick for the party!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Party?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait, is today
 

 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's Christmas, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
Everyone's waiting for you in the conference room,
Christmas cake in hand.

 
**Mash:**
...Master?
Is something bothering you?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nah. I've got a funny story to tell you later.

 
**Mash:**
I look forward to that. I was a little worried it would just be Da Vinci's magic tricks.

 
**Mash:**
There are only a few days left in the year. Our battle continues, but for tonight, let's enjoy Christmas!
