# Singularity 5: North American Myth War - E Pluribus Unum

## Prelude
 
**C：???:**
Hah, hah...Hah...
 
**A：???:**
You don't know when to give up, do you, punk? I really want to get this over with. 
 
**C：???:**
...Damn you! 
 
**C：???:**
Ugh! 
 
**C：???:**
The amount of curses covering your body...They're strong enough for you to shoulder an entire nation! 
 
**C：???:**
Damn you! If you possess this much strength...Why? Why have you fallen to Ravana's level!? 
 
**C：???:**
Your skill is not something that can be given, but obtained only through sheer will and determination! 
 
**C：???:**
You could've transcended good and evil! It shouldn't be possible for you to be corrupted like this! 
 
**A：???:**
Huh? What are you talking about? I'm like this because I've transcended good and evil. 
 
**A：???:**
I kill my enemies. I will keep killing until one of us dies. That's the only law on the battlefield. 
 
**C：???:**
Look at this mountain of corpses! Is it your law to slaughter the weak with overwhelming brutality!? 
 
**A：???:**
Why would I waste my time worrying about something so trivial? 
 
**A：???:**
What? Don't tell me you actually judge your enemy's worth? You would let them live if they're weak, yet kill them if they're strong? 
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;That's ridiculous. If you want to kill something in a humane way, do it at a ranch. 
 
**A：???:**
This is a battlefield. I'm tired of hearing your theories. Just die. 
 
**A：???:**
It's go time, my demonic thorn of death! 
 
**C：???:**
Ugh! Brahmastra, full power! 
 
**A：???:**
Ha! See, you do have it in you. Too bad, you're just a circus clown. 
 
**A：???:**
Gáe&ndash;Bolg! 
 
**C：???:**
...Gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh! 
 
**A：???:**
&ndash;What? How are you still standing? 
 
**A：???:**
What a pain. You still hang on to life despite having 80% of your heart destroyed. Servants&ndash;Heroes, can be such a nuisance. 
 
**C：???:**
Gar...Hah...
 
**C：???:**
I can't...die here...Not...until I see...Sita! 
 
**A：???:**
Who the hell is that? Like I care. 
 
**C：???:**
...Ugh...
 
**A：???:**
Huh? 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Servant response confirmed. Commencing countermeasures. 
 
**A：???:**
...That trash from the West, huh? 
 
**Soldier:**
Now, Geronimo! 
 
**C：???:**
What's...going on? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Just come with me! We have to escape while they keep him busy! 
 
**C：???:**
Who...Who are you? 
 
**A：???:**
I see now. You all want to get in my way. In that case, you're all my enemies. 
 
**A：???:**
In other words, this is a new battlefield! Let me first extend my welcome by killing you! 
 
**Soldier:**
Geronimo, go! We'll hold him off here! 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Thank you! 
 
**A：???:**
Hah! Ready to sacrifice yourself? Well, look at you! Your morale is pretty high for a mere pawn! 
 
**Soldier:**
We won't...lose...This land...will not...yield! 
 
**A：???:**
Oops, I screwed up. He was too annoying so I just crushed him. 
 
**A：???:**
He pointed his blade toward the king of a nation. I really should just cut off his head and display it as a warning but...I guess there are more where he came from. 
 
**A：???:**
Hey punk, let's continue. I've already crushed your insides. How about I go for your skull next and&ndash;
 
**A：???:**
...What the hell, he's gone already. 
 
**A：???:**
Tch, that's no fun. Oh well, injuries from my spear's thorn are incurable. He'll eventually die. 
 
**D：???:**
&ndash;Hehehe, you look braver than ever. Say, which do you like better, to fight, or to kill? 
 
**A：???:**
Huh? Is there any difference? 
 
**A：???:**
Or what? Are you one of those idiots who think of eating and living as two separate things? 
 
**D：???:**
...You're funny, Cú. You really are different. You're like a wild beast. 
 
**D：???:**
Even in life, there was a part of you that somehow felt like a beast in human's clothing...
 
**D：???:**
But this time, I can't sense a single trace of impurity! You're without a doubt a king among all violent beasts! 
 
**D：???:**
Truly fantastic. I wonder if the hero Cú Chulainn lost all his rationality by being given an imaginary concept. 
 
**D：???:**
But I like both forms of Cú. Hehe, hehehe, hehehehe! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Well, that's number thirty...Huh? Woman, did you say something? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Either way, job's done. I'm going to sleep now. Wake me up if anything happens. 
 
**D：???:**
...Oh boy. I'm happy to see you all rough and tough, but it's a shame you're strangely indifferent now. 
 
**D：???:**
Well, it's fine either way. You probably won't have much chance to show off anymore. 
 
**D：???:**
Because from here on, it's my turn! Here comes the innocent, perfect, much beloved Queen Medb☆
 
**Celtic Warrior:**
...What are your orders? 
 
**Medb:**
Come, my warriors! It's time to advance our troops! Sing my praises, loudly! 
 
**Medb:**
Praise me, and kill my enemies! Medb is the best! 
 
**Medb:**
Oh, my dear and sweet warriors! Come on, we're almost there! 
 
**Medb:**
This nation! This land! Everything will be ours! 
 
**Medb:**
Eternal, an eternal nation. We'll create a utopia! 
 
**Medb:**
If they oppose me, kill them! If they don't oppose me, still kill them! 
 
**Medb:**
Foolish civilians, unwise leaders, and weak soldiers! I need none of them! 
 
**Medb:**
The United States will be no more, and from its ashes we'll create a new nation. 
 
**Medb:**
It'll be an eternal nation only for us! One centered around us! 
 
**Geronimo:**
How's his condition? 
 
**Soldier:**
Terrible. It's amazing he could stay alive. 
 
**Soldier:**
So he's a Servant, too. Like you...Geronimo. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes...We need as much manpower as we can get. Tell the shaman to give him the best treatment possible. 
 
**Geronimo:**
But...things won't get better as they are now. 
 
**Soldier:**
Geronimo, can we talk for a minute? 
 
**Geronimo:**
What's going on? 
 
**Soldier:**
Moments ago, the last fort in the East fell. The United Western States has retreated from the East. 
 
**Soldier:**
The East-West Civil War will drag on longer than it should. So it means&ndash;
 
**Geronimo:**
This place will turn into what the missionary called “Purgatory. ”
 
**Soldier:**
What's the difference between Purgatory and Hell? 
 
**Geronimo:**
No big difference. In either case, it is going to be harsh for us. 
 
**Soldier:**
What are we going to do? 
 
**Geronimo:**
You guys should continue infiltrating the Western forces in those costumes. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Although many non-human creatures lurk among the Celts, the Western troops still have a lot of humans. 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes, understood. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Don't worry. The star is finally starting to show movement. It seems the Mage's Association is getting serious...
 
**Geronimo:**
...Wait, no. Perhaps the world is not moving, it's revolving. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I hope...that this starlight is something that we can be proud of...

**--SECTION BREAK--**

**A：???:**
&mdash;I woke up at the same time today. 
 
**A：???:**
I checked my temperature. I checked my five senses. I said my name out loud, so that I could understand it better. 
 
**A：???:**
I think I've gotten quite used to waking up like this. Previously, my wake-up was a bit more gradual. 
 
**A：???:**
It was as if I was walking on thin ice,or sneaking in front of an animal in a blissful sleep. 
 
**A：???:**
That's how I used to wake up. Like I was looking for my way in complete darkness. 
 
**A：???:**
Of course it's different now. My self-consciousness is stable. I don't have to worry about my memory disappearing after each sleep. 
 
**A：???:**
I am who I am. Today, too, I can feel that I am myself. 
 
**B：???:**
Good morning. You're on time as usual. Ready for breakfast? 
 
**B：???:**
Your brain waves are stable. If you continue like this, you won't need to stay in this sterile chamber anymore. 
 
**B：???:**
Then you can finally be a researcher at Chaldea. I will throw a celebration for you when that day comes. 
 
**B：???:**
Do you have any requests? I'll try to get you anything within my capabilities. 
 
**A：???:**
I couldn't think of what I wanted,but I thought of something I wanted to do. 
 
**A：???:**
Though I knew this comfortable room was more than enough, I wanted to go outside, just once. 
 
**B：???:**
Well. You'll get out pretty soon. 
 
**B：???:**
What I want to give you is more like a gift, not something simple like what you just said...
 
**A：???:**
I expressed my intention by shaking my head. 
 
**A：???:**
What I wanted to see was not outside of my room, but Chaldea. I wanted to see the outside world with my own eyes, not through pictures. 
 
**B：???:**
Oh, I see...So you want to actually see the sea and the grass field from the VR program I showed you the other day. 
 
**B：???:**
That'll be difficult. Chaldea is on top of a snowy mountain, 6,000 meters above sea level. 
 
**B：???:**
Part of it is to prevent top secrets from leaking. Either way, you'll see nothing but a blizzard if you go outside. 
 
**B：???:**
Maybe you can see the ravine when the weather clears up once a year. 
 
**B：???:**
Even so, your body can't withstand the outside world. I think it's best for you to change your way of thinking. 
 
**B：???:**
If you want to see nature then VR is enough. It's not worth it for you to shorten your already short activation period. 
 
**A：???:**
His smile seemed so troubled, like he was sorry for me. His gaze avoided mine. 
 
**A：???:**
...It made me feel terribly sorry. I suppose what I said made him feel sad. 
 
**B：???:**
Oh, but you'll be free anywhere within Chaldea. I will take responsibility and make sure to get the Director's approval. 
 
**B：???:**
You can rest assured and wait for that day to come. I will think of a gift for you. 
 
**A：???:**
“Thank you,” I replied. 
 
**A：???:**
It was hard for me to think about what I wanted, but I was happy that anyone would care that much about me. 
 
**A：???:**
I am very, very happy. 
 
**A：???:**
Because today, I can spend another peaceful day without changes. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...That dream just now...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...How was that happiness? 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou? Fooou? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait...Am I crying? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...What's this feeling, in my heart? 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou? Kyuuu...Fou, fooou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup, times like this call for a doctor. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. You're here to see the Doctor for something? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, is that Fujimaru? I'm glad you are here. I need your help convincing her. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash fights in the front lines too much these days. As her physician I think she should take a break...
 
**Mash:**
That's not necessary. Senpai should be under the same conditions. 
 
**Mash:**
As long as Senpai is fighting, I can't find any reason for me to rest. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As you can see, she's insisting that she follow you. Fujimaru, what do you think? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I won't stop her if she wants to come. 
 
**Mash:**
See? You are being overprotective, Doctor. You are the commander, so please keep your composure. 
 
**Mash:**
And thank you, Senpai. I will do my best to match your expectations. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash will be fine. I'll protect her. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I believe in you, Master. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sigh...Oh boy. Though I am happy she's become so dependable in the short while that I wasn't looking...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, it's also true that things can be inconvenient unless Fujimaru is accompanied by Mash...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fine, I will allocate more budget to Mash's health management. But don't force too much on her. 
 
**Mash:**
No need to worry, Doctor. Self-management is one of the things I'm good at. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll tell Senpai immediately if I don't feel well. We must stay alert at all times during a Grand Order. 
 
**Mash:**
Even a slight decrease in my performance would put Master in danger, so I won't hesitate to state my requests. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll ask for medical attention when injured, and I'll ask for sweets when I need sugar. 
 
**Mash:**
As far as that goes, I can guarantee you I am on top of that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, you've really become quite dependable. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, it's a call from the Command Room. They're ready for the next Rayshift. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's get going, Fujimaru, Mash. We'll start with a briefing as usual. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's hurry up, Senpai. 
 
**Fou:**
...Fooou...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I didn't get a chance to ask the Doctor...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well, it's not like he's going anywhere. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's start the briefing. The rest of Chaldea's staff, please pay attention as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
After the battle in London, we now know our enemy is the King of Mages, Solomon. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We're lucky we obtained all sorts of information...Though it was likely on purpose. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Out of all the information we received, here's the important detail&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He will not attack us. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The King of Mages won't fight. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. It seems Solomon doesn't care about us taking down the other three Singularities. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He made it clear that he won't attack us until then. Whatever the purpose, it doesn't look like he's lying. 
 
**Mash:**
So, we can continue with our mission of correcting the Singularities? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. First, we'll return human history back to its proper course. The problem is&mdash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
How to deal with the King of Mages, right? Grand Caster...He stands above all mages. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I don't like the fact that there's a Caster who ranks higher than me, but I suppose it can't be helped. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Inserting the reincarnated Demon Gods into each era...That's not something an ordinary person would think of. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
As a genius myself, I must admit...We currently have no idea how to track him, let alone defeat him. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...You're right. We don't know how to track him. 
 
**Mash:**
I hear the King of Mages had 72 Demon Gods serving under him. We've defeated at least three of them, that means&ndash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
There are 69 left...But there's no point counting them. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
If he's indeed the Grand Caster, he can replenish the lost Demon Gods as much as he wants. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, the familiar known as the “72 Demon Gods” is one single ritual, one single concept. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In that case, all 72 of them must always exist. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As long as they call themselves “Demon Gods,” all 72 pillars will continue to be around Solomon regardless of shape or form. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So you mean there is no end? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. Unless we defeat King Solomon, the summoner, the 72 Demon Gods will never disappear from this planet. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are they? Octopus tentacles? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...I don't think they look that delicious...
 
**Da Vinci:**
...But using marine life as an analogy might be getting to the point...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm...It reminds me of something I've seen in a picture book...But I can't remember...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know we're in the dark regarding Solomon, but we do know what we have to do. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's think about how to get rid of the Demon Gods after we're done with that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, let's start talking about our current coordinates. This is a place that would surprise any mage. 
 
**Mash:**
Where is it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
North America. A superpower known as the “United States of America. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You can't exclude this nation from history. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This nation is insignificant when it comes to Magecraft, but historically it's as important as Rome. 
 
**Mash:**
...Insignificant when it comes to Magecraft...I see, the Doctor is correct. 
 
**Mash:**
It's true that the United States is still a young nation, and there're no official records of it ever holding a Holy Grail War. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hahaha. To me it's just the place that said I put codes in my paintings. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
When would I have time to do something like that when I'm painting? Even if I did, I'd only do it to spite my client. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That aside, it's not like they're completely void of Magecraft. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Apparently, they've developed their own style of Magecraft that could summon an Elemental down to Earth. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I also confirmed that Heroic Spirits existed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are deep-rooted legends of outlaws who would rebel against anything in that nation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Obviously, we can't treat this like places we've encountered before. I want you to proceed with your search carefully. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Then I'll start the Rayshift. Master Fujimaru, please start your preparations. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...
 
**Announcement A:**
All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation. 
 
## Section 1: Feet on the Ground, Eyes on the Stars 
 
**Mash:**
...Whew. The Rayshift was successful, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
We're in a forest somewhere in America in the year 1783. 
 
**Mash:**
...To be precise, we are on the continent of North America...The United States hasn't been born yet. 
 
**Mash:**
Once the Revolutionary War against England ends this year, the nation later known as “America” will be established. 
 
**Mash:**
After that, this nation will turn into a monster-like mega power that dominates this world. 
 
**Mash:**
Whether that's good or not, there's no doubt that this nation is absolutely essential for the proper course of history. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is England the enemy? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who is the enemy? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Let's say America loses the war, and the nation known as the United States never comes into existence. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right, though that certainly is a possibility, the mere result of the Revolutionary War won't change the flow of history. 
 
**Mash:**
As long as America has shown its will for independence, even if that process gets delayed for 30 to 50 years...
 
**Mash:**
Eventually the United States of America will be established. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't think it's as simple as “England is our enemy. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, I know you've just arrived but we have a bit of an issue! I've detected a large scale battle just ahead! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know the details, but please hurry! This is not an ordinary battle! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. Master, let's go! 
 
**Mash:**
This is...
 
**Soldier:**
Stand your ground, elites of the glorious Mechanized Infantry Brigade! Protect this territory with your lives! 
 
**Mechanized Soldier:**
Yes! Domination Order! We're ready to keep firing till our barrels are empty! 
 
**Mash:**
Th-That's...Mr. Babbage!? Senpai, it's Mr. Babbage! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Calm down, Mash. That's not him. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Calm down, Mash. It's nothing. 
 

---

 
**???:**
&mdash;! 
 
**Mash:**
The other side is...a lot more retro-looking! 
 
**Mechanized Soldier:**
&mdash;Oh, terrible. Enemy reinforcements spotted. Firing warning shots, then proceeding to exterminate! 
 
**Mash:**
The guns are pointed at us&mdash;Senpai! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
For now, let's fight back! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Understood, Master! This is our first battle on North American soil, I'll do my best! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Soldier:**
I-Impossible! The enhanced exoskeleton “Hard Work Mk-2” given by His Excellency was destroyed!? 
 
**Soldier:**
And by such a frail-looking girl? Could she be...the Servant-Type enemy I read about in my report? 
 
**Soldier:**
Fine! Retreat! We'll move our front line back until the reinforcements arrive! Hurry! 
 
**Mash:**
Hah...Hah...We did it, Master! 
 
**Mash:**
I can't grasp the situation yet, but it seems one side has retreated&mdash;
 
**???:**
&mdash;! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Be careful! Now the other side has targeted you! Please hang on for a little bit longer, Fujimaru! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**C：???:**
&mdash;! 
 
**Mash:**
We did it! Now those people are retreating as well! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good job, Mash! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, you should get back, too! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes! We should hurry and retreat as well! If we continue to stay here, we'll get flanked by both forc&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Master, fall back now&mdash;No...RUN! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai? Senpai! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Senpai is airborne! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Mash, what did you just say? 
 
**Mash:**
You know, airborne! Like when your two feet are above the ground and...Oh never mind! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Stay with me, please! Senpai, Senpai! 
 
## Section 2: The Lady with a Lamp 
 
**???:**
......
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**???:**
Patient No. 99, severely wounded. The wound on the right arm is serious, I recommend amputation. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**???:**
Here, too...I don't think it can be saved. Left femur shattered. It's a miracle that this one's alive. 
 
**???:**
We're going to have to amputate this as well. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
???
 

---

 
**???:**
Gouge wound on the lateral region of the abdomen...No problem, as long as we remove the damaged organs and stitch it back up. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
???
 

---

 
**???:**
Don't worry, you'll still live. Your condition is far better than the other patients here. 
 
**???:**
In another 200 years, highly advanced artificial limbs should be developed...I suppose that's too far ahead. 
 
**???:**
Now then, it's time to amputate. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 

---

 
**???:**
This should've been a surgeon's job, but seeing how we don't have enough physicians here, I will do it. 
 
**???:**
Please bite on this. It's going to hurt. 
 
**???:**
If I were to compare it to something...It'll hurt as much as getting your arm ripped off. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's the same thing! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't have much of a vocabulary, do you!? 
 

---

 
**???:**
You mustn't be so childish. At least it's better than dying, isn't it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, I don't really think amputation is necessary. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just stitch me back up, please! 
 

---

 
**???:**
No. I'm doing it. I'm cutting. This wound, at least, must be dealt with swiftly. 
 
**???:**
Don't worry, you're still young. I know you can endure something like this. 
 
**???:**
...Sorry. That sounded rather vague. Let me correct myself. You must endure it no matter what. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're crazy! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You just want to cut something, don't you? 
 

---

 
**???:**
...You there, don't come in here in that unsanitary state when I'm treating someone! 
 
**Mash:**
Please wait! Stop! You've got the wrong person! 
 
**???:**
There's no mistake. All patients are equal, be they a private or a colonel. 
 
**???:**
No matter who they are, I'll do the best I can to save them. In order to do that, proper hygiene is essential. 
 
**???:**
Listen to me. Take one step closer and I'll shoot you. 
 
**Mash:**
I-I wasn't about to! 
 
**???:**
Your eyes told me otherwise. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am fine! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't like where this is going! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai! Thank goodness, you're conscious! 
 
**???:**
How are you fine? It's a miracle that your limbs are still attached after taking a direct hit from the cannons. 
 
**???:**
Normally, I would amputate those limbs to prevent the blood from reaching unnecessary areas...
 
**???:**
And by keeping those wounds clean, we can prevent them from getting infected. 
 
**???:**
Don't worry, I am going to heal you, even if that means killing you. 
 
**???:**
Yes...I will do everything in my power to save you! I will take your life if I have to! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's messed up! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The ends and means are reversed? 
 

---

 
**???:**
I am sure some people see it that way. But sometimes, you have no room for doubt in the field of medicine. 
 
**Mash:**
Medicine...Cleanliness...Ah. Um, are you...
 
**???:**
Am I what? 
 
**Mash:**
You're a Servant...Aren't you? 
 
**???:**
That has nothing to do with this. As long as I'm summoned here, I'll only think about how to follow my conviction. 
 
**???:**
My conviction is my strength, and that is medical treatment. It doesn't matter if I'm a Servant or not, I must do my best here. 
 
**???:**
Now that I'm summoned to this battlefield, I must treat these patients. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Ah, um, but you're a Servant, right? That person there is a Master. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure you know that means that I must protect my Master. That's non-negotiable, even with you. 
 
**???:**
That goes the same with me. My conviction won't falter unless you can have a stronger...
 
**???:**
...Wait. You...That body of yours...
 
**???:**
...Fine, understood. I'll withhold my treatment for now. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, here's a Scroll of Healing. 
 
**Mash:**
...You're all right. You're back to normal now. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I thought I was a goner...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Whew. Thank goodness it turned out okay...
 
**???:**
All right, if you're finished, get out of the way! My next patient is coming! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is this place? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I...don't really know myself...But this is the rear base of the American Independence Army. 
 
**Mash:**
Do you remember that last battle? 
 
**Mash:**
The American army lost. Their forces retreated from the front line. 
 
**Mash:**
I followed along. Um...since they carried you here, Master. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know who's on the other side.... But I'm at least certain that it's not the British army. 
 
**Mash:**
And there's one more thing. This army is strange, too. The American flag they're flying isn't what it's supposed to be...
 
**Mash:**
...and the ones they sent in to fight...were the same things we encountered in London. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Things...Homunculi? 
 
**Mash:**
No, unfortunately, that's not what they are. I'll give you some hints: the smell of oil, looks like iron...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They're the robot army? 
 
**Mash:**
That's it. Charles Babbage, the King of Steam. These things were the same as his production model. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hi, Fujimaru. Um...So that was a disaster, huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any case, what you've encountered was probably due to the Singularity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't know what they are, and there are many mysteries about this army you've joined up with...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But what I can be certain of is that someone is trying to prevent the United States of America from being established. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If the United States isn't established, it will cause a logical error in this world. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Aside from the “anchor” that King Solomon used, I believe other powerful Servants are appearing in this era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But we're not going to change our methods. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We'll keep looking for help from Servants who are already summoned. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...And, I fully understand how you'd be nervous about this, but I think we should ask the Servant that's in front of us now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She seems dependable...I think? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, when you say it like that, it almost sounds like this isn't your problem...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I'm just a little scared. Just a little. I'm not good with nurses who are too serious...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But you two aren't me. That's a battlefield, not an infirmary! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Besides, we can't afford to be picky! Just try talking to her, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Actually...I proposed that earlier...but it didn't work. She won't listen. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why not? 
 
**Mash:**
Seeing how she talks and acts, I have no doubt that her class is Berserker, and&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
I can't be certain yet, but her True Name is probably...Florence Nightingale. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Did we get a new patient? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Don't call my name unless you need me. All right, the treatment is done. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Keep the wounds clean, you hear me? 
 
**Soldier:**
Thank you...very much...Are you...an angel? 
 
**Nightingale:**
I don't know. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Angels don't give out beautiful flowers,they're the ones who fight for those in distress. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If you're in agony, yet still choose to fight&ndash;Then I will be there for you. 
 
**Mash:**
I knew it, you're Florence Nightingale, aren't you? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;I fail to see how that makes any difference. 
 
**Mash:**
Please help us. Unless we correct the Singularity&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
Please don't bring up such foolishness. I have patients here waiting for me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is the only reason and motivation for my being summoned. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's a way to save them all. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's a way to treat them all. 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
...What's that now? 
 
**Mash:**
You heard that right. May I, Ms. Nightingale? 
 
**Mash:**
No matter how hard you struggle,the number of patients will keep increasing. 
 
**Mash:**
In a normal war, the number of casualties slow down somewhere along the line. 
 
**Mash:**
However, this is no normal war. This enemy will fight until the last man is dead. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You say the patient count will keep increasing? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, unfortunately. That's exactly why we need to cut it off at the root. 
 
**Soldier:**
Enemy raid, enemy raid! 
 
**Mash:**
You there, sir! Is the enemy the same as before? 
 
**Soldier:**
That's right! Anyone who can walk, prepare to engage! The mechanized brigade won't get here in time! So get the cannons ready! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, let's fight with them. 
 
**Mash:**
If we can't maintain the front line here,the patients will...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can't let them attack this camp! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Wait. I'll go with you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Despite my appearance, I know a thing or two about combat. But most of all, I can't let these patients be injured anymore. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Doctor Rush! Please treat these patients just the way I told you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The patients who mustn't be moved are housed in the big tent. I want to move them, but that would risk their lives more. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Those who can walk on their own, please help those who can't. When you do, be very careful not to touch their wounds. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I won't let the enemy reach this tent. This is our sanctuary. 
 
**Doctor:**
R-Right. But...Who are you? 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm a nurse. Nothing more, nothing less. Follow me, Servant! 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right! 
 
**Doctor:**
...Th-That's a nurse? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Okay, time for treatment. I'll remove the infected parts right away. 
 
**Mash:**
C-Calm down, okay? ...After another look, it seems our enemy can move better than humans. 
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, let's fight. This is the front line. We can't win if we don't hold them here. 
 
**Mash:**
Here I go, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
More are on the way. They're more powerful than the ones before...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We've become more powerful as well. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! Let's keep going! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
It's a stalemate. For them, it may have been their first Servant battle ever. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I don't think they'll reach the tent, but&ndash;Mm. Mm, mm. Mm. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Detecting enemy Servants. Two of them! 
 
**D：???:**
Your Majesty. We've found them. 
 
**D：???:**
Apparently they're Servants. I can see why our troops aren't pushing onward. 
 
**D：???:**
This is probably as far as the unsung warriors can go. Now it's our turn to step up. 
 
**C：???:**
Just what I'd expect from my subordinate, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Your eyes are, yes, if I were to compare, akin to a hawk's! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...You are too kind. Compared to your wisdom, Fionn mac Cumhaill, I am nothing. 
 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha! Enough with the modesty. You have an eye for beauty. The fact that you chose Gráinne proves it. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...N-No. I wouldn't...say that...Uh...
 
**Fionn:**
Sorry, I was only joking! That was a bit mean of me! Now, let's fight! 
 
**Fionn:**
Let's show them the power of the Knights of Fianna! And...let's bring an eternal empire to this fertile land! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
As you wish! Now, ladies. Prepare yourselves. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne,the best spearman in the Knights of Fianna. 
 
**Mash:**
Diarmuid...the “radiant-faced” Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. 
 
**Mash:**
And standing right behind him is his lord,Fionn mac Cumhaill...
 
**Nightingale:**
In other words, you two are pathogens. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Pathogens? No, we're just warriors. Nothing more, nothing less. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Whoa! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&mdash;With your death, I shall eradicate this disease! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Ugh...So you don't listen to what people say, huh? I don't like it, I really don't like such women...
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Diarmuid:**
Ugh! 
 
**Fionn:**
You were caught off guard, Diarmuid! Leave it to me, I'll heal your wounds! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
My lord, I am grateful. Please accept my apologies. Forgive me, I was overwhelmed. 
 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha, that's my “Ladykiller” Diarmuid. So you're not comfortable taking on women? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
No...I wouldn't say...Uh...
 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha! I jest, I jest! That was a pretty good one, too! 
 
**Fionn:**
But no need to worry. They're both good-looking, powerful women. 
 
**Fionn:**
I don't blame you for holding back. Now then, I shall head out myself. 
 
**Fionn:**
In the name of the glorious Knights of Fianna,I shall claim their heads! 
 
**Fionn:**
Lancer, Fionn mac Cumhaill...here I come! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fionn:**
Hmm. To think they're more than a match for both of us. Quite impressive...Are they seasoned veterans? 
 
**Mash:**
Master, we couldn't finish them off! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Wait! What's this...The wounded back at the camp...
 
**Mash:**
Wait, what? Nightingale, where are you going? 
 
**Fionn:**
Oh, my, I think she's noticed. 
 
**Fionn:**
Oh unknown Shielder Servant. This Holy Grail War is by all means...a war. 
 
**Fionn:**
As far as we're concerned, we only needed to keep you here. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh no! The other soldiers! 
 
**Fionn:**
They're nameless warriors. Just unique monsters who will continue to fight. 
 
**Fionn:**
Of course, they're no match for Servants...But I wonder...How about the American troops? 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...! Your Majesty, please retreat! 
 
**Fionn:**
&ndash;What? 
 
**???:**
Right flank, left flank, surround the enemy! We're going to charge down the middle! 
 
**???:**
They're beasts who only process what's right before them! But we have wisdom! 
 
**Fionn:**
Is that...the much-rumored Resistance? If there are more Servants, there's nothing we can do. 
 
**Fionn:**
Fine. We'll retreat for now, Diarmuid! Give the order to the other warriors as well! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Very well. But will they be able to comprehend our orders? 
 
**Fionn:**
Hmm? If they don't, it can't be helped. We'll abandon them. Come on, don't feel bad. 
 
**Fionn:**
They're monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won't be a problem for us! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...Indeed, my liege. All right...Let us retreat. 
 
**Fionn:**
Oh, before we do, I forgot something important. Oh beautiful Demi-Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
D-Do you mean me? 
 
**Fionn:**
Yes, I mean you. Are you determined to oppose us? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Along with my Master, we will defeat you. 
 
**Fionn:**
That's a beautiful gaze, full of sincerity. I shall forgive your transgression for showing me such a wonderful gaze. 
 
**Fionn:**
In return...If you're defeated, I shall have your heart! That's right, you shall become my wife! 
 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me? 
 
**Fionn:**
I can't wait, I really can't wait! A truly blissful promise! Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...(There he goes again, just like that...)
 
**Diarmuid:**
Pardon us. It's a bad habit of my king's. You might think it's a prank, but he actually never lies. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
He must've fallen for the sight of you fighting so bravely. If you're defeated, please consider surrender and submission. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well! 
 
**Mash:**
...Um. What was that last part about? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He proposed to you. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He asked for your hand in marriage. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I-Is that right? Well, that was a bit of a...surprise. 
 
**Mash:**
Um...I have no comment on the man himself,but his words did have an impact...or should I say...
 
**Mash:**
I felt like my heart skipped a beat...Sorry, let me take a deep breath. 
 
**Mash:**
Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey! Are you okay? Looks like the enemy Servants are gone for now...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...but now a different Servant has appeared. It's heading your way. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's join Nightingale right away! 
 
## Section 3: Fragment of the Star 
 
**C：???:**
Green, I'm out of ammo. Cover me. 
 
**D：???:**
Gotcha. 
 
**D：???:**
By the way, why do you call me “Green”? Who's this “Green”? 
 
**C：???:**
I mean, you and I are both Archers, right? So we either call each other by our True Names or use code names. 
 
**C：???:**
But neither of us wants to use our True Names, right? You know, as outlaws. 
 
**D：???:**
I'm no outlaw. That's just how it turned out. Basically, I'm just a lazy-ass. 
 
**C：???:**
Say, if you were an animal you would be a gorilla, right? I mean, Druids are like sages of the forest? Then you would be a gori&ndash;
 
**D：???:**
Green is fine, just call me Green. And why are you “Thunder”? 
 
**C：???:**
Huh? It sounds cool, no? Thunder. Plus it's the name of my gun. 
 
**D：???:**
...To be honest, between this land, what you wear, and that gun, I have a pretty good idea of your True Name. Is that okay? 
 
**C：???:**
Come on, I can say the same for you. Faceless ruler of the forest, specialist in guerilla warfare. 
 
**D：???:**
It's not good to go without a face. Now that we're done with idle chatter&mdash;
 
**C：???:**
Right, now that we're done&mdash;What do we do with this? 
 
**D：???:**
How's that escape hatch we made? 
 
**C：???:**
It's good. We can use it. It'd just be a shame to, that's all. 
 
**C：???:**
After we gathered up all these weapons and ammo......Hmm, maybe we overdid it? 
 
**D：???:**
Well, after all that sabotage, I'd say a bit. 
 
**D：???:**
Doesn't seem like they have any Servants over there,but we're done for if they engage in close combat. 
 
**D：???:**
...Well, it's all in fate's hands now. Want me to pray for the Master to come to our aid? 
 
**C：???:**
Are you mad? Were your prayers ever answered in life? 
 
**D：???:**
Why, sure. But you have to be a good boy. 
 
**D：???:**
Unfortunately, it hasn't worked since I became an adult. I guess we're both just bad boys? 
 
**C：???:**
Hmph, speak for yourself! I always said my prayers, just like my mom taught me. 
 
**D：???:**
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure if you pray from the bottom of your heart, we'll be saved. 
 
**C：???:**
Mmm, I guess praying in your spare time doesn't work. Well, I&ndash;
 
**C：???:**
was expecting that, too. 
 
**D：???:**
Praying while blasting away with your gun won't do a thing. I mean, God can't hear your prayers over the gunshots. 
 
**D：???:**
Whoa, someone fell for it. I'll go light 'em up. 
 
**C：???:**
Yeah, knock yourself out. 
 
**C：???:**
...Still, I'm tired. I wonder how long the Resistance is gonna hold out. 
 
**C：???:**
Sooner or later, they'll reach their limit. I just hope Geronimo finds the “star” by then&ndash;
 
**C：???:**
Whoa, that was close. The “Regulators” are closed for today. Please visit us another day. See ya! 
 
**Mash:**
Nightingale? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Please give me a moment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm in the middle of telling Dr. Rush how to care for the patients. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Honestly, though this is long before I was born, there is too little risk management concerning sanitation. 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right...
 
**Nightingale:**
Listen to me. The wounds must be kept clean, and don't lay beds edge-to-edge. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Normally, I would never let patients lie down on the filthy ground. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Giving them vomit-inducing medication or bloodletting to expel toxins, or having them drink mercury chloride...
 
**Nightingale:**
If you perform outdated treatments like that again, I will punch you until you need treatment yourself. You've been warned. 
 
**Doctor:**
But those are the latest techniques...
 
**Nightingale:**
Which is the latest, this gun or that treatment? Don't make me repeat myself. 
 
**Doctor:**
U-Understood! Understood! I understand! Please, no more guns, latest or not! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Also, treat all patients equally, regardless of age, gender, race, or social status. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The only discrimination is the order they receive treatment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If you don't follow those rules, this bullet will go through your forehead, even if I'm 5,000 kilometers away. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...You got all that, Benjamin Rush? Please take good care of the patients. 
 
**Doctor:**
I-I will. You can be assured of that! 
 
**Doctor:**
She's gone. 
 
**Doctor:**
...Still, she's an outstanding nurse for being so radical. 
 
**Doctor:**
“Regardless of race” are brave words in this day and age. 
 
**Doctor:**
Seems she came from Europe. She must be famous over there. 
 
**Doctor:**
...I have issues with that gun, though...
 
**Mash:**
Um...Did you just fire that? 
 
**Nightingale:**
It's your imagination. Let's go. 
 
**Mash:**
No, it isn't my imagination. You just fired that without hesitation. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I just used the back of its blade. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do guns have blades? 
 
**Mash:**
If I have to guess...I think she means the bottom of the grip. You just lightly tap the back of the head like this? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know. You can do that with shields, too. 
 
**Mash:**
Of course. The trick is to strike gently, and at the moment of impact, shift the strike point...
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
Excuse me, please refrain from idle chatter during treatment. Come, let's go. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, right! My apologies! 
 
**Mash:**
Um...Senpai. Is it normal to feel a little bit worried? 
 
**Fou:**
Fouuu. 
 
**C：???:**
Wait, Florence. Where do you think you're going? 
 
**C：???:**
Do you know that leaving your post in the military is an offense that can get you shot? 
 
**C：???:**
Get back to your post now. Or else harsh punishment will be waiting for you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...You go back to your post. 
 
**Nightingale:**
My job has not changed at all. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I feel like I almost found a way to treat the soldiers' ailments at their core, so that's what I'm going to do. 
 
**C：???:**
Oh, really? That is reasonable. Thank you. But&mdash;
 
**C：???:**
I can't let a Berserker like you wander off like that. What happens if you end up disrupting our troops? 
 
**C：???:**
The king would never approve of this. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...The king? Someone like that has absolutely no right to stop me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Unless you have a better way to treat the soldiers. I'm all ears. 
 
**C：???:**
Sheesh, you really can't talk to a Berserker. I wonder what I should do. 
 
**C：???:**
We've never seen eye to eye, so maybe this is a good chance to get rid of you? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Well, that's not very kind of you, but I feel the same way. That saves me some trouble. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yikes...We've got sparks flying over here...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why is it when two strong-minded women clash, it always turns into a bloodbath like this? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doctor, calm down. 
 
**Mash:**
I think this is happening because they're both correct, and stubborn in their own way! 
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, we can't let them kill each other! Senpai, may I intervene? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, please intervene! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. I'm not confident, but I'll do my best! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
P-Pardon me for interrupting! Are you...a Servant too? 
 
**C：???:**
Too? You mean...Oh! So many Servants! Great! 
 
**C：???:**
When I heard the Celts were driven away,I assumed Florence had lost her mind again...
 
**C：???:**
But it seems I was wrong. So this is good news for the king? 
 
**Mash:**
King? 
 
**C：???:**
Oh, you don't know America's current situation? This country has split into two, and now the two sides are at war with each other. 
 
**C：???:**
The other side is good-for-nothing savages who just want to destroy. 
 
**C：???:**
And there's our side&ndash;the United Western States, led by our king. 
 
**C：???:**
It's a civil war between the East and the West...not the North and the South. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So it's not even “What if the South won the Civil War? ”but a clash between two unknown armies. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um, pardon me, miss. What's your name? 
 
**C：???:**
Oh. You recognized Florence at a glance,but you don't know me? 
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry...Ms. Nightingale was...Um, anyway, it was easy to guess...
 
**C：???:**
That's okay, I'm only giving you a hard time. Please forgive my childishness. 
 
**C：???:**
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I am Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, I suppose I'm known more as Madame Blavatsky. I didn't appreciate having to change my maiden name. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Helena Blavatsky! The poster girl for 19th-century occultism! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A talented woman independent from the Mage's Association who codified occultism with only her distinctive powers&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But seeing as how you're a Servant here,are you acting as an agent for the Mage's Association? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
No. In this world, all major nations other than America are completely destroyed. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who is this king? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So who do you serve? 

---

 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, so you're the Master. What a pity. We have already decided who to serve. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's the king. If he conquers the globe, I have no problem with it. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I believe we'd become Lemuria, breaking away from other dimensions and continuing to wander. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Kind of like the Throne of Heroes. Don't you think that is a happy ending in its own way? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;I can't accept that as treatment. Amputating the bad part and then walking away is outrageous. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Well, I figured you would say that. But what do you think? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A definite no! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, I see. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, ma'am! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I must admit to being a little irritated. “Ma'am. ” What is this “ma'am”? 
 

---

 
**Blavatsky:**
...Ahem. Well then, where are you people taking Florence? 
 
**Mash:**
...In order to prevent the destruction of this world, we intend to remove the cause. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I see. Then I suppose that makes us enemies. 
 
**Mash:**
No, it doesn't have to be like that. Would you please let us go? 
 
**Mash:**
We're just leaving here with Nightingale as our ally. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Hmph. Then you are able to understand Florence's will. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That makes me somewhat relieved,but I still can't let you go. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not even Mash could convince her...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So the punchline to this venture is that there aren't any Servants joining our side? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There is one! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
One right here! 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm done talking. Let's go, Fujimaru. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I don't want to waste a minute or even a second. I'm going to cure this war. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
R-Right. Anyway, she's on our side and we're just barely managing to communicate with her! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru! Escape from there with Nightingale! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Ahhh, you leave me no choice. Now I have to call out my elites. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
We'll start with them. Mechanized infantry, come forward! 
 
**Mash:**
The production model Babbages from earlier! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, have you encountered Mr. Babbage? Have you been to 19th-century England? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Oh, I see. He was defeated, wasn't he? Poor man. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
But these won't lose. After all, the king personally “worked” on them! 
 
**Mash:**
“Worked” on them? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Babbage used the powers of the Grail and Noble Phantasm to produce his clones. However, the power of science was used here to mass-produce these. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Even if the result is the same, the approach differs. And if the approach differs, the result will too. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, quoting our king...
 
**Blavatsky:**
“Of course electricity is better than steam, you fool! ”
 
**Mash:**
Th-They're electric? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fired up! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's so cool! 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master, seeing your eyes glitter like that worries me a little...b-but anyway, here I go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We defeated them! Be they steam-powered or electric, once they're broken the victory is ours! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
An obvious truth. But it all ends here. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Okay, Karna! Hurry up and finish them off! 
 
**Mash:**
What...Umm, I'm sorry. What did you just say? 
 
**Karna:**
...It's my turn? Understood. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa! All of a sudden I'm picking up a Servant response! It's right above you! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Forced teleportation...Command Spell!? ...What's going on!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The readings I'm getting from his Spirit Origin are off the charts! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh no...
 
**Nightingale:**
...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Sorry, but could you go ahead and capture them? I mean, it looks like they're enemies for the time being. 
 
**Karna:**
I'll oblige to your frivolous conjecture. 
 
**Karna:**
Travelers from afar, pardon the rough welcome. &ndash;Brahmastra! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Retreat...Oh no, he's too fast! 
 
## Section 4: King of Presidents 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai! I'm so glad, you woke up! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What on earth happened? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My head hurts...

---

 
**Nightingale:**
Your Servant blocked that Noble Phantasm attack. However, its shockwave knocked everyone unconscious. 
 
**Nightingale:**
While our lives were spared,it appears that we are in their custody now. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, so you're awake. Right now we're in the midst of transporting you. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You can run away if you like...But, the bad news is that these babies will target the Master, aggressively. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Though Karna probably won't do a thing, since he's firm on his policy of not killing a Master. 
 
**Karna:**
...That's a misunderstanding. I will kill a Master first depending on the situation. 
 
**Karna:**
Of course, first you must show me that you have the reason, conviction, and determination to convince me to kill a Master. 
 
**Karna:**
For instance, is the one issuing the order willing to exchange their own life for it? 
 
**Karna:**
If that's the case, I am willing to consider. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
See, he says stuff that's basically unthinkable on a battlefield. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, that's how Karna is,but that doesn't change your situation in the slightest. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
At such close range, it would be quite difficult to slip past the mechanized infantry, don't you think? 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Now, now, be good. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we headed? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you want? 

---

 
**Blavatsky:**
First, I'll have you meet my king. You should decide which side to be on after that. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, I know the two Servants sitting right there won't side with us that easily. That much I'm sure of. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
However, I'm sure things will be different if we can persuade the Master. 
 
**Mash:**
...Umm, Lady Blavatsky. 
 
**Mash:**
Why is it that you go to such lengths to take the side of this “king”? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Lady! I like the sound of that. You're a nice girl. You understand etiquette! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Your name is Mash, right? In light of your proper manners, I shall answer you. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
The biggest reason why I support the king is that we were closely connected when we were alive. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, it's not like we had an affair or anything like that. We kept in close contact, and I owe him a lot...
 
**Blavatsky:**
The Celts who dominate the East won't accept anyone other than themselves. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Even if I surrendered to the Celts, they would just kill me. Or maybe they would sacrifice me for the sake of their war. 
 
**Mash:**
...The Celts...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Those Servants you saw earlier were Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If that's the case, we'll be seeing a lot of Celtic Servants this time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As far as I know from the legends, they all have a few screws loose. They're a bunch of airheaded Berserkers! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
What were those magical energy waves just now? Is there someone else with you? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Hey, are you keeping a fairy in your pocket or something? Nothing? Then, just where did that voice come from...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh. Is Graham Bell with you or something? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
If he were, the king would seriously lose his temper this time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hate to break it to you, but when it comes to long-distance communications, we're a few steps ahead. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Apologies for introducing myself so late, Ms. Blavatsky. I'm their navigator. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
My name is Dr. Roman. Make sure you don't forget it, as we may cross paths someday. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Wow...I can tell you're an imprudent man just by your voice. You're clearly up to no good, my dear. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey! Why does everyone always dis me when they first meet me? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, it doesn't matter. It means Fujimaru has an advisor as well. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
So, let's get back to the subject. You all get it now, right? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You can't win in this war unless you side with somebody. It will only get you killed if you try to take on both sides. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
This world maintains a precarious balance as the East and West continue to fight. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
If we didn't fight, this nation would have been completely destroyed and beyond salvation by now, you see? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So both sides just like to fight? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Dear, you're not a good listener, are you? Has anyone called you stubborn before? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, at any rate, you should meet the king at least once...It'll be amusing. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So what are we, really? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh. I see. So I hadn't gotten around to explaining that yet. But...Heh heh. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
We've already come this far, I don't want to ruin the surprise. Besides, isn't that more amusing? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Amusing...you say? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Well, someone is calling himself “king” in this ultimate democratic nation. How is that not amusing? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Oh, if self-proclaimed title counts, I do remember there's an emperor as well. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You sure know a lot about snobs. If he were a Heroic Spirit, I'm sure he would lament the current situation. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Ah, but first we have a preliminary show. Perfect. Can you help me out? 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Pretty please♪
 
**Mash:**
Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight for now. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's defend for now. 

---

 
**Mash:**
Understood. Either way, they're enemies we must eventually stand against. 
 
**Mash:**
Okay, here I go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Blavatsky:**
Here we are. 
 
**Mash:**
...A fortress unfitting for America. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
The White House was taken over,so we had no choice. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
We built the fortress from the ground up. We should use anti-Celt measures to resist the Celts, right? 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Madam Blavatsky, Lord Karna. The presi-king awaits. Please come right away. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
M-Maybe I heard wrong. Did he just say “presi-king” or something? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, no doubt...I don't know how to say this, but it's so...simplistic. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Right? But that's what makes it charming. It's not an idea we'd come up with. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Come, follow me. The king, despite his appearance, has a short temper. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...So your employer is just ahead, right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nightingale, wait! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you itching that badly for a battle!? 
 

---

 
**Karna:**
Wait. That would be a bad move, Nightingale. Let your gun rest a while longer. 
 
**Karna:**
If you want to cure this world's soldiers, identify the pathogen first. Or are you that simplistic as well? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...In the meantime, more soldiers die. Are you telling me to bear with that? 
 
**Karna:**
Yes. Bear with it, but do not get accustomed to it. It may be tough for you, but consider it a trial. 
 
**Karna:**
Or is long-term treatment not your policy? If so&mdash;
 
**Karna:**
I wonder which is beyond saving? You, or this land? 
 
**Nightingale:**
What? Are you saying my treatment is wrong? 
 
**Karna:**
Not quite. But everyone makes mistakes. Humans fall to ruin when convinced that their ideas are the only absolutes. 
 
**Karna:**
...Anyway, if you idly meet your death here, that would be truly meaningless. 
 
**Karna:**
Everything has a proper order. Even if you temporarily defeat an enemy here, it may cause a greater evil to prosper. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;I see. I understand your valuable opinion. I will put the gun away for now. 
 
**Karna:**
...Good grief. What a consummate liar. Blavatsky, I will keep an eye on her. 
 
**Karna:**
You look after this world's only Master and that Servant. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Yes yes, I know! Well then, let's get ourselves an audience with the king! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I've brought them to see you, Mr. Presi-king. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Understood. It will be another minute until the presi-king's arrival. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm starting to get nervous, Senpai. I wonder what kind of king he is...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have a bad feeling about this. 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You might be right on that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm detecting a new Servant approaching you,but there's something bizarre about it...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Umm...I wonder if this really is a Heroic Spirit? 
 
**Mash:**
Bizarre? In what way, Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't want to affect your first impression with my speculation. Anyway, we'll talk after you meet this King. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Thank you for waiting. The presi-king is here! 
 
**E：???:**
Oh! At last I get the chance to meet that angel! 
 
**E：???:**
How I have yearned for this moment! 
 
**E：???:**
I intended on inviting them only after they eliminated the Celts, but this is fine, too! 
 
**E：???:**
Yes, advancing the schedule is a good thing! Much better than pushing back the deadline! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I see he still hasn't fixed his habit of talking to himself while walking. I was hoping he could at least have kept that to himself. 
 
**Mash:**
That was “talking to himself? ”
 
**Mash:**
D-Did you hear how loud he was, Senpai!? No human could do that! 
 
**E：???:**
&mdash;To be frank, you have all done a fantastic job! Greetings, everyone! And congratulations! 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Is the monitor broken? All I see on it is a creature? 
 
**E：???:**
I'll say it once more! All of you have done a fantastic job! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I bet you were pretty surprised. Right? Right? Right? 
 
**Karna:**
...Well, yes, they'd be surprised. 
 
**Mash:**
W-Well, I was indeed surprised...but it's fine, I'm getting used to things of this sort...
 
**Mash:**
That aside, umm...You must be the king who controls Western America, right? 
 
**E：???:**
Indeed, it is as you say. 
 
**E：???:**
I have taken it upon myself to rule America in order to pulverize those barbaric Celts&mdash;
 
**E：???:**
I am a Servant, and a gentleman who supports other Servants! I am Thomas Alva Edison, the presi-king! 
 
**Mash:**
E!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
DI!? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
SON of a gun!? 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
&mdash;Oh, excuse me. I was at a complete loss for words. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Edison...Edison, the King of Inventions? It's really you? You're not a Chimera? 
 
**Edison:**
Indeed. Although I am currently the presi-king, not the King of Inventions. 
 
**Edison:**
You must be Lady Florence Nightingale.... You are just as beautiful as they say...
 
**Edison:**
Unfortunately we could not meet when we were alive, but this moment is truly a miracle of energy, no, a miracle of souls. 
 
**Edison:**
I was not one to live on the battlefield, but I deeply respect your convictions and rationality. 
 
**Edison:**
Do lend us your strength. Not only to advance medicine, but also to boost the morale of our soldiers&mdash;
 
**Edison:**
The effects of you as poster girl are immeasurable! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I had no idea you were not human. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To put it lightly...He's a feline? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To put it figuratively...From the Savanna? 
 

---

 
**Edison:**
What? I am without a doubt a human! 
 
**Edison:**
Humans are just higher forms of beasts who possess reason and wisdom. They shall not be segregated by the color of their skin or the shape of their face. 
 
**Edison:**
Even if I possess a lion's head,that fact does not change. 
 
**Edison:**
I am Edison, an intelligent human being. That is all. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Wow, just look how he asserts himself with confidence. I really need to learn that kind of positivity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically, he was a human when alive, but now his head is a lion when summoned as a Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, since that doesn't affect his intelligence in the slightest it's not a problem. This lion, he's the definition of rationalism! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Everyone was taking a hint and not calling him the “L” word! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, he can't help it. I mean, he's basically a lion. 
 
**Edison:**
A lion...I like the sound of that. Also, was that communication through magecraft? 
 
**Edison:**
Even though you live in an age of telephones, your fixation with such an inconvenient method bewilders me. 
 
**Edison:**
Mages by birth are indeed illogical creatures. Surely you can make better use of spiritual channels. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, what? Look, phone lines only work when you occupy the same space in time, yes? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is far more functional, and crosses time and space in a kind of hyper-navigational form of communication...
 
**Edison:**
Oh. So that means you do not exist in this era! 
 
**Edison:**
Hmm. To be able to communicate across different eras is quite convenient indeed...hmm. 
 
**Edison:**
Magecraft and science are similar. There is nothing you can do that I cannot. 
 
**Edison:**
I'd like to see if the same thing can be done by telephone. No, wait, I should develop a spirit phone before that...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Yes, yes, Mr. Edison. Please save your inventions for later, okay? 
 
**Edison:**
...Oh, yes. Right. 
 
**Edison:**
Your name is Fujimaru...was it? You are the only Master in this world. 
 
**Edison:**
Let me get to the point. Can you lend us the strength that you used to correct the previous four eras to get rid of the Celts? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
How'd you know that? 
 
**Edison:**
I am well aware. You see, a certain fellow took it upon himself to inform me. 
 
**Edison:**
The world's worst good-for-nothing! That detestable hysteric told me...
 
**Edison:**
“While all these things happened, I am in good health. I bet you've never had such grand adventures, Edison”
 
**Edison:**
Truly the epitome of displeasure! 
 
**Edison:**
&mdash;Ahem. Well, so much for that. Anyway, we must get rid of these Celts. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why get rid of the Celts? 
 
**Edison:**
Hmm. I believe that is a self-evident truth. 
 

---

 
**Edison:**
Needless to say, the Celts are an anachronism in this age. 
 
**Edison:**
The United States is a cutting-edge nation created by capitalism and rationalism. 
 
**Edison:**
This is our nation, and home to those with intellect. 
 
**Edison:**
However, they keep multiplying like planarians, and the American army lost due to difference in the size of our forces. 
 
**Edison:**
But fortunately, I, a Heroic Spirit, have descended upon this nation! 
 
**Edison:**
The battlefront revived with my proposals of a new national structure and reformed military, equalizing the situation. 
 
**Edison:**
Hmph&mdash;They truly are barbarians. Attempting to contend against me in mass production is the epitome of idiocy. 
 
**Edison:**
Eventually my mechanized infantry will cover the land and annihilate the loathsome Celts once and for all. 
 
**Edison:**
However...there is one matter that concerns me.... Leaders. In other words, we don't have enough Servants. 
 
**Edison:**
We have an obedient army,but no mighty ace warrior to lead them. 
 
**Edison:**
While enemy Celts have many notorious barbarians lined up. 
 
**Edison:**
Just when we gain a foothold somewhere,we end up losing it to a single Servant. 
 
**Edison:**
Only Servants can overcome other Servants. We only have three Servants on our side, including myself. 
 
**Edison:**
Other Servants who were summoned are in disarray,and show no interest in joining us. 
 
**Edison:**
Only my rationality restrains me from roaring out at this sad state of affairs. 
 
**Edison:**
The Heroic Spirits meant to save America dread the enemy and refuse to fight. Their negligence is going too far! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This lion just roared! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You're “rational,” right? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
C-Calm down, Mr. President! 
 
**Mash:**
Umm...If you're trying to save the world, we are willing to cooperate with you...
 
**Edison:**
Oh! You understand! Truly wonderful! You also have a very delicious-looking body! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Foou! 
 
**Edison:**
Hey, stop hitting and biting me, runt! That was figurative. I'd never assault a lady! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Can I ask you two questions? 
 
**Edison:**
Yes, what is it? Coming from an exemplary woman like yourself, I shall give you a genteel answer. 
 
**Edison:**
A gentleman's genteel reply&mdash; Oh, how elegant! Karna, please record that in the Presi-king Chronicles. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...My first question. On our way here, we saw the mechanized infantry several times...
 
**Nightingale:**
Is that the result of your proposal? Is that what you aim for with your “new national structure? ”
 
**Edison:**
Indeed, that is correct! I arrived at this conclusion...in order to save the nation from its predicament! 
 
**Edison:**
National unity! Citizens herded, no, rallied, to new life! Equal national service, regardless of age or gender! 
 
**Edison:**
Eventually, all citizens will be part of the mechanized infantry and defeat the Celts, the invaders. 
 
**Edison:**
Of course, we must maintain our mass-production lines for this purpose. 
 
**Edison:**
Acquisition of labor from all across the land. Institution of 20-hour workdays. Unremitting surveillance. 
 
**Edison:**
Of course, you need the best welfare system, too. One cannot have labor without recreation. 
 
**Edison:**
We will play three times as hard, work three times as hard, and win three times as hard as normal humans! That's my new vision for America! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Playing three times as hard doesn't sound too bad...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's not okay! Recreation has its limits! Please just be normal! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is he not aware of human limitations? 
 
**Mash:**
I agree...Mr. Edison's plan does not take physical limitations into account whatsoever. 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
...So that is what you are fixated on. 
 
**Edison:**
Hmm? What'd you just say? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, I was just talking to myself. Do not mind me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Well then, my second question. How do you intend to save the world? 
 
**Mash:**
That can be accomplished by securing the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
Defeat the Celts, obtain the Holy Grail, then correct the era. 
 
**Mash:**
While it is unclear who among the Celts possesses the Grail, if we can secure it, we can handle the rest...
 
**Edison:**
No, it is unnecessary to correct this era. 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Edison:**
It is unnecessary. If I acquire the Grail, I could refine it and we should be able to prevent the incineration of eras. 
 
**Edison:**
Consequently, it would give birth to a world named “America” operating on a different timeline from the other eras. 
 
**Mash:**
What...Is that really possible!? 
 
**Edison:**
Having been summoned by the Grail, we Servants are well aware of its power. My conclusion is that it is quite possible. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What will happen to the other eras? 

---

 
**Edison:**
&ndash;They will probably be destroyed. 
 
**Mash:**
Then, it's pointless to do so! 
 
**Edison:**
What? Is there any other idea as brilliant as this? 
 
**Edison:**
This America will survive for all eternity. My inventions will remake America. 
 
**Edison:**
It will show those Celts, who can only procreate and fight, that my inventions are the lights of humanity, the power of civilization! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...So you expand your battlefront for that purpose? Abandoning those who fell in battle. 
 
**Edison:**
...An accusation fit for Chief Nurse Nightingale, who so valiantly struggled for the salvation of all soldiers. 
 
**Edison:**
I...I am...ugh...not abandoning them because I want to, however&mdash;
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison, calm down. Florence is just stating her opinion. It's not an accusation. 
 
**Edison:**
I'm aware of that. That just now was my usual headache. Don't worry about it. 
 
**Edison:**
Listen, Lady Nightingale. 
 
**Edison:**
To us...To me, especially, this nation is everything. And a true king has a paramount duty to protect his nation. 
 
**Mash:**
B-But! 
 
**Mash:**
If you are a Heroic Spirit, you should also have a duty...an ideal, a wish, to protect the world! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...You are right. Even my current self possesses that sense of duty in one corner of my sanity. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Mr. Edison. If you deny that duty,you are nothing more than a mere patriot. 
 
**Edison:**
Quite so. What is wrong with a king being a patriot? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I see. In that case&mdash; There is only one thing for me to do! 
 
**Karna:**
Nightingale, that's enough. I will not allow you to fight here. 
 
**Karna:**
Even if that costs me my life. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Let go of me! I can tell! Leaders with those eyes always lead to destruction! 
 
**Nightingale:**
And in the end he will irresponsibly declare...That “it wasn't supposed to turn out like this! ”
 
**Edison:**
Fujimaru...Master. What do you think? 
 
**Edison:**
Shouldn't you join me to fight the Celts and acquire the Holy Grail? I'll give you three minutes to decide. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Maybe joining them for the time being is not a bad idea. 
 
**Mash:**
What are you saying, Doctor!? He's opposed to the idea of fixing the Foundation of Humanity! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Quite the contrary, he's for it. It's just that the world he envisions differs from ours. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But we don't have the time to confront him now. And in the end, I think he'll stop baring his fangs. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not just being hopeful. My conclusion stems from historical observation...and experience. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Those that move nations believing in their own righteousness will experience consequences, in one form or another. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...But that's all irrelevant. Now is about gaining the upper hand in the war. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
With all the Celtic Servants gathering,there is an overwhelming gap in military strength. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and Fionn mac Cumhaill are formidable enough. How many more Servants of that caliber do they have? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For now, we will cooperate in order to acquire the Holy Grail, and correct the mistake where Celtic myths dominate North America. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What happens afterwards? We can think about that later. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, what should we do? ...Senpai? 
 
**Edison:**
Well then. Have you come to a decision? Let's hear what you have to say. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have a bad feeling about this. I can't help. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Give up on the Holy Grail, President Lion. 
 

---

 
**Edison:**
...That is an unexpected response indeed. 
 
**Edison:**
Whatever your hidden agenda may be, I thought you would agree to join forces. 
 
**Edison:**
I, Thomas Alva Edison, should respect your honesty and sincerity. 
 
**Edison:**
But as presi-king, unfortunately I have no choice but to condemn you. 
 
**Edison:**
Get 'em! 
 
**Mash:**
They're coming! Stand back, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Hah, hah...No good, there's no end to them! 
 
**Nightingale:**
!!! 
 
**Edison:**
So even my prized mechanized infantry will become junk in minutes when going up against a Servant, huh? 
 
**Edison:**
But sometimes it's quantity over quality. You should be out of energy already. 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;Blavatsky! Throw them inside the special underground jail! 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Yeah, yeah. I guess it can't be helped. So sorry, but you're getting locked up. 
 
## Section 5: Cool Hand Florence 
 
**Mash:**
...Those numbers just aren't fair. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But even after all that, they let us keep all our equipment. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fou is safe, too. 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou. 
 
**Mash:**
Not quite, Doctor. Just run an analysis and you'll know...
 
**Mash:**
The magical energy supply from Master is being cut off. And we have no way of escaping this jail...
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's right. You can't really underestimate a Caster from the 19th century, can you? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, since I've lived on this continent before, my affinity with this land is not so bad. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Tell the guard if you're willing to cooperate. We'll let you out immediately. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Tell me, Fujimaru. Why did you refuse? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
As the gentleman from Chaldea said,you could have just betrayed us along the way. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
At the very least, I'm sure you saw this coming. Yet you chose this foolish path. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Why? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
For Edison's sake. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I see. True, I'm sure he'd be hurt if you'd betrayed him. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
In life, he was fed up by all the lawsuits. Despite the way he looks, he's naïve. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
He loves his country more than anyone and thinking that is only natural. No, he's obsessed. It's extreme self-righteous patriotism. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But if you understand that, why are you helping him, Helena? Wouldn't he listen to your counsel? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
No. My approach can't save this country. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
For better or worse,only Mr. Edison can stop the Celtic army. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's why I'm with him for now. I do have obligations from when we were alive, too. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...However, Fujimaru,what you said makes me happy. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Please don't hate him too much. As the King of Inventions, he really is an amusing person, like a child. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For Nightingale's sake. 
 
**Nightingale:**
For my sake? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I can see that. After all, Florence would never agree to those conditions. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You never abandon someone once you've become allies, huh? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
As a Master and a human being, that's wonderful. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Though other people may think it's foolish...
 
**Blavatsky:**
...your actions are noble, more so than anybody else. 
 

---

 
**Blavatsky:**
&mdash;Rest easy. Someone will come to your rescue soon. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Until then, just wait here. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We have to do something to get out of here. Please help me. 
 
**Mash:**
I-I know, but I think it's impossible to destroy a cell with a gun! 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, I think I've managed to shave off a little bit. Come on, everyone pitch in and dig! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, the bullets are ricocheting inside this cell! Nightingale, that's too reckless&ndash;! 
 
**D：???:**
...Yes, that was reckless. 
 
**D：???:**
But on the bright side, the sound of the gunshots let me find you quickly. 
 
**Mash:**
A Servant? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, wait, a Servant you say? But I didn't detect anything at all! 
 
**D：???:**
If I gave off a Servant response, we'd risk the possibility of that great hero of India finding us. 
 
**D：???:**
It's thanks to this Noble Phantasm that I borrowed from that man...Just a moment. I'll get you out of there. 
 
**Mash:**
Who on earth are you&ndash;? 
 
**D：???:**
...Good question. I'm sure you can't trust me unless I tell you my name. 
 
**D：???:**
That said, my True Name is not to be revealed lightly. Though even if I told you, you wouldn't know who I am. 
 
**D：???:**
As such, you should just call me this. “Geronimo”...My name is Geronimo. 
 
**Mash:**
Geronimo! 
 
**Mash:**
The Apache shaman...You were summoned as a Caster, huh? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Strictly speaking, I'm far from being a shaman. I'm just a warrior. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Hero of the Apache! ...I see. There's no way he would follow Edison. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even though they live in the same land...Or, no, that's actually why they're so incompatible. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Strictly speaking, we should also be enemies, but this is no time for that. 
 
**Geronimo:**
There, you're free. Now you should be able to receive magical energy again. 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you! 
 
**Geronimo:**
I'd like to escape...But first we need to take down the mechanized infantry guarding the place. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I'm sure Karna will notice us at that point. It'll take everything you have to escape. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Are you ready? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do it, Mash! 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right&mdash;I'm not used to bullets yet, but I'll do my best! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Geronimo:**
...All right! They're down! But Karna must have noticed. Follow me, quickly! 
 
**Mash:**
Th-This place is bigger than I thought! 
 
**Geronimo:**
In this era, land is the only thing there's plenty of. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mr. Geronimo. Do you mind if I ask you something? 
 
**Geronimo:**
You don't have to raise your voice, mage. I can hear you. What is it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In Eastern and Western America, the Celts and Edison have raised armies and are at war. This we understand. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But do you know of any other Servants who we speculate were summoned as countermeasures? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes, there are three other...No, two other Servants that fight with me. I'll introduce you after we escape. 
 
**Geronimo:**
It seems there are many more Servants who have been summoned here to America, though. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...But we're short on military strength, so we had to act very carefully. 
 
**Geronimo:**
To be honest, the Celtic army is picking us off one by one. 
 
**Geronimo:**
But if you join us, we'll be able to take decisive action. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Wait a moment. I have one question. 
 
**Geronimo:**
What is it, angel? ...I take that back. I was inappropriate. My apologies. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Go ahead. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If memory serves me correctly, Geronimo, you were once at war with this nation. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...That's right. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If this era is corrected, you will be treated as a warrior who failed. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Is that still all right? 
 
**Geronimo:**
I don't mind. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Victory or defeat, in the end, it's no more than a point embedded in the flow of time. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Crushing this era would mean that my brothers and I shed all this blood for nothing. 
 
**Geronimo:**
It's simple to pretend something doesn't exist. It's even easier if that something is disadvantageous to yourself. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Even so, being able to acknowledge something is what makes us warriors. Only a sly coyote would pretend something doesn't exist. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Too much irony for my taste. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I see. Then for now, I can think of you as an ally, yes? 
 
**Geronimo:**
I wouldn't want to try fooling a gaze that could even shoot a sun down. Ah, here's the exit&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...As expected. I'm picking up one powerful Servant. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Outwitting him was too much to ask. But we can't turn back now. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Push through! 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Karna:**
So it is you, Geronimo. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I didn't want to meet the great hero of the Mahabharata under these circumstances. 
 
**Karna:**
I did not wish to encounter the great man who bravely confronted a nation under these circumstances, either. 
 
**Karna:**
However, I must raise my spear now that we're being attacked. Don't worry, I won't let the mechanized infantry interfere. 
 
**Karna:**
This will be a battle just between me and all of you. &ndash;So, prepare to fight. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Listen, Fujimaru. It seems he doesn't expect this to be a battle to the death. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Normally, the odds would be against us, but now that he isn't going all out, we might still have a chance if we can send him flying. 
 
**Geronimo:**
He's a Lancer. Summon Servants that are advantageous against him and unleash Noble Phantasms before he does. Got it? 
 
**Karna:**
It seems you're ready. Then here I come! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Karna:**
Ugh...
 
**Mash:**
S-Somehow we pushed him back! Master, now's the time! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's escape! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's retreat! 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Now! Run, run&ndash;! 
 
**Karna:**
This is as far as I go...Edison. It seems that the clock has started ticking. 
 
**Karna:**
You have asked me for help, so I'll stay until the end...But what can we do to avoid a catastrophe? 
 
## Section 6: Rama Got His Sword 
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai. Are you awake? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good morning, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
That nap was exactly three hours. Rest when you can. That's the spirit. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where are we? 
 
**Mash:**
Geronimo said to take a nap since it's going to be a long journey, but...
 

---

 
**Geronimo:**
Relax. This is a small town in the West. The residents have already evacuated, likely due to the Celts' fierce attacks. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The only people on this land now are those who have come to our side. 
 
**Soldier:**
It's Geronimo! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Is he all right? 
 
**Soldier:**
The life force of Servants is incredible. I can't say he's fine, but he's breathing anyway. 
 
**Mash:**
There's a Servant here? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes. Actually, we're sheltering the third Servant I mentioned here. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Of course I'm helping you because I want your help in return, but most of all, it's to get him medical treatment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
In other words, the spotlight is on me. Not like it matters...
 
**Nightingale:**
If there's a patient who seeks treatment, I will tend to him. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes, please. In your care, he may yet have a chance. 
 
**Geronimo:**
All right, bring him out! 
 
**D：???:**
Ungh...
 
**Mash:**
...Horrible...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A part of his heart has been gouged out! I'm shocked he's still alive! 
 
**D：???:**
Well...Endurance...is...my strong suit...Ugh...
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;I've never seen a wound like this before. But I can't turn you away. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Don't worry, young man. Even if you end up in hell, I'll drag you out. 
 
**D：???:**
Hnngh...That does sound...promising! 
 
**D：???:**
Ah, owwww! C-Can't you be a little more gentle!? 
 
**D：???:**
Do you understand? My heart is crushed! 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm surprised you can even talk. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Anyway, I'll heal you. First, your heart is about to lose all functionality. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Because of that, blood cannot circulate properly in your body...I must cut it out. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...All limbs, I mean. And if possible, I'll take all organs out except your lungs too! 
 
**D：???:**
W-Wait, wait, wait! Focus on repairing just my heart, no amputation! 
 
**D：???:**
I cannot lose any means to fight! 
 
**Nightingale:**
What are you talking about? There is no greater joy than being alive! 
 
**Nightingale:**
As an individual life form who has taken root on this earth, you have a duty to survive, come what may! 
 
**D：???:**
Th-That's easy for you to say! 
 
**Nightingale:**
It's all right. I swear that I'll heal you...I swear it! 
 
**Mash:**
...So, who is he? He doesn't seem like a Servant from this country...
 
**D：???:**
Y-You mean me? I am Rama! The great king of Kosala! 
 
**Rama:**
For more details...Owowowowow! Read the Ramayana! That's all! 
 
**Rama:**
Aaaah, dammit! That really hurts! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Frustrating. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating, frustrating! 
 
**Nightingale:**
No matter how much I slow down the speed of encroaching death, I cannot stop it! 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, I won't give up. As long as this body is alive, I'll fulfill my duty! 
 
**Mash:**
Ah, Nightingale, be more gentle! Who were you fighting that could give you such a wound? 
 
**Rama:**
It was inevitable...After all, my opponent...was Cú Chulainn, Ireland's strongest hero. 
 
**Mash:**
Cú Chulainn!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahhh...Of course. If Celtic warriors are the enemy,then naturally he would be around...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Cú Chulainn...Ireland's most renowned hero, nicknamed the Child of Light. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They say if he aims his lance, Gáe Bolg,it always pierces his target's heart. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I suppose it would be difficult to avoid that,even if you are the hero of the Ramayana. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...More like, it's a miracle you're still alive. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Preventing the collapse of our front lines is important, but I want to heal Rama. 
 
**Geronimo:**
When I heard about a Servant concentrating on healing soldiers, I brought you here&mdash; Hmmm? 
 
**Mash:**
That voice...from the sky. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Tch. Scouts. I'll wipe out every last one of them. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
...I have a favor to ask of you all. At this rate, the boy's condition isn't going to improve. 
 
**Nightingale:**
His heart should've been repaired just now, but more than 10% of it is starting to deteriorate again. 
 
**Nightingale:**
A bottomless bucket...Well, not that bad, but without continuous treatment he will die quickly. 
 
**Nightingale:**
This is completely due to my own incompetence. 
 
**Nightingale:**
However, I do not want to give up on him. I will not give up on him. 
 
**Nightingale:**
This boy wants to live so badly. 
 
**Nightingale:**
As long as he possesses the will to live, I will never give up on him! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Tell me how to do this. How to treat him. Tell me that which I do not know! 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor. Please give us your analysis concerning Rama's injury. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. You don't need to send me any detailed data. I can tell at a glance. It's a curse. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Removing the curse takes precedence over treatment. The fastest way is to defeat the person who injured him. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gáe Bolg is said to be a demonic spear or technique wielded by Cú Chulainn&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any case, there's no doubt that it was a blow that, if left untended, will destroy the heart. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's basically a miracle that Rama is still alive. Normally, I wouldn't be surprised to see him already dead...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or rather, it's strange he's not dead. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Then again, this is Rama, hero of the Ramayana, one of India's two epic poems. If anybody can perform a miracle, it's him. 
 
**Rama:**
Indeed. You should praise me even more...Ouch. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's more accurate to say that Rama reversed his state of death through sheer willpower. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically, the fact that Rama is alive is an “error” in the proper cause-and-effect flow of this world. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Doctor Roman, please correct yourself. I do not think it is an error that he is alive. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Take your finger off that trigger! Please, just hear what I have to say! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As I said earlier, the only way to save him is to eliminate the spear that can distort cause and effect. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However&ndash;I can tell how difficult that is even by monitoring events from over here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Besides Cú Chulainn, it's certain that there are at least two more Servants. 
 
**Rama:**
Exactly. This is quite literally a war that we are in. 
 
**Rama:**
Were I to stage a one-man attack, only death would greet me. Ugh...I'm sorry, please continue your treatment! 
 
**Nightingale:**
You don't need to tell me. Please sit still. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, we do have one thing in our favor. This world's state is unstable. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just like how the Celtic warriors continue to be summoned and fight to the death despite their precarious existences...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If we can somehow strengthen Rama's existence, we can remove the distortion cast on him, or close to it. 
 
**Mash:**
...Is that similar to how we broke Siegfried's curse when we were in France? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. The best thing would be to make contact with a Servant who knew him when he was alive. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Knowing the “blueprint” of his body when he was alive will likely increase the efficacy of Ms. Nightingale's treatment. 
 
**Rama:**
...I know someone. A Servant that meets your criteria exists in this world. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Who, exactly? 
 
**Rama:**
Ah, hmm. It's embarrassing to say, but...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...You can't mean Eli
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, stop! Loose lips sink ships, as they say. 
 
**Mash:**
If you utter that name in a place like this, there is no doubt she will be summoned. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu, foou. 
 
**Rama:**
Huh...Eli? Unfortunately, you are quite off the mark. 
 

---

 
**Rama:**
Another was summoned from the same era as me&mdash;my wife, Sita. 
 
**Rama:**
I have not seen her yet, but I am certain that she is being held captive somewhere in this world. 
 
**Rama:**
I crossed blades with Cú Chulainn in order to find her location. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. Your wife, Sita. You may have dragged her here when you were summoned. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If we find her, it may be possible to cure you. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...I see. At present, Rama is unquestionably the strongest among the Servants who have been summoned. 
 
**Geronimo:**
At full strength, he would likely be an equal match for Karna. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I want to save him if I can. We must locate his wife Sita as soon as possible. 
 
**Geronimo:**
For that purpose, I would like Nightingale to accompany me&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
Hm? I'd go with you to the ends of the earth. Got a problem? 
 
**Rama:**
Truly!? I feel reassured, but you don't need the details!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Why must I abandon my patient? Especially if there is no one besides me who can save him. 
 
**Nightingale:**
With that in mind...I believe it is worth seeking a somewhat more effective nursing method. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Rama, please excuse me. Don't struggle too much. 
 
**Rama:**
Wh-What!? You can carry me so easily!? This is how I used to carry Sita! 
 
**Rama:**
...Isn't that how you carry a princess? 
 
**Mash:**
Oh...
 
**Rama:**
Hey, put me down! What am I to do if my people witness me in this state! 
 
**Nightingale:**
I do not mind. I am used to violent patients. This way, please. We must also prepare a special belt. 
 
**Rama:**
Let me go! Let! Me! Go! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Oh, uh...That was quick. You are truly the angel feared...uh, I mean, adored by all soldiers. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...What's wrong, Doctor? You seem disheartened...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, it's nothing...I mean, Rama is still young, right? Yet he has a wife...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And you're still single at thirty, eh! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yet you're still single at thirty...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can't read your expression, Fujimaru! Are you sympathizing with me or laughing at me? 
 
**Mash:**
? That is true, but I think it's strange for the Doctor to feel inferior. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Shouldn't he feel inferior? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
N-No, I mean&mdash; I believe the Doctor has, uh, been married previously...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whaaaaaaaaaat!? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When did that happen!? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Mash, why did you have to blurt out something like that!? 
 
**Mash:**
But it's true. This one time I saw the Doctor washing his hands and there was a&mdash;
 
**Geronimo:**
Ahem. Sorry, but can we get back to the subject? We're quite pressed for time, too. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh...that's right. I apologize. Please continue. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Besides healing Rama, we also need to figure out how to deal with Edison and the Celtic soldiers. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I suppose Mr. Mage in the other world has some kind of plan in mind? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course. While Fujimaru is on the front lines, my job is to collect data and analyze it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Recall earlier when we&ndash;or Mash Kyrielight, rather, fought with Fionn mac Cumhaill. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He muttered something that bothered me. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
“They're monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won't be a problem for us! ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words...the Celtic soldiers may be able to multiply infinitely. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If that's true, normal attacks are useless. Reducing their numbers won't work as a strategy. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...That did briefly cross my mind. But it's overwhelming to hear someone say it outright. 
 
**Mash:**
Does Edison's mechanized infantry follow the same principle? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's probably fair to say so. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The only way to counter Celtic soldiers, who wouldn't flinch at the loss of thousands, is through mass production. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As an inventor, Edison did not try to pioneer anything&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
His talent lay in modifying other people's cutting-edge inventions so that they became more accessible. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Without Edison, the telephone, the light bulb, and many other so-called “modern conveniences”...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...would have developed at an unimaginably sluggish pace. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Moreover, America's pride is its ability to develop war-machines on a massive scale. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I see. Perhaps it's natural for the King of Inventions to call himself this nation's king. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, it's a troubling idea for us mages: mass production will lower the value of all Mystics. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, there's only one course of action I can recommend. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Assassination&ndash; Use Servants to take out both the king and queen at the same time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Facing them head-on and wasting our resources is exactly what they want. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
With an enemy that can multiply troops indefinitely, the only solution is to target their leader! 
 
**Geronimo:**
&mdash;Exactly. Well put, Doctor. 
 
**Geronimo:**
You must be quite a famous mage. Your voice alone seems unreliable, but that intelligence is anything but. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Even Geronimo has to point that out...I wonder just what's wrong with my image...
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou. 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Doctor. Fou just said, “Geronimo hit the nail on the head. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, I'm well aware that I'm kind of a wimp, okay!? 
 
**Geronimo:**
...All right. To make sure this assassination succeeds,let's unite all the Servants scattered in different areas. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Once we come together, we will make a stand against the Celtic soldiers and Edison. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...We need to make sure to return this land to the hands of its people! 
 
## Section 7: Young Guns 
 
**Geronimo:**
Sorry to do this while we walk,but let me explain the situation again. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I have confirmed the presence of two Servants, both Archers. You'll have to ask them for their True Names. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Both are infamous Servants who specialize in guerrilla warfare. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Unless they run into a particularly powerful enemy, they are unlikely to lose in combat. 
 
**Geronimo:**
But they're at a big disadvantage in terms of numbers. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Even though these Archers excel at guerrilla warfare, the best they can achieve is reducing the extent of the damage. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Celtic soldiers are laying waste to the land as they please. Such savagery is easy to identify. 
 
**Mash:**
Savagery...As they please...Are they not all united in one group? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Not objectively speaking. But, it's obvious that their purpose is seizing control of this land. 
 
**Geronimo:**
So they probably have one objective, but how they accomplish that is left up to each individual. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The literature suggests that Celtic soldiers can be downright vicious and ferocious. 
 
**Rama:**
...Indeed. 
 
**Rama:**
As far as I saw, Cú Chulainn massacred all opposing soldiers. 
 
**Rama:**
His nickname is “Child of Light? ” What a joke. He's truly fallen into darkness already...Ugh! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
By the way, what happened to you, Rama? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Rama, why are you being carried like that? 
 

---

 
**Rama:**
This wasn't my idea! It was this iron-like nurse who...ugh! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Fujimaru. Please try not to disturb the patient. 
 
**Nightingale:**
This is an emergency transportation device I devised. It's not a mere body bag. It's a Rama bag. 
 
**Rama:**
U-Ugh...To be carted around by a woman...How humiliating. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Gender and age are irrelevant for patients. Do not forget that you have a severe injury and cannot walk. 
 
**Geronimo:**
&mdash;Well. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The Western American army forces civilians into factories, making them work on the mechanized infantry's mass production. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow. Edison has become a dictator. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I heard many have sought refuge for the time being, saying it's better than being slain by the Celts. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The war between the East and the West is at a stalemate. While it's a relief that we don't need to worry about the civilians at this stage...
 
**Geronimo:**
...Wait, hide! 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Looks like scouts. If we let even one escape, they'll call reinforcements. 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. I shall hurry to cut off their escape route...huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Umm, Master. What happened to Nightingale? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. She has already pounced on the scouts with a vengeance. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I shall purify the source of the illness! Time for your medical exam. Now, open your chest for me! 
 
**Rama:**
W-Wait!? Do you intend to fight while still carrying me!? 
 
**Rama:**
Wait, hey, my wound...Argh, that hurts! 
 
**Mash:**
M-Master, I will be right back! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
Annihilation complete. Excellent work, hygienically speaking. 
 
**Mash:**
...Um, Nightingale? 
 
**Mash:**
We planned to surround the enemies before battle, so if you rush in on your own, it causes us trouble...
 
**Rama:**
And don't go off fighting with me on your back...I'm your patient, remember...
 
**Nightingale:**
Healing my patients is always my top priority. All other matters are not my concern. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. Senpai. Nightingale won't listen to us. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fofooou...
 
**Rama:**
Hey, Fujimaru. It'd be nice if you did something about this...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But she's a Berserker. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But she's Nightingale. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...You're right...I'm beginning to realize that a conviction so strong you can't compromise is a type of Madness Enhancement too...
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes. Whether she's like this after becoming a Servant, or if she was like this in life is rather scary to contemplate...
 
**Geronimo:**
Luckily, we may reach our destination before that. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Two Archers are in the town ahead. Considering the earlier scout, they're most certainly under attack. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's just as he said, Fujimaru. I've confirmed the presence of multiple enemies and Servants. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They seem to be surrounding the town. Hurry! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. Let's get going, Senpai! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 Huh? Where's Nightingale? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Geronimo:**
...She's gone. On top of that,Rama, who she was carrying on her back, is gone too. 
 
**Mash:**
L-Let's run! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**F：???:**
Huh? Did you hear something just now? 
 
**E：???:**
Hmm...It sounds like people fighting, or something. Have our reinforcements arrived? 
 
**F：???:**
The tables have turned! Old Man Geronimo's finally done it! 
 
**E：???:**
...Hey, hey, Green? 
 
**E：???:**
Remind me. Is Geronimo a woman with a medical bag, toting a gun and carrying a kid on her back? 
 
**F：???:**
...Huh? What's that scary-sounding thing? Not even our banshee is that scary. 
 
**Rama:**
Why, you...You didn't listen to a word of what the others were saying, did you? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes, I did! That good hygiene is the basis of all healing! So I shall now disinfect them all at full power! 
 
**Rama:**
You're such a...Argh! You...Mash! Fujimaru! Hurry up and rescue me already! 
 
**Mash:**
...A-Anyway, in this situation,there's only one thing we can do. 
 
**Mash:**
We need to protect Nightingale! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Leave the cover fire to me! Go! 
 
**Mash:**
All right! Mash Kyrielight&ndash;going in! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Do not interfere with my treatment! 
 
**Rama:**
How should I say it...This is ridiculous...
 
**E：???:**
Hey, hey! Hey, you! You're an ally, right? I think? 
 
**Rama:**
Are you one of the Archers Geronimo was talking about? 
 
**E：???:**
Oh, good. So you ARE an ally! Hey, Green! They're allies! 
 
**F：???:**
That's good to hear. Really good. 
 
**F：???:**
Most of the enemies are gone now, but I was afraid we'd have to go against that scary lady next. 
 
**Rama:**
Oh, how long have you been there? 
 
**F：???:**
It's my skill, don't worry about it. As for me, I'm more interested in the fact that you're being carried on her back. 
 
**Rama:**
&ndash;Please, just don't ask. It's an excessively long and convoluted story. 
 
**E：???:**
Hey, hey! Are those people charging at us our allies too? 
 
**Rama:**
Yes. They are very reliable allies.... At least more than myself right now! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Most of the Celtic warriors have been eliminated&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up a strong enemy response! It's a big one...
 
**Mash:**
It's not another dragon, is it!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No. This&ndash;is a new type of demonic beast. Please be cautious! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Oh, seeing animals here. Just how unsanitary can this place get! 
 
**Nightingale:**
And there're so many different kinds...A true hotbed of bacteria. I'll get triple the disinfectant ready! 
 
**Rama:**
I see, so that's the first thought in your mind seeing this? You're amazing, Nightingale! 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Let's go, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...We won! But for some reason...I feel more exhausted than usual...
 
**Mash:**
Are you all right, Nightingale? Let me treat your wounds&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
I am a nurse, I understand my body more than anyone. I can still move. Wounds like these will heal themselves. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you're bleeding. 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
What of it? On the battlefield my blood is as precious as their blood. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If shedding my own blood spares others from spilling their own, I will gladly do so. 
 
**Nightingale:**
As someone who's joined the military, that's the only mission possible for me. 
 
**Mash:**
...What should we do, Senpai? 
 
**E：???:**
Hey, are you the reinforcements Geronimo mentioned? 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. You must be the ones he spoke about...
 
**E：???:**
Yep, the pair in a solitary struggle. My True Name is...I'll just tell you, since it's too troublesome otherwise. 
 
**E：???:**
I'm Robin Hood, Archer class. And this guy with me here is&ndash;
 
**D：???:**
What the heck? You just blurted it out? No fair. Then I guess there's no reason I should keep mine a secret. 
 
**D：???:**
I'm William Henry McCarty, Jr. Though people call me&ndash;Billy the Kid! 
 
**Billy:**
To protect this nation, it looks like I, a Servant from this nation, was chosen. 
 
**Billy:**
I'm an Archer, of course. Nice to meet you! 
 
**Geronimo:**
I'm glad both of you are alive and well. 
 
**Geronimo:**
This is the Demi-Servant, Mash Kyrielight, and this is her Master, Fujimaru. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice to meet you. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yes, good to meet you. Well, at least we're not fighting all on our own anymore now. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just you two? 
 
**Billy:**
There are some townsfolk who couldn't evacuate. They're injured. 
 
**Mash:**
So that's why Nightingale rushed off like that...
 
**Geronimo:**
Just like a coyote catching the scent of blood.... Maybe that metaphor was a bit rude. 
 
**Nightingale:**
They're quite weakened, but their lives aren't in danger. 
 
**Billy:**
Thank goodness! 
 

---

 
**Billy:**
So, um&ndash; Fujimaru? What should we do now? 
 
**Mash:**
Right, let me explain our current situation. 
 
**Billy:**
...Ah, okay. Heal this Rama kid, find more firepower for our party, and&mdash;
 
**Robin Hood:**
Assassinate the enemy leader. That works, doesn't it? Sounds like an appropriate course of action. 
 
**Billy:**
As expected of someone who's been fighting as the Faceless King, you really don't hesitate. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Both of us are used to doing dirty jobs. Right, Boy Outlaw King? 
 
**Billy:**
Ah, ha, ha! Well, of course! I'm not gonna deal with guys that spawn infinitely. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Considering our lopsided class distribution,we could really use a Saber or Lancer in our lineup. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Having only Mash on the front line leaves our formation unreliable...Especially when Nightingale runs off on her own. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The ideal Servant would be someone summoned to this era who has no connection to the Celts...
 
**Billy:**
I don't think anyone I know has been summoned. 
 
**Nightingale:**
What is lacking the most in this world are nurses. Second to that are doctors. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Oof. I'm not picking up any Servant responses in the vicinity. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you can wait a bit, I'll expand the scan range. 
 
**Mash:**
Until we detect a Servant,I guess we have to patiently keep scouting the area? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
......
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something wrong? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's up? 
 

---

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, just...I guess, um, before I teamed up with this guy, I met some...
 
**Robin Hood:**
A Saber and a Lancer. Well...I mean, they were a Saber and a Lancer, but...
 
**Robin Hood:**
They're, like, ultra-problematic children? 
 
**Mash:**
...Huh? Do they have Madness Enhancement? Or are they Anti-Heroes? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
One's definitely an Anti-Hero. But you can communicate with both of them. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
But they were, I guess you'd say...Well, you'll see when you meet them. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Just don't blame me when you do, okay? 
 
**Mash:**
With our current situation, no matter how problematic the Servant is, we could use their aid. 
 
**Mash:**
When things get dire, Senpai will be able to unite us. Right, Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, I'll figure something out. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, let's make sure things don't get dire. 
 

---

 
**Robin Hood:**
Well, that's reassuring. You've fought beside some pretty troublesome folks, huh? 
 
## Section 8: My Fair Lady 
 
**Medb:**
Oh, really? And then you came running back. How pathetic. 
 
**Fionn:**
Yes. I am very sorry. 
 
**Medb:**
Hey, Cú...What should we do with them? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...What? Yeah, whatever. I don't care. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
They're not kids. They're allowed two mistakes. This is their first. They're off the hook for now. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
However, there won't be a third. Don't waste my time, got that? 
 
**Fionn:**
Understood. Then Diarmuid, let's go. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes. 
 
**Medb:**
How naive! Cú, you need to be a lot more strict to people like that! 
 
**Medb:**
You need to be more like an animal. An animal! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No. Animals are free until they die. Unfortunately, I'm a king. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
The first time, I forgive their carelessness. The second time, I praise their narrow defeat. The third time, I resign myself to the fact that they're weak. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That, I don't need. 
 
**E：???:**
That opinion still suits you even after falling to darkness. Your ferocity against enemies, on the other hand, does not suit you. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...So it's you. 
 
**E：???:**
Surely it's you who called me. 
 
**Medb:**
No, that would be me. 
 
**E：???:**
Oh, Medb, is it? What's wrong? No one to warm your bed at night? I'd be happy to oblige. 
 
**Medb:**
No. Rest assured that I have no issue in that area. Actually, I have a bit of news from an earlier report. 
 
**Medb:**
Servants aiming to “correct” this world have appeared. Enemies trying to return this nation to how it used to be. 
 
**E：???:**
Interesting. How audacious. Are those the ones whom Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne ran into? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If you're bored, you go. They're strong enough, they shouldn't disappoint you. 
 
**E：???:**
Oh, by myself? 
 
**Medb:**
No, they're trying to meet up with one another. So you could sneak ahead, take those Servants and&ndash;
 
**E：???:**
Oh, I see. In other words, pick them off one by one before they all meet up. 
 
**E：???:**
Acceptable. That should be simple enough. 
 
**Medb:**
Thank you, Fergus. When you return, maybe I'll keep you company for a night? 
 
**Fergus:**
&ndash;Hmm, oh, no, no. I'll pass after all. 
 
**Fergus:**
I finally got my second life. It's not bad to be greedy&ndash;But being celibate every so often can't hurt. 
 
**Fergus:**
I'll dedicate all my vigor to combat. I'll let my surging animal instincts guide me. 
 
**Fergus:**
Don't you feel the same way? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;No. I won't get all enthusiastic over a battle that will end once I kill everyone. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
My task is to flatten this whole nation. Minor skirmishes with foot soldiers are mere drudgery. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll fulfill my destined role. Before I die, this nation will become an uninhabited wasteland. 
 
**Fergus:**
I see...In spite of that, you're quite...
 
**Fergus:**
Never mind. Something about friendships and hedges. Now, my queen, if you'll excuse me! 
 
**Medb:**
Good luck. I love you, Fergus♪
 
**Fergus:**
Hmph. Except for your body, you're the worst woman ever. However, you do have a sharp eye for good men! 
 
**Medb:**
Well, how will they react? We're up against Rama and Geronimo, right? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And that one group. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Do they have a strong sense of purpose? Of duty? Or no reason at all? ...At any rate, what a nuisance. 
 
**Medb:**
Cú, you've changed so much. You've become more regal. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I'm still my old self. Everybody has moments when they're not so eager to fight. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's just how I'm feeling at the moment. 
 
**Medb:**
I suppose. The animalistic side of you lusts for fulfilling battles and love. 
 
**Medb:**
And the empty, hollow side of you is bored of battle, and just stoically deals with things. 
 
**Medb:**
When summoned as a Servant,which side manifests is a matter of chance. 
 
**Medb:**
Admittedly, you're basically one of my creations. I'm quite astounded at our compatibility. 
 
**Medb:**
To be sure, I love both sides of you, Cú. I love you&ndash; Really, truly. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Shut up. You're annoying. 
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;You're so spiteful. Hehehe. 
 
**Medb:**
That aside, half of Eastern America has already fallen. 
 
**Medb:**
We've killed George Washington and exterminated the majority of the nation's leaders. 
 
**Medb:**
...I thought the battle was won. Who would've known that the West would unite to oppose us? 
 
**Medb:**
“Edison,” was it? I didn't expect a mere human to go this far. 
 
**Medb:**
The worst thing is that they have Karna on their side. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Fool. I told you to mow them down while they were still weak. 
 
**Medb:**
Look, I didn't think a mere “King of Inventions” would go this far! 
 
**Medb:**
I can't shake the feeling that he has some kind of backing. Something besides the Holy Grail. 
 
**Medb:**
Otherwise, it's impossible to explain how he can oppose us as much as he has. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Hmm. That's alarming. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Well, I'll go and deal with him in time. Make sure our preparations are in order. 
 
**Medb:**
Yes, of course. 
 
**Medb:**
Well, Cú. Let's dream together. A dream as pleasant as a nightmare. 
 
**Medb:**
When we awake, I'm sure things will have moved forward. Hopefully it will be something to celebrate&ndash; Hehehe. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Ugh, I'm so depressed. Completely run-down. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Why do I have to travel to America's remote regions just to see those guys...
 
**Mash:**
? What is holding you back? Did you meet them when you were alive? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Of course not. I never met such an overwhelming group when I was human. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
But it still feels like we're inextricably linked. Like we're connected, but still apart, you know? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ex-girlfriend? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Girlfriend? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I see. So that was the reason. Robin, I underestimated you. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, Fujimaru...Don't pull such scary stuff out of that imagination of yours. 
 
**Billy:**
But that's what it sounded like he was talking about. Don't you all agree? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Who cares? 
 
**Rama:**
...I am ignorant of such matters. I am dedicated to my wife, Sita. 
 
**Nightingale:**
What? A “girlfriend”...Is that the name of a new antibiotic? 
 
**Billy:**
Oh, this is pointless! Nobody here has a sense of humor! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I think they settled down around here...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa. I'm getting enemy readings, so watch out! 
 
**Mash:**
Okay. Master, let's go! 
 
**Mash:**
...Wait. Huh? 
 
**Billy:**
Don't these guys seem kind of weak? Well, whatever. I guess that's good for us. 
 
**Billy:**
Okay, let's do this! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Robin Hood:**
They're weak, but there are so many of them. I wonder why they're so weak. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Is it, maybe? No, there's no way...there's no way. 
 
**Mash:**
Is something wrong? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
It's nothing. Let's get on with this. We're not finished here yet. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Billy:**
Yup, they were weak! 
 
**Mash:**
But they're the same Celtic soldiers we've been fighting, right? Seems like they fought something else before us&ndash;
 
**Geronimo:**
...Hmm? 
 
**Billy:**
Geronimo, what's wrong? 
 
**Geronimo:**
No, I just heard a weird sound&ndash;
 
**Billy:**
Oh, you're right. What is that...exactly? 
 
**Billy:**
Each individual sound is beautiful, but when you put them together, they feel murky, like mud...
 
**Billy:**
It's like when you use red, blue, yellow, green, and pink paint...and the canvas goes all black. 
 
**Mash:**
Please wait, Master. I feel like we've heard this song somewhere. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's just your imagination-tion-tion! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's an auditory illusion-sion-sion! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master, the way you are ending your sentences is very strange! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ugh. Is she still singing...

**Elisabeth:**

**Elisabeth:**
Oh, wait a minute. I should have ended that “okay” on a much springier, livelier note. Definitely. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Then I'd do a cute little spin, and slap my tail at the audience. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's so fun to practice! I feel like I'm just getting more and more charming! It's great! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
If I say so myself, it's scary how perfect I am...Adding all these practices on top of my natural talent...I am entering godhood! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Heh heh, just you wait, Saber. Next time we meet, I'll be way different! 
 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me, Master. 
 
**Mash:**
I believe the situation calls for you to say something that should be said.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me?

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why me?

**Mash:**
Yes. There is only one thing to say. Senpai, I have faith in you. You can do it.

Okay&mdash; Go ahead!

What, you've never heard of it? It's the home of musicals! Oh, the glory of Broadway! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's a glittering hub of entertainment! A sparkling paradise for artistic expression...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Well, this place is just a hillbilly town at the moment. It is none other than I who deemed it Broadway! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
So here and there are the only places in America that are worth anything. Hehe, I can see it now. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
All the pigs enchanted by my singing voice flock around me here, one after another&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
Eventually I'll have everything built here. My own stage, my own theater, my own cinema. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll reign over it all as an unscalable magical tower! The only other thing I need is...Right, a statue of me! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
A super statue, 500 meters tall,faithfully capturing my exquisite beauty! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
As the goddess of fresh blood, I'll raise my voice in song with a tomato in one hand and end the cutthroat world of idols! 
 
**Billy:**
...Could someone stop her? Please? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, don't look at me like that! I don't want to! Look, uh, everyone has the right to dream! 
 
**Billy:**
Hahaha. Delusions aren't dreams, and with how she is now, her dreams won't come true even after a century passes. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Treating damaged vocal cords is one thing,but curing delusions is beyond my expertise. 
 
**Mash:**
......

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Huh? ...I am very sorry, Master. 
 
**Mash:**
My mind wandered off for a moment there. Elisabeth, this is our third meeting! 
 
**Mash:**
If you'll allow me to be frank, I believe your only audience is Celtic soldiers eager to pounce on you! 
 
**Mash:**
Your beautiful voice won't reach their hearts. They hear only the death throes of a hungry dragon! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Huh? 
 
**Billy:**
Oh, I finally get it. Why those guys we ran into earlier were so weak. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
You do? Me, too! 
 
**Geronimo:**
I get it, too. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I was getting so fired up because so many fans wanted to get near me...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Is it true that those half-naked macho men were just a bunch of fools incapable of understanding my art? 
 
**Mash:**
Correct! Those fellows would be quite out of place on your stage. 
 
**Mash:**
As a fan, my advice to you is to unleash your song at the right place and time! 
 
**Mash:**
In order to promote your art(istically atrocious singing), I humbly beseech you to lend us your strength! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nice job, Mash! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Oh, so that's your plan...
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
&ndash;I see. I don't really get it, but I'm convinced. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Basically, you need my power, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh...Well, I can't say “no” when a passionate fan asks me to do something. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You've passed, Mash! I, Elisabeth Báthory, henceforth pledge my microphone to your Master! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes! Thank you so much! 
 
**Billy:**
...I see. So that's how you're supposed to talk to that dumb dragon...
 
**Robin Hood:**
I had a feeling she loved to be flattered. But there's no way I could so desperately beg her for anything. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...We are Servants. Thus, once we achieve our goal, we have no choice but to return to the Throne. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...In the end, will she really have enough time to build her own Broadway? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That is to remain unsaid, Old Man Geronimo. 
 
**Billy:**
So, where's the next one? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
We're going to pass through the eastern forest. Saber's in the town on the other side. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Another...Saber? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Right, Saber. An equal match for our Lancer here. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Umm...are you perhaps referring to the “red” one? 
 
**Billy:**
? You can tell your Sabers apart based on whether they're red or blue? 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
I see, I see. Basically you're recruiting other members for me. I'm your vocalist, so...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, I've got it! An assistant director, right? Lighting, seating, acoustics! Yup, those are important! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru. I meant to say this earlier, but thanks for what you did for me in France! 
 
**Mash:**
Not at all. It is we who should extend our gratitude...Thank you very much. 
 
**Mash:**
The Saber class is an indispensable part of the group. Let's go. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ah! What's up with this forest? It's so big! I'm scared! 
 
**Mash:**
The giant sequoias in the West are supposedly even larger. 
 
**Billy:**
They're worth seeing once. If you're ever in Sierra Nevada, be sure not to miss them. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Wow. America's forests are amazing. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yeah, these forests are still pristine. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
There are animals resembling gorillas, too. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Right. Those gorilla-like things...Um, where? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Over there. See. There's one waving at us. It's holding a glow stick, no doubt. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...That's not a gorilla, it's a werewolf-type enemy. And it's holding a club. 
 
**Mash:**
P-P-Prepare for battle! It was clearly trying to ambush us! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh, it's just an enemy? That's too bad. Let's finish this up quickly! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
I worked up a little sweat. My [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], give me something to wipe the sweat off. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Here, use this...
 

---

 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, wait! It's not right to use my Noble Phantasm as a towel! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Master, don't get carried away and try to snatch anything from me either! 
 
## Section 9: A Star Is Born 
 
**Mash:**
We have emerged from the forest. Robin, is that the town you told us about? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, that's right.... Hmm? Somebody's here. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes, that's an ally. 
 
**Spy:**
Geronimo. I have news. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Hmm...I see. I'm sorry, but please continue your investigation. 
 
**Billy:**
Who were those guys? 
 
**Geronimo:**
They've been tracking the Celtic soldiers for me. In particular, I want to know where they're coming from. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Once we get that Saber on our side,we can pursue the matter further. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ugh, I don't want to do this...
 
**G：???:**
♪Hum, hum, hum, hum...Okay then, the groundwork is in place. 
 
**G：???:**
It's a shame that a Western is the only thing you can shoot in a town like this&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
But not to worry. Even in a Western, my extraordinary acting talent will no doubt win me an Academy Award! 
 
**G：???:**
I'll be concurrently responsible for production, direction, the script, music, and the leading role...
 
**G：???:**
Oh, no! I just realized there's no cameraman&ndash;! 
 
**G：???:**
Hmph, what am I to do...Perhaps the time has finally come for me to try my hand at summoning? 
 
**G：???:**
But my profound talent may result in summoning a big shot...I'll be forced to choose between Eastwood and Scott...
 
**E：???:**
Hmm. Hollywood, is it? One must not underestimate the creative minds of Servants. 
 
**G：???:**
Hmph, who are you? I'm quite busy, so off with you...Unless you're a cameraman. 
 
**Fergus:**
Do excuse me. My name is Fergus. I once earned my keep as a Knight of the Red Branch. 
 
**Fergus:**
Normally, I would have happily called myself a cameraman in order to hit on you&ndash;but things are complicated now. 
 
**G：???:**
Oh? 
 
**Fergus:**
So I'm going to kill you. Period. If you want someone to resent, you have only me. 
 
**Fergus:**
I'm doing this entirely for myself, after all. I'll cut you down just because I want to. 
 
**G：???:**
Hmph. You seem to have your reasons, but I won't ask. You're quite bold to think you can kill me. 
 
**G：???:**
I don't mean to boast, but I, Nero Claudius, am not a petty Servant who will die so easily, you see? 
 
**Fergus:**
...Nero, the tyrant of ancient Rome! What an unusual Servant to run into. 
 
**Fergus:**
No wonder your radiance is different from that mediocre rabble. Such a swelling. A swelling similar to a waterfall. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Mediocre...rabble? 
 
**Fergus:**
Indeed. On my way here,I cut down three other Servants. 
 
**Fergus:**
So you'll be my fourth victim. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Oh. Very impressive. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
But unfortunately, O mighty Fergus mac Róich, you're quite mistaken. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
The fourth victim...will be YOU! 
 
**Fergus:**
&ndash;I see. So I guess you aren't just an emperor that orders people about from your throne. 
 
**Fergus:**
How delightful. I guess there was no need to bring them...
 
**Fergus:**
Very well then. I'm Fergus, of the Saber class. I'll face you as one of the queen's knights. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
You know, what you're most mistaken about is your destiny. You are truly unlucky. 
 
**Fergus:**
...What? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
&ndash;You're here, right? Faceless King! 
 
**Fergus:**
...Ugh!! 
 
**Fergus:**
...Who's there? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, yeah. I'll just come on out now. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey there, little emperor. I'm impressed you knew I was here. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Call it my sixth sense. I'm quite attuned to the presence of spectators. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yup, yup. Nothing less from a tyrant always seeking love. Anyway, I'm not the only one who came running here. 
 
**Mash:**
Nero!? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmm, that voice...I feel like I have heard it somewhere before...
 
**Mash:**
Oh, that's right...You were still alive, back in Rome. 
 
**Mash:**
Ahem. Your Majesty, Nero Claudius. I am Mash Kyrielight. 
 
**Mash:**
Please accept our humble assistance. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, we owe you for your help in Rome! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Grant us the glory of fighting by your side one more time! 
 

---

 
**Nero Bride:**
Oh? So we have met somewhere before. You have earned my trust. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Anyway, both of you are my type! What beautiful faces! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
You may have the honor of standing beside me! Pleased to meet you, strangers from my past! 
 
**Mash:**
...Hehe. Master. Nero is just the same, isn't she? 
 
**Fergus:**
Hmm. I suppose it is reckless to take on so many. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
It would save us a lot of trouble if you would just surrender. 
 
**Fergus:**
&ndash;Surely, you jest. 
 
**Fergus:**
I also shall borrow the power of my queen! Come out, brave soldiers! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
!!! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Tch, so they were hiding. 
 
**Fergus:**
One against seven is a bit tough, but a hundred against seven should be more even. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh great...Looks like I can't slack off here. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I do not pardon laziness, mouse. If you wish to serve me, fight for your life. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Got it. Well then&ndash; Guess it's time to perform my role as an ally of justice! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fergus:**
Ugh! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's checkmate, General Muscles. 
 
**Fergus:**
General...Hah, general, you say? Sorry, but I'm no general. 
 
**Fergus:**
My role is to simply add a little flair to the queen's legend. 
 
**Fergus:**
I only wished to become her equal in the world this time...
 
**Rama:**
W-Wait, Fergus! Do you know of my bride, Sita? 
 
**Rama:**
The wife of a man named Rama, by the name of Sita! 
 
**Fergus:**
Your bride? I don't know if she was your bride, but I've seen a young woman of similar appearance to you. 
 
**Rama:**
Where!? 
 
**Fergus:**
...Hmph, very well. That was the one thing I found unpleasant in the queen's strategy, after all. 
 
**Fergus:**
Return to the West, Rama. To Alcatraz Island. Your bride may be there. 
 
**Rama:**
Did you say...Alcatraz Island? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, the famous prison island, said to be impossible to escape!? 
 
**Fergus:**
It's your choice whether to trust me or not. 
 
**Rama:**
No...I will. I'll believe you, Fergus mac Róich. 
 
**Rama:**
I'll head to Alcatraz Island. 
 
**Fergus:**
Heroes of India gaze at other people with such pure, beautiful eyes...
 
**Fergus:**
Still, good grief&ndash;
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm? 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? 
 
**Fergus:**
There are so many splendid women here besides the queen. 
 
**Fergus:**
What a waste, to die at a time like this...Ahahaha! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...A Celtic warrior who can admire beauty? That man Fergus had such fine taste! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
No, I think it's just that he doesn't have any standards at all...
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm? Did you say something? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, nothing. Anyway, what are you doing in an abandoned city like this, Your Majesty? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
You can't tell? ...Well, I suppose I can't blame you. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hehehe, I know. I've got it! This is a plan only a woman with an appreciation for art and beauty could come up with! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
We meet again, Saber! It must be fate that we were both summoned to America. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I can hear Mount János whispering to settle things here. To see who has the greater talent! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Oh? ...I thought I sensed something tingling. It must have been you, the devilish singing diva, Elisabeth! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hehehe. Things must be made clear to you, above all others. Listen well. In fact, everyone should listen...
 
**Nero Bride:**
To my grand plan which is as profound as the deepest abyss! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...I've already got an idea. Well, go right ahead, Your Majesty. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Very well, I shall! Here, I plan to build the city of ultimate fantasy, namely...
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hollywood! That world-renowned palace of amusement! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whaaaaaat!? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Whaaaaaat. 
 

---

 
**Nero Bride:**
Yes, such a pleasant reaction, thank you! I see you're a top class Master! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ugh...To think you've taken one of the two greatest locations in America...Though admittedly I've already taken the other one...
 
**Elisabeth:**
I knew it, Saber...You and I are tied by bonds of true friendship! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
We're rivals! And friends who appreciate the same art! 
 
**Mash:**
...It's just like we expected, Senpai. 
 
**Billy:**
Heroes are amusing, aren't they, Geronimo? 
 
**Geronimo:**
I feel like I understand why the Roman Empire collapsed now. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Treating someone's aesthetic sense is outside of my field. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Do you intend to help me with my plan? I could even promote you to sub-heroine, Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much. It's an honor to be the sub-heroine. 
 
**Mash:**
...However, Nero. Or should I say, Your Majesty. There's just one problem with your plan. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm? What on earth could be the flaw in my perfect plan? 
 
**Mash:**
This nation is currently in the middle of a war due to these Celtic warriors. 
 
**Mash:**
As it is now, you won't find any cameramen&ndash;or even an audience! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
(Yup. I know that all too well. I knew that all along! )
 
**Nero Bride:**
N-No wonder a single person hasn't appeared to listen to my rehearsals! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
There's a saying in the Orient: “Amusement is only amusing when you have a livelihood. ”
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Well, it might have been a little different...But close enough. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Very well! In that case, I must make a stand as well! To build a golden city of movies in this land! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Elisabeth, our showdown is on hold. For now, we need to mop up the Celtic warriors in this country! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, I'd expect no less from my rival! I won't lose! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Leave the ticket sales to me! I'll force it on them after they're defeated! 
 
**Mash:**
What a beautiful friendship. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, beautiful...As long as we don't get wrapped up in it. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Anyway, this means Saber's our ally now. We even took down Fergus as a bonus. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Let's consider this to be a good omen. 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, there's a transmission from the Doctor. Yes, Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry for interrupting your fun. If you head a little west from your location, you'll find a point with a strong Leyline. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd like you to establish a circle and set up a summoning point as usual. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. Everyone, I'm sorry, but there's a place we'd like to go. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But the patient...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, don't worry about that. Once the summoning point is established, we can supply healing spells. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Using that, you can hold out for a while. Securing camp is vital, for Rama's sake as well. 
 
## Section 10: Ambivalent States 
 
**Mash:**
As usual, it seems enemies are gathering at the Leyline. Let's clean them up. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
I'll set up the summoning circle now. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes, nice work as always. I'm glad you managed to establish the base safely. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now then. I suppose today's story should be about the United States of America? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Although...I don't have much relation to that nation at all...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Besides, what kind of fool would put a code in their own self-portrait? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Do you know how it feels to have something like that pushed onto you? Do you? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, setting that aside...
 
**Da Vinci:**
The phrase “e pluribus unum” is their national motto, meaning “out of many, one. ”
 
**Da Vinci:**
But that is the contradiction. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
To unite many into a single entity,the many must lose their individuality. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
They claim to be rationalism incarnate,yet act as champions of justice. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
They strive to be the strongest in the world, yet believe in a god. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
The nation of America is the embodiment of contradictory tendencies in humans. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;And for that reason, their nation has no connection whatsoever to monsters or Magecraft. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
While they may all reach for the same unattainable stars, their approaches are fundamentally different. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But having no connection doesn't mean one has no knowledge. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
A Holy Grail War may have occurred, even in this nation. But that would be in a different world, a faraway world&ndash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
...That's about it for today's lesson, I think. The summoning circle is established, after all. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, ciao everyone♪Do your best as always! 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Hm, night falls quickly. We should rest soon. 
 
**Geronimo:**
It'd be one thing if we were all Servants, but we have a Master with us. Plus one of us is wounded. 
 
**Rama:**
I'm fine! Oww...
 
**Nightingale:**
I fully understand your condition. Please stop trying to act tough. 
 
**Rama:**
H-Hey! Stop trying to gouge my wounds! Fine, I got it. I want to rest, I really do! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hm, that's fine I suppose. Hey, Greenie, lend me that towel. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I told you, this isn't a towel! It's my Noble Phantasm! It's not something to sit your ass on! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Haah. You're so stingy. I can tell how you were raised, you know? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I don't need to be told by some exploitative aristocrat! 
 
**Billy:**
There are silent ways to laugh! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
You're always laughing out loud, though. Geez...
 
**Billy:**
Night gets cold, so I'll gather firewood now. Sound okay? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes, we aren't within their sphere of influence yet. It would be a problem if Fujimaru freezes to death. 
 
**Billy:**
Okay. Robin, help me out. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll go sing for a bit. One needs to keep practicing, no matter the time. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's both the fate and duty of an idol. Also, a life of an idol. Oh, and hope of an idol. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmm, well said. I won't lose either! 
 
**Nightingale:**
The necrosis in your heart is starting to spread faster. I can still keep you alive for a few days, but&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
After that, I can't make any promises. 
 
**Rama:**
I understand. Just let me rest for now. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'll inject a double dose of painkillers. That should help. 
 
**Rama:**
No, I won't stay conscious without the pain. I need to be able to move, if the time comes...
 
**Nightingale:**
Then I'll give you the normal dose. Just be prepared for intense pain. 
 
**Rama:**
I know. This is a punishment that I must accept. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Punishment? 
 
**Rama:**
I suffered an unsightly defeat to Cú Chulainn. Not only that, but to save me&ndash;
 
**Rama:**
Many people were sacrificed. Therefore, this is my punishment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Are idiots allowed to become kings in India? 
 
**Rama:**
What? 
 
**Nightingale:**
In what world would people, after risking their lives to save someone, be happy to see that person suffer? 
 
**Nightingale:**
The people who saved you surely wished for your safety, and for your good health. 
 
**Rama:**
Uh...
 
**Nightingale:**
All too foolish. Recover from your wounds, and fight to honor those who saved you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is the best, and only, thing you can do for them. 
 
**Rama:**
...Thanks for the advice. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's a nurse's duty. 
 
**Mash:**
...Ah, Master. The stars are beautiful, aren't they? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's nothing there. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, a primal landscape. A place where it's hard for people to survive, where only beasts are allowed to live. 
 
**Mash:**
How long do you need to devote to something for a nation to be born here&ndash;I can't even begin to imagine. 
 
**Mash:**
Countless people, resources, blood and sweat. The culmination of humanity's efforts that transcends good and evil. 
 
**Mash:**
...No matter how much I thought about it in Chaldea, I couldn't understand...But I'm starting to see now. 
 
**Mash:**
It's all because of you. Thank you very much. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're welcome. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm nothing special. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
What is it, Fou? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Don't run, Fou! Just sit still, and let me brush you! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou fou! 
 
**Mash:**
You're being threatened, Nero. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hmph, too bad. By the way, Geronimo was calling for you. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
He wanted to talk about our plans going forward...Hm? 
 
**Mash:**
Night is their time. Call for everyone. Let's fight back! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Geronimo:**
We're currently in the western region of North America. The Celtic warriors seem to mainly be coming from the East. 
 
**Geronimo:**
American army bases and cities have fallen one after another. 
 
**Geronimo:**
While most of them massacre men and women of all ages, some Servants seem to allow non-combatants to escape. 
 
**Geronimo:**
It's fine to be an honorable Servant, but those that escaped are going to die sooner or later regardless. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The East is almost completely occupied. And...This is the most important part...
 
**Geronimo:**
They're using Washington as their base. In other words, the original capital. 
 
**Mash:**
Are you sure of that? 
 
**Geronimo:**
It's information from a man who escaped from Washington, but I have no proof. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Still, if you don't mind hearing my personal intuition, I believe this is the enemy's main stronghold. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Why is that? 
 
**Geronimo:**
When seeking to humiliate a nation,the most effective method is to occupy their capital. 
 
**Geronimo:**
On the other hand, the United Western States led by Edison has been actively accepting refugees from the East. 
 
**Geronimo:**
He makes them work in mechanized infantry factories, and diligently makes improvements each day. 
 
**Geronimo:**
He is accompanied by Helena Blavatsky, with whom he was also friends in life&ndash;
 
**Geronimo:**
As well as one of the most powerful beings in Indian mythology, the “Hero of Benefaction” Karna, from the Mahabharata. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Blavatsky may be obvious, but it's unknown why Karna would have taken his side...
 
**Geronimo:**
Regardless, those three and their mechanized infantry seem to be compensating for their lack of Servants. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Now, assuming that Washington is the enemy stronghold&ndash;the question is, what should we do next? 
 
**Billy:**
I know! Can't we wait for them to destroy each other? 
 
**Geronimo:**
That would be difficult. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Since the Celts possess the Grail, Edison's army can't close the military power gap regardless of the improvements he's made. 
 
**Geronimo:**
If anything, it's the chaotic nature of the current situation that allows small forces like us to move around freely. 
 
**Billy:**
That's true. Never mind! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Most of us rallying here on this occasion are heroes, but not really heroes. 
 
**Geronimo:**
An outlaw, an outcast, a lone wolf.... That's the type of folk we are. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Given the chance, they will exploit that weakness of ours. So there's only one way to win. 
 
**Geronimo:**
We must search for specific Servants, and eliminate them. 
 
**Geronimo:**
As I thought, our only option is assassination. We'll infiltrate their base and take out the Servants. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Um...Is that really okay? There's more than one of them, right? 
 
**Geronimo:**
You're correct, dragon girl. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The capital has the toughest defense in a nation. It would be difficult for even an Assassin to infiltrate and assassinate someone. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Normally, at least. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Which means? 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Celtic warriors are extremely belligerent. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Also, considering the haphazard nature of their invasions, it's obvious they simply do as they please. 
 
**Geronimo:**
In other words&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
...The Celtic warriors won't place any emphasis on defending the capital? 
 
**Geronimo:**
That's my speculation. They simply see a fortress as a place to live, and not a place to defend. 
 
**Geronimo:**
They stress about how strong their warriors ought to be&mdash; Their society values individuals more than the whole. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ah, I get it. Rather than build up a castle's defenses, they think they can rely on their own strength. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's the opposite of Edison, who believes in uniformity and strength in numbers. No wonder their castle is shorthanded. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yeah. However, this is a gamble. 
 
**Geronimo:**
We have no way to defend the West. We must gamble since the difference in military strength is overwhelming. 
 
**Billy:**
Hmm, I guess this really is the bottom of the barrel. 
 
**Billy:**
I don't like it, but I doubt there's a better plan than this. 
 
**Billy:**
I got no problem with this plan. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
No matter how slim it may be, I will take any chance I can get. An all-or-nothing gamble scares me. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Lancer and I don't mind, either. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Right. We're really busy, so the sooner it ends the better. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Medical treatment is pointless if it doesn't address the source. If Washington is the lesion, it must be cut out. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...However, we should prioritize treatment of this patient first. 
 
**Rama:**
I'm fine...Or so I'd like to say, but I'm useless when it comes to assassination. I'll only slow you down. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes, exactly. That's why I want to split our force into two. 
 
**Geronimo:**
One group will go with Nightingale in pursuit of the Servant Sita, who has ties to Rama, for his treatment. 
 
**Geronimo:**
The other will infiltrate the East,and carry out the assassination. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...The assassination mission is dangerous, there's a high chance of failure. We must avoid clumping up and getting wiped out. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Personally, I'd like Mash and Fujimaru to accompany Nightingale and Rama. 
 
**Geronimo:**
What do you think? 
 
**Mash:**
Us? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Yes. To put it one way...You're our ace in the hole. Literally, our trump card. 
 
**Geronimo:**
If all goes well and we eliminate the enemy, that's fine. If we can't, the rest is in your hands. 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai? I'll leave the decision up to the Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go with that. 
 

---

 
**Geronimo:**
Very well, I'll leave it to you. Now, in terms of balance...I'd like at least one more Servant to go along with you. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Hm, okay. Lancer...No, Elisabeth. You should go with them. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? Why me? We're not going together? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. While I'd love to see whose song is better...We can't exactly sing loudly during an assassination mission. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
That would be boring. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
That's why when we meet again, we'll make a big stage. They'll be the judges, and we'll finally settle things. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
To see who the true idol is! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ugh...How splendid! A once-in-a-lifetime performance! I'd expect no less from my rival. You think BIG! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Judges? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Let's just pretend we didn't hear that. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
But in that case, shouldn't you go with the Master instead of me, Nero? Can you handle something as complicated as an assassination? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hehehe, sorry to disappoint you, but I'm more fitted for assassination.... Why, you ask? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I'm Nero Claudius. I'm a veteran of both assassinating and being assassinated! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Life as emperor is filled with conspiracies. Kill or be killed, poison or be poisoned. It's filled with gory details. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Umu. I feel sad just saying that...Either way, there's no one more suited for assassination than me! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Ahem...Go on, feel free to applaud. Applaud. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's not something to brag about, Your Majesty. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I know. Even I'm not even really trying to brag. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
But with my “Imperial Privilege,” I can mimic an Assassin for a while. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
There's also another very important reason. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Important...reason? 
 
**Mash:**
What could that be...
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. Well you see...Rama and I are way too similar! 
 
**Rama:**
That's all!? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What do you mean, that's all? It's important not to have overlapping characteristics! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...In that case, we can't help it. That's a fatal issue for any group, after all...
 
**Rama:**
It's really that important? So much so that you accepted it instantly!? 
 
**Rama:**
Hey, Fujimaru. I'm really confused here! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't worry about it. 
 
**Rama:**
You say that, but...
 
**Nightingale:**
Okay, settle down a bit, patient. 
 
**Rama:**
Owwww! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Individuality is important. 
 
**Rama:**
Fujimaru, you too? So characteristic overlap...is really that important...
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Anyway, it's fine. You'd better get that assassination done, Nero. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
That goes without saying. Just leave it to me. It's like a secret live performance. 
 
**Geronimo:**
That settles it, then. Myself, Robin, Billy, and Nero...
 
**Geronimo:**
Our team will head to the East for the assassinations. And&ndash;
 
**Geronimo:**
Nightingale, Rama, Mash, Elisabeth,and Master Fujimaru...
 
**Geronimo:**
Your team will head to Alcatraz Island to rescue Sita. Any issues with that, Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not at all. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please be careful. 
 

---

 
**Geronimo:**
Of course. Very well, we'll depart tomorrow morning. 
 
**Mash:**
I'll give you a communication device. We can use it to decide where to rendezvous afterwards. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Sure. Now rest up and prepare for tomorrow. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Particularly you, Master. You need to head back west. Make sure you eat something and sleep well tonight. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Geronimo:**
We'll be heading to the East now. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, and we'll head to Alcatraz Island. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I'm sure there are Celtic Servants posted at Alcatraz Island as well. Be careful. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. You too, Geronimo. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Master. Our time together was short, but enjoyable. I pray for success on your end. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You sound like you're going to die. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You sound like we won't meet again. 
 

---

 
**Geronimo:**
Hm, I suppose I do sound like that.... Don't worry, we'll meet again. 
 
**Billy:**
Hey, Master. Don't worry, this will be quick. 
 
**Billy:**
Just sit tight and wait for the good news! ...Just kidding. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Take care of the little princess here, Master. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, it should be the other way around! I'm going to take care of these guys. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, yeah.... Anyway, time to get to work. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. Fujimaru, watch over Lancer for me. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, you too, Saber? That's so rude. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Ahahahaha. Forgive me, Lancer. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Listen, Saber. This is a promise. When you come back, we'll settle who number one is&ndash;
 
**Nero Bride:**
I know. We'll have a showdown, fair and square,and see who's more worthy of the audience's applause! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I'll show you my true strength when that time comes! &mdash;It's mind-blowing, by the way! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
So she's been holding back all this time? Now that's a scary thought. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, go and kill them all, Saber. We still have that collaboration between Golden Theater and Castle Csejte to do. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, leave everything to me! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Well, let's get moving. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. It was a quick farewell, but I have no regrets. Now, to finish our tasks. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...We're not going to our deaths, Nero. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I'm aware of that. But I also know how dangerous assassination plots can be. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
We're infiltrating deep into enemy lines. Prioritizing our own survival reduces the chance of success. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, are you planning to...
 
**Nero Bride:**
Say nothing more. It would be insensitive of you, Archer...I mean, Robin Hood. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I intend to survive. My stubbornness is second to none, after all! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's true. I don't intend to die, either. Let's just do our best. 
 
**Billy:**
Hey, Geronimo. 
 
**Geronimo:**
What? 
 
**Billy:**
I'm an American, so it's fine, but...You're a proud Apache, right? 
 
**Billy:**
Is it really okay? Saving this nation, I mean. 
 
**Geronimo:**
You're still saying that? If this nation isn't saved, we won't be saved, either. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Besides, the idea of America owing me a debt is pleasant. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Even if all is lost and forgotten once the world corrects itself. 
 
**Geronimo:**
There's no need for you to feel any sort of guilt. 
 
**Billy:**
...I see. Then I'll go with that. 
 
**Billy:**
I just hope this assassination goes well. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed...
 
**Rama:**
Ugh...
 
**Nightingale:**
...Master. It seems he's finally approaching his limit. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Please try to make haste. If not, I may be forced to amputate the patient's limbs...
 
**Rama:**
Anything but that. Haha, I need to show some willpower...
 
**Nightingale:**
This patient's display of toughness is praise-worthy. An ordinary person would have broken mentally already. 
 
**Rama:**
I can't die until I meet my wife. That is my duty, as the king of Kosala. 
 
**Rama:**
...At least, that's what I tried to do. But she ended up being harmed for that reason. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, according to the Ramayana, you suspected your wife of infidelity, and tested her twice. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Seriously? No wonder she got mad at you. 
 
**Rama:**
...No, I never suspected my wife of infidelity. But that wasn't enough to appease the people. 
 
**Rama:**
The first ceremony should have removed all doubt...But the people continued to suspect her. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...You trusted her, right? 
 
**Rama:**
I did. However, I still exiled her. I had no choice. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What the...
 
**Nightingale:**
Isn't that the same as suspecting her? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right! You're the worst! Simply the worst! 
 
**Mash:**
U-Um, both of you, calm down...He's injured. 
 
**Rama:**
...No, they're right. I truly am the worst. 
 
**Rama:**
Self-protection, embarrassment, fear...As one ages, various things intertwine, and tie you down. 
 
**Rama:**
This truth is evident from my being summoned as a youth. Back during this time, all I felt for Sita was love. 
 
**Rama:**
You could say that was my peak condition...Back when that was enough for me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Then you must endure, until you meet your love once again. If you truly love her, you must prove it. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If not, it would be the same as if you didn't love her. Some things must be said to truly be understood. 
 
**Rama:**
I understand that. Now, let's hurry. I'm still fine. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We should hurry, Master. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Right. At the very least, this lady Sita needs to give this man a good slap across the face. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
If it comes down to it, I could even lend her my microphone! 
 
**Rama:**
Haha, that sounds painful.... Hm? Master, there seems to be enemies about. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. I've detected enemies. They're Celt warriors, but their numbers are few. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. Let's go, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Now, let's hurry onwards. No stops until Alcatraz. 
 
## Section 11: The Rock 
 
**Mash:**
We've arrived. That island over there is Alcatraz Island. 
 
**Rama:**
It's unexpectedly close. But we still can't exactly swim there. 
 
**Mash:**
The chance of being noticed by enemy Servants&mdash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
The island's not that big...Anybody could notice us when we land. No use worrying about that. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
More importantly, I don't want to swim. Got that? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't swim? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sink like a rock? 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
That's not it! I've...never properly swam before, but I'm sure I'd be fine! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What I'm trying to say is,I don't want to swim in the ocean. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Seawater dries out my skin. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It might be fine for the Servants, but I'm sure it would be hard for our Master Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Currents are swift, and the water is cold. It's an extremely unfit place to swim. 
 
**Mash:**
We'll try searching for a boat that'll get us across. 
 
**Mash:**
...Maybe we should ask the old man over there.... Um, excuse me? 
 
**Old Man:**
Hm? 
 
**Mash:**
We're looking for a boat to cross over to that island&ndash;
 
**Old Man:**
...Forget it. There are demons living on that island now. 
 
**Mash:**
...Demons? 
 
**Old Man:**
That's right. I know because I'm originally from England. Those were “dragonkin. ”
 
**Mash:**
What!? 
 
**Old Man:**
If you really want to go, I can lend you my boat...But you'd better pay for it if you break it. 
 
**Mash:**
...There you have it. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Dragonkin, huh? That's not too bad, I'm a Dragonkin too. Well, a Demi at that. 
 
**Rama:**
Wait...You are!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Where did you think my tail and horns came from? 
 
**Rama:**
That's...I thought you were just into things like that...
 
**Elisabeth:**
When you've healed, Sita won't be the only one slapping you! 
 
**Mash:**
Th-That's enough. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Dragons waiting at our destination or not, this patient is at his limit. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We shouldn't be afraid of a fight. We need to go, there's no time to waste. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right, it'll be fine. We fought more than enough dragonkin in France, after all. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
There were wyverns everywhere we looked...As a fellow Demi-Dragon, it got old really fast. 
 
**Rama:**
I see. The journey to save the world sounds like quite the ordeal. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Anyway, Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Set sail! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go! 
 

---

 
**E：???:**
...Hm. One, two, three, four...But one of them seems weakened...Is that one injured? 
 
**E：???:**
So that really means three. Seriously? ONLY three? 
 
**E：???:**
I just hope there's enough for everyone to get their fill...
 
**E：???:**
Tch...Whatever. All right. Guys, you've got work. 
 
**E：???:**
You're not just here to live idly and eat humans. Go put yourselves to the test! 
 
**G：???:**
......
 
**G：???:**
&mdash;Lord Rama? 
 
**Mash:**
We're here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've already picked up several enemy wyvern responses. Also&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
A Servant is here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right. But the Servant doesn't seem to be moving. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The wyverns seem to be deployed to form a path to the enemy Servant. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Which means? 
 
**Rama:**
...We're likely being tested. He's saying, “I'm right here. Come at me...”
 
**Nightingale:**
And if we don't defeat that Servant, we likely won't be able to meet Sita. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Let's head straight there. Considering the patient's condition, we don't have a moment to lose. 
 
**Nightingale:**
No need to wait for permission to operate. Cutting straight through! 
 
**Mash:**
Uh, w-wait! ...Then again, I guess Nightingale isn't exactly the type of person to wait...
 
**Mash:**
Let's follow her. There's no mistake that her choice is the fastest option. No sense in overthinking. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right. It's good when things are easy to understand. Let's charge, full speed ahead! 
 
**Mash:**
Here they come. Wyverns and Celtic warriors! Master, please give me your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
Whew, piece of cake! Are you still doing okay? 
 
**Rama:**
...Yes, somewhat. Right now, I'm just worried whether I'll be able to meet Sita again or not. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh? We're busy fighting for our lives,and you're thinking about your wife? 
 
**Rama:**
I-I can't fight like this, I can't help it! I'd love to fight if I could! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
No, I meant the opposite. That's a good thing. I thought you were some playboy prince, but you're actually really nice. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Okay, I feel more motivated! Leave these weaklings to me. I'll make sure you see your wife again! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
But in exchange, you'd better apologize to her properly. Every girl wants to know that someone needs them. 
 
**Rama:**
Y-Yes...That's right. I just hope I have the chance to apologize...
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Nightingale:**
We must push forward and defeat them, for his treatment! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
...Ugh...
 
**Mash:**
Are you okay!? 
 
**Rama:**
Don't hurt yourself too much for me, Nightingale. I know of shame, and you mentioned something similar earlier. 
 
**Rama:**
I don't wish for you to be harmed. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Be quiet. For me, the second most hated thing in this world is an incurable illness. 
 
**Nightingale:**
What I hate most are patients who don't try to recover. 
 
**Rama:**
S-Shouldn't it be the opposite? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No. Incurable diseases will become curable someday. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Doctors and nurses like myself constantly work towards that goal, racking our minds and building knowledge. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We must cure illness, even if that means killing people. Disease must be killed, massacred, and exterminated. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;But to do that, a patient's willpower is imperative. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Curing a patient who has no will to recover is impossible, for any doctor. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Medical treatment can only begin when someone has the will to be healed. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I intend to cure you. I'll cure you so you can act openheartedly. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'll cure you so that you may whisper words of love to your wife. I'll cure you&mdash;so you can wield your sword and fight. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But for that, your body, your cells,must have the determination to recover. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If you lose willpower, muster it up again. Otherwise, I'll kill you myself. 
 
**Rama:**
...You know, you really are a Berserker! 
 
**Nightingale:**
You disapprove? 
 
**Rama:**
Not at all...I got it. I'll recover. I WILL recover. I have the desire to do so. 
 
**Rama:**
I refuse to die, not until my wish is fulfilled! 
 
**Nightingale:**
This is the final gate. Please hold out just a little longer. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
...A Servant! 
 
**E：???:**
Hey. Welcome to the Alcatraz Penitentiary. Are you here for imprisonment? An attack? Aiding a jailbreak? 
 
**E：???:**
Let me know what you want. I'll think about it after I kill you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
This patient's wife seems to be held here. She's necessary for his recovery, please release her. 
 
**E：???:**
What, you're here for a meeting? Seriously, you didn't come to fight? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Of course not. Why would a nurse want to fight? The only things that nurses fight are illness and injury. 
 
**E：???:**
You're absolutely correct. A nurse who takes lives would be out of their mind. 
 
**E：???:**
Hmm? That means you're actually not crazy? You're quite the respectable Servant! 
 
**Rama:**
I must agree with our enemy. 
 
**Rama:**
This nurse here is a contradictory woman,someone who's crazy yet isn't crazy either. 
 
**E：???:**
Oh? I thought you were just their luggage, but you can talk? I get it. You're that lady's husband. 
 
**E：???:**
Unfortunately for you,I have no intention of letting her go. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;So you are obstructing treatment of an injured man. Obstacles must be eliminated. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I wish for bloodshed. No, I thirst for it. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If it means saving a patient,I'll remove all obstacles down to their roots! 
 
**E：???:**
Heh...Hahahaha! How amusing! So Berserkers come in different varieties too! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ugh...This Servant doesn't make me feel well...I feel it in my horns! 
 
**E：???:**
I'm sure, young lady! After all, my True Name is Beowulf&ndash;the “Dragon Slayer. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The famed hero of the oldest English epic poem, Beowulf! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's a formidable enemy, so don't hold back. Everyone, fight him together! 
 
**Beowulf:**
Oh, we're starting with a group fight? I see you guys are going all out, I like that! 
 
**Mash:**
Wha...A dragonkin? It wasn't just wyverns? 
 
**Beowulf:**
I handpicked this one. A bit of a waste to use in skirmishes, but good enough as a test. 
 
**Beowulf:**
It's obvious that we're enemies,but there are still codes of conduct to follow. 
 
**Beowulf:**
I admire those who are strong, even enemies. Fear not death, but extravagance, and never forget honor. 
 
**Beowulf:**
That's the rule of our world. Well, it just means you need to fight, and prove yourself. 
 
**Beowulf:**
This world is filled with conflict, and this nation is being swallowed into the mud of war. 
 
**Beowulf:**
If you have a problem with that, come and fight. Prove that your life is worth living. Prove that you're warriors. 
 
**Beowulf:**
If you manage that, let's see...I'll at least remember your names! 
 
**Beowulf:**
What's going on? You don't feel pain, woman? Or, do you have a heart of iron? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Edison's mechanized soldier is more human than you. You're like steel in human clothes, Berserker! 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm often told that. I don't care at all. My body is simply a means to heal patients, after all. 
 
**Beowulf:**
You're like a puppet just doing what it was built for! Looks like I need to crush you completely to stop you! 
 
**Rama:**
...Wait. Nightingale, I have a request. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;You're a patient, please be quiet. 
 
**Rama:**
No, this is necessary for my treatment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...What is it? 
 
**Rama:**
Put me down. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I can't do that. 
 
**Rama:**
Put me down, for the sake of treatment. If you fall, who will treat me? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&mdash;Can you even fight? 
 
**Rama:**
Believe in me. A patient and doctor must first trust each other, right? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Just one correction. I'm a nurse, not a doctor. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Huh? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Hey, I want to fight that living iron puppet lady over there. 
 
**Beowulf:**
I have no interest in fighting a living corpse. Just go die in a corner or something. 
 
**Rama:**
...You're right. I'm just a living corpse. However...Listen to me. 
 
**Rama:**
I have quite the story for you. A sweet deal. You won't lose out. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Hm? You've come to a prison, and you got a sweet deal? You trying to bribe the jailer or something&mdash;
 
**Rama:**
&mdash;“Brahmastra! ”
 
**Beowulf:**
What!? 
 
**Beowulf:**
You've got a pretty face, but you pull a surprise attack like that? Damn, now that's interesting! 
 
**Rama:**
Shut up! Stand aside! For getting in the way of love, you could've got it much worse! 
 
**Rama:**
My wife is waiting for me! I'm not going to be picky about my methods! 
 
**Beowulf:**
Heh...Haha, of course! That's definitely my bad! 
 
**Beowulf:**
I tried acting like a big villain, but that was more like some petty underling! 
 
**Beowulf:**
All right, bring it on, frail boy! If you manage to beat me now, that's a victory for justice! 
 
**Beowulf:**
Put your life on the line for your woman, and die with honor! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Beowulf:**
&mdash;Tch, I can't even win against a man who's half-dead...I've lost, no matter how anyone looks at it. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Fine, I surrender. Do whatever you want. I'm not so tasteless as to stand in the way of your love. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Damn, bringing love affairs onto the battlefield...I'm weak against things like that. 
 
**Beowulf:**
To be honest, I wanted to wipe you guys out, or be completely wiped out myself...
 
**Beowulf:**
Oh, by the way, I didn't lay a finger on the prisoner. She's so dainty, I felt like she'd snap just by touching her. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That means...you're surrendering from battle? 
 
**Beowulf:**
That's right. We can talk somewhere else. Just get going, frail boy. Your dainty wife is waiting. 
 
**Rama:**
Yes...I'll do that! 
 
**F：???:**
......Lord Rama? 
 
**Rama:**
Is that you, Sita? I've come for you...I've...come...
 
**F：???:**
Lord Rama! 
 
**Mash:**
Rama, you shouldn't run in your condition...
 
**Rama:**
...Ah, damn it. My vision's all blurry. I can't see a thing. 
 
**Sita:**
I'm right here, Lord Rama. 
 
**Rama:**
Where...Sita...Where are you? 
 
**Rama:**
...I wanted to see you. I wanted to see you. I really, really wanted to see you again. 
 
**Rama:**
You being there for me was all I needed! 
 
**Mash:**
Rama! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;We must begin treatment at once. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm sorry, normally we wouldn't conduct medical procedures in such an unsanitary place. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But you're a Servant, so this is an exception. Feel free to hold his hand, no need for hesitation. 
 
**Sita:**
...What happened to Lord Rama? 
 
**Mash:**
I'll explain. You see&ndash;
 
**Sita:**
My, something like that happened? To think I could ever be of use to Lord Rama...
 
**Mash:**
...Um, so who exactly are you? 
 
**Sita:**
I am “Rama. ”
 
**Mash:**
What...What do you mean? 
 
**Sita:**
Are you familiar with the curse placed on Lord Rama? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If I recall...When he killed the monkey Vali with an ambush from behind, the monkey's wife cast a curse on him. 
 
**Sita:**
Yes. That curse keeps us apart, even as Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Sita:**
We can never meet again. 
 
**Sita:**
When participating in a Holy Grail War as Servants,either he or I get summoned as Rama. 
 
**Sita:**
We are never summoned simultaneously. Even in Holy Grail Wars, we are fated to never meet again. 
 
**Sita:**
...Even this unique situation is no different. When he awakens, I will most likely vanish. 
 
**Mash:**
That can't be...
 
**Sita:**
&ndash;But it's okay. I'm fine with that. While Lord Rama wasn't able to see me...
 
**Sita:**
I was able to be here, and hold his hand. That's...enough for me to be happy. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
&ndash;Are you really okay with that? What about a heartfelt apology? An oath of love, from the bottom of his soul? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You don't want something like that? This man betrayed you once before, right? 
 
**Sita:**
This man fought for 14 years, for my sake. 
 
**Sita:**
He faced Ravana, even though we had only lived together for a year. 
 
**Sita:**
He could have forgotten about me, and taken a new wife&ndash;but he never did, to the day he died. 
 
**Sita:**
That's enough. I know his love and passion well enough. That's why we will...continue yearning for each other. 
 
**Sita:**
Even if it's an impossible wish, we'll continue to believe that it'll come true one day. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...I see. It sounds like you had a short, but happy time together. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The mending is mostly complete,but “something” is nestled inside, interfering. 
 
**Mash:**
That's likely the curse of Gáe Bolg. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Even if he recovers from his wound, I doubt he will be able to fight...I am sorry to say. 
 
**Sita:**
In that case, I shall offer this body. 
 
**Nightingale:**
What!? 
 
**Sita:**
I'll dispel the curse with my body. I'll burden myself with the curse, then disappear. 
 
**Sita:**
Luckily, Rama and I are “one and the same. ” It should be simple to take the curse in his place. 
 
**Mash:**
P-Please wait! That defeats the purpose of us coming here! 
 
**Mash:**
Rama was able to come this far...because it was all for you! 
 
**Sita:**
...Yes. I'm saying, those feelings...are enough to fulfill me. 
 
**Sita:**
Also, from what you just told me, you need a strong warrior more than anything now. Isn't that right? 
 
**Sita:**
In that case, my husband...Lord Rama, is the most powerful warrior in this world. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Very well, I'll transplant the lesion to you. Are you sure this is okay? 
 
**Sita:**
Yes, please do so. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;I never married in my lifetime. However, I still understand your feelings of wanting to help another. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Though only a short while, it was an honor to speak with you. Farewell, Mrs. Sita. 
 
**Sita:**
Yes. 
 
**Sita:**
Lord Rama...Rama. I can take just a small portion of your burden. 
 
**Sita:**
...I can aid your fight, even if it's only for a little. But that's more than enough to make me happy. 
 
**Sita:**
I love you...I really, really do love you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Mr. Rama. Mr. Rama! Can you hear my voice? Should I fire a gun next to your ear? 
 
**Mash:**
Please don't do that...
 
**Rama:**
......
 
**Rama:**
......Ah, she is gone. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Yes, to cure you. 
 
**Rama:**
I see...I thought she might do that, considering how abnormal this Holy Grail War is. 
 
**Rama:**
So this is also destiny, I suppose. 
 
**Nightingale:**
She held your hand, and kissed you. She offered you her tears, and her love. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's why you're standing here, alive. 
 
**Rama:**
&ndash;Thank you, Nightingale. Those words alone give me salvation. 
 
**Nightingale:**
There's no need for a thank you. This is what gives my life meaning, after all. 
 
**Rama:**
Nightingale, Mash, Elisabeth, Dr. Roman...and Master. 
 
**Rama:**
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I, Rama, Saber class and king of Kosala...
 
**Rama:**
...hereby renew my oath. Fujimaru, I am your Servant. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready to fight? 
 

---

 
**Rama:**
...My body does not falter. I'm fully prepared for battle. 
 
**Rama:**
And...this time, I shall emerge victorious over Cú Chulainn. I swear it. I shall not be defeated again. 
 
**Mash:**
...This completes our team's mission. We should hurry to the East. 
 
**Nightingale:**
It's finally time to begin treating the root cause. Let's put our skills to the test. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, what exactly is the treatment? 
 
**Nightingale:**
We shall purge the Celtic warriors. Completely. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Wonderful. Truly the most exciting treatment. 
 
## Section 12: Sympathy for the Soldier 
 
**Geronimo:**
...How'd it go? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm done scouting. Geez. I'm really overusing “No Face May King. ”
 
**Nero Bride:**
We can't help it. If I went scouting, it would cause a huge uproar. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I guess that's true! But anyway...
 
**Robin Hood:**
It seems like they intend to hold a large-scale parade along this major street. 
 
**Billy:**
A parade? Why would they do that? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That I don't know. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Still, that's definitely what those Celts are preparing. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
A parade...How outrageous! No, enviable! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Isn't that the opposite!? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Archer. What a sad man...Have you never held a parade? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Why would I? I'm just a regular guy. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Parades are great...All the people shouting my name, the orderly troops marching along in perfect step. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
One wave of the hand, and I'm showered with “Wonderful! ” “Superb! ” “Hurray! ” “Lady Nero, sleep with me! ”
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu, now I want to hold a parade, too. 
 
**Geronimo:**
...I see. That sounds like an exciting time for anyone. Let's take out the target at the parade. 
 
**Billy:**
Target who, exactly? 
 
**Geronimo:**
The Servant with the highest honors held at the parade...Although it might not be a Servant. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Billy. At a parade, the person of highest influence must also stand out the most. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
That's the whole point of the event. But that also makes it a good opportunity for assassination. 
 
**Billy:**
Hmm, it's not easy being a show-off. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Robin, did you notice any Servants lurking about? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I sensed two. If there were any others, they weren't within my detection range. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
The two there are surrounded by Celtic warriors. 
 
**Geronimo:**
So most of the Servants are absent...
 
**Billy:**
But we don't know for sure. They could have just been outside of Robin's range. 
 
**Billy:**
There's always the possibility of an ambush. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm an Archer. My Servant detection range is pretty far, you know? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Then again, Servants can indeed close in from outside detection range in an instant...
 
**Billy:**
&ndash;What should we do, Geronimo? 
 
**Geronimo:**
...We have to do it. This is undoubtedly a golden opportunity. 
 
**Geronimo:**
We didn't have to fight on the way here at all. Meanwhile, Mash and company made a bold move out in the West. 
 
**Geronimo:**
I'm sure the enemy is already aware of our actions. 
 
**Geronimo:**
They might feel that something is up, but they surely don't think we have this many Servants lined up. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Yes. So what should we do? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Nero, what kind of Noble Phantasm do you have? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hm? My Noble Phantasm? My Noble Phantasm is&mdash;
 
**Geronimo:**
I see. Then we'll use that. There's no need to hold back on using Noble Phantasms. We'll end things here. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu! This is a great stage for our big moment! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Understood. Let's end this quickly, and make our escape. 
 
**Billy:**
Yeah, let's do our best! 
 
**Geronimo:**
&ndash;Then let's follow the plan. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'll use “No Face May King” to disappear and get close...Make way for the Faceless King! 
 
**Geronimo:**
That woman's standing above the Celtic warriors&ndash; I see, she's the queen! 
 
**Medb:**
Everyone! Thank you so much for coming here to see me, Medb! 
 
**Medb:**
This nation belongs to the Eternal King! 
 
**Medb:**
A nation of Cú and myself, made by Cú and myself, for Cú and myself! 
 
**Medb:**
Be honored that you serve us 24 hours a day. Rejoice that you are our subordinates 24 hours a day. 
 
**Medb:**
Justice, honor, and glory all belong to us! 
 
**Geronimo:**
&ndash;Robin! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Got it. Removing “No Face May King”!  Go, Saber! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Yes, leave it to me! 
 
**Medb:**
Hm? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Queen Medb! You may look cute, but your reign comes to an end now! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Sunlight of spring, dancing flowers! The winds of May that brush your cheeks! The blessed bells that ring all the way beyond stella! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Open, Nuptiae Domus Aurea! 
 
**Medb:**
Could this be...a Reality Marble!? No, this is different. This is Magecraft! Unwavering, unhesitant Magecraft! 
 
**Medb:**
It's so beautiful! I want this Noble Phantasm! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
This Noble Phantasm is beyond you, but we have a great banquet for you tonight! Brace yourself! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Queen of Connacht, Medb! Sorry, but we'll be taking your head! 
 
**Billy:**
&ndash;Here goes! 
 
**Medb:**
Oh my, so many! And because of this barrier, my warriors are weakened, too! 
 
**Medb:**
This is bad! I'm in big trouble! Big, big trouble! 
 
**Medb:**
Save me, my king! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Bring on your so-called king! 
 
**Geronimo:**
This is the moment of truth. Put some spirit into this! 
 
**Billy:**
Wait. I've got a bad feeling! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Haaaaah! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Ugh...He has this much strength inside my Golden Theater!? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
A bold plan, but a failure. You should have targeted me, not Medb. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Child of Light, Cú Chulainn! Still in that ominous form, I see. 
 
**Geronimo:**
It seems you're the holder of the Holy Grail! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Huh? I don't care about the Grail. I gave that thing to Medb. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Then what's this strength!? You're within Nero's Bounded Field! 
 
**Medb:**
I wished for it! 
 
**Geronimo:**
What!? 
 
**Medb:**
I wished for Cú to “become a king”! A strong and wicked king, who could stand equal to me! 
 
**Geronimo:**
&ndash;I see. If it's a wish upon the Grail, it's no wonder he can surpass this Bounded Field...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That doesn't matter. All I sought was this situation. I decided to reign supreme as “king,” and fight with all my might. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Oh? So you're a “king”? Let me ask you as an emperor. How do you intend to take the right of leadership? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll fight, kill, and conquer. That's all. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Is that really all? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm not the type to rule through wisdom. Besides, everyone living on this land is a warrior. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll take everything, kill everyone, and dominate everywhere...Then, when there's nothing left&ndash; I will return to the void. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What...In that case, you're no different from a mindless beast! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
And what's wrong with that? We were born into an era that's neither dream nor reality. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If everything's an illusion to begin with, we should all vanish without building anything, no? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
So you would deny prosperity...You are not fit to be a king! 
 
**Medb:**
Oh, but he is. 
 
**Medb:**
The qualification to be king is absolute strength. Enough to declare domination and create a nation alone. 
 
**Medb:**
That alone is enough for people to follow. Everything else can be handled by others. 
 
**Medb:**
I mean, mankind is enslaved by strength. The weak will cling to the strong as long as they get to pick up the leftover glory. 
 
**Medb:**
That's just the way of the world. Aren't you the same? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Hah. I like lions, but mad dogs aren't my cup of tea. When it comes down to it, you're just another dog, a bitch, who seduced a lion. 
 
**Medb:**
That's fine. I don't mind being a bitch. I don't mind at all. 
 
**Medb:**
I mean, I fell in love. What am I supposed to do? That's right...Ever since the day I failed to take Ulster! 
 
**Medb:**
A warrior who wouldn't become mine,a man who didn't heed to my will. 
 
**Medb:**
A great hero who protected his nation alone,who boasted to none, and ended his life with a smile! 
 
**Medb:**
As far as I know, Cú Chulainn is stronger than anyone or anything, and I've always loved him! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I see. Then watch as the man you love falls! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Here I go! 
 
**Geronimo:**
We're right behind you! 
 
**Billy:**
Got it! ...Wait, are you kidding me? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
A Servant...
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;To be perfectly honest, I thought Cú would be more than enough here. 
 
**Medb:**
But I figured I'd have one more as backup, just in case. I'm so smart! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Medb:**
Oh dear. Don't look at me like that, Cú. This doesn't mean that I don't trust you, okay? 
 
**Medb:**
But sometimes there's strength in numbers, you know? Like right now. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I'll handle that woman. Take care of the other weaklings. 
 
**Medb:**
Excited? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No. This is a matter of principle. If she calls herself an emperor, then it's my duty as a king to crush her. 
 
**Medb:**
Okay♪ Then go right ahead and handle the others, Arjuna! 
 
**Geronimo:**
Did she say...Arjuna!? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What!? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Arjuna, the eternal archenemy of Karna? 
 
**Geronimo:**
This is the worst...To think that they have something like that hidden up their sleeve! I underestimated them! 
 
**Arjuna:**
...I have no intention of making you suffer. Please let me finish my duty quickly. 
 
**Billy:**
What should we do, Geronimo? 
 
**Geronimo:**
&ndash;Robin! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
What!? 
 
**Geronimo:**
Take the communicator. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Use “No Face May King” and get out of here. We'll buy you some time. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
!!! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What are you doing, Archer!? Go! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Unfortunately, I can't leave this place. I cannot afford to leave! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
I need to teach this man a thing or two about how to conduct oneself as a king! 
 
**Nero Bride:**
&ndash;Listen well. You must live, and meet up with Fujimaru. We haven't been defeated yet. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Just go! Then return to this land with the song of victory! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...That's a tough order, but I got it. I'll be getting out of here first, Your Majesty. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Yes, that's more like it, Hunter of the Forest. I'm counting on you. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Now then&mdash; Sorry to keep you waiting, Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
So, thorny man. I think you're overdoing it a bit with that imposing look. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You're right, but give me a break. This is me holding it back as much as I can. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Got that, girl? If you intend to win,you've got to settle things before it bursts open. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now, why don't you show me how a king is supposed to act? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I have no intention of learning, though. Stuff like that isn't tasty. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Umu. It's not tasty, but it's meaningful. King of Beasts, I'll beat some humanity into you! 
 
**Mash:**
There seem to be some survivors left. We should eliminate them as soon as possible. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Right. Once we're done with this assassination,I need to have that singing match with Saber, after all. 
 
**Rama:**
I-I see...I hope that works out for you...
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Now, let's leave this island. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait! Enemy signals detected&ndash;Servants closing in! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
These are...the first enemy Servants you met! 
 
**Mash:**
The first enemy Servants...Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! 
 
**Fionn:**
Hey there, Lady Mash. Do you remember my promise from before? 
 
**Mash:**
...Oh, that...
 
**Fionn:**
Yes, I'm serious this time. That is, if you manage to survive your defeat! 
 
**Fionn:**
You'll be mine. In other words, I want you as my bride. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
A proposal? That was a marriage proposal just now! Mash, you're unexpectedly popular! 
 
**Mash:**
No. I already declined...Or rather, considering the situation, it's out of the question...
 
**Diarmuid:**
Now, don't say that. We've been moved by your tremendous courage, Lady Mash. 
 
**Fionn:**
Hm, Diarmuid can't stand women, and even he's interested! Hehehe, are you sweeping her off her feet right before my eyes again? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
I-I wouldn't do something like that...I'm not even thinking about it! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
I just, I simply admire Lady Mash for her unwavering courage, that's all...
 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha, I'm joking. I took it too far. Don't worry about it. 
 
**Fionn:**
I should be the one begging for forgiveness, after all. Yes, I really can't do anything about this personality of mine. 
 
**Fionn:**
However, that's enough. I'll stop joking around. I'll let go of all the grudges I had in life. That's because&mdash;
 
**Fionn:**
Young warrior, we are here to fight side by side. There is no greater joy than that on this earth. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
!!! Of course. That's most certain, my king! 
 
**Fionn:**
&ndash;We can make up for their numbers with our own. Beowulf, what say you? 
 
**Beowulf:**
...Huh? I don't feel like it. I'm going back east. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Besides, I didn't take on this job because I wanted to. 
 
**Fionn:**
I see. Do as you please. Very well...We'll fight this one by ourselves. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Here they come! A large army of Celtic warriors! 
 
**Fionn:**
Well, didn't you resurrect a mighty Servant who could stand up to this army? 
 
**Rama:**
...That's right! Master, there's no need to worry. 
 
**Rama:**
My Noble Phantasm is a divine blade, bestowed by Brahma. Sheer numbers are no match for me! 
 
**Rama:**
Not to mention, I am now one with Sita! 
 
**Rama:**
If you seek to defeat me, bring a million soldiers and their leader with ten heads and twenty arms to face me! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Rama:**
This is nothing!! Hahaha! I feel great today, I could face another 10,000 opponents! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Wow, you're doing really well there, prince. I won't lose either! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Get to work, ghosts of Csejte. Now, I'll charm you with this hit song of mine! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Diarmuid:**
Wait, wait, wait! You're a Servant, but you're also a nurse, right? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes, I'm a nurse. That's why I intend to kill you. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
That's some strange reasoning! Tch...That didn't work! 
 
**Nightingale:**
How is it strange? You're like patients, delirious with a fever. 
 
**Nightingale:**
If I don't cure it, you won't be saved! That's why I intend to save you, even if I have to kill you! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Mm...Your reasoning is absurd, but your beliefs are real. I take back what I said earlier. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Your attempts to save others are noble. But I still serve my king. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
As long as I am alive, I will die for his life! Bring it! 
 
**Nightingale:**
As long as you are alive...Is that so? Well then, allow me to relieve you of your royal duties! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We have you now,Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! 
 
**Fionn:**
Very well. It's finally time to settle this! Will we get married or not? Let's begin the fight! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
My King, please don't let your guard down on account of your bride's beauty. She is already a powerful foe. Please give up this talk of marriage. 
 
**Fionn:**
Hahahaha! A shame, but of course, Diarmuid! Did you think we could defeat them whilst holding back? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
No, not at all. 
 
**Fionn:**
Right? Heh heh, as long as we're Servants...we can't escape from this desire. 
 
**Fionn:**
To battle the strong. To carve away at life and soul. 
 
**Fionn:**
That's why the Holy Grail War continues! ...Thinking of it that way, our king is quite an exception. 
 
**Fionn:**
He's no doubt the most powerful warrior, so I can't believe he doesn't feel any joy! 
 
**Mash:**
...He feels no joy? 
 
**Fionn:**
Heh. Go meet him if you want to know more. Although he shows no mercy to his enemies! 
 
**Diarmuid:**
That's enough idle chat. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne&ndash;the first spear of the Knights of Fianna! Here I come! 
 
**Fionn:**
Yes, agreed! I am Fionn mac Cumhaill, captain of the Knights of Fianna! To battle! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Fionn:**
Ugh...
 
**Diarmuid:**
My king! ...Guh, I can't go on...
 
**Fionn:**
Haha...Well, it can't be helped. I fought plenty, I've had my fill. 
 
**Fionn:**
Diarmuid, I'm quite satisfied. But are you still not content? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
...Yes. I thought victory would be ours this time. 
 
**Fionn:**
&ndash;Well, to be honest. I didn't care if we won or lost this time. 
 
**Fionn:**
When I was alive, I became more and more tainted. 
 
**Fionn:**
The glimmer in my eyes wallowed within politics. The treasure, power, and duty I won tied me down more and more. 
 
**Fionn:**
It was painful. So painful, yet I couldn't let it go. 
 
**Fionn:**
&ndash;I fear that's why I envied you so much,as you were trying to die for your love. 
 
**Diarmuid:**
My king...You...
 
**Fionn:**
We fought together. In a pure yet avaricious pursuit of victory. 
 
**Fionn:**
I'm satisfied...Although to be honest, it's regrettable that I couldn't take Lady Mash as my own...
 
**Mash:**
...I'm very sorry. I can't accept your request. 
 
**Fionn:**
Yes, I've been rejected! Now I shall pass on...Without regretfully clinging onto this world. 
 
**Fionn:**
Would you accompany me, Diarmuid? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes, sir! 
 
**Fionn:**
As for you, Berserker. Do you not seek to heal your own wounds? 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's not necessary. I have neither the time nor the means to heal myself. 
 
**Nightingale:**
My heart is torn to pieces by the simple existence of patients, after all. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's why...If I was to be healed, it would be when there are no more patients in the world. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Until then, I will bear any wound as compensation. 
 
**Fionn:**
I see. You are broken, yet beautiful. Your conviction is like a dazzling jewel. 
 
**Fionn:**
Next time I'm summoned, I'd like to aid your cause. What do you think, making passes at my next bridal candidate? 
 
**Diarmuid:**
What is there to say? It's very like you to do so, my king. 
 
**Fionn:**
Yes, very well! It was worthwhile being summoned,if only because I was able to live youthfully until death! 
 
**Fionn:**
Farewell, defenders of order! Let us meet again, if fate allows! 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Confirmed elimination of Spirit Origins. 
 
**Mash:**
...Light and cheerful to the very end...Quite the pleasant pair. 
 
**Rama:**
But considering how they gathered such a large force here, the assassination by the others must have gone well...Right? 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;We've received a transmission. Huh? It's not Geronimo, but Robin Hood? 
 
**Mash:**
I'll switch to open transmission. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
&ndash;Sorry. We screwed up. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! Tell us what happened, Robin! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Old Man Geronimo, Billy, and Saber...Nero. They're probably all gone. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
&mdash;What? Hey, what are you talking about? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm heading to an abandoned Western United States base. Do you know the coordinates? I might need you to come right away. 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What happened? 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know. Doctor, do you know the location Robin specified? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-Yeah. Of course. Obtaining communicator coordinates&ndash;code received. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll send you the shortest route to the destination. Head over there right away. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...You're kidding. That was a lie, right? He was just joking with us, right? 
 
## Section 13: Over the Rainbow 
 
**Geronimo:**
Oh spirits that walk this earth. By the True Name of ■■■■■, lend me your power. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Unleashing Noble Phantasm&ndash; “Tsago Degi Naleya! ”
 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;Howl. “Agni Gandiva! ”
 
**Geronimo:**
My spirits, destroyed with a single blow. As expected from the strongest hero of India! 
 
**Geronimo:**
But I don't understand. You possess such power, yet why? 
 
**Arjuna:**
...I have my reasons. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Ugh...
 
**Billy:**
&ndash;Take this! 
 
**Arjuna:**
!!! 
 
**Billy:**
...You can even repel bullets!? 
 
**Arjuna:**
The fact that a modern weapon like that can harm me is praiseworthy enough. 
 
**Billy:**
Well, thank you...
 
**Geronimo:**
Mmph! 
 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;However, it won't reach me. I'm sorry, but I'll settle this now. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Ugh...
 
**Billy:**
Ah...Sorry...Geronimo...
 
**Billy:**
Dammit, I wish I had been a little more useful...
 
**Arjuna:**
...This is the end. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Arjuna...You're decent. You still have a sound mind...
 
**Geronimo:**
Why did you join them? 
 
**Medb:**
Hehehehehe! You can't answer them, can you Arjuna? 
 
**Geronimo:**
...Queen Medb. To think you'd serve Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Medb:**
Of course I would. I mean,Cú decided for himself to become king. 
 
**Medb:**
Not out of righteousness, or nobility, or even ambition. He just wanted to heighten himself. 
 
**Medb:**
The ones you sent to Alcatraz will be finished off by Beowulf, Fionn, and Diarmuid. 
 
**Medb:**
Well, even if they fail to, that's not a problem. Your defeat is already certain. 
 
**Medb:**
So long as we have the Holy Grail,this world will persistently continue to reincarnate. 
 
**Medb:**
All that's left is to destroy Edison's army. That's easy. 
 
**Geronimo:**
&ndash;Ah, I see. So you don't actually know yet. 
 
**Medb:**
...Don't know what? 
 
**Geronimo:**
It seems you think you're some sort of chosen one, who obtained absolute power&ndash;
 
**Geronimo:**
But actually, you're just one out of seven. 
 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed, the fact you obtained the Grail is proof of your greatness. 
 
**Geronimo:**
However, while it is rare, it is not the “only one. ”If anyone has the “only one,” it's us. 
 
**Geronimo:**
They have already recovered four Holy Grails. 
 
**Medb:**
!!! 
 
**Geronimo:**
That is why. Even if we fall here...others will take our place. 
 
**Medb:**
...I see. But none of you have a chance against our king. A Mad King and a War King, Cú stands at the pinnacle of power. 
 
**Geronimo:**
As a shaman, let me make a prediction for you. Be glad, you'll die happy. Unfortunately, it'll be real soon. 
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;Hmph. 
 
**Medb:**
Arjuna. Go and chase down the Servant who escaped. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Understood. 
 
**Medb:**
Now, Cú. Do you want me to help? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No, it'll be over soon. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
Ugh...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You can't maintain the Bounded Field anymore...This is the end. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...Yes. With so many parts of the theater destroyed, I have no choice but to yield. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
However, I'd like to ask one thing. Consider it a final tribute to the defeated. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;What? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
It's fine to hone your strength and become a king. Even if the rule you impose is tyrannical. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
However...How can you act without raising one eyebrow? 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...I'm not trying to cast doubt on your conscience. You're not enjoying this in the first place. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
You're neither a king rewarded by the smiles of your people, nor one striving for your dream. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
What exactly do you seek, then? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I seek nothing. I don't need rewards. I don't even hope for a place to rest at my destination. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
This is how I am. I merely charge forward until exhausted. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You could say, if anything,wherever my corpse lies is my destination. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...How absurd. You've decided to live as a king,yet you have no interest in gaining anything as a king. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
You are mistaken. Those contradict each other. The only path for you is to abandon one or the other, Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I see. But in reality, as you see here, I'm the victor and you're the vanquished. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now die, Emperor of Rome. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;It matters not if I'm torn to pieces. “Gáe Bolg! ”
 
**Nero Bride:**
Ugh...How disappointing...It seems my performance ends here&mdash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What a pleasant feeling. That pierced not just your heart, but also all your other organs too. 
 
**Nero Bride:**
...I'm sorry, Lancer. I wanted to...Sing together with you...
 
**Medb:**
I see it's over. Now, all that's left is that Servant named Robin. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You make it sound like there's a survivor. Press the attack and crush them. 
 
**Medb:**
Yup! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
!!! 
 
**Medb:**
Cú? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Over there. 
 
**Mash:**
This is the designated place.... Master! 
 
**Rama:**
Hm, Robin Hood's fighting. All right, let's head over quickly! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Sorry, I ended up running into them along the way! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
H-Hey! So what exactly happened out there!? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Well...Here's the gist of it...
 
**Robin Hood:**
...That's about it. 
 
**Mash:**
Geronimo, Billy, and even Nero...
 
**Elisabeth:**
...That idiot...We finally got to be summoned in the same era by some miracle...
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Sorry, I'll be over there for a while. 
 
**Rama:**
Sure...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Still, it's impressive that you managed to escape such a situation. Did you use some sort of trick? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I would never have managed to pull it off alone. There was a Servant who lent me a hand. 
 
**Mash:**
A hand? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Tch...So persistent! 
 
**Arjuna:**
That goes for us both. I'm sorry, but I must shoot you down. 
 
**Arjuna:**
Your bow isn't graceful enough. As a fellow Archer, allow me to teach you a few things. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ugh! 
 
**Arjuna:**
Hm!? 
 
**D：???:**
&ndash;Weak, so weak. 
 
**D：???:**
You're well-trained, but you don't put any heart into your attacks. You're like a child throwing sticks. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Who are you? I pride myself in putting my full might behind that attack. 
 
**D：???:**
I have no obligation to answer. Just remember me as a god-slayer who happened to pass by. 
 
**D：???:**
I've decided to allow that boy to escape with his life. Now withdraw, youngster who was merely adored by gods. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Being told that doesn't compel me to withdraw. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;No, stand down, Arjuna. That woman is too much even for you to handle. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm telling you, you're in the way. If you're around, you're just going to get hurt. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Or what? Are you trying to hold me back? Does that mean you're a traitor, too? 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Understood. 
 
**D：???:**
Good, good. Listening to others is a good thing. A good child, unlike you, Sétanta. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Quit calling me by my childhood name. What a headache. To think even you were summoned here. 
 
**D：???:**
 
Those are my lines, fool. That's not how you speak to your mentor. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But I've always been like this.... So? Are you my enemy? 
 
**D：???:**
Why yes. You know how it goes...
 
**D：???:**
If you see a rabid dog in your favorite flower garden, you wouldn't just sit around reading, would you? 
 
**D：???:**
I can't bear to see the fool you've become. Though a fool, you're still my student. I should behead you out of mercy. 
 
**D：???:**
Now, answer me, Cú Chulainn. What has possessed you? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
......
 
**D：???:**
No need to answer, huh? 
 
**D：???:**
In that case, the only thing left for us to do is fight to the death...However, it seems the circumstances won't allow us to. 
 
**D：???:**
I must allow that pale...boy in green to escape. You have that burden named Medb behind you. 
 
**D：???:**
If we fight, things won't end well for either of them. So what'll it be, O king who gained a queen? 
 
**D：???:**
Lose everything here, and promptly lighten your burden? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You must be joking. Knowing you, you'd take Medb out the second we start this fight. 
 
**D：???:**
Of course. I can't stand that woman. So I might just impale her with the best thrust of my life. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We won't fight here. I'll let that Archer go. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now you will get out of my sight, too. Come back again when everyone has died off, so no one can stand in our way. 
 
**D：???:**
Very well, that would be my duty anyway. When you no longer have a way to die, I'll kill you with a smile. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...A shield rune to escape from the battlefield, huh? 
 
**Medb:**
Not going after them? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
She's not someone who'd go down so easily. She can handle even a thousand spears I throw her way. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I can't win unless I'm ready to die. When I fight her again, it will be when there's no one left to kill. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Robin, the woman who you said saved you...If she's Cú Chulainn's mentor, then she...
 
**???:**
I'm right here. Is this some sort of far-seeing spell? I can't say it's in good taste. Poor disposition, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
N-Nice to meet you, too...
 
**???:**
I should introduce myself. My name is Scáthach. Although I'm sure some of you already realized that. 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach! Mentor of Cú Chulainn, and guardian of the Land of Shadows! 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;Yes, that's right. Oh, needless to say, I'm different from the other Celtic Servants. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Perhaps it's because I am a special being beyond human, that Grail cannot rule over me. 
 
**Scáthach:**
The reason I materialized as a Heroic Spirit is a special one, too. All of humanity was incinerated, as was my realm. 
 
**Scáthach:**
And so, being “dead,” I was summoned here. In a proper version of history, I wouldn't even be able to talk to the living. 
 
**Scáthach:**
From that perspective, I'm glad about the current incident in a way, but...No, there's nothing to be glad about. 
 
**Scáthach:**
My student was already foolish enough, but now I see him in an even more unsightly, idiotic form. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I came here to put a collar on him and take him back, but it seems there's something on his mind as well. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I considered putting an end to everything, including this era, but then I saw you. 
 
**Scáthach:**
This war isn't something that Heroic Spirits should settle. It must be solved by human hands. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That Archer, a part of the cause, was in a dilemma. I couldn't bear not to lend aid. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you. 
 

---

 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, you seem rather ordinary, but...There is strength in your eyes. A good Master, isn't that right, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, thank you very much. I'm proud of my Master. 
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, Scáthach. Would you fight alongside us? 
 
**Scáthach:**
That'd be difficult. I can lend a hand, but I can't join you. 
 
**Scáthach:**
As I said before, I don't have the means of repairing this era. All I can do is kill. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Also...I doubt I could win against THAT Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What!? You're Cú Chulainn's mentor. And even you can't win...
 
**Scáthach:**
I'm shocked myself. Nothing can be more irritating. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That is the Cú Chulainn I know,and at the same time he isn't. 
 
**Scáthach:**
It's likely because of Medb's wish upon the Grail. She wanted the fool to become a wicked king rivaling herself. 
 
**Scáthach:**
As a result, a cursed warrior with nothing but the power to become a king was born. 
 
**Scáthach:**
A Fanged God, or a Mad King, covered from head to toe in spines of death. That is the current Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Pitiful. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Most pitiful. That thing is painful. The fool felt even one thorn unmanageable, so he must be out of his mind with a thousand. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But by paying such a price, he has surpassed me. They say an idiot without hesitation is strong, yes? 
 
**Nightingale:**
That isn't strength. It's simply confining one's life inside a cage. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's called failure. Dreams that don't reach outside are nothing but delusions. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Indeed. Either way, this isn't just a matter of defeating Cú Chulainn alone. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Considering overall damage, Queen Medb has priority. The Holy Grail must be taken from that woman. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, don't expect much from me. I'd destroy the Holy Grail along with Medb, but that puts you back at square one. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're right...If the Grail is destroyed, repairing the Foundation of Humanity would be difficult. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That would be a huge time loss for us. If possible, we need to recover the Grail intact. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's consider Lady Scáthach to be our last resort. I want you guys to try defeating Medb by yourselves. 
 
**Mash:**
Medb...The legendary queen of the Celts. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes. She's a woman who is honest about her own desires. She's just engrossed in taking over a nation at the moment. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That woman, along with Cú Chulainn...Those two alone are enough to take any nation. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yet they also have Arjuna. And...I suppose Beowulf is still alive as well. 
 
**Scáthach:**
He's rather capricious, so we have no idea what he would do. But it's certain that he would side with the enemy. 
 
**Mash:**
???Doesn't it seem a bit noisy around us? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Hey! They're coming to attack us. What should we do? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Intercept them. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hold our ground. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
...Yes. I'm super angry right now. I'll strangle them all myself! 
 
**Mash:**
W-We should go, too. We must retain this camp as the front line for the West! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Wyverns, huh...They'll be difficult for those machines to handle. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Fujimaru, come with me. I'd like to see your talents. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I don't see any Servants with them. Overcome this situation first. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll try. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Got it. 
 

---

 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, good answer. Now on your way! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Not bad, but how about the next ones? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Wyverns and Chimeras? Curse you, Medb, summoning things like this. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Land and air. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Servants must understand their own roles and the Master must provide appropriate commands to kill those off. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Trouble won't be tolerated. Now go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Next are high ranking warriors among the Celts. Although they've given up their humanity. 
 
**Scáthach:**
They're as swift and strong as Servants. But if you have trouble here, you'll never reach Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Know your Servants, and use them well. Don't disappoint me, understand? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Hm...Shadow Servants have appeared. That Medb seems to understand how to use the Holy Grail. 
 
**Scáthach:**
These are wraiths that couldn't become Servants. They are one step shy of becoming heroes. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Or they are Heroic Spirits that became shadows due to the summoners' lack of ability, improper summoning circles, etc. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Thus, you could say they're beings closest to Servants. Make sure to defeat them. Humans stand no chance against them. 
 
**Mash:**
...What? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Hm? 
 
**C：???:**
&mdash;Haaah! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Wh-What's that!? The black things are disappearing one after another! 
 
**Rama:**
...A Servant. However, not a Celtic one. He seems to be from near my country...Chinese perhaps? 
 
**Mash:**
He doesn't look like an enemy. But...is he...an ally? 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;Regardless, his technique is quite impressive. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Abilities like that are impossible without both innate talent and hellish training to forge one's body. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Excellent. Most excellent. It makes me itch for a good fight. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You there! What is your name!? 
 
**C：???:**
Lancer, Li Shuwen! Well met, Servant of twin spears! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
A storm has been raging within me ever since I caught sight of you. It will not subside until I defeat you. Accept my challenge! 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;Oh? You challenge me? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Naturally. I know the reason why I was summoned. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Still...I can't help it. I'm filled with selfishness, after all. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I must try and see if my spear can reach the gods. 
 
**Rama:**
This man is like a famished tiger, or a starving wolf...
 
**Scáthach:**
...What a great potential playthi&ndash; Ahem...I mean, talent worth training. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Lancer, Li Shuwen. If this was the Land of Shadows, I'd train you right away. 
 
**Scáthach:**
However, I belong to Fujimaru's cause already. Thus, things must be done in order. 
 
**Scáthach:**
First fight Mash, and win. If you do, I, Scáthach, shall face you directly. 
 
**Scáthach:**
However, if defeated, you must be gone immediately. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...I see, I understand. Very well, Mash. I hereby challenge you to a duel. 
 
**Mash:**
But...I don't have any reason to fight. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I am confronting you. Is that not reason enough? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
If that's still insufficient, then consider me as a Servant sided with the Celts. 
 
**Mash:**
Master...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We have to fight. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's an enemy. 
 

---

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Yes, I see your Master has good judgment. That's right, I am your enemy. That should be beyond a doubt. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
If you don't treat me as such&ndash;you'll die. 
 
**Mash:**
I understand...Master! Please provide your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
H-He is...really strong! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
No, that's my line. To think you'd stand so well against me...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
If we were to fight seriously, to the death,I have no idea which way the scales would tip...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Scáthach, I'd like to rescind my previous request. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, is that okay? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
All of you perhaps stand a chance against those Celts. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I may be a scoundrel detached from society, but even I don't enjoy watching the world fall to ruin. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
You who's not human...Protect this world with that shield of yours. 
 
**Mash:**
...I will. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Now then, Scáthach. I have a request. Regardless of whether this world is saved or not&ndash;
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Would you face me at the end? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Very well. That is, if I survive until the time comes. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
You don't seem like one who would die so easily.... Oh right, I have one more thing to tell you. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
This is simply my inference, but it seems the King of Inventions is possessed by something. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Perhaps a good whack in the head will wake him up from his endless dream. 
 
**Mash:**
Um...Li Shuwen? Would you care to fight alongside us&mdash;
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I'm sorry. I can't say with confidence that I wouldn't attack you if I continued to be around you. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
If I was in my older body, I may have withered and settled down a bit. But I can't help it, as I was summoned in my physical prime. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Why, fate allowing, we may yet fight alongside each other. Farewell. 
 
**Mash:**
And he's gone. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As expected of Li Shuwen in his prime. So rough, he's like a knife that cuts you just by touching it...
 
**Nightingale:**
...Master, if I may, I believe I should go and see the patient. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What patient? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who's that? 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Edison, King of Inventions. 
 
**Nightingale:**
According to what that Servant said,he is supposedly possessed by something. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I agree with his opinion. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Even considering my knowledge as a Servant, that being is too foreign in nature to say he's Edison, King of Inventions. 
 
**Nightingale:**
In that case, it must be an illness. We should meet with him again. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Things are starting to sound crazy again...He captured you before, yet you want to meet him again? 
 
**Rama:**
I believe so, too. However&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
What are you saying? There are many infected areas. In situations like this, triage is important. 
 
**Mash:**
Master, what should we do? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go see Edison. 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Right. I think that's the correct thing to do, too. 
 
**Mash:**
I guess it's my intuition as a Servant...I feel like we can't leave him like this. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Then we should go. Immediately. We'll head straight there. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Charge via the shortest route. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We need to knock that hard-headed man out with some anesthesia, then wake him up. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hm...Robin, Elisabeth, Rama. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You've heard your Master's opinion. What do you think? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Well, to be honest, my head hurts so much I'd like some anesthesia myself...
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll leave the decision to Fujimaru. Everything until now has been right, so I'm sure it'll be fine going forward. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hmm...I'm a Servant who's better off acting alone. And besides, that...presi-king, was it? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Why would I take the effort to meet someone I know I'd be incompatible with just by how you describe him? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Are you saying you'll just casually go and assassinate Cú Chulainn for us? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I don't do crazy things like that. As long as there are other means, at least. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
If you can't do it, just say so. You just can't honestly admit things, can you? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...To think you of all people would tell me that. I should probably just shut my mouth and go along with it. 
 
**Rama:**
I have faith in our Master. If we all stand together, we can even defeat Karna if needed. 
 
**Rama:**
Now, Master. Let's go and wake Edison from his dream! 
 
## Section 14: The Running Man 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Master. Celts are attacking the town. We should eliminate them. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ah, wait a second. Master, sorry for the trouble, but do you think we could capture them alive? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If we tried to. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm good at things like that. 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? Why do you ask? Do you torture people too? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
No way! An interrogation, if anything! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
If we want to get to Edison's stronghold nonstop, we'll need prisoners like them. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Prisoners? Why? There's no use for them other than relieving my headache. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Geez. You've gotten a little more decent, but you're still the same at the root. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh well, whatever. Anyway, just hold back a bit, that's all I'm asking. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I don't really get it, but okay! Now, let's go, my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Whew. We made it through the battle just fine. We also captured some retreating enemies. 
 
**Mash:**
Robin, what should we do from here? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
All right, tie them up...There. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Now's the time for me to get to work. You all go elsewhere and eat a meal or something. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Halt right there. Identify yourself. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Industry and domination! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Robin!? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's that!? 
 

---

 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Industry and domination! Presi-king Edison is the greatest CEO! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
The greatest CEO! By the way, I'm Second Lieutenant Anderson Komadori of the 26th Commando Unit! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I have juicy news! We've captured some enemy soldiers, and they're to be transferred to headquarters! 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
&ndash;Understood and confirmed. They do appear to match our data on Celtic soldiers. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Excellent work out there. Please continue through. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Industry and...
 
**Robin Hood:**
Domination! I'll continue with my duties now. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
All right then. All of you, follow me. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Uh, Robin? What was that greeting just now? Are you into stuff like that? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I didn't wanna do it, either! That's the salute among mechanized troops! I had no choice! 
 
**Mash:**
Domination...Is Mr. Edison, well, perhaps a bad guy? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No. He's a little problematic, but he's probably got a different grasp of the word “domination. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Citizens coming together as one to overcome hardship. Perhaps he thinks of that as “domination. ”
 
**Scáthach:**
It wasn't domination for one's own vanity, but a call to action done for the sake of this nation. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Interesting. I heard he was an inventor, but it seems he had political potential as well. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Still, those soldiers were unsatisfactory. They weren't trained at all. That's beyond foolish! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Yeah. By simplifying the thought process, he's trying to improve their reflexes. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
By losing individual instinct and senses, they become tools of automation, completing a single task in large numbers...
 
**Nightingale:**
...Also, it's conceivable they're administering drugs for suppressing fear and doubt. It happens often, but I worry about the aftereffects. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Edison doesn't have the time to raise soldiers, or should I say warriors. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why he came up with a way for anyone to easily become a soldier. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a doctrine of mass production and united thoughts...The exact opposite of the Celts. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That said, their opponents are heroes of legend. If this was a modern war, Edison would likely win, but...
 
**Scáthach:**
Hm...The Celts are disregarding their rear from the get-go anyway. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...In fact, it's not like the Celtic warriors are using much in the way of intelligence...
 
**Scáthach:**
Generally, they're muscleheads. Muscleheads versus machines...Yes, they're brilliantly equal in disposition. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Suppressing fear with drugs, huh...Sounds like this side isn't very decent, either. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I shouldn't have hesitated about this. Let's go straight to our target. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Let's take down this self-proclaimed king ASAP! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Whaaaat!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Don't misunderstand. We're not going to take him down, we're going to treat him. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Although, I can't deny that the treatment procedure may be violent, even quite painful&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
But in the end, that's still treatment. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I got it, just don't shoot a gun near my ear again! 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'll take it into consideration. Anyway, we should head to Edison's stronghold&ndash;but first...
 
**Nightingale:**
It's gradual, but Edison's side is being overwhelmed. We should proceed after treating some Celtic warriors. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That enemy looks like a Bicorn. It's an evil, monstrous horse. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That queen sure does summon some ridiculous stuff! 
 
## Section 15: The King in the High Castle 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
&ndash;Halt. Beyond here is state-owned land. 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Retreat immediately, and submit an enlistment form to the United Western States Army Mechanized Infantry Corps. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Tch, they're bloodthirsty. Is this what you'd call a dystopia? Makes me nauseous. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hmm, I rather like it. It's a good thing when peasants follow the rules. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, yeah. I've always been part of the resistance, anyway. But it looks like we can't fool our way through any further. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Master, we need to break in! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Charge! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A rebellion! 
 

---

 
**Robin Hood:**
Whoa, as I'd expect, Master! I see you're enthusiastic. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
Begone! There are patients waiting! 
 
**Rama:**
Yes, such encouraging words...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If she wasn't kicking opponents around while saying that, it would sound even better! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hm? What's this, a burst transmission? Huh? What? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-Wh-Whaaaat!? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor!? Doctor, please respond...Doctor! 
 
**Edison:**
Why you...How could you give in to the Celts! And you call yourselves heroes!? 
 
**Edison:**
Above all, my Madonna, my Crimean Angel...To think someone with your ideals wouldn't share my own! 
 
**Edison:**
This is a huge disappointment! I haven't been this sad since the unemployment rate hit 30%! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Disappointment? No, there is still hope. We haven't betrayed you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Furthermore, us joining the Celts...That's a joke gone too far. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You fought your way into here, yet you say that? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
According to intel, your assassination of Medb failed. It's rather unnatural that you're still alive. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You must have begged for your lives, and joined the enemy. Isn't that the normal way to see it, Florence? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What did you say? Begged for their lives, and joined the enemy? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
You've got to be joking! She'd never be up for something like that! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Sorry, I must have stepped on a dragon's tail. If I hurt your feelings...No, that was rude of me. Sorry. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
It looks like they're merely losers. I don't see any signs that they've joined the Celts. 
 
**Edison:**
What? So they were simply defeated? Then did they come here to ask for our protection? 
 
**Edison:**
I can feel that lust for blood! Oh Angel of Crimea, why do you point your gun at me!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...An angel, you say? True, I was called that before. 
 
**Nightingale:**
There's nothing more painful than being compared to a creature as gentle as cotton candy. 
 
**Nightingale:**
King of Inventions, Edison. After seeing you like this, I understand. 
 
**Edison:**
Hm, what is it? Have you finally realized my greatness and my intelligence? 
 
**Nightingale:**
You're ill. You must receive treatment immediately. 
 
**Edison:**
What...was that? 
 
**G：Blavatsky:**
Ahh...You've said it right to his face...
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;How rude. What part of me is ill? 
 
**Edison:**
These strong limbs. This sound body, bursting with health. This sharp and honed intellect. 
 
**Edison:**
Everywhere you look, it's so standard! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Be quiet. What's so rude about telling a patient that they're ill? 
 
**Nightingale:**
If you want to be pampered, go ask your mother or wife. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You have the power to save the world, yet you're trying to bring the world to ruin. 
 
**Nightingale:**
How is that anything but an illness? 
 
**Edison:**
You're wrong! I'm&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
I'll attend to you right now. Just keep quiet, and rest in bed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What!? Huh? I-I finally got through the hacking. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Th-That's good. I couldn't communicate with you for a while...What happened? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Edison interrupted us. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-I'd expect no less from Edison. To think he could cut into our communications after just that one peek last time...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Your security's rather weak. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, we've been really careful about security, you know!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's just, well...Uh...This is Edison we're talking about, so it wasn't much use...Hahaha. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
So shooting a gun stops hacking? I'll remember that, Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Forget it. 

---

 
**Mash:**
O-Okay, I'll forget it.... So that's no good? 
 
**Nightingale:**
We don't have time for idle chat. &ndash;Now, we must break through. 
 
**Karna:**
&ndash;So you've come. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Of course, Karna. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You're also ill. Withdraw at once, you shouldn't be here. 
 
**Nightingale:**
There's something you desire, after all. I recommend recuperation in a remote place. 
 
**Karna:**
...You might be correct. I'm infected by an illness called loyalty. 
 
**Karna:**
Instantly realizing what I desire...Is that due to your occupation as a nurse? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, you're simply easy to understand. 
 
**Karna:**
......I see. 
 
**Mash:**
Um, Karna seems somewhat depressed. 
 
**Karna:**
&ndash;Thank you for pointing that out. However, I cannot surrender this path to you. 
 
**Karna:**
The King of Inventions asked for my aid, after all. He kneeled before a worthless man like me. 
 
**Karna:**
He was the first to ask. That's more than enough reason to oppose you. 
 
**Karna:**
...Also, one more thing. Edison resembles a friend of mine. 
 
**Karna:**
A man clever, yet foolish. Proud, yet full of charity. 
 
**Karna:**
There was once a king who called me friend. A king who saved me. 
 
**Karna:**
Edison resembles that amiable man well. To put it simply, I cannot leave him be. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&mdash;How surprising. To think someone like you could smile like that. 
 
**Karna:**
Even I'm human. I have emotions, like any ordinary person. However, that's enough talk. 
 
**Karna:**
The first time was testing the waters. This is the second. Show me just how much you have improved&mdash;! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hah...Hah...Hah...Y-You're good! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Stand back. You're at your limit. Umm...Redhorn? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Oh shut up! Some things I just can't give up as a fellow Lancer! 
 
**Karna:**
Lancer!? Weren't you an idol? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'm taking a break from my idol activities. Right now, I don't have a choice, so I'm holding this spear! 
 
**Karna:**
...Mm. Return? What an odd order. 
 
**Karna:**
But&mdash;I see, He wants to decide with his own hands. That's rather arrogant, but perhaps it cannot be helped. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What? Are you running away!? With the win!? 
 
**Karna:**
I don't think I've won yet...
 
**Karna:**
I have orders from my lord to return to the throne. I'll be waiting for you, up ahead in the throne room. 
 
**Karna:**
Along with this nation's finest...All three of us. 
 
**Mash:**
This nation's finest...That means...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Servants. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Edison and company. 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seems about right. Earlier we were speaking over the comms, but I imagine Edison wants to speak in person. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Regardless, it looks like we can't avoid battle before talking to him. 
 
**Mash:**
...True. I don't think Edison will come around unless he is knocked down once. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's get things ready first, Master. Then we'll head out. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
Now&ndash;entering! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go! 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes! 
 
**Edison:**
How dare you come here! You reprehensible traitors! 
 
**Edison:**
Why can you not believe in my righteousness? Are you drowning in conspiracy theories? 
 
**Edison:**
Like “Edison was the embodiment of capitalism itself! ”and “True geniuses do not idolize business! ”
 
**Nightingale:**
Mr. Edison. I believe you're the one easily swayed by conspiracy theories. 
 
**Nightingale:**
While I have not sensed a sliver of intelligence from you, I do know that your inventions are indeed amazing. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Which is why I have diagnosed that you are ill based on something other than such rumors. 
 
**Edison:**
Argh! I have no idea what kind of nonsense that is! Nightingale, pioneer of statistics! 
 
**Edison:**
Why did you materialize as a Berserker? I have no intention of speaking to an unintelligent beast! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Well, aren't you a beast yourself? I mean, you're a lion...
 
**Nightingale:**
...Sigh. Your fever is indeed getting to you. What a waste of intelligence. 
 
**Edison:**
Mmm!? Lady Nightingale, what did you just call me!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Pardon me. Slip of the tongue. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Master. Please prepare to operate. First, we need to have him rest on the bed, and make him hear what we have to say. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You're rather aggressive, Florence. Are you implying you're going to fight him and win? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes, I doubt he'll listen to us any other way. So we'll fight, we'll punch, and we'll win. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I like stuff like that. Very straightforward. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
I don't like fighting...Nor am I good at it. But I suppose I can set aside those feelings for now. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Mr. Edison, are you ready? 
 
**Edison:**
Y-Yes!? Yes, I'm ready. I'll engage them with all the electricity available! 
 
**Edison:**
Then they will truly know...How amazing inventions from this King of Inventions are&ndash;! 
 
**Edison:**
Direct current is just the way to go! 
 
**Mash:**
...So you still ARE fixated about that! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Edison:**
Ooooooooh! Not yet...I have not lost yet! I will not surrender! 
 
**Edison:**
If I do not suffice as a soldier, then I shall give up this body of mine to science! 
 
**Edison:**
Time for Thomas' great transformation, the big remodeling! I shall cast away this humanoid gentleman's form! 
 
**Edison:**
Now it's time for a beastly boost! I'll transform into Thomas Mazda Edison&mdash;
 
**Edison:**
Gah!? Wh-What was that for, Karna? How dare you throw my superhuman elixir on the floor!? 
 
**Karna:**
Sorry, Edison. But this ends here...I cannot let you walk the path of destruction any further. 
 
**Karna:**
Besides, first and foremost,that medicine is bad for your body. 
 
**Edison:**
No! Good medicine is always bitter to the taste. I can withstand my heart exploding! I'll show you! 
 
**Edison:**
If I don't hold my ground here,who is going to protect this nation!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Protect, you say? For someone trying to protect, you have a rather illogical method of fighting. 
 
**Edison:**
What...D-Did you just call me...illogical? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes. Extremely illogical. 
 
**Edison:**
I am always logical! Both this nation and I are children of logic. 
 
**Edison:**
It can't possibly be illogical&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
...We can't win. 
 
**Edison:**
...What? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Those Celts are monsters who spend all their time fighting, from birth to death. 
 
**Nightingale:**
People of this era are already falling behind, right at the starting line. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Moreover, the revered Queen Medb possesses the Holy Grail, allowing her to create soldiers infinitely. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's why we can't win. There's simply no way to win. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The Holy Grail is the only resource they need to reinforce their army. The idea of strength in numbers was a mistake to begin with. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But you didn't let up your ground. Rather, you didn't want to give up that system. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Because&mdash;
 
**Nightingale:**
Mass production. Cheaper, more efficient production. That was what you, Thomas Edison, were ingenious at. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But those aesthetics strip you of the intelligence you originally had. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You thought, “I cannot lose on my home turf. ”And subconsciously, you got worked up over it. 
 
**Nightingale:**
And because you kept grumbling like that,you were corrupted by such an illness. 
 
**Edison:**
Erm...W-Well, but...But...Why...I cannot deny that...
 
**Edison:**
True, I was fixated on productivity. Even if we run out of resources, as long as we obtain victory at the end...
 
**Nightingale:**
Indeed. There's no point winning in just the field of productivity. BUT! MOST! OF! ALL! 
 
**Nightingale:**
The biggest mistake is your body itself! 
 
**Nightingale:**
There are no records that indicate Edison had the head of a lion. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Furthermore, it is impossible for you to have such strength. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That means you possess power that doesn't belong to you. That is the dream pushing you to become “king. ”
 
**Mash:**
Um...isn't that the Holy Grail? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No. It is not the Holy Grail. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The Holy Grail can only grant wishes. It does not manifest them. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Edison. Your own desire did not stem from yourself. 
 
**Edison:**
...That's right. My name is Thomas Alva Edison. 
 
**Edison:**
I am the Presi-king of the United States of America. Past, present, and future...
 
**Edison:**
The successive presidents of this nation granted me power. Because it was logical. 
 
**Edison:**
They came to the conclusion that even if they were all summoned as Servants, they would lose to the Celts. 
 
**Edison:**
So, why not concentrate all the power into a single person. Not a president, but a hero with international fame. 
 
**Edison:**
...They entrusted me with the future known as “America! ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The presidents...from the first to the last. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Or rather, the thoughts of those who took up the mantle of president, or what you could call their grudges, had possessed him? 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is the illness. For us, it's not just about America. 
 
**Nightingale:**
We must heal, we must save this world. That is our Order. 
 
**Nightingale:**
E pluribus unum. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You are a state made up of many races, equivalent to being children of many nations. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Which is why you have an obligation to save the world. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yet you divert your eyes and try to save only your own nation&ndash;that is why Edison suffers. 
 
**Edison:**
Hrng...Guh...
 
**Nightingale:**
That is also why&ndash;you were defeated by Nikola Tesla, your fellow inventor. 
 
**Edison:**
Gaohoooooooooooooo!? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
(She landed the heaviest blow&mdash;! )
 
**Karna:**
(...I wish you pulled your punches...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-Is he okay? Mr. Edison, are you alive? 
 
**Edison:**
GAFU...GAFUUU! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, he has a pulse, but barely. He's on the ground, but he is still twitching, so...
 
**Nightingale:**
He will live. Edison, answer me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
What is it you want to do? 
 
**Edison:**
Urgh...Mm...
 
**Edison:**
...Yes. I admit it, Florence Nightingale. 
 
**Edison:**
The successive kings granted me power, but logically that also pointed to the fact that I couldn't win...
 
**Edison:**
I have strayed from my path just a little...It seems I was wandering in a maze of foolish thoughts. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Just a little...Just a little bit, was it...Very well. 
 
**Nightingale:**
To heal an illness, one must first admit that he is ill. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Being lost is fine. Because right now, you have returned to the starting point. 
 
**Edison:**
I see...Despite all the sacrifices the citizens have made...I am now only at the starting line...
 
**Edison:**
This is rough...This is actually rough. What am I supposed to do now...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Huh? You mean you don't know, Edison? 
 
**Edison:**
Blavatsky...Are you suggesting you do? What I should be doing? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Simple. Do what you would always do. If you fail 3,000 times, you try again with attempt number 3,001. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You're never discouraged by failure, causing trouble for all those around you. You always find a way to get back up. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's your life. Right, Thomas Alva Edison? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
In the end...That was your ultimate talent, right? 
 
**Edison:**
Blavatsky...I am not sure if I should take that as a compliment or insult...
 
**Edison:**
But thank you. You really are my friend. I just need to overcome it...That was my life's conclusion. 
 
**Edison:**
But I'm a loser. A coward. The King of Lawsuits. Leading a nation again is something I can't possibly&mdash;
 
**Karna:**
That's not true. Make no mistake, Edison. 
 
**Karna:**
You were lost, but you were headed towards the correct location. 
 
**Karna:**
Saving someone you don't know the name of, or trying to shine light into a world of darkness...
 
**Karna:**
I can confidently say that those are desires you can be proud of. 
 
**Karna:**
No matter how much you blame yourself, or how much you hate yourself, or how you perform evil deeds out of being overly cautious...
 
**Karna:**
Unlike heroes who can only save others by defeating something, you do it and have done it with your inventions. 
 
**Karna:**
As in, not with your words.... Ultimately, you really became a light shining onto the world. 
 
**Karna:**
Feed off that hope, that accomplishment, and stand up. You're at rock bottom right now, but not all is lost, right? 
 
**Edison:**
Karna&mdash;
 
**Karna:**
Mmm. It is time to wake up, great King of Inventions. There are still so many gems hidden in that brain of yours. 
 
**Edison:**
...I see. Your world is far from seeing inventions, and vastly differs from mine, yet you still say that. 
 
**Edison:**
Babbage, my best friend, is telling me in Morse code...That I cannot lose until I am bankrupt. 
 
**Edison:**
In that case...Yes! The presi-king will never die! He must rise as often as needed! 
 
**Edison:**
The dream of bringing prosperity to the world has revived! Karna, Blavatsky! Sorry to have caused you trouble! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Don't worry. We're friends. 
 
**Karna:**
...Right. Though a bit pushy, after coming this far, I suppose we are friends. 
 
**Edison:**
&mdash;Ha. I'm always blessed with such great friends. 
 
**Edison:**
Even that hysteric can't match me here. This is what I can call my own fortune. 
 
**Edison:**
...I also owe you an apology and my thanks,Fujimaru. And to all you Servants who support [♂ him /♀ her]. 
 
**Edison:**
Frankly, I still have no idea. I still don't know how to save the world, or how to defeat the Celts. 
 
**Edison:**
But&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup. Let's think about it together. 

---

 
**Edison:**
I am grateful, and I'm counting on you. That's right, I have forgotten something very important! 
 
**Edison:**
The president always has a vice president by his side. At times, the VP is even more capable. 
 
**Mash:**
Mr. Edison, then you mean...
 
**Edison:**
Yes. I am Thomas Alva Edison. One cornerstone of the foundation for American prosperity. 
 
**Edison:**
In that case, this time for sure...I want to create an invention that will save this world! 
 
**Edison:**
Of course, as your Servant, Fujimaru! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It would be my pleasure! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes! That's great news, Master! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So I've been appointed VP! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahh, congratulations! Though, that role usually dies first in movies! 
 

---

 
**Edison:**
&mdash;I will now bestow myself and all that I have upon you, Fujimaru. 
 
**Edison:**
Will you save the world together with me? ...My Master. 
 
## Section 16: The Fellowship 
 
**Edison:**
Now, everyone, have a seat! We're gonna brainstorm, guys! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, teacher! Me, me! 
 
**Edison:**
Yes, Elisabeth. What is it? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
We invade, and beat them up. That's our only choice! 
 
**Edison:**
That's...Completely denied!! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Whyyyyyyy!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...I know! How about we sing to heal their souls? 
 
**Everyone:**
DENIED! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Whyyyyyyy!? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They lack the refinement to appreciate it. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
They have no tolerance for such things. 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
I-I see. Then I suppose there's nothing we can do. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
One needs knowledge to understand music, too. If they don't have that, there's nothing I can do. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need to wait for death metal to be invented. 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Right, if death metal was&ndash; What'd you just say, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Idols! My genre of choice is a cutesy pop idol song, you know? 
 
**Edison:**
This is what's known as “letting 100 schools of thought contend,” yes? Anyway, all of you, please reassess the current situation. 
 
**Edison:**
Here's a map. The Celts occupy the eastern half of North America. 
 
**Edison:**
They'll ultimately invade us from two routes, north and south. They're currently making the preparations to do so. 
 
**Edison:**
If we were to invade, we would leave one side exposed. They'd overwhelm us, and we'd lose. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Based on data obtained so far, losing too much land will likely be the condition for defeat in this war. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So I presume. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The connection to the era is fragile enough as is, it will sever more as the Celts expand their area of dominance. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In time, this era will no longer withstand its separation from reality...and it will “die. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, even if we do invade, we have to make sure they don't take any more of our current territory. 
 
**Edison:**
...That's how it was...Then the fact that I increased the number of troops and pushed back the front line as a stopgap measure...
 
**Nightingale:**
Ended up saving this nation, yes. The patient was continuously losing stamina, but you protected its heart. 
 
**Edison:**
Yes...Yes! 
 
**Scáthach:**
But, that was also your limit. You slightly pushed back the front line, but it won't be long before it falls. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Servants will likely be commanding the invading army. 
 
**Scáthach:**
At this rate...the mechanized infantry won't stand a chance, and they'll continue to branch out. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
But that was then, right? Now we have a bunch of Servants! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Well, there is some truth to what Eli-Eli is saying. Hmm...Let's first look at our opponents' strength&ndash;
 
**Blavatsky:**
Queen Medb, Cú Chulainn, Beowulf, Arjuna...
 
**Blavatsky:**
We may outnumber them, but they have some of the world's greatest heroes on their side...Not just Celtic ones. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Add to that the Celtic soldiers, who can overwhelm even Servants if there are enough. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
And don't forget the monsters and Shadow Servants they pull into the confusion. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
To top it off, they can reproduce indefinitely. Can we defeat them? I can't. Totally impossible. 
 
**Rama:**
Mmm, hmm...I could keep up at full strength, but&ndash;
 
**Rama:**
Defeat? That I cannot guarantee. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Even if we were to just go after the Servants...I mean, I'll do it if you ask me to. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'd be beaten to a pulp if it's one-on-one. If only there was someone else to help...
 
**Edison:**
Hmm...
 
**Rama:**
...Mmm...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Now, then...
 
**Edison:**
This isn't good...The discussion is coming to a halt. How about we move our bodies a little bit? 
 
**Edison:**
Fujimaru! You should take this opportunity to join us! 
 
**Edison:**
This is a virtual skirmish I invented. It's only slightly dangerous! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Edison:**
Physical activity relaxes the mind,but in the end, there are only two ways to go about this. 
 
**Mash:**
Is one of them...assassination? 
 
**Scáthach:**
A select few will go to Washington D. C. , and assassinate Queen Medb. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That should prevent any further increase in Celtic soldiers. We can turn this into a fight between Servants. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But Medb is extremely cautious. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Once she senses Servants, she will likely bring all her Servants back at once. 
 
**Scáthach:**
To be honest, she's already survived one assassination attempt. I would expect her to be even more cautious. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That really hits home. 
 
**Edison:**
Painfully true. What do you think,Chief Nurse Nightingale? Quite the pickle, isn't it? 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I shall leave military problems of this sort to you. I am just a nurse. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now, don't say that. 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
I'm telling you that I'm useless. Sheesh...
 
**Nightingale:**
If an ambush is impossible, we fight them head-on. That's about all I can think up right now. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm...Actually, Nightingale's suggestion is probably the most realistic one. 
 
**Edison:**
Meaning? 
 
**Rama:**
We place mechanized infantry and Servants both to the north and south. 
 
**Rama:**
Of the two armies, one simply needs to hold its ground. Meanwhile, the main army will rush towards the capital. 
 
**Rama:**
...What do you say, Scáthach? 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's right. There are several Servants here. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Some Servants are powerful enough to rival the enemy, myself included. However, there aren't enough for “two even armies. ”
 
**Scáthach:**
But if we concentrate forces into one army, the other will crumble, and the enemy will occupy America. 
 
**Scáthach:**
All types of balance must be considered when forming the North and South armies. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Now, how to handle it...
 
**Elisabeth:**
What, that's actually quite simple! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Mmm? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Come on, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] over there! Don't just stand around, you pick the parties! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, me? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you sure? 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Naturally. You fought alongside Servants in France, Rome, and all sorts of other places, right? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
No other Master in the world is as familiar with Servants as you are. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
If you choose the teams,I can trust those decisions! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Oh, Eli-Eli has a point. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Can you stop calling me Eli-Eli!? 
 
**Rama:**
Hmm, it's just like Elisabeth says. If Master selects the parties, I will be all right with it. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Give me some time. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hold on a sec. 

---

 
**Scáthach:**
No problem. Just think of a team of Servants by tomorrow. 
 
**Scáthach:**
In the meantime, Edison and his team should prepare for the final battle. 
 
**Edison:**
Sounds like a plan. Start up the comms! Inform all units immediately! 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. It's a lot of responsibility, but we're counting on you. 
 
**Mash:**
Sleep on it for a day, if you need to. I believe you've got it in you! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Taking a walk at this hour? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Change of pace. 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
...This is also some sort of fate. I shall accompany you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Edison's wounds are healed. His responsibilities as King of America should've been lessened. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Or perhaps the obsessions of past presidents had been possessing him. 
 
**Nightingale:**
There is a chance for a poor prognosis, so I need to continue monitoring him...
 
**Nightingale:**
One illness left. I only hope then the world will be healed. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll try my best. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, we have to make it work. 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
I have no intention of putting you under any pressure. I hope you don't misunderstand. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Normally, it's insane to have just one person bear the responsibilities of stopping world destruction. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is indeed a dire move. Only the insane could withstand the pressure. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Like I once was.... But you are different. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You must remain steadfast and assign us to our posts. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I trust you. The same way I trust my comrades who fought against the stubborn army. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You need to make an effort. But there is no need to bear the entire burden. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Moreover, even if your choice is correct,there is the possibility that we, the entrusted, will fail. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Even with utmost preparations,soldiers will die, and people will fall ill. 
 
**Nightingale:**
So, I hope you do not shoulder too much weight. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Relax, but be honest&ndash;I'm sure we will be fine. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Do you find the night breeze a bit chilly? Let's return. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The fallen soldiers are on the move. If we leave them alone, their numbers will only increase. 
 
**Nightingale:**
A corpse is a mound of pathogens. We must carefully mourn them, and send them to the afterlife! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Now, let's head over to heal our wounded hero. 
 
**Scáthach:**
My oh my...Even he is but an ill patient to you. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I would've never guessed that you, his mentor, had failed to notice. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I am not good at dealing with illness. After all, having come this close to being a Divine Spirit, illness has lost its meaning to me. 
 
**Scáthach:**
A straightforward death is something I've long since left behind. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...I don't understand. For one who has traversed death, your expression seems glum? 
 
**Scáthach:**
But of course. I have not traversed death. Simply, I have overcome it. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yet that doesn't mean I've transcended death. I am merely a ghost who was left behind by life. 
 
**Scáthach:**
What of yourself? In the sense of ghosts or grudges, I believe you're rather close to me? 
 
**Nightingale:**
I have simply returned to the present world in my peak form. Which is why I shall treat anyone to the best of my ability. 
 
**Nightingale:**
The fact that I was summoned in itself shows that this world is still in need of “nursing. ”
 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm...
 
**Scáthach:**
First, the North Army. Elisabeth, Robin, Edison, and Blavatsky. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Then, the South Army. Karna, Rama, Nightingale, Fujimaru, Mash, and myself. 
 
**Scáthach:**
The North Army might just be barely enough to hold them. However, depending on the enemy's number, the South Army can break through their defense. 
 
**Edison:**
I see...
 
**Edison:**
I'll equip boosters on the mechanized infantry for the South Army so they can keep up with you Servants. 
 
**Edison:**
Hold the North with as few members as possible, and rush into Washington D. C. with the South Army. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Wait a minute, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! I want to get at him, too! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're the only one. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
......
 
**Elisabeth:**
......Fine. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
In exchange, Cú Chulainn, the one who defeated Saber...Make sure to take him down. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I promise you. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Fine then. I'll fight for you here, along with that Mr. Komadori. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's not my actual name, you know? Well, you can leave this side to us. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
If we're against an army, my preparations will come in handy. I'll do a thorough job of harassing them. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes. Our goal is 60% reduction. I'm sure you can do that much. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Against Celtic warriors led by Servants? That'll require double as much work as usual...
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, you can do it with only double? That's amazing, Hermit of the Forest. You've exceeded my expectations. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Ugh, I talked too fast. Normally, it's impossible even with double the effort...
 
**Robin Hood:**
Maybe if we put our lives on the line, we might make it work. We'll give it our best shot. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
They are counting on us. 
 
I'm just not sure how far we can go with two Casters...
 
**Blavatsky:**
However, I'll do my best. No matter what the job is, I will see it through. 
 
**Edison:**
...Mmm. We might've gone down the wrong path, but I'm glad my mechanized infantry can be of use. 
 
**Edison:**
Allow me to take charge of the North Army. 
 
**Scáthach:**
No one has any issue with this? Then let's move everybody out. 
 
**Scáthach:**
This is quite a large-scale operation. I imagine our opponents will pick up on our movements. 
 
**Scáthach:**
We have to time our attacks simultaneously. Three days from now, at dusk. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Servants in the North Army should move out at once. We must expect the unexpected. 
 
**Edison:**
True. I trust you with this mission, Madame Blavatsky. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Indeed. Mr. Edison, I wish you the best, as well. 
 
**Edison:**
Karna! 
 
**Karna:**
What is it, Edison? 
 
**Edison:**
Um, well. I've been meaning to say this, but didn't get the chance to! 
 
**Edison:**
Thank you for answering the request of someone like me! I was able to come this far because you were with us! 
 
**Karna:**
Don't mention it, Edison, and Godspeed. 
 
**Edison:**
Thank you, Karna. Now, Master! 
 
**Edison:**
...I imagine I won't be able to see you again. Though quite brief, you really treated me well. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're a role model for children. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Oh, you're Edison...What can I say? 

---

 
**Edison:**
Hah! Did you read a biography or something? If it was written for children, I must have been so awesome. 
 
**Edison:**
...I swear I will accomplish this mission, so the real me won't lose to the book me. 
 
**Edison:**
Then, farewell, my friends! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
All right, guess we'll take off, too. This is our final farewell. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I suppose this is the life of someone engaged in guerrilla warfare. As long as we're alive, we'll meet again. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Not necessarily seeing each other face to face. For example a song or a letter left behind by someone...
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm saying we'll come across stuff like that if we survive. For humans, meeting in person isn't the only way to reunite. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
See ya. It was a short while. But I had fun. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...It doesn't bother me. Seems like we're strangely connected, anyway...
 
**Elisabeth:**
I'll probably be summoned into a different era anyway. I might already have a contract as a Servant to begin with. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
There's no way I would die. I am invincible. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Which is why...Well, as long as you avenge Nero, I'll be fine. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Don't worry. You've got some potential as a Master. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
That's right! Why don't I write you a little song to cheer&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ahhh! My stomach! Can't hear you! 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
&ndash;you up. You say you're sick but you look pretty energetic? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Well, whatever...I plan to console the soldiers along the way! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
We've got a long road ahead...
 
**Scáthach:**
All right. Time for to head to the front lines. This is the final battle...Don't let your guard down. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Perfect! Why don't I find out if you're really up for the task...
 
**Mash:**
S-So suddenly&ndash;!? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Hm, not bad for a practice round. 
 
**Mash:**
I didn't think I would be nearly killed in a warm-up...
 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, nonsense. All right then, Rama, you lead the charge. 
 
**Rama:**
Huh? I don't mind, but...You're not going to do it? 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'll take my leave here. 
 
**Mash:**
What!? W-Wait, why!? 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'll be acting on my own and monitoring the actions of Queen Medb and Cú Chulainn. If needed, I'll fight and hold them down. 
 
**Rama:**
Isn't that like walking to your own death!? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Certainly, if I was some other Servant. But, who do you think I am? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Do I look like someone who'd be gobbled up that easily? Even if they got me, it'd take days. 
 
**Rama:**
...Still, you already say it like it's inevitable...
 
**Scáthach:**
Well. That can't be helped. There must be some sacrifices. After all, someone's got to do it. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Listen. If those two ever make it to the front lines, we will most certainly lose. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I am something like a dam to hold them back. It's on you all to lead this battle to victory. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I am counting on you, Rama. You're still inexperienced, but you have the skill to be a swordsman comparable to my stupid student. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You have experience leading battles, too. You're essential in our army. 
 
**Rama:**
...There's no stopping you after such a speech. In life, my army was mostly monkeys...But, well, it'll work out. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Fujimaru...Master. Don't look so worried. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You've got plenty of Servants now. You have nothing to fear, even if I alone am missing. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Ideally, I would've liked to enjoy the life of a normal Servant, but asking for luxuries can be endless. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Farewell! 
 
**Karna:**
Master, a word? 
 
**Mash:**
Karna. What is it? 
 
**Karna:**
I'd like to stand out as much as possible in the vanguard...Will you allow it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I guess...

---

 
**Karna:**
&ndash;Arjuna is on the other side. 
 
**Karna:**
By nature, he shouldn't be on that side. 
 
**Karna:**
A born hero, Kiritin...Arjuna is the very embodiment of justice, a true Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Karna:**
In addition, he and I are connected to each other...For better or for worse. 
 
**Karna:**
The key to this battle lies in how we immobilize enemy Servants. 
 
**Karna:**
In which case, I'll concentrate on shutting down Arjuna with everything I've got...Would that be all right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please, Karna. 
 
**Karna:**
Very well. I'll make sure to shut Arjuna down. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do your best. 
 
**Karna:**
Of course I will. I will not go easy on him. 
 

---

 
**Karna:**
I will take the vanguard soldiers, then. Let's go! 
 
**Mash:**
Karna leading the vanguard. Rama and Nightingale are here with us, too. 
 
**Mash:**
Yet...I am still worried. Despite being more supported than ever before&mdash;
 
**Rama:**
You have good reason to be, Mash. After all, Cú Chulainn is on their side. 
 
**Rama:**
The strongest soldier, who singlehandedly fought his way through Medb's army. 
 
**Rama:**
As long as he is against us,there will be no such thing as a sure victory for us. 
 
**Rama:**
I need not mention Edison and his North Army. We, too, may very well collapse on the battlefield. 
 
**Rama:**
Nevertheless, to make victory ours...We will give it our all. 
 
**Rama:**
Now, Master. Your orders. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aim for the White House! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Begin the advance! 
 

---

 
**Rama:**
Understood! All units attack! This is the final battle! 
 
**Rama:**
Take back the United States of America for yourselves! We will lend our assistance as well! 
 
## Section 17: War 
 
**Medb:**
Hey! Guess what, my king? They're dead. Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid. 
 
**Medb:**
Looks like the Servants turned the tables on them. You really can't underestimate them, can you? 
 
**Medb:**
Or, could it be that their Master is even stronger than we thought? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...That's nice. 
 
**Medb:**
So apathetic. Not interested? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Of course not. The greatest benefit of a dead man is that you no longer have to think of him. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What interests me is what the living are up to.... Let's see. What do you think they're planning to do? 
 
**Soldier:**
I have a report. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Ah. Speak. 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes sir. The United Western States Army split their troops to the north and south. The South Army is advancing towards us. 
 
**Medb:**
My, they want a final battle? 
 
**Soldier:**
They're bringing in troops standing by at the rear as well. No doubt about it. 
 
**Soldier:**
And leading the army is&ndash;
 
**Medb:**
It's not Edison? 
 
**Soldier:**
No, Edison and Blavatsky are in charge of the North Army. The South Army is led by another Servant. 
 
**Medb:**
...There's more? 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes. Leading the South Army is a young male Servant,and a Servant with a giant shield. 
 
**Soldier:**
We have also confirmed a nurse Servant. 
 
**Soldier:**
Leading the vanguard is Karna&ndash;the thin Lancer with a shining spear. 
 
**Medb:**
One, two, three...Four!? There are suddenly four more of them!? 
 
**Soldier:**
Karna's presence had been previously confirmed, but...
 
**Medb:**
That still leaves three new Servants! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Probably more than three. 
 
**Medb:**
Huh? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
My mentor, the Indian rascal, even the Servant I let escape once...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
On top of it, that shield Servant from the report...That means there must be more. 
 
**Medb:**
What, no way! Edison partnered up with those guys!? 
 
**Medb:**
...In other words, they gave up on giving up? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Looks like it. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
He gave up on protecting America,and instead decided to take the world for his own. 
 
**Medb:**
Hmm, this might not be good, huh? You never know what can happen in an all-out war. 
 
**Medb:**
What to do? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Hey. 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
We're off to war. Gather troops. 
 
**Medb:**
W-Wait...Are you planning on joining the fight!? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Of course. Are you planning on leaving them alone? 
 
**Medb:**
No, no! In the name of the Mad King, I won't let them be. I'll crush those Servants with my entire army. 
 
**Medb:**
By advancing on us, they insulted the king and provoked us. Then again, it just goes to show how desperate they are. 
 
**Medb:**
Desperate people are favorable for me. 
 
**Medb:**
The despair of those who hate us and spite us is so many shades darker than the ordinary kind, you see? 
 
**Medb:**
An avenging father slain by his family's murderer, a lover killed by someone whose lover was also killed,
 
**Medb:**
I love stories like that. That's why I simply squash them, with my superior resources! 
 
**Medb:**
Let us divide our army into two forces as well. 
 
**Medb:**
Leave the North Army to Beowulf, and put Arjuna in charge of the South Army. 
 
**Medb:**
I'll take care of informing the Servants. Now, go! 
 
**Soldier:**
Yes! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Taking the scout's report into consideration, their main force is the South Army. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
They're planning to crush our forces with that army and march straight to the capital. 
 
**Medb:**
The North Army only needs to hold the front. At worst, they're buying time? 
 
**Medb:**
My oh my...And they call themselves proud Servants? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's just how desperate they are. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That Edison guy has cast aside his pride,and is trying to protect this world and fix history. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
The source is most likely&ndash;the world's last remaining Master that was in the reports. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Medb. How are you reading this? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Servants unleash their greatest powers when they have a Master. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If they come fighting not as individual troops,but as Servants accompanying their Master 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Is our army powerful enough to defeat them? 
 
**Medb:**
...Let's see. It might be tough. 
 
**Medb:**
Beowulf and Arjuna are both top-notch warriors, but they have no will to fight. 
 
**Medb:**
You could say Arjuna has a reason to fight, although it's a very personal one. 
 
**Medb:**
But Beowulf is only barely following orders. I can't imagine him losing...but...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Medb. We're going all in. 
 
**Medb:**
!!! O-Okay. 
 
**Medb:**
But I need time. Setting the North aside, the South&ndash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll hold the South down. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Arjuna can lead the charge,and I'll destroy all the Servants I can get my hands on. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
After all, they've got that woman. 
 
**Medb:**
...Scáthach? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Yeah, she IS my mentor. I can't imagine any other man being able to handle her. 
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;Do you want to fight her? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
No. I am a king. A king doesn't fight for self-interest. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I am the frame in establishing this nation. I'll devote myself to being a weapon slaughtering opponents. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
As long as Karna lives, Arjuna won't have the composure to deal with other Servants. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If that is the case, I'll go. I'll go, and I'll kill. 
 
**Medb:**
Very well. I won't stop you. Ride forth, my king! 
 
**Medb:**
Hahaha, hahaha, hahahahaha! The least kingly king in the world. 
 
**Medb:**
Despite having no intention of unifying the nation,you devote yourself to its creation. 
 
**Medb:**
That's why you never lose. You always kill the opposition. Once all opposition is gone, you may even turn on your allies. 
 
**Medb:**
...Perhaps that's the very thing I've been desiring most. 
 
**Medb:**
For a king such as you to throw everything in this world into chaos. 
 
**Medb:**
To wipe out everyone equally, with your Gáe Bolg. 
 
**Medb:**
Oh believers of justice and miracles...Hurry up and come here! Let me lead you to your unsightly death! 
 
**Mash:**
...A message from Karna! 
 
**Karna:**
We've engaged the enemy vanguard. We defeated them, but several troops are headed your way. 
 
**Karna:**
Sorry, but we don't have any forces to spare. Please stop them, Master. 
 
**Rama:**
I'll take the right wing. Nightingale can handle the left. Mash, you break through the middle...Can you do that? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I can! 
 
**Rama:**
Good. Then let's go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;All done! 
 
**Rama:**
...Their vanguard is this big? They must've figured out the South Army is the main force, and sent in their elites. 
 
**Rama:**
It looks like it. 
 
**Rama:**
The all-out clash is coming soon. Everybody, stay on guard! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nothing less from the king of Kosala. Such tremendous charisma, no matter how you look! 
 
**Rama:**
Can I consider that a compliment? So convoluted...
 
**Rama:**
Wyverns are coming, huh? All right, Master...Let's crush them! 
 
## Section 18: The Killing Fields 
 
**Rama:**
If we continue to proceed at this pace, we can expect all armies to clash in the wilderness ahead. 
 
**Mash:**
...It's going to be quite a large-scale war. 
 
**Scout:**
Commander Rama! We've confirmed the Celtic army at a point 20 klicks ahead. 
 
**Scout:**
Leading them is a brown-skinned male Servant holding a giant bow. 
 
**Rama:**
...Have you told Karna yet? 
 
**Scout:**
Yes sir, General Karna has already been informed. 
 
**Rama:**
Very well. 
 
**Rama:**
Tell all troops to not engage with that man, even if we enter battle. 
 
**Scout:**
Yes, sir! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It's Arjuna, isn't it. 
 
**Rama:**
Most likely. Good grief, this is like a scene from a nightmare. 
 
**Rama:**
Arjuna...The legendary hero. The Mahabharata is practically all about him. 
 
**Rama:**
He grasps victory in every battlefield. Even Karna once suffered a crushing defeat. 
 
**Rama:**
Is there any way we can win this? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There is. 

---

 
**Rama:**
...Hm, interesting. 
 
**Rama:**
You declare it to be so, Master,but you probably have absolutely no basis behind it. 
 
**Rama:**
Yet somehow, I feel as if we can win. 
 
**Mash:**
Me, too. Somehow, having your guarantee makes my hair stand on end! 
 
**Rama:**
Hahaha. Brilliant. Like the dawn of a new year! 
 
**Rama:**
Heh. A good Master and good Servants. It's no wonder we've made it this far. 
 
**Rama:**
Thanks to that, I have no doubts either. I merely wield my sword as your Servant! 
 
**Rama:**
...They're coming! 
 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;There you are, Karna. 
 
**Arjuna:**
You all go fight the Servants. I have&ndash;business with that Lancer. 
 
**D：Soldier:**
Yes. 
 
**Rama:**
Enemy forces, including wyverns, should be handled as discussed during our march! 
 
**Rama:**
They're strong, but that's all they are! There's no need for fear! 
 
**E：Soldier:**
...
 
**Rama:**
All of you have a duty to protect this land! And I don't mean because you are the owners! 
 
**Rama:**
Since you've taken it, it means you're responsible for it until the end! 
 
**Rama:**
Thousands and thousands of lives are depending on each of you. 
 
**Rama:**
This war cannot be decided by heroes alone! This war has no meaning unless it's won by each and every single one of you! 
 
**Rama:**
Go make victory your own! Now, charge! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, Karna's unit has broken through. The right and left wing units are headed this way! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do this. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll surely win. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Mash Kyrielight&ndash; Here I go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Rama:**
Look out! Wyverns! Fire the Anti-Air Electromagnetic Net Launcher! 
 
**Soldier:**
Commander, it's not just an Electromagnetic Net Launcher, but an Edisonian Direct Current Electromagnetic Net Launcher! 
 
**Rama:**
He's picky about that kinda stuff!? Servants, take down the ones who slip through the net! 
 
**Mash:**
Copy that! Master, your orders please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The soldiers keep coming, don't they? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Give me every bandage we have! 
 
**Celtic Soldier:**
YAAHHH! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Out of my way! 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'm sorry, please defend this place until I'm done with treatment! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay. 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
I appreciate it! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
Treatment is mostly complete. I've sent those unfit for battle toward the back. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, is Karna safe? 
 
**Mash:**
Seeing as Arjuna isn't here,I imagine they are in combat&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Amazing. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's the very reenactment of mythology! Nothing less from a top Servant. Off the charts in every way! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;So you've come, Karna. 
 
**Karna:**
No matter when or what era. Only I can ever be your opponent. 
 
**Arjuna:**
Each time I am summoned to a Holy Grail War as a Servant, it seems I always end up searching for you. 
 
**Arjuna:**
While attempting to be a proper hero...I would seek you, and be disappointed. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Never again will we have an opportunity such as this. 
 
**Karna:**
...
 
**Arjuna:**
The moment you stood before me,all my other priorities evaporated. 
 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;So, Karna. Shall we begin where we left off? 
 
**Karna:**
...We shall, Arjuna. 
 
**Karna:**
Both you and I seem to be held captive by a chronic disease that can never be cured. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...However. 
 
**Karna:**
Yes. 
 
**Both:**
&ndash;That is our very delight. 
 
**Karna:**
This world has no gods, no curses, not even destiny. 
 
**Arjuna:**
Precisely because there aren't, I made facing you my only desire upon the Holy Grail. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...And now, that wish has come true. I have no interest in saving this world. 
 
**Arjuna:**
If it is to perish, it shall perish. Yet, you attempt to save it&ndash;this world. 
 
**Karna:**
Of course. As long as people wishing to live proper lives exist, I will continue to protect them. 
 
**Karna:**
I was given this power for that purpose. Know that as long as my father and my life remain, the sun remains immortal. 
 
**Arjuna:**
That is why I am for destruction. If you stand with the good, I shall stand with the evil. 
 
**Arjuna:**
That is equality. This time&mdash;surely this time, I must put an end to your very existence as my equal! 
 
**Karna:**
...Now then. Arjuna. Do you know the saying“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost”? 
 
**Arjuna:**
? 
 
**Karna:**
No, it's nothing. There was once someone who taught me that. Watching you just reminded me of him. 
 
**Karna:**
Like it or not, we've known each other the longest. On account of that, promise me one thing. 
 
**Karna:**
If you defeat me, fulfill your original duty as a Heroic Spirit. Save the world with your “Agni Gandiva. ”
 
**Karna:**
...I hate to admit it,but you're far better at that sort of thing. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Very well. But once it's decided,don't make that your reason for defeat. 
 
**Karna:**
Never. I would never fight for defeat. 
 
Upon my spear, upon my armor, I swear it. 
 
**Karna:**
I swear upon my father and mother&ndash;that victory will be mine. 
 
**Arjuna:**
I also swear victory upon my parents&ndash;and my brothers. 
 
**Arjuna:**
After tens of thousands of years,I've finally obtained this chance! 
 
**Arjuna:**
Not even evil spirits out there can interfere with me! 
 
**Both:**
&ndash;Here I go! 
 
**Rama:**
Whoa, that queen...Don't tell me she even called a giant dragon to attack us! 
 
**Rama:**
But if we defeat it, it's just one more push before their front line crumbles! Let's do this! 
 
## Section 19: North American Myth War (Beginning) 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Life signatures eliminated! ...Whew, what an ordeal. Had me scared a bit. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, how's the northern front doing? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't worry, they've been holding it. This might be possible after all! 
 
**Karna:**
HAAAAAA&ndash;! 
 
**Arjuna:**
SHAAAAAA! 
 
**Rama:**
It's Karna and Arjuna! What a chaotic battle! 
 
**Rama:**
All forces, keep away from those two! You'll be caught in the crossfire! 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Ever so slightly, Karna is overpowering him. 
 
**Rama:**
Ah, you can tell, Nightingale? 
 
**Rama:**
After all, an Archer shines in long-range combat. Being so closed in on, even the great Arjuna cannot handle him. 
 
**Rama:**
Then again, normally Karna would be overwhelming in a situation like this. 
 
**Rama:**
Yet the two appear to be nearly on par with each other. As expected of the great Arjuna! 
 
**Rama:**
And yet&ndash;if things continue this way...
 
**Karna:**
...Tch! 
 
**Arjuna:**
Ugh&mdash;! 
 
**Rama:**
Karna will win! 
 
**C：???:**
&ndash;“Gáe Bolg. ”
 
**Mash:**
What...
 
**Nightingale:**
!!! 
 
**Rama:**
Wh-What&ndash;!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servant responses have suddenly...Wait, what just happened!? 
 
**Arjuna:**
!!! 
 
**Karna:**
...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Don't hate me, Hero of Benefaction. After all, this killing spree has no rules. 
 
**Karna:**
...Cú Chulainn...
 
**Arjuna:**
Cú Chulainn...You bastard! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Shut up. Starting a fight without consulting me...Did I approve a one-on-one? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Wait until you've read the situation before running after your own interests. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
At least be grateful that you weren't stabbed from the back, Hero of the Endowed. 
 
**Arjuna:**
!!! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Now let's see&ndash;Is that the famed Master? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
!!! 

---

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What, shaking all over? My mistake for thinking you'd be a veteran hero. 
 
**Mash:**
Y-You're...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The Caster from Fuyuki! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The one we fought with back then! 
 

---

 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Sadly, I don't remember that. A completely different guy. 
 
**Mash:**
But...
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, calm down. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, he's an enemy. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, I know. 
 
**Rama:**
Wait, Cú Chulainn! What happened to Scáthach&ndash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Hm? Oh, I defeated Scáthach. 
 
**Nightingale:**
!!! 
 
**Rama:**
...You don't mince your words, do you? 
 
**Mash:**
No, not Scáthach...Impossible...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Oh yeah, no need for condolences. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You're all going to die here, too. Go lick each other's wounds on the other side. 
 
**Rama:**
He's coming! Don't hold back on Command Spells, we'll fight with all we've got! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Hah...Hah...Hah...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
The strength of that shield...Strange. I don't recall a shield so powerful, not even in folklore. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But it's definitely a Noble Phantasm. Girl, that shield&mdash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Never mind. It won't matter if I take you down, anyway! 
 
**Rama:**
Noble Phantasm incoming, Mash! That vermilion spear aims for your heart no matter what! 
 
**Rama:**
You have to run at full speed! 
 
**Mash:**
It's no use, I won't make it! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It's go time&ndash;My demonic thorn of death. 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What...
 
**H：???:**
Dozing off as I stroll along,I find myself in a strange land of wilderness. 
 
**H：???:**
Is this the dream continued, or merely an illusion? Well, not that it matters. 
 
**Merlin:**
Good morning and hello, all. Everyone's trusted advisor, Mr. Merlin, is here. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mer...Who? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who's that cocky fellow!? 
 

---

 
**Merlin:**
Right, you, never mind that. This appearance is a special service, an incognito visit totally on a whim. 
 
**Merlin:**
Your paths and mine are not yet set to cross. I mean, I should be a shut-in from a tower in paradise to begin with. 
 
**Merlin:**
Just consider this a lucky visit from a wonderful gentleman and be done with it, okay? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
So&ndash;what kind of blockhead are you? Is this what they call a daydream? 
 
**Merlin:**
Of course. It's my ol' specialty,making do by confusing the opponent! 
 
**Merlin:**
Oh! Congratulations on your coronation, Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Merlin:**
To think the day would come when the great hero of Ireland settles down on a throne. My, my, destiny is a strange thing. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
This feeling...You must be an incubus...Which means...I see, you are the Stargazer. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Your meddling is breaking the rules. Is this fine, mage? Your pride will crumble to pieces. 
 
**Merlin:**
Not to worry, we'll play it by ear. Besides, I have no pride or principles, or anything like that. 
 
**Mash:**
Who&ndash;are you&ndash;? 
 
**Merlin:**
I watch everything in this world from an island in the farthest lands. Yes, I watch everything. 
 
**Merlin:**
That's the important point. I am but an observer, simply observing...At least for now. 
 
**Merlin:**
...Whoa, I really am about to wake from my nap. 
 
**Merlin:**
Sorry, but this is about all the help I can lend you. You'll have to finish slaying that beast on your own. 
 
**Merlin:**
Once you have done so,the future in which we meet shall come. 
 
**Merlin:**
Farewell, then, until that slightly altered future. Take care of Cath Palug for me. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Tch, behind me! 
 
**Karna:**
Burn him to ashes...“Vasavi Shakti! ”
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Tch! 
 
**Mash:**
Karna! 
 
**Arjuna:**
...
 
**Karna:**
It wasn't strong enough...to reach him...Master...farewell...
 
**Rama:**
...Karna...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
One last struggle at the very end. This is why I never trust the comings and goings of spearman. 
 
**Rama:**
Quit babbling, now's the chance&ndash;! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Right back at you, scumbag! Flaunting your borrowed feathers...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That attack left me scorched all over. I'll be going home to cool off now. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...It's no use fleeing, Cú Chulainn. No matter how great your fury, that wound will never heal. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You are ill. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Ha. It's as you say, bloody saint. The day I'm healed will probably never come. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll simply continue being king,until the day I fall and rot. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Come and get me, if you can. I'll fight you in Washington. 
 
**Rama:**
...Don't let this opportunity pass! All forces push, push, push! 
 
**Arjuna:**
...
 
**Rama:**
I am sorry Arjuna, but I must kill you! 
 
**Rama:**
Er, Nightingale!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Arjuna. Have you any desire of receiving treatment? 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Treatment? What illness do you think I have? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Karna tried to be a Servant. That is all. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Despite trying to be a hero with a second life, you do not wish to be a Servant. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Our existence sides with neither. We have our self-interests, yet we also have a given Order. 
 
**Nightingale:**
In that moment, Karna acted as a Servant, and believed that stopping Cú Chulainn would lead to victory. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...He believed that it was the right thing to do than indulging you with your deep-rooted obsession. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Obsession? My long-standing desire...
 
**Arjuna:**
How could the likes of you ever understand!? 
 
**Rama:**
H-Hey, Nightingale. Er, maybe you shouldn't provoke him too much!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;It's a mistaken obsession. No use crying over spilt milk. Defeating a nemesis with an arrow you shouldn't have shot&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
You must live the rest of your life with that regret. That's how it is for other heroes, too. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Madly wishing to redo, seeking a wish never granted.... Despite that, a Servant doesn't cross that final line. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You did not try to understand that final line. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...I...
 
**Nightingale:**
Will you fight? If you would like to, you may. 
 
**Arjuna:**
...You're right. There's no need to fight. I don't even want to vent my anger. 
 
**Arjuna:**
But I...want to settle the score. In order to purge this unmanageable something in my heart. 
 
**Arjuna:**
I'll understand if you decline. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight. 
 
**Rama:**
H-Hey!? Master, you're going to fight Arjuna!? 
 
**Rama:**
Who is!? We are, yup, of course! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll win. 
 
**Rama:**
Hahahahaha, Master! I've got something to say to you, as a fellow warrior! 
 
**Rama:**
There's no telling whether we'll win. After all, our opponent is Arjuna! 
 
**Rama:**
Ah, what the heck! Let's do this! 
 

---

 
**Arjuna:**
&ndash;Thank you. Then let us battle, if you please. 
 
**Arjuna:**
My name is Arjuna. Consider it an honor&ndash;to fall by my arrow! 
 
**Rama:**
I also have the pride of having bested the Demon King Ravana. &ndash;Prepare yourself, Arjuna! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Rama:**
How's that, Arjuna! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Do you feel better now? 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Yes, very much. I appreciate you putting up with my self-indulgence. 
 
**Mash:**
Arjuna. Well...If you wouldn't mind, could you lend us a hand? 
 
**Arjuna:**
...Unfortunately, I cannot. Though I strongly desire to. 
 
**Arjuna:**
I'll be sure to make amends for what I've done. Will you please believe me? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will. 

---

 
**Arjuna:**
...Your words ring true, even in my hollowed heart. Farewell, then. 
 
**Rama:**
...Arjuna...What did he...
 
**Nightingale:**
It means he was able to sort out his feelings. 
 
**Nightingale:**
He is not as faithful as others think,nor as evil as he himself believes. 
 
**Nightingale:**
He must've led quite a stifling life when he was alive. 
 
**Nightingale:**
After all, he'd been living a life that was decided for him by someone else. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, I see. Arjuna must have wanted a fresh start. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That day, that moment, that arrow he shot at Karna...He'd been regretting it all his life. 
 
**Nightingale:**
His illness has been cured. Though the price he paid...was all too great. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But despite that, we must forge ahead. 
 
**Rama:**
Nightingale is right. All right, march on! Let's charge all the way to Washington! 
 
## Section 20: North American Myth War (Middle) 
 
**Rama:**
Forward! The northern front has already clashed with the main army! There's no telling how long they'll last! 
 
**Rama:**
Speed! Speed will determine the winner! Full speed ahead! 
 
**Rama:**
Master! Enemy forces are straight ahead! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Crush them! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Blow 'em up! 

---

 
**Rama:**
Yes! All troops, charge! 
 
**Rama:**
No stopping, not even for a moment! We'll come down on them in one giant blow! 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's the matter? 

---

 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry. I was thinking of Scáthach. 
 
**Mash:**
Scáthach said she could never defeat Cú Chulainn, but I didn't believe her. 
 
**Mash:**
I felt nobody could ever defeat Scáthach. So&mdash;there was a part of me that wasn't worried. 
 
**Mash:**
A part of me that thought, even if we failed here, Scáthach would set it right. 
 
**Mash:**
But, it didn't turn out that way.... Scáthach was right. 
 
**Mash:**
But, I still don't understand. I don't understand how Scáthach could've lost...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;“Gáe Bolg! ”
 
**Scáthach:**
“Gáe Bolg Alternative&ndash;! ”
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Scáthach:**
Ugh! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
A clash of Gáe Bolgs, unimaginable during our lifetimes. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Both claim to deliver fatal blows,while at the same time evading them. 
 
**Scáthach:**
With different Noble Phantasms, this would've ended in death, not a draw. But both our Noble Phantasms are forbidden magical spears. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Both thorns of death trace identical paths and clash. A curious phenomenon&ndash; one that may never occur again. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...But my, that right arm of yours. Have you been repairing it with rune spells as you throw your spear? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Pretty much. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You're not waiting until the destruction ends to begin regenerating, unlike me. 
 
**Scáthach:**
You're regenerating while it is being destroyed. The pain must be excruciating...No, I am sure “excruciating” is not even enough to describe it. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Pain can be managed. I'm already prepared for the worst. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Hmph, you've been enduring it well too, my mentor. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Not really.... In the end, I'm merely buying time. 
 
**Scáthach:**
In the past&mdash;I've even dreamed of being killed by you. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Scáthach:**
“I should've died before things became this way,” I thought. If I regret anything about my life, that would be it. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;But, I have no desire to be killed by your current self. Personally, I preferred your previous self. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm not obligated to shoulder any of the burden you bear. My path is simple and straightforward. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I can't afford to be taking detours,nor can I afford to carry someone else's baggage. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll take the shortest path to be king, and to rule. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;For whom? Is it for Medb? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Medb wished upon the Holy Grail, and made you into a king. But that was never your wish. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What makes you think so? Do you really think I've never dreamed of becoming king? 
 
**Scáthach:**
You never mentioned such a dream when you were alive. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
True. Just as you say&ndash;in life,the thought of becoming king never crossed my mind. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
However. Isn't it common for Servants to harbor new dreams that might not have existed when they were alive? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...So, it's the opposite. You're trying to become a king as a result of becoming king. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;What a foolish contradiction. Despite becoming king, nothing indicated you became one. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That's why you have to destroy everything. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If a man stands alone in the deserted wilderness,then indeed, he must be the unopposed king. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Yeah, that's fine by me. That solution feels best. A hero's existence is full of contradictions, after all. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
It's not for Medb. I brandish this spear for my own self-interest. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Now, you must be running out of ways to stall for time. Let's put an end to this, Scáthach. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&mdash;Such an idiot. You're an idiot down to your bones, yet you're thinking so hard. 
 
**Scáthach:**
But no matter. I'm finished with my questions. Gates, open. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Tch! 
 
**Scáthach:**
“Gate of Skye. ”
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
A Noble Phantasm that transports people to the Land of Shadows! 
 
**Scáthach:**
I'm sorry, but I'm taking you with me. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
My mentor...You must've sensed it. That you can't defeat me. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You know you can't win, even using that Noble Phantasm, yes? &ndash;That's correct. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
A Noble Phantasm that transports, yet doesn't kill&mdash;Your consideration for others this late in the game is why you will lose. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Noble Phantasm seal. Transform&ndash;! 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Wh-What? 
 
**Scáthach:**
!!! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;You stopped moving, Scáthach! 
 
**Scáthach:**
Gah! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
“Curruid Coinchenn”&ndash;This is one trick I didn't learn from you. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
This Noble Phantasm is the one and only thing that can punch a hole in that gut of yours. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...So you've reached that far, huh? That's enough power to destroy the world. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I bet it is. As things stand, I'll be doing just that. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;Cú Chulainn. That's what I don't understand. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Living and fighting. Those used to be your greatest joys. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Those were the big prerequisites. That is why you lived so beautifully. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Yet why do you insist on being so ugly? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...I'm ugly, yes. Because as far as I've seen, that's what a king is. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...What......Who knew you were such an honest idiot? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Goodbye, Scáthach. We'll probably never meet again. 
 
**C：???:**
Too bad. As a fellow spearman,I would've liked to try fighting him, but&ndash;
 
**C：???:**
I had to prioritize a previous appointment. You alive? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Somehow. Jumping through the gates myself to fling my body to the outsides of the world must've worked. 
 
**Scáthach:**
I've patched up my outward appearance, but that's about it. To put it into perspective, 90% of my organs are destroyed. 
 
**C：???:**
Hm, that's a problem. You can't fight like that. 
 
**Scáthach:**
If we were to fight, it'd be when this era ends. Until then, Shuwen, would you help those guys out? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Which side? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...The North Army. The South Army has Fujimaru, but the North Army doesn't. This is a big difference. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
All right. Then I'll head to the North Army. You stay here, until the era comes to an end. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I'll be sure to come back for you. Whether the era ends, or the world ends. I promise. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
After all, that divine spear has reached a realm beyond human understanding. If you disappear before I fight it, I'll surely go mad. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Suit yourself. How can I refuse so earnest a request? 
 
**Scáthach:**
Fine. I look forward to your return. If you don't mind a cowardly spear that lost to its disciple. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Kaka! I wouldn't count that as a loss. Your objective was different from the start. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Realize the competition of spears has just begun, mistress. Time to see if my divine spear will stand up to a true god. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Well, I suppose I should save the world first, though. Too bad. All I want to do is fight strong opponents...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...but the world is such a hard place to live in. 
 
**Scáthach:**
That is the fate of us Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hahahahaha&mdash;that's for sure. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, yeah. Here they come again. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Wait a second, how many of them are there? They just keep coming! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Did you really clean up 60% of them? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Well yeah, of course. I take my work seriously. It's one of my few redeeming qualities. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Poisoning their food and water, burning, drowning, dropping rocks...Even some treachery amongst them. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I used all sorts of tricks to cut out 60% of them. But there's still many left. Don't you just hate it? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Seriously, what is it with those guys? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Normally when you lose 60% of your troops,morale plummets and retreat is par for the course. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I suppose there is one exception, though...
 
**Robin Hood:**
The case of ridiculously strong leaders being ridiculously tyrannical. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Encore after encore no matter how much I sing...I feel lucky as an idol, but I'm not happy about this! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's just our job this time around. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
How are they doing over there? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Karna was killed in battle. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...I see. That guy was crazy strong, too. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Don't tell Old Man Edison. He'll probably sink into depression. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I figured as much. Is the [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] doing all right? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, they defeated Cú Chulainn, who then retreated. They're marching toward Washington with Rama and the others. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Our tasks remain the same? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Not sure about that. Hey! Old Man Edison! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Should we keep going!? 
 
**Edison:**
Hahahahaha! Of course, sounds good! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Looks like it. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ah, too bad. It's tiresome, but I guess we can give it one more push. 
 
**Edison:**
Direct current is the best! Am I right!? 
 
**Mechanized Infantry:**
Of course, Mr. Presi-king! All hail direct current! Brilliant domination! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Yes, yes, direct current is the best, the best. And now...
 
**Blavatsky:**
&mdash;Behold, the Book of Dzyan in my hand. Light, shine here. Hierarchy in the heavens, Lemuria in the sea. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
And on earth, myself! Old things and new, make everything clear! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Everything seems to be going smoothly...But life never goes so well, does it? 
 
**Edison:**
...Hm. Yes, it'll be here soon, without a doubt. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh, what'll be here? ...Wh-What the...
 
**Beowulf:**
&ndash;Life never goes so well, does it? 
 
**Beowulf:**
...Wait, is this it? A cunning Archer and a scrawny Lancer? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Where are the people who defeated me? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
They're out. And it's “slender,” not scrawny! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, was that a compliment? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Yes, it's a compliment. Cutting us by 60%, just by laying traps.... But with 40% left, victory is ours. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Ugh, I can't stand it. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Crude, insensitive, and shameless. On top of that, muscles, tattoos, and stubble! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Nothing could be more vulgar! That settles it! You take him. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'd like to say “Yeah, sure”&ndash;But I'm afraid I may die without your help. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What a slacker. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
My only talents are long-range combat, killing with poison, and sabotage. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Then go stand behind me and shoot your little arrows. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Bring it on, half-naked man. Having one dragon slayer is more than enough! 
 
**Beowulf:**
I'd appreciate it if you'd at least call me by my True Name, scr...slender Lancer! 
 
**Edison:**
Can you go assist Elisabeth and Robin Hood!? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's impossible. It's taking all I can to hold back the Celts! You little...
 
**Edison:**
...Alas, when it comes to tenacity, we just can't match these Celtic soldiers...How disappointing. 
 
**Edison:**
So these are the limits of mass production...No, not true! It's just that my approach was incorrect! 
 
**Edison:**
I can't lose. I must grasp the glory of success someday! As the one responsible, I must make an effort! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ugh...
 
**Beowulf:**
Hmph! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Bastard! 
 
**Beowulf:**
&ndash;Ha! 
 
**Beowulf:**
Sorry. Despite being a Berserker, I'm not really insane. 
 
**Beowulf:**
If anything, I'm just a little more ferocious. I don't easily lose the techniques I've cultivated. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Damn it, I hate these types...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Eli-Eli and Robin are in trouble. Not good! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
&ndash;Then allow me. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Huh!? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Whoa.... Hey now, who are you? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Just a passing divine spear. My True Name is Li Shuwen. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Hmph. I suppose it's a perk for this job. To be able to fight the famous Beowulf. The highest honor. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Oh? Not one for modesty with a name like “Divine Spear. ” Li Shuwen...Yes, I've heard a lot about you. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Oh, it's just an old nickname. So, what shall we do? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Beowulf. You're the warrior known for killing the monster Grendel with your bare hands. In that case&mdash;
 
**Beowulf:**
Heh, you sure know how to flatter. And who were you, again? 
 
**Beowulf:**
Ah, yes, yes. “No Second Strike,” right? Don't need a second strike! What a claim! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm. How about we put it to the test? We'll see if it's real or an exaggeration. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
What a coincidence, for two Servants who can fight unarmed to meet in this place. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Fate is such an odd thing. 
 
**Beowulf:**
It sure is strange. Which means...
 
**Beowulf:**
...a so-called fistfight? 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I don't know whether these fists will work on you or not. But I think I'd like to give it a try. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Let's see you withstand my Bajiquan! 
 
**Beowulf:**
That's fine. Many winters have passed since my honoring as a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Yet it's hard to forget that feeling...That moment when I beat that guy to death. 
 
**Beowulf:**
And now, a guy who looks even stronger than Grendel is standing before me. 
 
**Beowulf:**
So&ndash;no one would turn down such an opportunity! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Indeed! 
 
**Beowulf:**
One. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Two...
 
**Both:**
Three! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Whoa! A f-fistfight! Is it a fistfight!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
This is so scary! Stop them, Greenie! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
No thanks! Even God couldn't stop a fight like this! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Wow, man, it's hard to believe we're the same species. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
What's with that? Sometimes I don't get how men think at all. 
 
**Edison:**
Oh, come on. Girls box too, don't they? All warriors dream of a fistfight. It's their instinct. 
 
**Edison:**
...Although, being an inventor,I wouldn't know much about it. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Whatever. 
 
**Edison:**
Either way, the only Servant who could ever stand up to Beowulf in a fistfight is him. 
 
**Edison:**
Let's leave Beowulf to Li Shuwen. We should focus on doing what we can. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You're right. But Edison, I...have a bad feeling about this. 
 
**Edison:**
...Your bad feelings are always on the mark. Whatever is to come, let us be prepared. 
 
**Rama:**
All right! Mostly done&ndash;What!? 
 
**Rama:**
Medb's elite soldiers...Shadow Servants! Master, we should handle this! Your orders, please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Rama:**
...All Shadow Servants have been eliminated! 
 
**Mash:**
We're almost at the capital, Washington. Cú Chulainn and Queen Medb should be there. 
 
**Rama:**
Karna and Scáthach are no longer with us. However, we do have our Master...Fujimaru. 
 
**Rama:**
If we concentrate our power, we can defeat them! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you forcing yourself? 
 
**Rama:**
Gah. No, uh...Well, how can I say this...
 
**Rama:**
...To be honest, I don't know if we can win. The difference in power is overwhelming. 
 
**Rama:**
Yet I feel as though we can. I had the same feeling when I faced the Demon King Ravana. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't have to force yourself. 
 
**Rama:**
Hah, I know. I'm not forcing myself. 
 
**Rama:**
I'm still far from my limit&ndash;Even if I reach it, I feel as though I can go further. 
 

---

 
**Rama:**
Hey, Master. 
 
**Rama:**
I feel love for you. Mash and Nightingale, too. 
 
**Rama:**
I love these soldiers, who follow my orders despite my young appearance. 
 
**Rama:**
And I love Sita from the bottom of my heart,as she entrusted me with her life. 
 
**Rama:**
Love makes me want to protect,and love makes me not submit to fear. 
 
**Rama:**
Isn't it simple? 
 
**Rama:**
However, when you think about it&ndash;a hero begins his journey from tiny feelings of that sort. 
 
**Rama:**
This is something I came to understand,after returning to my youth. 
 
**Rama:**
&ndash;Now, let's go! 
 
## Section 21: North American Myth War (Ending) 
 
**Medb:**
They'll be here soon, my king. How's your body? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
The restoration is complete. It'd be a bit troublesome if Arjuna betrayed us, though&ndash;
 
**Medb:**
If the need arises, we could always use “that. ”
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...That's not necessary. I am enough. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Throw everything at the northern front. That'll end the war, and this world. 
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;Right. Oh dear, I guess this is the end of playing queen. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Having fun? 
 
**Medb:**
Yes, very much so. That's why I intend to enjoy it to the very end. 
 
**Medb:**
You aren't having fun, are you, Cú? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I don't know. You can have fun on your own. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
All I need to do is continue being the king you wished for. No matter what happens. 
 
**Medb:**
...Yeah. I love you, Cú. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Is that so? 
 
**Medb:**
Now, let's begin the final battle. 
 
**Medb:**
They'll struggle, and writhe, and try to stand up. All those who glare at us with determination in their eyes. 
 
**Medb:**
We'll crush them under our heels easily. &ndash;Ahh, I'm so excited! 
 
**Rama:**
We're here...
 
**Mash:**
Yes! Master, we're just one step away! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The northern front is fighting well. At this rate, we should somehow&ndash;
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;So you've come. 
 
**Medb:**
Oh dear, I guess those Shadow Servants really weren't good enough. 
 
**Rama:**
You're&ndash;
 
**Nightingale:**
Medb. The queen who brings Celtic heroes into this world. 
 
**Mash:**
So you're...
 
**Medb:**
Your scrap soldiers, or my cute boys&ndash;I wonder which are stronger? 
 
**Rama:**
Sorry, but we don't have time for idle chit chat. We'll be taking you down now. 
 
**Medb:**
I've already calculated it. Your power, my power,my summoned warriors' power, my monsters' power...
 
**Medb:**
...I'll make sure to win. After all, the one that the king trusted with everything was me, the queen! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've confirmed enemy signatures. Analyzing the magical energy wavelengths&mdash;this is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A massive dragonkin! Also&ndash;Chimeras,and even Shadow Servants!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sheesh, she's really going all out! 
 
**Mash:**
It's okay. We won't lose to enemies like that after all we've been through! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, let's go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Medb:**
I guess that wasn't enough to stop you. 
 
**Medb:**
...But I can't afford to lose. Come, Spriggan! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even more of them!? Can Queen Medb really create an infinite number of soldiers!? 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nightingale:**
I would hesitate to call it infinite. 
 
**Nightingale:**
It may be infinite given enough time, but we're defeating them faster than they're being created. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You could say that we're cornering her, both in Magecraft and science. 
 
**Nightingale:**
However&ndash;
 
**Medb:**
&ndash;H-Haha. Hahahahaha! 
 
**Medb:**
...Cornered? ME? Opposite. It's the opposite. 
 
**Medb:**
I'm the one cornering you. Come visit the White House. 
 
**Rama:**
Tch...She's staying out of range. So she knows that “Brahmastra” is a throwing weapon. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Let's go, everyone...Although we may not make it in time. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Make it in time? 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For what? 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
...I don't know, but it seems like they're hiding a secret weapon. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Her smile wasn't because this is too easy for her,nor was it an attempt to mock us. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That was the smile of a predator. 
 
**Nightingale:**
It was an unbearably sadistic smile, made right when she destroys something dear to us. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But it's not towards us. If it was, she would have used the trump card immediately. 
 
**Nightingale:**
In that case&ndash;
 
**Rama:**
Yes, I understand what you're trying to say, Nightingale. However, we must still pursue her. 
 
**Rama:**
Now, we head to the White House! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Beowulf:**
...Ugh! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
&ndash;This is “Stalking Tiger,” a Bajiquan technique. Kung Fu that's been refined through thousands of years. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Like how mere fistfighting evolved into boxing,we developed fights to the death into techniques. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...This nation is the same. It's not something you should stick your hands into. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Heh...Seriously...Dammit, hitting that big Grendel was a lot easier. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Parrying incoming attacks is part of the technique. Try learning some boxing skills before your next summon. 
 
**Beowulf:**
...Hah...Sorry, but I refuse. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Thinking in the middle of a fistfight is like trying to wake yourself from a dream. Isn't it? 
 
**Edison:**
Okay! That should do it...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Mr. Edison...You should hurry and send the troops back. 
 
**Edison:**
Hm? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Just have them retreat! Hurry! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
What, retreat? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hey, we're winning. What's this all of a sudden? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Who knows. You'd probably have to ask Edison to find&ndash;
 
**Robin Hood:**
Wh-What!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Aughhhhhhh! 
 
**Edison:**
C-Calm down! It's just an earthquake, settle down! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
No, this is no mere earthquake! Augh! 
 
**Edison:**
Blavatsky? 
 
**Mash:**
Master. The White House...It's transformed...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What the hell is this!? Are you telling me that this is truly the White House!? 
 
**Rama:**
...Hm. Such extremely poor taste. The original White House was far more beautiful. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Hey. 
 
**Rama:**
...Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Mash:**
Queen Medb! 
 
**Medb:**
Hey, Demi-Servant. Don't utter my name so casually. 
 
**Medb:**
I'm in a bad mood, mind if I kill you? 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Leave this place. Your wickedness is no illness. You were born with it. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'd say you're in good health. Although you're still wicked. 
 
**Medb:**
What? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Stand back, Medb. She's got business with me. 
 
**Medb:**
What are you going to do to Cú? 
 
**Nightingale:**
That goes without saying. I'm a nurse. A nurse must fulfill her duty. 
 
**Medb:**
Huh? With Cú? As a nurse? 
 
**Nightingale:**
In other words, I intend to treat him. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...What a simplistic reason. However, as my enemy, I intend to kill you. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
An enemy is an enemy, even if they're a nurse. It's simple. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Feel free to do as you please. I'll treat you, and you'll kill me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
While contradictory, that's how we should be. One thing to say before combat. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
What? 
 
**Nightingale:**
You are ill. I recommend suicide, or allowing yourself to be defeated. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'm not really one to talk, but you're pretty crazy, aren't you? What you're saying is pretty ridiculous. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;You can't feel joy. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Say that again? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, that's not quite right. It's not that you can't, it's that you don't. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Becoming king didn't stop you from feeling joy. It only sealed your joy away. 
 
**Medb:**
...Shut your mouth, nurse. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You've trapped yourself in a cage, ceding your body to a “system” called a “king. ”
 
**Nightingale:**
Since you feel no joy, you fight automatically and mechanically. If you don't do so, you can't continue being king. 
 
**Medb:**
Didn't I tell you to shut up!? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You talk like you've seen it for yourself. Did we have some sort of connection in our past life? 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, I haven't seen it myself. I simply know, because that's how I used to be. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I cast aside my own humanity,working only to fulfill my goal. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I had to pay a price for that,but I didn't mind. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I was fine being nothing more than a healing machine. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Of course, I can't deny that it's a twisted way of life. Nothing changed from when I was alive, working tenaciously at patient's bedside. 
 
**Nightingale:**
But still, I didn't mind. I simply wanted to help expand to the world, with an iron body and an iron will. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Nightingale:**
The hope for medical treatment. The delight of recovery. These things were needed in the world at the time. 
 
**Nightingale:**
For that, I abandoned everything I had, but I have no regrets! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;So let me ask, king of savages. Is your rule truly necessary? 
 
**Nightingale:**
What prospects for the future do you have? Where do you aim to be, after all is done? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Who knows. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You have nothing. Your deeds are like severe burns. That's why&ndash;you and I are different. 
 
**Nightingale:**
My blood boils, for the sake of dreams. Your blood has grown thick and cold, for the sake of ambition. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is your illness. Allow me to treat you, Cú Chulainn. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Even if I die, I must treat you. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...You done talking? Your lecture was so crazy that I actually couldn't help but listen. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Ill. Ill. Illness, huh? I see, I get it. Pretty fitting. I was used to things like curses and wounds, but&mdash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'd never actually suffered from illness before. This what you'd call “seeing the light,” iron woman. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That must mean this overbearing sense of fatigue is an illness. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
If this body is healed, and this blood is purified, I might return to my senses. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;But that's not possible. I think you're well aware of that. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You know, in this world there are incurable diseases that you can never recover from, right? 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Well then. Here I go! 
 
**Medb:**
...Let's go, Cú! 
 
**Medb:**
I'm Medb, queen of Connacht. I won't lose to people like you! 
 
**Rama:**
I am Rama, king of Kosala. This task was handed down to me, by those who have fallen. 
 
**Rama:**
So long as you threaten to destroy this world&ndash;my fighting spirit, my will shall never falter. 
 
**Rama:**
In the name of my wife Sita,I swear by the name of the god I hold faith in. 
 
**Rama:**
I shall smite thee as an iron hammer. Prepare yourself, Queen Medb! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Rama:**
&ndash;Right there! “Brahmastra! ”
 
**Mash:**
...We did it...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Medb:**
Uh&ndash;Ugh&ndash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Tch. You're in pretty bad shape, Medb. 
 
**Medb:**
Yes, Cú. I feel like I could die at any moment. But I fulfilled my role...
 
**Medb:**
I really, really did it.... Will you praise me? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&mdash;Yeah. You did pretty well. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You defended your nation, as queen. You're a pretty capable woman, when you try. 
 
**Medb:**
...I'm glad. That's all I wanted to hear. 
 
**Medb:**
That was enough to save me. My wish came true. 
 
**Medb:**
You've finally&ndash;become mine. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's this “role? ”

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did you do? 

---

 
**Medb:**
Ahahahaha! Ahahahaha! Don't you know my name? 
 
**Medb:**
I'm Medb! Queen Medb! Don't you know of my greatest work, from my legend? 
 
**Medb:**
The “Clan Calatin! ” A group of warriors to defeat the peerless hero, Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Rama:**
So that's your trump card? Very well then, summon them! 
 
**Medb:**
...Ahaha...That's wrong, so wrong. It's completely different from what you imagine! 
 
**Medb:**
Completely, and totally wrong! 
 
**Nightingale:**
......
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Wait. Is that possible? Should it even be possible!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Heroic Spirit can't possibly come up with something that terrifying! I mean, is it even possible through Magecraft!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Queen Medb! This is something not even Solomon dared try! 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor!? Doctor, what exactly is happening!? 
 
**Mash:**
There's nothing strange here&mdash;
 
**Nightingale:**
The North Army! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right! THAT was summoned on them just now! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't tell me that's...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A Demon God Pillar? 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I've confirmed 28 Demon God Pillars at the northern front! 
 
**Mash:**
...What? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To summon an entire pack of Demon God Pillars by shoving them into the framework of “Clan Calatin! ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's theoretically possible for a wielder of the Holy Grail. It's definitely possible...But a total of 28 of them!? 
 
**Rama:**
Is that really possible!? 
 
**Nightingale:**
Her wish must have been that powerful. More so than any other to date. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;If it was for that man. She would offer any sacrifice. Even her own life. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, the Servants on the northern front! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...What is this!? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's, you know...A major boss. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Why would something like that appear here!? Is our [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] okay!? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...We've received a transmission. It seems they're fine. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
In other words, the enemy sent these here to crush us instead! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...
 
**Beowulf:**
...There's no way to win. It's a whole group of Demon God Pillars. 
 
**Beowulf:**
They aren't something that mere Servants can handle. However, escaping is impossible, too. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Well, this just means we've got to give up. Li Shuwen, they'd be too much even for you. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...As I'd expect. 
 
**Edison:**
...This is the end. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison? 
 
**Edison:**
There's no way to win against this! Look, just look! 
 
**Edison:**
There's 28 of them! 
 
**Edison:**
Even a single one would require multiple Servants to defeat! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison! Calm yourself! You mustn't panic! 
 
**Edison:**
It seems...Justice is defeated...
 
**Blavatsky:**
...
 
**Elisabeth:**
......Hey, lion head. 
 
**Edison:**
...Lion head? Lion...There's no lion here...Oh, you must mean me! Wh-What is it, horned lady? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Well you see&mdash;Quit your whining! 
 
**Edison:**
Aah, my ear!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
It's true that we're in a pinch, in trouble, in a catastrophe! But that [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] trusted us to do this! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
If we can hold out here, we win! If we give up now, the front will collapse, right!? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's right, but these things are on a different level. Would our attacks even be effective? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Even if they aren't effective, it's fine if we just survive! I don't care what anyone says, I won't lose! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
No, I can't stand losing to them! They killed my rival...They killed my friend Nero! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Sure, that's fine, but...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey you&ndash; Get out of the way! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Aaaaah!? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Above you! You've got to look above you! And wipe those tears. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...I-I know that! Let's pull ourselves together and fight, Greenie! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
I've got a name, learn it already! ...So, Old Man Edison? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
What will you do? You can try to run, if you want. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
We can still buy time, if you go now. 
 
**Edison:**
......
 
**Elisabeth:**
Now, bring it on! Clan Calatin! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I, Elisabeth Báthory&ndash;will send you to your death with my hit song! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...You leaving now? 
 
**Medb:**
Yes, I am. I entrust the Grail to you. 
 
**Medb:**
Farewell, Cú Chulainn. May we meet again sometime, somewhere&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
...Cú Chulainn. Are you&ndash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;I've always been one to take the long road. I never had much luck with good women. It never lasted. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
But all the bad women flock to me. Medb was especially tenacious, more so than briar vines...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Sheesh. The moment she becomes good, she disappears looking satisfied. 
 
**Rama:**
He seems a little different? 
 
**Mash:**
...He's more like when we met in Fuyuki...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just slightly, but the magical energy surrounding him has weakened. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The era's ability to correct itself probably strengthened, because the one who wished Cú Chulainn into kingship vanished. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's basically like a 0% chance became 3%...But now there's a possibility! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Listen, you have to defeat Cú Chulainn, before the northern front collapses! That's the last chance to repair this era! 
 
## Section 22: Shielder, Master, Soldier, Nurse 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Okay. Then let's get the killing started. 
 
**Rama:**
Mad King.... Do you intend to hand over the Grail? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Not at all. That was my geis. While Medb may have been a helplessly wicked woman&ndash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
She used a wish granter with the power to dominate an era without hesitation to seize just the heart of one man...Me. 
 
**　:**
&ndash;Very well, this is my wish: To make Cú Chulainn king. A wicked king, enough to rival even me. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
For her, I may have been a toy to discard when she got tired of me, but I should admire her spirit at least. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
That's why I've abandoned all joy, and continue to fight. Now, and forever. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Besides, all of you&mdash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
You've gotten in my way so many times until now. Do you think I'd just let you live? 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Come, brats. What happens when you pick fights with an Ulster warrior&mdash;
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I'll teach you by tearing your bodies to pieces, and crushing your very bones! 
 
**Rama:**
Mash! Master! This is the final battle! Don't back down now! If you let down your guard for even a moment, we'll die! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou! Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
...Let's go! Master, bring us victory! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...
 
**Mash:**
His form...changed!? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It seems the Holy Grail's wish is still driving him. “A better king”&ndash;in his case, “stronger. ”
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's going to attack with even more strength than before! Be careful! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Hah ...Hah ...Hah! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
&ndash;Oh tree of mourning, sharpen your fangs! “Yew Bow! ”
 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh man, this isn't good. It's not working at all! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Manager, give me some water! My throat's all dry! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...By manager, you mean me!? That being said, I do have water! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
I won't lose! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Edison, Mr. Edison. You already know, don't you? 
 
**Edison:**
...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Stand up. Stand, and fight. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Aren't you an American? Aren't you a pioneer who traded the sword for an axe and gun? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
While you believe in the occult,you refused to rely on such powers. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That aspect of you was why I shared a friendship with you&ndash;
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's why everyone followed you. To reject the unknown and dream of the future. That was your greatest merit. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Now, you must&ndash;
 
**Edison:**
......
 
**Elisabeth:**
Ah, oh no! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, lady!? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...???
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? I'm fine? 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;How difficult it truly is to stand up and fight. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's right. It is difficult. 
 
**Edison:**
But one is a hero because one treads past countless despair. 
 
**Edison:**
If I keep forcing such burdens upon such a little lady...I'd be a disgrace to America! 
 
**Edison:**
Hahahaha! I'll show you the heroic figure of the true King of Inventions! “World Faith Domination! ”
 
**Elisabeth:**
...Amazing! 
 
**Edison:**
I know, right? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
With that, my live concert can shine brighter than usual! All glittery! And sparkly! And dragony! 
 
**Edison:**
...I never assumed it would be used like that...
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison has now stood up as well. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
But...Even if all five of us fight,I don't know how many more minutes we can last. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...If only there was something else...Something that would give us an edge...
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
His form...Again! 
 
**Rama:**
We should be wearing him down,but it doesn't feel like that at all! 
 
**Rama:**
As expected of the Child of Light. He might just be the strongest Lancer in the world! 
 
**Rama:**
Still&ndash;we cannot lose. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You need to hurry! The northern front won't hold much longer! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just a reminder. If they lose, America loses! At that point, it's highly likely this era will collapse! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood, Doctor...But...But! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
&ndash;Not enough. This still isn't enough to defeat me! 
 
**Rama:**
We need to do it! Master, please give us your orders! 
 
**Rama:**
We need to trust the guys at the northern front! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Full speed ahead! 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Robin Hood:**
Gah!? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You need healing...Augh! 
 
**Edison:**
Robin Hood! Blavatsky! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Guh...Something of this size is difficult to knock chi into...
 
**Edison:**
No one can go on...I must at least evacuate everyone else&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
What would be the point in that, you idiot!? I-I can...still fight! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Guh...
 
**Edison:**
No, you mustn't move......You can't fight anymore...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Desertion...Treason...Back talk! Those are the things I hate the most...So...
 
**Elisabeth:**
I can...Still fight! 
 
**Edison:**
...Then I have no choice! 
 
**Edison:**
Blavatsky! Take care of them! 
 
**Edison:**
Noble Phantasm overload&ndash;“World Faith Domination! ”
 
**Blavatsky:**
Wait...Self-destruction!? 
 
**Edison:**
Don't stop me! This is the only thing I can think of now! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, stop it, Old Man Edison! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I admire your courage,but you might not even last one minute! 
 
**Edison:**
I don't care! 
 
**Edison:**
I have a duty to protect you&ndash;everyone, for a little while longer! 
 
**Edison:**
Not as the Presi-king of America! Not as King of Inventions! Not even as Thomas Alva Edison! 
 
**Edison:**
But because I am human! 
 
**Edison:**
I have a duty as a human who, in the distant future, will exploit this land and inhabit this nation! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison...You mustn't...
 
**Edison:**
Farewell, my friends. Trust in Fujimaru. 
 
**Edison:**
I'm sure [♂ he /♀ she] will surely lead you to victory&ndash;
 
**Blavatsky:**
Edison! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...
 
**Robin Hood:**
...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Huh...
 
**Edison:**
...What...
 
**H：???:**
&ndash;Hahahahaha! How unsightly! How unsightly of you, Edison! 
 
**H：???:**
You're ordinary after all, unfit to stand before me! Hang your head in shame, and begone immediately! 
 
**Edison:**
...This...This disgusting voice...And this pointless laugh...
 
**Edison:**
D-Don't tell me...You're...
 
**H：???:**
I'll tell you! I am the true genius, the one given the duty of pioneering the stars, I am&mdash;
 
**Edison:**
Hysteric! It's you, Mr. Hysteric&mdash;! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I'm Nikola Tesla! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You're kidding! Nikola Tesla!? 
 
**Edison:**
Guh, nnnnn! To appear at a time like this, as always...
 
**Edison:**
What a man with good timing you are! And you say that you of all people, intend to help me!? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You must be joking! Even if I was summoned a thousand times, I would never help you! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I intend to save this era&ndash;And those whom I owe a debt to. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I caused them a bit of trouble in England, after all. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
That relic from the Age of Gods is destined to disappear, due to the power of electricity I paved the path to. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Edison. Just stand aside and witness the beauty of my grand lightning! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! 
 
**Edison:**
Mmph, that laugh sounds like he's been practicing it every morning in front of a mirror! Such meticulous planning, fit for a genius! 
 
**Edison:**
But don't mess with me, Tesla! In the end, you're nothing more than an eccentric that stood out! 
 
**Edison:**
A true genius is universal! You're not one to talk! You couldn't even find a wife! You stayed single your whole life! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&ndash;Fool. That just means no woman was able to match me. Genius begets a solitary life. You really are an ordinary man. 
 
**Edison:**
I'm not ordinary! I'm a CEO! I'm tired of seeing geniuses! People like Bell! 
 
**Edison:**
A CEO must use geniuses well! You don't even understand that!? Fool! You fool! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Hey. Old Man Edison. Isn't he being really childish right now!? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
&ndash;Yes, yes. Okay, geniuses. It's about time to start dealing with reality. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Even the power of electricity can't defeat these monsters. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Hmph. I wasn't summoned by that strange man to defeat those things. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
That Master is the one fighting, correct? Then, I simply have to keep these monsters sealed away. 
 
**Edison:**
...An electrical cage. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hah. I suppose even an ordinary man would realize it if I gave away these many hints. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Now, out of the way! “System Keraunos! ”
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Feel the power of the thunder and lightning of a new legend! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What!? Maybe I held back too much! 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;Hah! 
 
**Edison:**
You always choke at the very end. That's why people never write decent biographies about you. 
 
**Edison:**
By the way, my biography is distributed globally. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Why you! 
 
**Edison:**
This is true electricity, true thunder! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Tch. 
 
**Edison:**
...Tch. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Fine, we must work together. Of course, since I have the higher power output. Sync with me. 
 
**Edison:**
That much I agree with. All right then. I'll overload it a bit and continuously hit those eerie monsters&ndash;
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Yes. We'll hit them with enough lightning to keep killing an immortal monster until the end of time. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Here goes! 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;Got it. Noble Phantasm&ndash;activate! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Thunder and lighting, descend! 
 
**Edison:**
Bring light to this world that has plunged into darkness! 
 
**Both:**
&ndash;“World Faith Domination! ”&ndash;“System Keraunos! ”
 
**Edison:**
So, what do we do now? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I just told you! Our only duty is to keep those things sealed away! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I hate to admit it, but even among ancient relics that should vanish one day, some items have their uses. 
 
**Edison:**
That's...
 
**Blavatsky:**
I'm observing an enormous amount of Ether! 
 
**Edison:**
What!? What exactly is happening&ndash;
 
**E：???:**
&ndash;Expanding sacred domain. Domain secured. Setting divine punishment enforcement limits. Calculating amount of time needed for magical energy convergence and acceleration. 
 
**E：???:**
&ndash;Countdown. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
It's Arjuna! 
 
**Arjuna:**
Please evacuate at once, if you could. I'll try to keep the range as small as possible, but&ndash;
 
**Arjuna:**
I will sacrifice myself with this attack, after all. I won't be holding back. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...A weapon...From the Age of Gods...A Divine Construct? 
 
**Robin Hood:**
G-Get away! We'll be consumed by it too! 
 
**Arjuna:**
By the rage of Shiva, your life ends here. “Pashupata”&ndash; Take this! 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...You're kidding...He did it? 
 
**Arjuna:**
I hope this is&ndash;enough to atone for my actions. 
 
**Arjuna:**
Karna...How you felt...Now I...finally...
 
**Edison:**
We won...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It would seem so...
 
**Elisabeth:**
We really did it, Robin! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Although I've got mixed feelings, as a fellow Archer. Man, it's a big world out there. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Now that I've finished my duty here,I must hurry and attend to my other business. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Pardon me. 
 
**Edison:**
Hahaha! 
 
**Edison:**
His Noble Phantasm may have dealt the finishing blow, but it was MY electrical skills that contained those giants! 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Cease your delusions, Edison. You were simply backup. Mere support. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It was Nikola Tesla's electricity that sealed those monsters. If I had full power, I could've blown up the whole continent! 
 
**Edison:**
...Hmm, I could argue about that if I wanted to, but...I'm in an extremely good mood right now. 
 
**Edison:**
I'll just leave it at that. Period, times infinity. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What? 
 
**Edison:**
...What? Do you want to fight? 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&ndash;Of course not. I wouldn't lend an ear to the jokes of an ordinary man&ndash;
 
**Edison:**
Oops, my hand slipped. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oops, my electricity slipped. 
 
**Edison:**
...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Um, they've started fighting. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Just leave them. The war's over. They're free to hurt each other however they want. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...Even the articles of William Hearst wouldn't contain such absurd spectacles. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
&ndash;Heh, but those two are both heading down the proper path...
 
**Blavatsky:**
That path just happens to be narrow,so they always end up fighting each other. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
In the past, those who wished to see happiness for others were forced to take up the sword. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
If they didn't rule through violence, no one would know happiness. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...But those two were different. They fought not with swords, but with their intellect. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
In other words, they're proof that humanity slowly progressed&ndash;the fruit of history itself. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Do you understand that, Beowulf? Your side never had a chance of victory from the very start. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
They've brought happiness and fortune to far more people...than your side ever could. 
 
**Beowulf:**
...So it's not an era of strength anymore, huh? How sad. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Perhaps so. To move forward and make progress, something must be lost. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Brilliant tales of heroes vanish,and what's left is mostly bland and uninteresting&ndash;
 
**Blavatsky:**
But these scholars and eccentrics share the same passion of “making a nameless someone happy” and work their hardest to achieve that. 
 
**Beowulf:**
...I see. But for now, you still need some strength like mine, right? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
That's right. Farewell, Beowulf. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Hope you're summoned by Fujimaru next time. 
 
**Beowulf:**
Hahahahaha! Sounds great, that may give me more fun than I had this time! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You, you did it&ndash;! Everyone, we won! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The “Clan Calatin” at the northern front has completely vanished! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And Cú Chulainn's finished as well! 
 
**Mash:**
Confirmed Spirit Origin collapse! Heroic Spirit Cú Chulainn's materialization is fading! 
 
**Rama:**
This is the end, Cú Chulainn! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Tch. Geez, looks like I've lost my touch...
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
...Well. This is the end of the Mad King Cú Chulainn's role. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
However&ndash;before I'm done, I've got to summon the Demon God guarding the Holy Grail. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Good luck, brats. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
O Holy Grail. The ultimate vessel to make wishes come true. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Manifest. Remember. You have joined the 72 Demon Gods! 
 
**Rama:**
There's still more!? Ugh, my Noble Phantasm's has just about run out. 
 
**Rama:**
Cú Chulainn...is far too powerful! 
 
**Mash:**
No way...We're already at the limit of our power! We can't keep fighting consecutive battles like this&mdash;
 
**Nightingale:**
I shall sever all that is poisonous,and all that is harmful&ndash;Nightingale Pledge! 
 
**Rama:**
My wounds! 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;Master, now is the time to save lives. I shall treat your wounds. Everything will be as it was before. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Over, and over, as many times as it takes. To crush the outrageous, to overcome despair. 
 
**Nightingale:**
For that, I offer everything I have. 
 
**Mash:**
Nightingale! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
One of the 72 Demon God Pillars...Rank number 38. The Demon of War, Halphas. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
War will never vanish from this world. Weapons will never disappear from this world. 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
Mortals are fated to continue fighting,turning like screws in an endless cycle. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;No! No! I deny it! I shall shout it tens of thousands of times! 
 
**Nightingale:**
When the lives saved outnumber those lost,the spiral of conflict should eventually cease turning! 
 
**Nightingale:**
No, I'll MAKE it cease. That is my task, as a Servant. 
 
**Nightingale:**
So begone from this world, Demon God. I shall never give up, even if it means a thousand deaths! 
 
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**
I am the one who bestows conflict. You who wish for peace in your hearts...You are unnecessary! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Holy Grail recovery...Mission complete! But...There were too many sacrifices...
 
**Rama:**
What are you saying? We're Servants. We were summoned to fight, and destined to fight for salvation. 
 
**Rama:**
This battle was on an epochal scale. 
 
**Rama:**
Some might regret that they never finish the fight, but none of them run away from it. 
 
**Rama:**
See them off with a smile. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Sigh, I'm tired! France, then Rome, and now America! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Sheesh, you should know when to stop calling for encores. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
You've already been summoned three times!? Why? Is there some sort of demand for virgin girls? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
W-Wh-Who are you calling a virgin!? If you say it again, I'll hit you with my mic, you pervert! 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, yeah. Still, I'd say our Master's pretty good. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
This is the fifth one, right? How many hells have they ventured into...
 
**Elisabeth:**
Yes, although they're still far from my ideal Master&ndash;
 
**Elisabeth:**
But I quite like their spirit,constantly reaching for the stars! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Anyway, Robin. I'll be going first. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, take care. Sigh, I wonder if I'll be called again. 
 
**Robin Hood:**
...Maybe I should study up on effective traps,for every era and location. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Mr. Edison. The world was saved, isn't that wonderful? 
 
**Edison:**
Yes...That's right, this was for the best. 
 
**Edison:**
We are “e pluribus unum. ”Even America cannot stand alone. 
 
**Edison:**
I gave in to despair, and thought only of this nation...That was my first blunder. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I think that's fine. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
In the end, it's because you fought back that you were able to keep this nation safe before they arrived. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
There might be countless mistakes during the process, but finding the correct answer from those is what Edison does best, right? 
 
**Edison:**
...That's right. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&ndash;Hah. Just like an ordinary man of action. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You encounter needless troubles because you rush blindly into challenges without understanding the theories. 
 
**Edison:**
...What, you mean empty theories? Like those of a certain someone. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Huh? 
 
**Edison:**
What? 
 
**Blavatsky:**
You two could at least try to get along when it's time to depart...
 
**Blavatsky:**
...It's about time. Mr. Edison, I'm glad I was able to fight alongside you. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
Mr. Tesla, I recognize you're a genius,but you should learn to fit in with others. 
 
**Blavatsky:**
...I say that, but I suppose you're a genius because you didn't learn to fit in...
 
**Blavatsky:**
It seems difficult to be a genius. 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;Good grief. To think I'd join forces with you of all people to save this nation. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
There are things unthinkable in our lifetimes. That's just what it means to be a Servant, Mr. Ordinary. 
 
**Edison:**
&ndash;Hah. I will be summoned again, and this time&ndash;I will fight for [♂ his /♀ her] sake. 
 
**Edison:**
This time as a proper Servant...along with Karna and Blavatsky. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Hmph. This is as irritating as static electricity. To think my conclusions are the same as an ordinary man's. 
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Yes&mdash;but it's the truth. If opportunity arises, this thunder god shall fight for humanity. Though...
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I'll have no issues if I'm summoned first,but that is something that depends on luck...
 
**Mash:**
Nightingale! 
 
**Nightingale:**
Yes? 
 
**Mash:**
When I was about to fall to my knees,your voice helped me stand again. 
 
**Mash:**
...Thank you very much! 
 
**Nightingale:**
There's no need to thank me. That's how our agreement was originally, anyway. 
 
**Nightingale:**
&ndash;It seems the treatment is complete. We healed the injuries of an entire nation, not just an individual. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, thanks to you. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you. 
 

---

 
**Nightingale:**
While gratitude is unnecessary, I'll accept it respectfully. However, in exchange...
 
**Nightingale:**
Please, allow me to shake your hand, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru. 
 
**Nightingale:**
My secret pleasure was to shake a patient's hand like this when they were discharged from hospital. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course, gladly. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Don't worry, I'll adjust my strength accordingly. Anyway, stay healthy, my Master. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You have a rather cute side. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Cute isn't quite the right expression. Joy of this sort is just good etiquette as a nurse. 
 
**Nightingale:**
...Good grief. To think you're still well enough to make such a bad joke. It seems I've underestimated you, Master. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to interrupt a good scene. With the Holy Grail's recovery, the era correction will begin soon! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Preparations for the Rayshift are complete. It's time to part ways. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This time...there were far too many Servants who had to die for us to get to this point. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
While I know parting is sad and painful, you still emerged victorious. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You can return with pride. That's the greatest respect you can pay them. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes...Anyway, Nightingale,we'll be going now&mdash;
 
**Nightingale:**
Miss Mash. Before that, may I have a word? 
 
**Nightingale:**
My wish is to eliminate hospitals from the world. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That is, adequate medical care being available in every home. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I didn't think that, even after 100 years, it wouldn't have been achieved...
 
**Nightingale:**
But there's one thing I still believe in. That someday, illness will be eradicated completely. 
 
**Nightingale:**
No more patients will die filled with despair and resentment. 
 
**Nightingale:**
I'll no longer have to oversee the final agonizing moments of soldiers that have respected me. 
 
**Nightingale:**
That's why I fought. Both now, and forever into the future. 
 
**Nightingale:**
There's no reason for you to feel any guilt. I did this for my own goals. 
 
**Nightingale:**
You too must continue to live...for yours. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Thank you very much, Chief Nurse. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Miss Mash. Dreams and wishes are different things. 
 
**Nightingale:**
My wish isn't my dream. The moment people classify something as a dream, they misunderstand it as something far away. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Constantly facing reality, understanding the numbers, and fighting thoroughly is what opens a path to one's wishes. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Sobbing must be trampled, resignation must be crushed. &ndash;That is the one and only path that humans can walk. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Master. I have as much trust in you as my kindred spirit, Sidney Herbert. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Please, continue to support Miss Mash. May there always be light along your path. 
 
**Nightingale:**
Farewell. I look forward to the day we meet again. 
 
**Mash:**
...The path to one's wishes...is opened by fighting...
 
**Rama:**
Ahem, it seems I'm the last. Mash, Master...
 
**Rama:**
My wish has not been fulfilled yet, but still...I'm proud of many things that happened during this battle. 
 
**Rama:**
I was able to rescue Sita. In record time, no less. 
 
**Rama:**
But above all, I was able to meet you. I find this bond as precious as Sita and my younger brother Lakshmana. 
 
**Rama:**
If I could become your Servant once again,that would bring me the greatest joy possible. 
 
**Rama:**
Thus, this is the only thing I have to say. &ndash;May we meet again! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. See you again! 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...So it was no good. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...No, that's not true. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...I'm quite surprised. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Taking a lethal wound and still surviving is how a Servant is, and how I am. 
 
**Scáthach:**
All that means is some of the skills I've acquired over my long life have proven useful. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Still, Cú Chulainn really was the strongest. Even though their timing was impeccable...To think they could actually defeat him...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I should say I'm impressed. 
 
**Scáthach:**
Now then, that leaves just one more promise&ndash;
 
**Scáthach:**
Very well, I'll fulfill my agreement. Although, now with the Holy Grail's power gone, this world is correcting itself. 
 
**Scáthach:**
There's time for a single round at most&ndash;
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I don't mind. After fighting with Beowulf,I think a single strike is my limit now. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Your proposition is convenient for me, if anything. 
 
**Scáthach:**
...I see. Although simply vanishing would be less painful, I'd imagine. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
A chance to fight the famed queen of the Land of Shadows? If I miss this chance, it'll probably be gone for eternity. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
I don't mind if it's just a single round. Scáthach, do you happen to know my nickname? 
 
**Scáthach:**
...Yes. Your nickname means that you only need one strike to defeat any opponent. Something that any warrior would admire. 
 
**Scáthach:**
“No Second Strike”&ndash; If so, I shall put everything I have behind this single strike as well. 
 
**Li Shuwen:**
&ndash;Heh. I'd want no less. 
 
**Scáthach:**
&ndash;Very well. 
 
**Both:**
An honest&ndash;
 
**Both:**
Match! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Hey, you managed to pull through again, somehow. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This means the United States of America, a nation essential to history, was successfully established. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any case, good work. We'll secure the Holy Grail that you recovered. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Both of you should go back to your rooms and get some rest. I'll tell you about the next plan later. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood, Doctor. Let's get going to our rooms, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
May I ask something? Many sad things happened on this journey, as always. 
 
**Mash:**
That's why it might be a little&ndash;inappropriate, to say something like this. 
 
**Mash:**
But...I'm having fun. 
 
**Mash:**
Travelling to different parts of the world and eras with you. We meet many people and heroes. 
 
**Mash:**
This time, we went to America, and got to meet regional heroes like Geronimo and Billy...
 
**Mash:**
And we got to witness Nightingale's incredibly strong conviction. 
 
**Mash:**
Putting good and bad aside&ndash;even the enemies we met with possessed vivid personalities, in their own ways. 
 
**Mash:**
...It's amazing. I'm sure no mage could experience such a journey. 
 
**Mash:**
Our journey will never go down in history. It'll be one engraved only within our memories. 
 
**Mash:**
I want to cherish these memories forever and ever.... That's how I feel. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I feel the same. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's cherish them. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, I'll be going now. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, don't lie down right away just because you're tired. 
 
**Mash:**
You should take a shower to relax your body before going to sleep. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup. Good night, see you tomorrow. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You did well, Mash. 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's do our best next time too. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Mash:**
Sen...pai...S-Strange...I can't...stand&mdash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Mash? 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou, fo&mdash;u!
