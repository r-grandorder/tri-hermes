# Robin Hood  
  
## Hunter of the Forest  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh? Robin's buying things from that shop.  
Did you tell him to do that?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, I asked him to guard the area.  
   
**Mash:**   
As expected, Senpai knows exactly what to do with Servants. If there's nothing to do, have them patrol.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I don't remember asking him anything...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then he's just walking around on his own?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, until they're needed they're free to do what they want, but...

**Robin Hood:**   
Those beat up old blades? If you're just gonna give them to the blacksmith I'll take all you've got.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, and a dozen lengths of rope.  
Throw in some rags, too.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Yeah, sure thing. I'm glad you're taking this junk off my hands, but what will you use them for?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Who knows? But junk's got its uses.  
You can put it together into something good.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, this is a nice blanket.  
Didn't think I'd see something like this. I'll take it.  
  
   
**Man:**   
That's an expensive blanket.  
You sleep in your cape, what will you do with it?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
My new boss is a wimp who's not used to camping.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Looks like he's buying a lot.  
Should we talk to him, Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hello Robin, are you buying something?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, Master and Lady Mash.  
Fancy seeing you here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm kind of surprised to see you here Robin...  
It's rare for a Servant to go shopping.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Maybe so. Compared to the other guys, I'm a little plain, right? I feel more at home in places like this.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
But again, this is perfect timing.  
I'm going hunting, want to tag along?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hunting? Is that code for you're going gambling?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What kind of guy do you think I am?  
Not gambling, plain old hunting.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Quietly. Quietly.  
I saw some weird animal tracks around here.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I set some traps over the past few days... Got it!  
Bingo! They fell for it.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
This area up ahead is a blind alley.  
It'll be easy to trap them.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You really did mean hunting...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Of course I did.  
What did you think I was doing?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
They didn't make me a Servant just because I'm good looking. I'm a master hunter.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did you trap?  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Haha, you'll have to find out.  
Something perfect for a growing Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Robin, it's pulling!  
The line is pulling!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
All right, let's do this! This is some rare prey.  
Don't let it escape, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
That was amazing!  
Master, Robin is a master hunter!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Totally agree! Do it again!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's the best! Gimme more!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hahaha, you're a greedy one, huh Master?  
Let's move on to the next trap then.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Quietly, quietly...Oh, this one too.  
Although this is one I hoped they wouldn't trigger.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You hoped they wouldn't trigger?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, unlike the other place, there are signs of people staying here.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
They're pros too, so they've hidden themselves well,  
but... See? 3, 2, 1, 0.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
GYAAAAHHH!  
A trap! A hidden pit!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Scouts, what were you doing? There's spear tips smeared with cow dung on the bottom!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I hear terrible screaming!  
Robin, what was that?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Damn, enemy soldiers!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Damn! Definitely not a bonus character!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
These guys were getting ready to attack the town.  
See? This is important, too.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
If we can get rid of them here, they can't hurt the town and the enemy won't know our location.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Just like they said, scouts are the most basic and critical part of war.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
A bonus is important, but you need basic recon work too. Don't forget that, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yeah. Robin is right!  
This is important too! No, it's more important!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's go, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Damn it! Let's do this, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger&mdash;I'll change my feeling of misplaced hope into rage, Master!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, how brave!  
Let's do this nice and easy. Nice and easy.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew!  
We ended up going around the whole forest.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it paid off, bigtime.  
Not just from the battles, but what Robin did.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He's been protecting the town without them ever knowing, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Robin Hood is a true hero.  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Aww, don't say that.  
I'm not a hero even after death.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aww, you should've just told us.  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'll admit I can be a bit of an oddball.  
But you've got me all wrong, Fujimaru.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I don't even remember the people in town.  
I just protect it because it's a nice place.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm not any different from the soldiers who attack the town. Just different tastes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, what does that mean?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You know, I didn't want to go around crushing kids' dreams. But I may as well say it.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You guys talk about saving humanity, but that stuff's too big for me to really understand.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm a Servant?  
It got to be some kind of mistake.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I was just a murderer with a rebel streak.  
I didn't save anything.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But you saved the villagers.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There are people you saved.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's just how things ended up.  
I fought alone, and the village was safe for a year or two.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sure, I fought the lord's army,  
but that doesn't mean I wanted to save anyone.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You get it? I'm just a thug and a coward.  
So be careful, Master.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
It's dangerous to let your guard down because of my good looks. I'm a coward who'll run if he has to.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Anyway, we're done hunting, so I'll be going.  
Might take a nap in the woods.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Call me if there's a fight.  
It's my job, so I'll do whatever crazy things I have to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He's gone.  
But Robin contradicted himself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He said he protected the town because it was a nice place to be, but he sleeps in the forest.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think he...I think he's keeping his distance from what's truly important to him.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Some guys are like that, Mash.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...It might be too important for him.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What does that mean...  
Hey, why are you smiling like that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you know the answer, please tell me!  
Senpai, Senpaaaai!
