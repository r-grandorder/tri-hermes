# Marie Antoinette  
  
## Queen of Lily and Emperor of Rose  
  
**Marie Antoinette:**   
All together!  
Vive La France♪  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Vive La France♪  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou-foou♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!  
Marie!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this?  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, well.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Vive La France!  
   
**Mash:**   
...You too, Senpai...?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
When the Doctor said he wanted to summon Marie to Chaldea for something&ndash;important,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I thought it might have something to dowith repairing the singularities, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I never thought that "something important"  
was telling her he's a big fan.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Ready, go♪  
Vive La France♪  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou-foou♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!  
Marie, you're the greatest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They are having so much fun, so I'm going to leave them alone for a while.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Vive La France♪  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou-foou♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!  
Marie!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Okay, now we're getting excited♪  
But it would be better with more people.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hey, Doctor.  
Is there a place we can go with more energy and people?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course!  
The Second Singularity, the repairing Rome!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There shouldn't be any enemy Servants, so I can guide you there safely!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
S-Senpai, the Doctor's saying that&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't hurt, can it?  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Really?  
...I guess you're right. It can't hurt.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
MARIE!  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai??  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay!  
I'll get the Rayshift system ready right away!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
My, what a wonderful place&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So this is the ancient Roman Empire, the land that all the nobles of Europe dreamed of.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
The buildings are splendid, and there're so many people!  
And look at all these smiles!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
This is a great place!  
Thank you for bringing me here, Doctor♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not at all. Anything for you, Queen Marie.  
But there was one mistake I made...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You need an operator to perform the Rayshift, which means I have to stay behind...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...This is the biggest mistake of my life.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou-fou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The wars have ended and everyone's full of energy.  
I'm glad&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder if Nero's doing okay.  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure she is.  
Not knowing history, just knowing her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's how it seems to me.  
But I know she's got a lot of trouble ahead...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Should we...not say hello?  
   
**Mash:**   
No. Rome's being restored, so Nero may have no memories of us.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh? Oh?  
I see a splendid palace over there.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's different than the ones in my era.  
The town and palace are both different.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'd like to see what's inside.  
Heheh, let's go take a look!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou♪  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come along, Fou.  
Let's take a tour inside that palace♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, um, Senpai? Marie is heading further and further away. Let's go after her!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hmm, so this is how it looks.  
It looks elegant, but it's also sturdy and strong.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I feel strength within the beauty. Perhaps it comes from the trust and pride toward this country's culture.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We finally caught up...  
I can't believe she just walked right inside the palace.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
As expected of the French Queen.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Amazing, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...  
She passed by the palace guards with just a smile...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She has a noble aura, you could say.  
Like she belongs in any palace.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Her words, her expression, even her smallest movements, they're all so noble that even I might...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If I were a palace guard, I might let her in too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She truly is the last queen of France&ndash;  
Amazing...just amazing...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wish I could have seen her walking through the real Versailles Palace, and smiling by the fountains...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If one of the singularities turns out to be 18th century France, maybe I'll get the chance...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But sadly, the Rayshift system won't let us travel to any location except the singularities.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If only all the other eras hadn't been incinerated...sob...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Huh?  
What's this over here?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Is it a throne? An ancient Roman throne!  
How wonderful!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come here, Fou.  
We'll look at it together!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She ran off again!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's follow her, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai! We'll follow her!  
Oh, she's surprisingly fast!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
(Grin Grin)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
And you are...?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
(Grin Grin)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu. Are you a foreign royal? I sense an intense royal aura about you, though it does not rival my own.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
For you to come before my throne, you must be.  
Umu, I shall allow it.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
But where are you from?  
Seneca said nothing about an audience...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Nice to meet you, Emperor.  
I am Marie.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu.  
I am Emperor Nero Claudius.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oops! We ran into Nero!)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Marie the White Lily Queen, and Nero the Rose Emperor! What a picture! Save an image, Mash!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(R-Right now is not the time!)  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Um, I have a favor to ask of you.  
May I speak?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
What royal family are you from, again...?  
Hmm? What do you wish to ask of me?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That throne&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'd like to sit on the throne of the ancient Roman emperors!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou♪  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Wha&ndash;  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Y-You say you want my throne?  
Does that mean&ndash;you want to become Emperor?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I don't know what family you're from, but you are indeed a bold rebel!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Very well!  
I see I must show you what I'm capable of!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I shall allow it! Pick up your sword!  
If you truly want the throne, seize it by force!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
We emperors have ruled Rome since the time of Romulus! You who oppose us, behold the might of the Emperor!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Wait, Nero&ndash;  
Um, we're not here to fight!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(And Nero is a human from this time period!  
There's no way she can fight a Servant!)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm? Have I met you&ndash;  
somewhere before?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh&ndash;Oh, right. The era is repairing itself, and she's started to forget about us, maybe.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
No, I remember your name at least.  
Mash and Fujimaru, was it?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? She remembers and forgets?  
Maybe she'll remember tomorrow?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
You're with Marie, then?  
Very well! I'll fight you too!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Oddly, the headache I've had all day is gone!  
No one stands a chance against me at full power!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait&ndash;  
Huh? What...What's this...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sensing powerful magical energy from Nero!  
She wasn't a mage in life, though!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
H-Huh? I'm picking it up here too!  
What is this? It's Servant-class!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's going on!?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Uh...? Huh?  
What is it?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah! Queen Marie has no idea what's happening!  
We're about to start a duel with Emperor Nero!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, I see&ndash;  
Good luck and do your best, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're just making us do it?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Let's begin!  
May the thunderous applause echo here!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no stopping her now! Commencing battle&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...S-She's strong.  
How can the human Nero be so strong?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Where is all this energy coming from?  
Did something happen to Emperor Nero?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I'm feeling great today!  
I feel like I could expand our borders tomorrow!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Marie, was it?  
I can't give you the throne, but that was splendid.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I love your beauty. You have the purity that's lacking in Rome. It would be a shame to pluck such a pretty flower.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
You can sit on the throne a little later when no one is here. Tonight, we'll have a banquet!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'm honored, Emperor!  
Right, Fou?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou really likes her...  
A-Anyway, I'm glad neither of them died.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...They're friends now, too.  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're gonna eat tonight!  
   
**Mash:**   
We did use a ton of magical energy.  
I want you to fill yourself up, Senpai.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm so jealous... You guys get to join a banquet,  
and all I get to do is watch...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hehe, we'll bring back presents, so don't be sad Doctor.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Queen Marie!  
Oh, Vive La France!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Vive La France♪  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou-foou♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!  
Marie!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm? What's this?  
I don't know, but I'll join in! Vive La Rome!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou-foou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
  
## The Fragile Lily  
  
**Mash:**   
Where...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Where is this place?  
I think I was resting at Chaldea...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was trying to...  
sleep in my room, I think...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;That's right.  
You were all asleep.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So sleepy...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? Marie?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You're both awake, then.  
Good morning♪  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
However, you both are actually still asleep.  
So am I, more precisely.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Your bodies are dreaming, but your minds are with me.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So you can't hear the Doctor here.  
You can't contact Chaldea.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You understand what I'm saying now, don't you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're dreaming...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The records say that a Servant and Master can share memories in their dreams.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But this...  
For us to recognize each other&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's because Chaldea's summoning system is slightly different than normal summons.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's what happened.  
Or perhaps,  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
"You" are the only one dreaming, and the others are just characters in your dreams.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Which means&ndash;  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
???  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The dream of the butterfly, right?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I wonder.  
Who's the dreamer, and who's the dream?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But there's one thing I do know.  
Especially for me.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
This is...  
The place I must walk.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The place you must walk...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
This is my Temple.  
Not the real one, of course.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Tour du Temple&ndash;  
The place where Marie Antoinette awaited execution.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then this is your mental landscape?  
This space, no, this place.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's what it looks like to me.  
How does it look to you?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If my memories are reaching you, then it must look the same to you. Otherwise, perhaps you're seeing   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
the closest place to it in your own memories.  
Heheh, don't get scared, okay?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's all right.  
I'll be sure to lead you to the exit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That means we need to find a way to escape, doesn't it?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. &ndash;I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
These are my memories. What was once in my heart.  
A world where I waited for death, with no escape.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But you two are different.  
And so I can get you out.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's escape.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go together.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come, let's go.  
To the outside. To your real world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's a labyrinth, isn't it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I don't really feel lost.  
Is this your doing?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes.  
Because you two are here.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I don't know if I could escape on my own.  
These are my memories of sorrow and misery.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But you are here for me.  
I'm connected to you as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And so I won't lose my way.  
I'll make it to the exit&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Wait.  
Multiple presences detected ahead.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Magical energy responses?  
Wait, these aren't from living creatures.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Though I don't know if you can feel magical energy in a dream.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
This is what I once felt.  
It's fear, death, and of course, sadness.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...It's all right.  
We can win.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get ready, Mash.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's break through.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master.  
&ndash;Moving to engage enemies!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...We defeated them!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good thing the summoning system was working.  
It must be because it's linked to your existence.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Whew! We made it.  
There's no way that we'll lose.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I was sad when I was here, but I never gave in to despair.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Even if I died, even if my husband the King died, even if my beloved children died...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Marie&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Even if the people forget the royal family's white lilies, France will be eternal.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's what I believed.  
I believed that this was necessary for France.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's why "giving up" is the one thing I didn't do.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It may change form, but France is eternal.  
The white lilies of glory shall never fade.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Vive La France!  
Glory to our nation, France!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
...What a joke.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
That's nothing but self-deception. The foolish lies of a foolish queen, killed by her foolish people.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
The man you loved was killed. Your children were killed.  
And yet, Vive La France? Really?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
You're a liar.  
Tell them what you really think, why don't you?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
You want France, and its foolish people who trampled on your royal white lilies, to die.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...  
A Servant? No&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Another Marie?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A Shadow Servant?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The presence is almost identical.  
If this is really a dream, then...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, Mash is right.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Both of us are real.  
Both of us are me.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I am the "Marie" who never gave up.  
She is the "Marie" that did.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I am the "Marie" who decided to regret nothing.  
She is the "Marie" who sorrows, rages, and curses.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Both of us...are me.  
Neither is a fake.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
No, no.  
You're a fake, Marie.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
I'm the real Marie Antoinette. A foolish queen who broke her heart trying to save her people, and was betrayed!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
My curse upon France!  
May it suffer a millennia of starvation and war!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
May it be crushed&ndash;  
Under the wheels of endless revolution!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Maybe it's because this place is special, but I can feel her rage.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a burning torrent of emotion, as sharp as a knife.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She carried this inside of her...  
And she still always smiled at us&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Pathetic, aren't "I?"  
How could I forget smiles and love?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
No matter how much I am hurt, or hated, I can never stop smiling.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Shouldn't that be the duty of a Queen?  
No matter what my end was&ndash;  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Say, why don't we stay dazzling?  
Let's smile at everyone, every nation, and the world.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That is the "Marie" who decided to leave her mother and become the White Lily of France.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's why...  
I will not accept you.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
How dare you, Marie Antoinette! In that case,  
I will make you succumb to me, and I shall rise!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
They want to incinerate the world?  
Fine! Let them!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
The people, the country, the world that stole my life and the lives of the people I loved!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
Let it all be destroyed, with no records or memories left!  
The guillotine is too good for it!  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;I can't bear to listen to this anymore.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Your cries are my cries, but I don't want to hear them.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Come Fujimaru.  
Tell me what to do, my "Master."  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're leaving this place!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Defeat her and press on!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oui. &ndash;Let's do this, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Marie!  
Master, let's go&ndash;Commencing anti-Servant combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
...Hmm, I see.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
So you're fine with this.  
After the way you were betrayed.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
And you're still smiling?  
I see...  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
...That's really who I am, isn't it?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette?:**  
Vive La France.  
The exit is just up ahead...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...The enemy Servant has vanished.  
The battle has ended.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Thank you, both of you.  
Sorry to get you caught up in this.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But I feel just a little better. You got the chance to see me do something besides smile.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now I have nothing left to keep from you.  
And I can go back to smiling and loving.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Vive La France, my Queen.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, Vive La France!  
Come on, let's go.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If you happen to remember this dream&ndash;  
After you wake up.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Please don't tell the Doctor or Fou, all right?  
Promise me?  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If at all possible, I only want those two to see me smiling.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Of course, Marie.  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Heheh♪ I'm counting on you!
