# Henry Jekyll & Hyde  
  
## Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...I'm feeling pretty good.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I finally took control of "Hyde" at last.  
It's all thanks to you, I should say.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Let me say thank you from my heart.  
I might finally be liberated from my own karma.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well, I don't know.  
You don't look like you are about to be liberated.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That bloodstain worries me...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, yes... Let's see... Senpai...  
When he says he might be liberated...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It might mean a liberation reaffirming violence...  
don't you feel... it can, be taken, that way...?  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Actually, Sorry I had you bring me all the way to London, the Fourth Singularity.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I'm grateful to you guys.  
Ascension, was it? It was truly amazing.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I'm impressed that it could turn me, nothing more than a failed mage, into such a powerful Servant.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Besides, as you can see... I got a chance to come to London, though the Demonic Fog still remains.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since the Holy Grail was removed,  
London is undergoing correction to its original era&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what brought you here?  
You just wanted to visit your homeland, is that it?  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Huh?  
Sure, something like that.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Mash, you are quite perceptive.  
Yes, I wanted to see my "homeland" firsthand.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I'm glad you understand me.  
You're "lovely," Mash Kyrielight.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A-A love confession!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I don't think so. He seems&mdash;  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Oh, I love you, London! Of course I love you, sky!  
Gas lamp! I love you very much!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As you see, his love spreads very wide.  
But it is exactly as we predicted beforehand...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I'm sorry for interrupting when you are hyped up,  
but there's a bit of Demonic Fog left&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You guys might hinder the phenomenon called Correction of the Era by being there. Yeah, who knows what might happen?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Isn't it time for us to go back?  
Can I prepare for Rayshift?  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...I'm sorry, but will you wait just a little?  
There is a place I want to visit.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
You guys saw "me" once before, right? In this era, in this foggy city, seeking the Fourth Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean, we saw you in your lifetime.  
Yes, you did help us a lot.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you remember?  
About when you saved London with us&mdash;  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Sure, mostly.  
Anyway, you know...  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...I want to see for myself.  
This apartment where I supposedly lived.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
If possible, I wish to talk to myself in my lifetime, too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I get it. But, you should know that Mr. Jekyll may no longer be there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This era is being corrected. He may already have returned to the time he's supposed to live in.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Even if so...  
I still wish to visit. May I?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you could see him...  
Would there be anything you should do?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that why you came to this era?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Face yourself, huh.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes, I have something to tell him. That no matter what happens in the future, he can definitely overcome it.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
At least I overcame "Hyde" by killing myself.  
So, I hope that I can just...  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...give my past self a piece of advice. It can even be something short like "Be brave and face yourself."  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I know it's merely self-satisfaction. Whatever I say will probably be erased in the Correction of the Era.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
And yet...  
I wish to tell him...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, if that's the case&mdash;  
Hmm, Is it okay? Is something like this okay?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course, it won't cause something like a time paradox, but Hmm. Hmm.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!!  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
...So you came to me?  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
I understand most of the situation.  
At any rate, it's great to see you guys again like this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pleasure is ours.  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Saber and the Heroic Spirits...  
are all gone. No, I am fully aware of that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, you rather seem different?  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
You&mdash;think?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Me, too, it's good to see you again,  
Mr. Henry Jekyll.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
I'm glad to know you're doing great.  
And, well, whom I see over there is my&mdash;  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
"Your future self."  
Just think that way for now.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
"I thought so."  
I take it you understood the basic gist at a glance.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
In that case, I suppose you also know what I'm trying to do, Mr. Henry Jekyll?  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Surely.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Haha&mdash;Then, can you die for me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-What!? What's going on there!?  
He just jumped on Mr. Jekyll, didn't he!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He did, Doctor.  
He...tried to murder himself from his lifetime!  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Haha...  
That's right, I wish...  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
&mdash;No, you listen to me!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
I wanna kill me, or "Jekyll"... Who's lived his goody-goody life from the day he was born!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
Honesty, trust, goodwill!  
I don't need that kind of crap!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
You hear me?  
I can't stand the fact that you exist!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
I will kill you!  
And I will be the complete "Hyde!"  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm positive he's an anti-hero!  
Wait, he is, right? A-at any rate, we must stop him!  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Well, it's okay.  
I've always wanted to fight seriously with him once.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Jekyll?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're reckless to battle a Heroic Spirit!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You want to kill yourself?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
I'm not losing my mind.  
And, I'm not a powerless human failure of a mage, either.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
I am a "Heroic Spirit." I'm one of the lost Servants materialized from the remains of Demonic Fog.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
I was summoned after you returned to Chaldea, and the living Jekyll returned to his original era&mdash;that's the story.  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Somehow I had a feeling that a thing like this could happen&mdash;  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
So I was waiting. Right in this room,  
right after my living self returned to the original era.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Two identical Heroic Spirits are in the same place!?  
Could this really...happen?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a second. I see. Maybe his spirit "has completely separated personalities?"  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
Damn, damn, damn!  
Shoot, I did all this for nothing!!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
Finally!  
I thought I could finally kill "Jekyll"!  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
You should read Wells.  
Though his books were published after we died.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
The rank system of Heroic Spirits may be something that transcends such a notion, but it's fine&mdash;  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Fujimaru, Mash.  
Can you fight with him against me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean&mdash;  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
If he's like that,  
he could be dangerous to get along as your ally, right?  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
So, I think I should make him learn his lesson now.  
For the future.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It makes sense!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
Fine. Fine, you bastard!  
I'll be happy to play your game, even by myself!  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
Goddamnit&mdash;  
I'm going to take all my pent-up anger out on you!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!  
What are we going to do now...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whatever happens happens!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We just do the best we can!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes, Master!  
Servant battle&mdash;commencing!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Past Jekyll:**   
...Whew. Your combat power is as quite good as I expected. Well done.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Well, I'll be going now.  
I'm sure he learned what his limit was after all.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Nothing will do you good to be overcome by "Hyde."  
Don't forget your original purpose, "myself."  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Are you going to live a life that would shame Tatsumi?  
Think a little, and you'd have figured that out.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Mash, Fujimaru.  
Give my regards to Saber and Fran if you see them.  
  
   
**Past Jekyll:**   
Good-bye&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Servant Jekyll is gone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We got the results of the observation.  
It shows that his existence itself was unstable.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Demonic Fog remaining in London is not perfect, either, so it wasn't a proper summon or materialization.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He would have disappeared by himself sometime soon anyway. So, um&mdash;  
  
   
**Hyde:**   
...Humph.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
That killed the mood.  
I should probably leave it at that, too.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
That part of "me" looked happy when he disappeared.  
What the hell was that "learning his limit."  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...Oh my.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oh&mdash;)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Senpai. Compared to before, he seems...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A bit more obedient.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Calmed down?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(...Yes)  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I'll return to Chaldea.  
Pardon me for getting you in trouble, Master.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's true I acknowledge that I am also "Hyde." but it wouldn't do any good if my thoughts become too hasty.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...It will, ah, never allow me to achieve anything.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Someday I will resume my battle to control "Hyde" myself. I'm truly sorry, Master, Mash.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I should take no more detour and start correcting the world now.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...I'll challenge myself to a rematch afterwards.
