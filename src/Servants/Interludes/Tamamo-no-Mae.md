# Tamamo-no-Mae

## E-Pal Wars

**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Master, where are you?
Your Caster's looking for you!

 
**Mash:**
That's... Tamamo, isn't it?
What's gotten into her?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh Master, there you are.
I've been looking for you.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Let's get going, then!
Come on, come on! This way! Come on!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where are we going?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um, you're a little too close.
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We're going, of course, to our...
H O N E Y M O O N♡

 
**Mash:**
Oh, so that's all it was...
What!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mmm! Blue skies! Sandy beaches!
And a clear blue sea as far as the eye can see!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's the perfect day for a honeymoon,
isn't it Master?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...That said. (Glance)

 
**Mash:**
...(Hmph)

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, one or two tag-alongs shouldn't bother us too much.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, how about something to drink?
D A R L I N G♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I really don't want to know,
but how did this happen?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I mean, I really, really don't want to know.
Actually, just forget it.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Too bad, here's how it happened! Listen up. Yesterday,
I got a message from Kiyohime, my texting buddy.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I just went on a date with my Master,
who is also my lover.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A lover's tryst, you could say. A lover's tryst.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
"So, how are things with your Master, Tamamo...
Oh. (gotcha.) Anyway, I'll text again sometime♪"

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Can you believe she sent that!? What the hell was
(gotcha.)? What is she saying she got!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Kids these days... Even Osakabe-hime, who never leaves her room...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Is going on "chat dates!"

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
At this point, I have no choice but to act!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So I'm sending selfies of me and my Master being lovey-dovey, just to show the two of them who's boss...

 
**Mash:**
So... It doesn't have to be with Senpai, does it?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. She just wants to brag that she's getting along well with her Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Caster, you're toying with me?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Caster, let's end our contract...
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, no! No! Not at all!
It's true that I've sworn my soul to another.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Even though I don't quite remember what that person was like, or even which dimension did I encountered them in.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But that's different!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I respect Fujimaru for making a contract with an Anti-Hero like me, and with no complaints!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I've seduced countless men and committed countless sins. But if I feel this one's the one, I'll serve with my whole spirit&mdash;

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That is my true nature as Tamamo-no-Mae, the Caster!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Okay, so maybe "honeymoon" was going too far,
but maybe you can at least call it a vacation? Maybe? Tee hee hee!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to interrupt, but we have enemies.
Looks like this is a Lamia spawning ground.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It looks like you're surrounded?
What? Your discussion's more important? Sorry.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Why now, of all times!?
Geez, this is just great.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Now I feel awkward, like when you run into an old friend and you find out she's married and has children now...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...I'm going to take it out on these...
What were they? Lamias?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, fine. I'll join you!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, I know how you feel.
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That's my Master!
I'm even more in love with you now!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Now that we're both on the same page,
excuse me while I give a little speech.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I will come to your aid whether you ask for it or not!
The reliable Shrine Maiden Fox, Casko-chan, now descends upon the tropical seas!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Wow, it sure is nice to relax in a mountain inn,
isn't it, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure is.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I want to relax...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
What's going on here...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't ask me. No idea...

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So Master...
Oh who is it, at a time like this...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, a message from Kiyohime?
What does it say...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
"Today I went shopping with my Master, who is also my husband."

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
"We went to a famous French clothing store... Oh, what was its name? Anyway, there my Master bought me some Western-style clothes."

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
"I get so put on the spot by things like this. So Tamamo, do you... Oh. (Gotcha.)"

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
"Anyway, I'll text again sometime. -from France with love- Your Kiyohime"

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This again! I'm asking you, what the hell is this?
What the hell is this, this (Gotcha.)?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
In the first place, I'm sure her partner is being tricked!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not Kiyohime?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The partner is!?
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes. It's not polite to say, but unlike me,
Kiyohime can get the weirdest ideas in her head.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Tendencies for love at first sight aside, she often creates relationships in her mind without talking to the men involved.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Her imagination when it comes to these things could put virtual reality to shame. Every relationship she imagines already has marriage on the horizon.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Ultimately she traps the guy inside a bell and burns him to death. That's how she is, so I worry about her partner...

 
**Mash:**
...Oh, I should've brought us lunches or something.

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I hate to interrupt, but I'm picking up something...
Yeah. It looks like we're in wyvern territory.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Again? Jeez, I just want to make some memories with my Master. Why do they keep interrupting?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This isn't fair!
My texting buddy does this to me every single day!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Her texts always sound so happy!
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me neither.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
ME NEITHER!
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Wyverns, flying lizards, I don't know what you are...
But how I feel on all those Sundays...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
The feeling that I should do something meaningful but ends up on the couch, getting nothing done...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Then after a bath, realizing I'm already getting into bed...
That dismal feeling...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'LL TAKE THEM ALL OUT ON YOU!

 
**Mash:**
...I'm actually feeling the same way.
Oh, Senpai! I was joking! I-I'll do my best!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Dr. Roman:**
Well, I'm glad you two had fun yesterday...

 
**Mash:**
What exactly was all that, anyway?

 
**Fou:**
Fooouu...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, Master!
Trouble! Big trouble!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Another text message?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Now what is it? Did Osakabe-hime ask you on a double date or something?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No, she's, you know,
in the middle of a very cute internet romance.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
The problem is the active one, Kiyohime.
It seems, um... she got&ndash;dumped.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes, apparently she got mad and started setting everything on fire.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I wanted to ignore it, but you know,
she's a dear friend.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We'd both promised to enroll in that cooking class held by Benienma from Severed-Tongue Sparrow, you see.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So out of my deep compassion and love,
I think Master and I need to stop her!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's a friend's job to be supportive at times like this, right?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
&ndash;Though I've never met her in person.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So come on! Come on! Come! Come!
With the deep bonds between us,

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
we shall heal poor Kiyohime's wounded heart!
No ulterior motives, of course!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, the shield girl is welcome too,
I suppose...

 
**Mash:**
I'll pass.
Senpai, please try to avoid being burned to death, okay?


## Nine-tailed Fox

**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy type is a demon!
Be careful, the readings are off the chart!

 
**Fou:**
Fou-foou!

 
**Mash:**
Roger. Let's go, Master!
You be careful too, Tamamo!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Right, right.
Sure thing, Shieldy!

 
**Mash:**
Shieldy!?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew... That was tough.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...Is something wrong, Tamamo?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh no, it's nothing!
Come on, let's finish off the last of them!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
???
 


---

**--ARROW--:**

**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
...Oh, that's Tamamo.
What's she doing in a place like this?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Sigh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why the sigh?
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Master... I'm sorry.
You've caught me at an embarrassing moment.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Actually... No, I'm sure you've already noticed. It's about my body.

 
**Mash:**
Your body?
W-What does she mean, Senpai!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
C-Calm down!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Deep breaths, deep breaths...
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'm sure even Shieldy's noticed,
but lately, I've been slowing you down.

 
**Mash:**
What did you do, Senpai?!
...Wait, slowing us down? You, Tamamo?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Indeed... You see, for some reason, I cannot fully use my powers.

 
**Mash:**
It doesn't feel like you're holding back...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No, I can feel that I am.
It's my body, after all.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A long time ago, you see, I had nine fluffy tails and would go around...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...causing havoc everywhere.
The follies of youth, you understand&ndash;

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'll spare you the details, but eventually I became deeply, deeply repentant.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I sealed away eight of my evil tails...
and became a weak, one-tailed fox.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The famous story of the nine-tailed fox. I've never heard that she lost her tails, though.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'd like to be stronger so that I can be of use to you, Master, but...

 
**Mash:**
Is there a problem?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes, when I get stronger, I get more tails. But you see...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
When I get more tails, I become a very different sort of creature than I am now...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes, I kind of... I become a great demon strong enough to destroy the multiverse.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You get that strong?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes. Understand that this isn't an exaggeration. I become a great demon...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...that is an avatar of the apocalypse itself.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But should I care?
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
The thought of you seeing me like that makes me scared to grow more tails...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But if I can't be useful to you, I'm just a fluffy fox, shrine maiden...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...and the cause of this Holy Grail War is a threat enough to rival my nine-tail self...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'm not sure what to do.

 
**Mash:**
A battle with your past, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry guys. I hate to interrupt, but there's another monster... A big one!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's bigger than that demon enemy!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, leave this to me and get Tamamo!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
If I could get back at least one more tail, that monster would be nothing...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Aah, I hate myself for having so much hidden power!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even with more tails, aren't you still Tamamo?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Really, it doesn't bother me.
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I know, I know...
You're just about to get sick of m... MIKON!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
M-Master!?
W-What did you say?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Seriously, I don't care.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You'll always be Tamamo.
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
What!? So Master, even if I get all nine tails back, and even if I think...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
“Wow, this is ridiculous,” you'll still treat me like you did before?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yup.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah.
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I can't believe it! I came to this world by pure chance, and to think the Master I've contracted with out of some sense of fate...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...Would possess such a handsome soul! Oh, but it's not as good as the man I'm destined to be with.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Okay, now I'm really fired up!
I'm even more serious about this! Yeah!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Even if something terrible happens, you can quell my negative energy, scold me, and exorcise me!

 
**Mash:**
...U-Um, so what exactly are you doing?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Shieldy, I'm sorry for worrying you!
From this moment, I am reborn&mdash;

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A reborn Tamamo-no-Mae! That's right! I am the New Tamamotchi, at your service!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Come, come, come, come, come, Master! Come watch the cute little Casko-chan's big moment on stage!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
&ndash;Come now! Those afar, hear my sound! Those nearby, be charmed!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I am the guardian of the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, the bearer of luck from the Kunluns!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A mirror of water reflecting the golden sun's rays!
Behold the Eightfold Blessing!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mmm! Tamamo W I N S!I feel so good! So good!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't have more tails, do you?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you power up somewhere?
 


---
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, my tails?That's right... To get another tail back...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I need another 500 billion experience points or so?
So I'll just have one for now.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Then all that stuff about you growing your tails back...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, I'm just a worrywart, you know?I'm the type who worries about the future.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But I'm okay now.With my Master's trust, I'm invincible.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Honestly, I didn't see anything different between that last battle and the one before it...

 
**Mash:**
That's right... What was all that stuff she was talking about?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They do say the mind rules the body, right?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This fleeting world is but a moment's dream, just as the lives of men are but morning dew...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But my contract with you is firmer than the Sesshouseki. I will serve you with all my soul, Master!
