# Aśvatthāman

## After the Rage

**Narration:**
Anger swells up, explodes, and settles.

**Narration:**
It's a lot like a bomb, or a flash of light.

**Narration:**
Anger is by no means a negative emotion.

**Narration:**
Everyone has the right to get angry at
things like injustice, oppression, and malice.

**Narration:**
But, all that being said...

**Narration:**
...do I still have a right to get angry?

**Tristan:**
Hmm, I see.

**Tristan:**
Speaking as an outsider, I would say that,
while getting angry is every person's right...

**Tristan:**
...taking out anger you've held onto from life on third parties who had nothing to do with it seems wrong to me.

**Narration:**

Exactly.

**Narration:**

My anger comes from the injustice I witnessed
back when I was alive.

**Narration:**

And I can't shake the idea that it's wrong to take it out on others, even if they're enemies.

**Chiron:**
If there is a significant difference in combat prowess between when you are angry and when you are not, then that is certainly an issue.

**Narration:**

Good question. I guess being angry
might make fighting a little easier for me.

**Chiron:**
In that case, it would most likely behoove you to remain angry during battle.

**Chiron:**
That being said, if this anger is having
a negative affect on your mind...

**Chiron:**
...then we cannot simply ignore it.
I suspect Master feels the same way.

**Narration:**
Yeah... That's true.
I nod along in agreement.

**Chiron:**
Anger and rage are necessary emotions for anyone.
We Servants are no exception.

**Chiron:**
Indeed, I'm sure that some heroes were only summoned here due to feats that were driven by righteous anger.

**Chiron:**
However, anger also requires fuel.

**Chiron:**
It costs both physical and mental energy to be angry.

**Chiron:**
So it is surprisingly difficult to remain in a
perpetual state of either anger or grief.

**Chiron:**
Is that not the case for you?

**Narration:**

I cock my head and think about Chiron's question.

**Narration:**

He's right. It is difficult to stay perpetually angry.

**Narration:**

But for some reason, I still have plenty of anger to go around.

**Chiron:**
Hmmm.
What about the strain it puts on your mind?

**Narration:**

...I don't know.

**Tristan:**
You don't know?

**Tristan:**
So you have no idea whether your anger
puts any strain on you whatsoever?

**Narration:**

I nod.

**Narration:**
This emotion&ndash;this burning, all-consuming rage&ndash;has never been a burden.

**Narration:**

If anything, it's only given me energy to spare.

**Narration:**

It keeps my mind constantly elated, to the point where I don't even realize I'm tired.

**Chiron:**
Very good. In that case...

**Chiron:**
I think we'd better talk to Master.

**Aśvatthāman:**
So now, I need your advice!
What should I do? Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You three make, um...quite the combination.

**Chiron:**
Hahaha, I suppose we do.

**Chiron:**
We may all be Archers, but we come from very different times, regions, and cultures, to say the least.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I feel like I'm looking at RGB personified.

**Tristan:**
As in red, green, and blue?
...Yes, I suppose I can see that.

**Tristan:**
I guess I must be green, Chiron blue,
and Aśvatthāman red.

**Tristan:**
Though it's still hard to say as to whether we complement each other or not.

---

**Mash:**
I see...

**Aśvatthāman:**
It's not healthy for me to always be angry all the time.
That makes sense.

**Aśvatthāman:**
But right now, I can't do anything unless I'm angry.
At least, I think so.

**Mash:**
But, um, aren't we talking normally now, without you being angry?

**Aśvatthāman:**
I can keep it in check for a little bit.

**Aśvatthāman:**
But that's not the same thing as getting rid of it completely, right?

**Chiron:**
Besides, we wouldn't be here asking for help if this issue could be managed by simply having him keep it in check.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Exactly.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you want to keep your anger in check?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Well, I definitely want to do something about it before I end up making trouble for someone...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So you wouldn't rather just stay the way you are?

**Aśvatthāman:**
I don't think this is a good way to be.
It's not natural to be angry all the time.

---

**Mash:**
Maybe you should talk to Pārvatī.
She might have a good idea.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Ulp.

**Aśvatthāman:**
...Sorry, Mash, but I'd really rather not do that.

**Aśvatthāman:**
It's like, uh... How can I put this...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You don't want to ask your mom for help now that you're grown up?

**Chiron:**
Hahaha. That's certainly one apt way to put it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't want to worry her?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Basically.
Please, I'm begging you here!

---

**Mash:**
Keeping anger in check...
What about facilitated relaxation?

**Mash:**
You could try forest therapy to calm your mind, get a massage to relieve the tension in your muscles... I've heard things like that can work wonders for relaxing!

**Aśvatthāman:**
I got no idea what the hell forest therapy's supposed to be... But okay, let's give 'em a shot!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right, let's do it!

---

**Chiron:**
I think I will come with you then. What about you, Tristan? Will you be joining us as well?

**Tristan:**
Forest therapy... I like the sound of that.
I was just thinking I could use a good nap.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No sleeping during therapy.

---

**Tristan:**
Yes, Master.

**Mash:**
Okay then, I'll go get the simulator ready!

**Narration:**
Forest therapy.

**Narration:**
They say it's a kind of, well, therapeutic treatment that involves going into a woods to relax.

**Narration:**
Apparently, it's all 'cause of things like phytoncides and air quality and a change of environment and such.

**Narration:**
Well, if nothing else, it ought to be good for the mind.

**Narration:**
Except...

**Narration:**
...it doesn't seem to work that well in dense South American jungles.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Frick, it's hot here.

**Mash:**
I'm sorry. I think I got one of the settings wrong...

**Tristan:**
So much for taking a nap.

**Tristan:**
Hehe. Now that I take a closer look, I can see there are all sorts of insects happily buzzing about the air here.

**Tristan:**
Well, I can't actually see them, since I'm too scared of bugs to open my eyes, but I can still sense them.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're scared of bugs!?

---

**Tristan:**
Yes. I've always hated bugs. They just look much too much like fairies for my liking. That, and vampiric horses...

**Chiron:**
Oh? I'll have you know that some insects are actually very nutritious. They're essential eating when it comes to wilderness survival.

**Tristan:**
What? You mean some people have to eat bugs to survive? I can't even imagine it... So I won't. I'm just going to pretend I never heard that...

**Chiron:**
I see. Well, you certainly don't HAVE to eat them, especially if you have access to meat, fruit, and veggies.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Never mind that.
What do we do about this?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Forget about relaxing! All this heat and humidity's only cranking up my anger energy!

**Aśvatthāman:**
Good, perfect timing! Sorry guy, but like it or not, I'm taking my anger out on you!

**Chiron:**
Here, let us help.

**Mash:**
A-all right! Initiating simulation battle!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Aśvatthāman:**
Eat this!

**Aśvatthāman:**
Dammit. I thought that might help
get my anger under control...

**Aśvatthāman:**
But thanks to how damn hot these things were,
I'm more pissed off than before!

**Tristan:**
I'm sorry to hear that.

**Tristan:**
In that case, I think it's time we tried some real forest therapy.

**Chiron:**
I would appreciate that. I don't think I can
stand much more of this heat, either.

**Mash:**
R-right.

**Mash:**
Okay, I'll make sure to set the next environment to a proper forest that you can use for therapy.

**--BATTLE--:**

**Tristan:**
That's it.
This is just what I had in mind.

**Tristan:**
It really is peaceful here. Forests are green,
and of course, I am synonymous with green.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really? 'Cause when I think of green, I think of Robin Hood.

**Tristan:**
...

**Tristan:**
No, it's me.

**Mash:**
(He really doesn't want to let this go!)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't Chiron more closely associated with green?

**Tristan:**
...
...(Zzz).

**Aśvatthāman:**
Stop sleeping!

**Tristan:**
Oh, I wasn't sleeping. That's just the sound I make when I'm not ready to admit defeat.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Uh...

**Chiron:**
When it comes to Tristan, I've found it's best to just not think about him too hard.

**Aśvatthāman:**
...Gotcha...

---

**Chiron:**
All right, since there don't seem to be any Demonic Beasts nearby, let's try some deep breathing exercises to complement the forest therapy.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Got it.

**Chiron:**
Okay everyone, line up, please.

**Chiron:**
Now, let's take some deep breaths.
Inhale...

**Chiron:**
Exhale...

**Chiron:**
Inhale...

**Chiron:**
Exhale...

**Chiron:**
Inhale, then expel all of your breath at once,
building up power throughout your entire body...

**Chiron:**
And stick out your fist...

**Aśvatthāman:**
Ha!

**Tristan:**
Hra!

**Aśvatthāman:**
...How's that supposed to help us relax?

**Chiron:**
I'm sorry. Old habits.
All right, let's try meditation next.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You ready?

---

**Aśvatthāman:**
Hell yeah!

**Chiron:**
Start by sitting down in a comfortable position,
then close your eyes.

**Chiron:**
Now, look for the source of your anger.

**Narration:**
That statement takes me a little by surprise.

**Narration:**
Anger... The source of my anger.

**Narration:**
That cowardly plot, unbefitting of warriors.
The enemy army that decided to carry it out.

**Narration:**
My pathetic self, unable to stop it.
My comrades, falling one after another.

**Narration:**
That was why I got so mad that I broke the rules
of warfare and massacred them during the night.

**Chiron:**
That's not the only reason.

**Narration:**
That statement sends me reeling.
I want to jump down his throat...but I resist.

**Chiron:**
Anger like that would never last the way yours does.
There must be something more to it.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean he's angry at something else?

---

**Aśvatthāman:**
I...

**Narration:**
Yeah... He's right.
I mean, I really was angry back then...

**Narration:**
But the anger I feel now is different.
It takes over my whole body, tormenting me.

**Narration:**
Where does this anger come from?
What in the world is it?

**Chiron:**
That anger isn't right for you.

**Chiron:**
If it were, you would be able to understand it.

**Narration:**
...This anger isn't right.

**Narration:**
...

**Narration:**
Is it the anger I felt for being punished?
...No, it's not that.

**Narration:**
I agreed with that punishment.
In fact...

**Narration:**
I remember thinking it didn't go far enough.

**Narration:**
That's right. I wasn't punished enough.

**Narration:**
I've never felt like I fully atoned for what I did. I just kept wandering around wearing myself down until the next thing I knew, I was a Heroic Spirit.

**Narration:**
I remember thinking I was sure I was going to keep being punished.

**Narration:**
And yet...

**Narration:**
That's right.
Chaldea's way too good for a sinner like me.

**Aśvatthāman:**
I see it now.

**Aśvatthāman:**
I'm angry at myself.

**Aśvatthāman:**
I'll never be able to atone for what I did in a paradise like this.

**Chiron:**
...You're wrong.

**Chiron:**
That's it. That guilt is the indescribable
source of your anger.

**Chiron:**
That rage you feel towards yourself
is what you need to fight!

**Chiron:**
Concentrate. You're a warrior, are you not?

**Chiron:**
Then you should be used to fighting yourself.

**Narration:**
Yeah. I am. But...

**Narration:**
...I'm not at all confident I can win.

**Narration:**
After all, I've been holding on to this anger for thousands of years.

**Chiron:**
Hahahaha.
No need to worry about that.

**Chiron:**
Did you forget who's there beside you?

**Narration:**
...Yeah. Good point.
In that case...

**Aśvatthāman:**
So Master, I hate to ask you this...but would you mind giving me a hand fighting my own redemption?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Listen well, my millennia-old anger.
I will vanquish you in the name of duty.

**Aśvatthāman:**
I'm here to help save humanity. To help set it right.
It's natural to be angry at any and all injustice.

**Aśvatthāman:**
But in your case...you're much too big for a simple archer like me to carry by myself.

**Aśvatthāman:**
...

**Aśvatthāman:**
So it's time for us to go our separate ways,
even if it should cost me my life!

**Aśvatthāman:**
Here I come!!!

**--BATTLE--:**

**Aśvatthāman:**
All right! We won!!!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
B-but I didn't do anything...

---

**Tristan:**
...I see.

**Tristan:**
As a first-rate warrior, he must be able to simulate a battle where you were there giving him orders, Master.

**Chiron:**
Well? Is your anger gone now?

**Aśvatthāman:**
...

**Aśvatthāman:**
It's not that simple.

**Chiron:**
Perhaps not, but you can tell your relationship to it has changed, no?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Yeah, I can.

**Aśvatthāman:**
My anger wasn't just directed at other people.
It was also directed at me.

**Aśvatthāman:**
And just being aware of that
makes a world of difference.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Thanks, Master.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh, you're welcome, but I really didn't do anything!

---

**Aśvatthāman:**
Hahahaha!

**Tristan:**
And so♪
His Master♪

**Tristan:**
Birthed a new legend♪
By winning despite doing nothing♪

**Tristan:**
Ahh, how very jealous I am♪
Strum strum, strum strum♪

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Would you please stop singing that song already!?

**Tristan:**
I'm sorry. Your bewildered face was just so amusing that I couldn't help myself.

**Gareth:**
That's enough, Sir Tristan!
Zip it!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ugh! Stupid Tristan!

**Tristan:**
I see. Insults, is it?
Well, that's okay. They don't bother me♪

**Tristan:**
For a poet is not truly a poet♪
Unless they are also a nuisance♪

**Gareth:**
You're not even the least bit sorry, are you, Sir Tristan? I never could tell what you're thinking.

---

**Chiron:**
How are you, Aśvatthāman?

**Aśvatthāman:**
You know, I'm doing all right.

**Aśvatthāman:**
The time I'm spending here in peace, laughing and having fun with these guys I now call my friends... That's all the atonement I need.

**Aśvatthāman:**
And it's not unpleasant for me,
so I'm not gonna ruin the mood.

**Aśvatthāman:**
My suffering'll last as long as I live, but I'll also be able to enjoy the good things in life.

**Aśvatthāman:**
'Cause they're both perfectly valid ways
for me to be who I am.

**Chiron:**
Wonderful. That answer was so good I'm tempted to give you an A+ on your report card.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Thanks, but there's no way I'm
going back to school at this age.

**Aśvatthāman:**
...Then again, maybe that wouldn't be so bad...

**Chiron:**
Well, if you're ever in the mood for a lesson,
I'm always accepting new students.

**Aśvatthāman:**
Hm?

**Aśvatthāman:**
...Thank you for everything.

**Aśvatthāman:**
I hope my uncertainty, and my anger,
always remain in their proper place...

**Aśvatthāman:**
...and that you will continue to
watch over both myself and Master...

**Aśvatthāman:**
...Lady Pārvatī.

**Pārvatī:**
...Thank goodness.
It seems there was no need for me to get involved.

**Pārvatī:**
Seeing them grow, inspire, and motivate themselves like this is the greatest reward I could ask for.

**Pārvatī:**
Now then, I think I'd better check in on someone else who could use a little motivation!

**Pārvatī:**
You can't just spend every day doing nothing but playing video games, after all!

**Aśvatthāman:**
So tell me, Master:
What is it you're angry about right now?

**Aśvatthāman:**
Whatever it is, I know you'll have a good reason to be angry over it. And I'll always be there to help.

**Aśvatthāman:**
After all...isn't that what Servants are for?
