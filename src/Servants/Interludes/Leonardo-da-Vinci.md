# Leonardo da Vinci  
  
## Not Even The Almighty Hand Can Reach Here  
  
**Mash:**   
...Rayshift successful, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
19th Century London. The Fourth Singularity has already started to correct itself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's still a great deal of mist, but it's a normal mist. It's not the demonic fog, so it should be safe for the residents!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are there people around?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't see any carriages moving.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It should gradually go back to normal. The iconic scene of people and carriages on the streets should return soon enough.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's all thanks to you. Eventually, we will need to fix all the other Singularities like that, too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, Rayshifting to the Singularities and corrections to the abnormalities are all unprecedented, so it's not that there aren't any concerns...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Enough of that. I'm sure we'll learn more as we go.  
For now, let's just keep moving forward!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood, Doctor.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Fou. You're with us again?  
When did you...?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, now that we've finished the small talk, can I get down to business?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Can you hear me, Da Vinci? Do we need to prove our existence and adjust Sheba's elevation angle this time?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, are you sure you can leave all that to me and the staff? You can always come back, you know!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahahaha! So you caught me already.  
I guess it was inevitable.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry so much, Dr. Roman! We're in a Singularity that's already finished correcting itself.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides, this place is close to the modern age. It's the 19th century. With the abnormality corrected, proving our existence shouldn't be too hard, even for you!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I know, but...!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just wanted you to understand what was going through my mind when I turned around and realized you had disappeared. I was afraid! I was petrified!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hardly half a second had gone by when I thought, “Huh? What the heck is that darn technical advisor doing?  
Is she playing?”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Relax. Think of this as training in case of an emergency. In case there comes a time when I'm not around.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay. It's been a while since I've been in London.  
Now that the pesky demonic fog is gone... Let's see...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, darn. Things have barely gone back to normal.  
How disappointing.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And where did we Rayshift to?  
Soho? We can't have any fun here!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Seriously? Is that supposed to be a critique?)  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I wanted to go to Hyde Park.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I wanted to go to the department store to shop with all the wonderfully fashionable ladies, and then head over to a club to socialize with the gentlemen...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm not asking to get to be a noblewoman, but I had at least hoped to cut loose a little.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see, to have fun as a lady...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see, to have fun as a gentleman...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
How expected, Senpai! This is so like Da Vinci! First, she Rayshifts just to take a break, and now she wants to enjoy herself by flouting the usual gender roles of the time!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, calm down, Fujimaru and Mash. Don't get swept up by that oddball's whimsical nonsense.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes. U-um, Da Vinci! The reason why we Rayshifted here this time was not so we could go sightseeing, but...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You do know, right, Da Vinci?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course. There's nothing I don't know.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm pretty sure she knows.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm impressed, Fujimaru.  
You're starting to get me.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry. Of course I know. I know that a small abnormality was found in this Fourth Singularity.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And I have a general idea of what it is.  
Our destination is the British Museum in Regent's Park!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A tourist destination!  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Senpai.  
But the British Museum is...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But the British Museum is...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
First of all, I was the one who observed the abnormality. Well, there was also something else that bothered me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And I wanted to see it myself, so that's why I'm accompanying you. Of course I wasn't here to sightsee.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I do not tell meaningless lies. Because such a lie would eventually point towards the truth.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's why, whenever I make any nonsensical lies, it's to ride along with someone else's lie. Right, Romani?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uh...um... If you say it that way, I...don't really have a response to that...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu, fooou!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Whoa. I sense some criticism coming from over there. Come on, Fou, don't suspect the pretty big sister like that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
... (Sigh) The nerve on her to call herself  
“pretty big sister” is rather impressive...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, impressive!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Impressive.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yep, yep.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She is the fair Mona Lisa, after all...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe, that's the spirit!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
This version of me is the true Mona Lisa! Accept no substitutes! That makes my smile the world's greatest smile. Right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyuu...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Though to be honest... Yeah, I'm in no mood to smile right now.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If only we were at least near Westminster, we could have swung by the National Gallery.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
National Gallery?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't that...um...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I believe it's an art museum in Trafalgar Square.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Correct. It seems some of my work is displayed there. And there's also a piece of work that I was the inspiration for.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem dazed. Everything all right?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...my apologies, Master.  
I was just thinking about what Da Vinci meant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Things that she directly worked on or things that she was the inspiration for remain years after...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To have your work preserved in museums, and have it receive praise and admiration from those who see it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I assume many people have seen it and been affected by it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I just thought that must be a very wonderful thing.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou, fooou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yep. It's one of the perks a cultural Servant like her can enjoy. Most heroes make a name for themselves through the legend of their battles and victories.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it's truly rare to leave a lasting imprint on the world through your work alone. In that sense...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Leonardo da Vinci has left an indelible mark on this world. She truly earned the title of “universal genius.”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's the absolute truth, and Da Vinci is still considered to be the personification of that genius.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Heh heh. Keep praising me, Romani. Yes, I am not only a helpful and a beautiful big sister, but I am a true genius to boot.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The “beautiful big sister” part is a bit much. By the way, the work of yours exhibited in the National Gallery is a painting, right?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yep. A laaarge painting.  
Hehe, did you think it was some mysterious code?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, not really. That would have been interesting, but I only thought that for a second, okay?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What about the piece that you were a model for?  
Is that a painting too? A portrait?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Wrong. Verrocchio, my mentor in painting, used me as a model to paint a legendary being.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Legendary... What was the theme?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something that was modeled after Da Vinci...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, it was the archangel Raphael.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
!!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...! The archangel Raphael...!?  
Isn't that angel almost always depicted as male?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The archangel Gabriel is usually the one who is frequently depicted as female.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but wait. If the male Da Vinci was the model...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It doesn't matter which gender I was back then...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
My mentor Verrocchio modeled the angel after me. Besides, it's up to the artist to decide how to depict his subject...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words, the angel was not drawn to look like Da Vinci...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But the angel was drawn based off of Da Vinci's way of life... Is that what you mean?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I see.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even so, doesn't the angel look too handsome?His soul, at least.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahaha. Thanks for those interesting reactions,  
Fujimaru, Mash, and Romani.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, however I looked, I was extremely beautiful. Archangel or not, bring it on!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
When I think of Da Vinci's portait...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought he looked like an old man.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh I see. Are you thinking of my portrait as an old man?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, I won't deny that.  
That was, after all, how I looked at one point.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But, you know, changing one's appearance is like changing clothes.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...You say that so casually, but I can't really imagine that.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe, you think so?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...We've managed to get to the basement.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Fou. That's right. The Mage's Association hasn't been completely fixed just yet.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Most of the British Museum itself has been restored, but this area is still the way it was before...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank goodness. If the correction of the Singularity had progressed much further, we wouldn't have been able to infiltrate the place so easily.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Especially for a place so labyrinthine.  
This place is the Mage's Association's ultimate secret.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This place is like a type of armory. It stores a bunch of rare and extremely precious books.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And yet, we got in so easily...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's also made it easy for shady characters to sneak in. Do you feel it, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I sense some magical energy up ahead.  
Senpai, please be careful.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I suspect they are spellbook-type enemies!  
I thought the effects of the demonic fog were no more!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Thick clouds of Mystics naturally lay dormant in Britain. Even without the demonic fog, if we are in the time when reality is correcting the age itself...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...the fact that there are man-eating books around isn't surprising to me at all. Here they come!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That sounded completely crazy, but she said it like it was normal... Anyway, yeah, it's time to battle!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
All enemies defeated.  
Good work, Senpai.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You too, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Thank you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Da Vinci, are you pushing yourself?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Not at all. Actually, this is fun! My job normally doesn't let me accompany you like this.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To freely walk around, huh...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Since we are shorthanded at Chaldea, it somehow became my job to build up the anti-infiltration program.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's not a particularly taxing job, but day and night, it's just been work, work, work.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Buuut, ever since you formed a contract with me, I've been able to get involved in battle...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it... It is rare for you to be with us from investigation to battle.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right? That's why I'm really happy. I'm excited!  
If it was fieldwork, it would have been even better.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fieldwork...?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If I'm outside, I can go all-out. Making a bonfire in a place like this is frowned upon, you know.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I didn't think it was true, but Leonardo really seems like she's out camping.)  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I heard that, Romani.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, sorry... Wait, that wasn't all bad. Was it?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway. So, is this labyrinth the source of London's abnormality?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci seems to be convinced that it is, and the fact that we encountered demonic books is all the proof we need.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But the readings on my side aren't all that clear.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Mage's Association bounded field that was originally there has reappeared, and it's interfering with our ability to gather information.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Who knows? Man-eating books hardly seem strange to me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And besides, I might have made a mistake.  
I was still human, after all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Da Vinci...making a mistake?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're kidding.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't think Da Vinci made mistakes.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahahaha. You saw through me. You're right.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Like you said, I probably don't make mistakes.  
I'm almighty! While many desire to be so, I truly am!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's why I'm a bit saddened.  
I didn't want our reunion to be like this.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
During my time, I had not a single equal.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I was a genius, after all. And not just any genius.  
A universal genius.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The talents that I was born with were not limited to any single field. Painting, sculpting, architecture, carpentry, anatomy, natural science...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah yes, and magecraft.  
All fields of human knowledge were my playground.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There was nobody who was equal to me.  
Everyone trailed behind.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Leonardo.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But still. There were a few who could match me in a handful of fields.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
For example, yes... You.  
  
   
**???:**  
Guuu... Uuuuuuuuu...  
  
   
**???:**  
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)...!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Magical energy detected! From what I'm seeing, it looks like a ghost-type enemy!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Shall we do this? I came here to see you...Michelangelo.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Ghost of Michelangelo:**   
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)...  
  
   
**Ghost of Michelangelo:**   
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Goodbye, Michelangelo.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
While it was only where the arts were concerned...my dear friend, you had a gift that was comparable to my own.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But I wonder. Why were you hanging around the Mage's Association library?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Or perhaps... Did the abnormality of the Singularity cause any lingering spirits lurking around the British Museum...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...to fall underground? Haha, perhaps the truth really is something silly like that.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Either way... Michelangelo... I'm a little relieved.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm glad you didn't end up in the Throne as a Heroic Spirit. At least your soul should rest in peace now.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Rest in peace...the other uomo universale.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Da Vinci...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you have a special relationship with him?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Your lover, perhaps?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm? Well, it's hard to say...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He really was somebody truly special to me, but I'm not sure how I can express our relationship.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm a genius. He was a genius.  
I'm sure you know the name Michelangelo.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes. Michelangelo is a widely known artist, also known as a Renaissance man.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Especially his sculpture, paintings, and designs were considered the work of a true genius.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yep, yep. Right. I'm a big fan of his “David” as well.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Well, yeah. I guess I did like him.  
I'm not sure if you'd call it love, though.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
More than Mona Lisa?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Well, maybe not that much.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo, fou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That was a quick answer.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, I pity Michelangelo. Well, I don't know what he was thinking while he was wandering around.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I died before him. Maybe it's this?  
His feelings just...accumulating here...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And a lot of things happened to get them all twisted and warped. Something like that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-yeah. If you're satisfied with that, then I'm fine with it too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The fact that you were acting different than usual...  
Well, I'll just say that was my imagination.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, the minute abnormality in the Singularity seems to have stabilized now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, let's prepare to head back.  
Good work everyone!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Doctor. Good work.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe. Okay Doctor.  
Can you Rayshift us back without my help?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can. I can!  
I've always done it... Wait a minute, have I done it properly!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Usually I make adjustments in the background...  
 Ahem. I'm joking. You've always done it fine.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, wait. Wait, wait.  
Have I never done adjustments on my own!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahaha, that's fine! You're not alone!  
I'm here, and so is the staff!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And of course, Fujimaru and Mash!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If I say it, there's no mistaking it!  
It's lonely doing it all alone. Let's have some fun!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uh, that's not what I mean!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyuuu!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...That happened a while ago.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was sometime after fixing the Fifth or Sixth Singularity. Yeah. It was right before going to Uruk.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Sigh) ...That brings back some memories.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That was supposed to be a lesson for you, but that message came right back to me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah...right. It hit me hard.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can understand Michelangelo's feelings now. I see.  
I can see why he would turn into a troublesome ghost.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Sigh) It sure is painful having to continue to work even after being left all alone.  
  
  
## A Gift From a Little Devil  
  
**Narration:**   
...I was there for my mother when she died.  
...I suppose I should be grateful for that.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And I am. Truly.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...That all happened a long time ago.  
A VERY long time ago.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
My family were notaries in the village of Vinci. Had been for generations. They were pretty well off, all things considered.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
My parents were never married. My mother, Caterina, was beautiful, but she was also a peasant.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Back then, there was no way she or my father, Messer Piero, could possibly have been permitted to make their love official.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In other's eyes, she just wasn't good enough. I don't want to say it because it's too crass. But...that is essentially what people thought of their love.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Still, that didn't stop them from having a beautiful child together.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
This is me, Leonardo.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And boy was I cute! I think. But according to what I've heard, and considering what I look like now, how could I not have been?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, what am I saying? Of course I was adorable.  
Let's just leave it at that.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Getting back to my mother, Caterina...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...she married another man after she gave birth to me. They had many children of their own. That's all well and good.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was certainly better than continuing in a relationship that could never lead to marriage, and she didn't have to worry about me. My grandfather and uncle on the Da Vinci side took care of me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I grew up healthy and happy, and it wasn't long before my abundant talents started helping me accomplish amazing things...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...but I never forgot about my mother. It wasn't an obsession, really. But I thought about her often.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I think it was Botticelli who said that “enough is plenty”? It certainly sounds like something he'd say.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, when I was about forty or so, my mother fell ill. She died shortly thereafter.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I had a bit of money back then,  
so I tended to her sometimes.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That is why I was able to be there when she finally slipped off. Oh, I held her funeral as well. It was a rather nice funeral, at that.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Strangely, I can't recall whether I cried at all.  
Truly.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I barely remember it at all.  
Still...I think I probably did.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I was still a strapping young lad of forty back then, after all, so I must have been more sensitive.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Most importantly...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I wasn't the universal genius back then that I am now.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
...What's this?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
It seems your repose last night was somewhat less than restful, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Did something unusual happen once again while you were asleep?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
My understanding is that this would hardly be the first time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I dreamed about Da Vinci.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess you could say it was unusual...  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh? Me? I wonder why that could have happened.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I must say, I don't recall it. Of course, there's no reason for me not to take you at your word.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It could be that our connection is much stronger now that we have a contract that allows me to accompany you in battle.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, I'm flattered! Sorta irritating that you're not able to control it, but that aside...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...we should be glad our Master is having new and interesting experiences!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So...uh, just what kind of dream are we talking here, anyway?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think...you were talking about someone...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Hmm. Perhaps it was something related to an experience of hers from her lifetime?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh, I wonder who it was.  
I knew SOOO many interesting people in my lifetime!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Was it Botticelli? Mikey? Lorenzo the Magnificent?  
Maybe Isabella d'Este?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, by the look on [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru's face, I would say it was none of those. It may not, therefore, have been someone of great historical significance.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
A question for you: In your dream conversation, how would you describe Ms. Da Vinci's emotional state?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think she was smiling?  
   
**Holmes:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think she was crying?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Pffft, good one. You know I'm not really one to turn on the waterworks, right?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Did I wake you? Or were you still up?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Either way, sorry for bothering you so late.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So, I'm pretty sure you've guessed why I'm here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I couldn't get our conversation from earlier out of my head.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So...I'm curious who I was talking to you about...you know, in that dream you had.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
First, though, I should apologize. I think I had it figured out as far as who it was once you dropped that little hint.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I just didn't want to get into it there in the Command Room with so many people around.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Even if I'm just filling in, I'm still their boss. It's hard to talk about sentimental stuff around them.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Holmes? Well, you know him. I'm sure he's got this whole thing figured out already.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway! Like I said,  
I'm pretty sure I know who it was.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I was talking about my mother, right?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Caterina of Vinci village.  
My beautiful mother.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She never did get a chance to raise me,  
but she still brought me into this world.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She's the woman who gave me life.  
I loved her so much, and I'm sure she loved me too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your mother...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yup.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did she look like you do now?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe. Who knows?  
Though I AM pretty sure she had a lovely smile.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Things were...complicated. She was my mother,  
yes, but she could never marry my father.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Maybe I've already told you about this within that dream, so I'll be brief...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I spent the last years of my mother's life with her in Milan.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I was doing pretty well for myself back then, so I took steps to bring my birth mother to live with me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Not long after, she got so sick she collapsed. I remember going a little out of my mind, not knowing what to do...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Looking back, I realize I may have foolishly been responsible for shortening her life.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It'd be a lie to say I didn't regret that,  
but still...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I wouldn't trade those two years in Milan with her for anything.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How familiar are you with my paintings?  
Ever heard of one I did called “Virgin of the Rocks”?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really, sorry...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's one of my better ones. I'll show you sometime...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it displayed in London, or Paris?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Both. Although, my apprentice did one of them...I think? I'm not sure.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I painted it in Milan, a few years before I had my mother come live with me. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...but I also went waaay past the deadline on it. Things happened, you know? And I ended up delayed so long all you could do was laugh!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm? That's no laughing matter?  
Well, yeah, you're right. It's not.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Boy was the priest who commissioned it pissed! Then again, I was pretty pissed too once I saw what he wanted to pay me for it!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...As the name suggests, it's a painting of the Virgin Mary, the Madonna, sitting among some rocks.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I think...when I was making it, I must have been longing for some maternal presence myself.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's how it seems to me now, anyway,  
with the benefit of hindsight and all.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
While I was painting the Madonna, I started to miss my own mother, so much so that I ended up having her move out to Milan to live with me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sure you've heard the saying,  
“No use crying over spilled milk”?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Me, I've always had a different take on it: “You can't put spilled water back in the pot.” I think that's about the perfect summary of human life.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Although, if I'm being really honest...I think I might like the way Sun Tzu put it the best:  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Thus, prompted by [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.} Fujimaru's dream...  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
...the Heroic Spirit Leonardo da Vinci has a premonition, and decides she would like to take some manner of action...  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
...just as she did when she brought her mother to live with her. Do I have that right?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How long have you been there...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now I get it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is Holmes right?  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I hate to admit it, but I suppose he is. I DO want to take action here, just like I did with my mother.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And if I'm going to do that,  
I'll need your help, just like last time.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Last time?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean, with Michelangelo...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm so glad you remembered! Yup, exactly like that.  
I suppose I'm being a bit nostalgic again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Coordinates set for Europe,  
on the outskirts of Milan, 1524.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This appears to be a minute Singularity, most likely caused by a small Holy Grail or a Grail fragment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's just as you said, Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe you called it so accurately before the Command Room could observe it with Sheba...  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
I thought this might be a good time to try my hand at Freudian dream interpretation, but it seems that won't be necessary here.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Most impressive, Da Vinci.  
Just the sort of thing I would expect from you.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Though I suppose something of that ease may be owed to the...precision of Master's dream.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Commencing Rayshift.  
Please be careful out there, Senpai!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
See you later!  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahh, this is a sight for sore eyes!  
I haven't seen the Duchy of Milan like this in ages!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou, pastafooou!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, Fou. You snuck along too?  
Are you sure you wouldn't rather be with Mash?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fou.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I see, I see. So you like beautiful women, do you?  
As it happens, I do too! What good taste you have.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift successful. Readings show you should be in the eastern part of Milan.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Good. I must admit, though, that this is a different time period than when I lived here, so I don't know the place so well as it is now.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was pretty peaceful back then,  
but France and Venice always loomed large as threats.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
As much as people went about their lives quietly,  
there was a certain tension in the air.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I remember the local hotshot, Il Moro, took a liking to me. I used to play the lira for him...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Lyre? As in the instrument?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sure is.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you're a musical genius too...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Have I not mentioned that?  
My talents were never confined to a single field.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To name a few, there's painting, sculpture, architecture, weaponry, woodworking, autopsies, natural science...and of course, music.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right then, let's just go for a walk and see where we&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, never mind that. Looks like we Rayshifted to just about exactly where we need to be.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There they are, plain as the nose on your face.  
They could've at least waited till nightfall.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
See?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Faaau! Fau, kyaaau!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hostiles detected! A lot of them!  
It looks like they have the Holy Grail with them!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right, let's get this show on the road, shall we? I am, of course, a combat genius too, so just sit back and let Da Vinci handle this!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Initiating battle!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's see what you've got!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Here they come!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Just look at all these demons.  
Man, they couldn't be more obvious if they tried.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That takes care of them, but...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Fou, fou fou.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right. It's not over yet.  
Still more of them here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The BBEG in particular. I can tell it's not a Servant,  
but it's still got a lot of magical energy.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It must have absorbed the Holy Grail fragment to get its magical energy levels up THIS high.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right, Da Vinci! I can see those exceptional magical energy readings from here, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It must possess a small Holy Grail,  
or a fragment of a larger one.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I figured, yeah.  
And don't you just look the part.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey there, Salaì...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Salaì?  
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Gian Giacomo Caprotti. While she lived, Da Vinci took him under her wing when he was still a young boy.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
He became Da Vinci's apprentice in Milan in 1490,  
where they grew as close as family.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Family...  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Now I see. Since he died in 1524, this minute Singularity must have occurred when the small Holy Grail turned him into a ghost.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
It would seem you were right on the mark, Ms. Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The Salaì I knew already had a fragment, so I figured he must have been the one affecting Master's dreams.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I had a hunch, really,  
and it turned out to be dead-on.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Though I wish it wasn't...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You're the only person I ever knew who would think to pester me like this, Salaì.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Still...  
Why is it a ghost this time around too?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah, well. I guess you never did get to a point where you'd be enshrined in the Throne.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides, if you were, I'm pretty sure all your bad habits would put you preeetty firmly on the Anti-Hero end of things anyway.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was he really THAT bad?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He was just a kid, right?  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He was a beautiful kid. Adorable, even!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, I loved his curly hair. He may not have quite been at my level, but he was still as lovely as an angel.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou, Da Fooou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(She's leading off by extolling the virtues of pretty boys! Th-that's our Da Vinci, I guess...)  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Buuut, he was a freakin' brat, too. He was easily four times as mischievous as the average person.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He used to sell my shoes just to buy candy...steal my silver brushes...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hell, he'd steal anything that wasn't nailed down, really... Broke my pots while we ate...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Ugh, just thinking about it pisses me off.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Salaì, I gotta say...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...a brat like you appearing before the maestro as a wandering ghost, just like what happened with Michelangelo...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...ticks me off even more than I thought it would!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Shut your damn hole!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Hostiles eliminated. Automatically collecting Holy Grail fragments per the usual protocol.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Annnd collected.  
That takes care of that.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Sigh) Dammit, Salaì...  
I heard you died five years after I did.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Why'd you have to go and do that while you were still so young? What a damned waste.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Even if it was just bad luck that led you to the Holy Grail and turned you into a ghost...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...you have no business dying while you're so young.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...You really were nothing but a pain in the ass till the end, weren't you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You probably wanted to have a real talk with him, huh?  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, I don't know about that. Sure, he ended up an evil, rampaging ghost...but I think that suited him, in an odd sort of way.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What better way for a hellion like him to cause as much trouble as he wants, after all.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In that sense, we were lucky to meet him like this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, now! No getting all gloomy on me!  
If Da Vinci says it's okay, then it's okay!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I do like that sensitive side of yours, though.  
I hope that's something you can hold on to. Always.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right then!  
What do you say we get ourselves back to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sure you'll sleep soundly tonight, Master.  
Any dreams you may have will surely be sweet.  
  
  
**--SECTION BREAK--:**  
   
**Narration:**   
...Hey, Maestro?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I don't get it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...You held a proper funeral for your mother, right?  
So why aren't you doing anything this time around?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Ahahaha. Oh, Maestro.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...This is why you still have all those regrets, you big dummy!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yup. I get the feeling that's what Salaì was telling me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I know he wasn't ACTUALLY saying anything,  
of course. But that's still the impression I got.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
This wasn't a prediction or anything like that.  
Just a feeling.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I swear.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That little imp never did have any problem saying the sort of things no one else would dare to.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But you know, Salaì...even if I couldn't give you a proper funeral, I still feel like I gave you a proper send-off.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Even if I'm the only one who feels that way.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right...guess I'd better start getting things ready.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, getting my spare ready, really.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No telling when my number could be up,  
so I've got to be sure I'm ready for anything.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's probably part of the reason why Salaì showed up now. Demons have long been harbingers of death.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...While I'm at it, you know what,  
I think I'll model it after my childhood appearance.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Holmes probably already has an idea of what I'm up to...but I don't see him having an issue.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He may always play it pretty close to the chest, but he had my back again with this, and he kept his mouth shut when he should have.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I wonder what you'd think about this plan if you were here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You'd probably have a big problem with it, wouldn't you? Well, sorry. I've just got to go through with it.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Lady Luck has been awfully kind to me in this life and in the last.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So to make up for that...even if my next death does turn out to suck pretty badly...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I think...  
  
   
**D：Da Vinci:**   
...I'll just have to roll with it.
