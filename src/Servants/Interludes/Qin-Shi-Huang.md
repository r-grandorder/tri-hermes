# Qin Shi Huang  
  
## Melancholy of the Judge  
  
**Narration:**   
We knew there was more than one way a world could  
fall to ruin, just as there is more than one way for  
a dream to come to an end.  
  
**Narration:**   
With the Trees of Emptiness gone, dragging their respective Lostbelts down to the realm of fiction, how will each world dissipate?  
  
**Narration:**   
Will each merely be snuffed out, like a candle?  
  
**Narration:**   
Or will their end be hellishly prolonged, with the ground crumbling away beneath their feet and the heavens tearing themselves apart?  
  
**Narration:**   
In our eternal empire's case,  
its undoing began with a lack of observers.  
  
**Narration:**   
One by one, its woods, wilderness, and unexplored  
mountains and rivers all succumbed to oblivion.  
  
**Narration:**   
An immutable darkness covered the land as the  
world began to forget it was ever there.  
  
**Narration:**   
But our citizens remained blissfully unaware. Satisfied with their peaceful lives, never turning so much as a curious eye towards the wider world.  
  
**Narration:**   
Today, they went about their lives just as they  
always have, and went to bed just as they always have.  
  
**Narration:**   
Tonight, oblivion came for some while they were fast  
asleep, swallowing up their villages into endless darkness.  
  
**Narration:**   
And just like that, our citizens' homes disappeared in their sleep one after another, with no one the wiser.  
  
**Narration:**   
The ones still around to wake up the next day never even remembered they had once had neighboring villages, and so thought nothing of their vanishing overnight.  
  
**Narration:**   
But even as the citizens we had raised to live their lives peacefully did just that, we oversaw everything.  
  
**Narration:**   
As the one true human to exist in this land, we are the only one who knows that this dream will be ending now that it has been pruned away.  
  
**Narration:**   
As our world collapses,  
we are the only one seeing the whole picture.  
  
**Narration:**   
This is good.  
  
**Narration:**   
Indeed, this ending is the best we could have hoped for. It gives us time to prepare&ndash;time we can estimate.  
  
**Narration:**   
We believe our empire will disappear  
completely in about three months...  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
How is it proceeding, my soul?  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Not well, my spirit.  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hmm. So even mobilizing the entirety of the Epang Palace's operational resources is insufficient...  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Things may not be proceeding well, but neither are they stagnating. Progress is still being made, even if it comes at a snail's pace.  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
Well hurry. We have very little time left.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
We are well aware. Remember, we have always held  
Authority over analysis and data processing.  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
Yes, much as it pains us,  
we know there is nothing we can do to help.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
That is where you are wrong, my spirit. Now that you have regained human form, there is something only you can do.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Console our citizens.  
Stay on the ground with them until their final moments.  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
True, that too is an emperor's duty, and we cannot neglect it. But once everything has returned to null...  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Not to worry, my spirit. Even then, you will still have an important part to play.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Your body is a perfect replication of the fairy woman's. As such, it should let you reenter the sage world.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
There, beyond its deepest recesses, you will surely  
find a path that leads to Proper Human History.  
  
**Zhenren Qin Shi Huang:**   
Then we have a long journey ahead of us.  
We only hope we can prepare in time...  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
Once you have arrived, you are to do your best and leave the rest to providence.  
  
**Iron Qin Shi Huang:**   
For we are the only one fit to rule over all things  
between heaven and Earth...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We have a Singularity!  
Come, let us begin the Rayshift!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fowha fou!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Um... A Singularity, Qin Shi Huang?  
Are you sure?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, Fujimaru?  
Sorry to bother you when you're on break...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but I wanted to give you a heads-up that an overly  
excited Servant might be headed your way, like, right now.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I appreciate that, but I'm pretty sure they're already here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, yeah? Figures...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, in that case, come down to the Command  
Room and I'll fill you in on what's going on.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be there in a jiffy.  
  
---  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
This one is taking place in Xianyang, right?  
And in 210 B.C., no less, right?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
That is exactly the time when our frustrations over our failed search for immortality reached their peak.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
So we can say with absolute confidence that we must  
have done something to cause this new Singularity.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Absolute confidence, huh?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We cannot say we are surprised.  
We had gone quite mad at the time.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
For a time, we even lost sight of why we wished to extend our life, or why China and the emperorship existed at all.  
  
**Sion:**   
(Sigh) I cannot believe this is from the same Qin Shi Huang who was renowned far and wide for their wisdom and his insanely high performance computation resources.  
  
**Sion:**   
How can you be so blasé about a  
Singularity you know you caused?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Must we remind you? We may be two-thousand two-hundred and seventy-six years old now, but we were not even fifty at the time we almost died.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
By your standards, at that age we would have been the equivalent of a toddler who has only just started to walk.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
And who would be so narrow-minded as to blame a toddler for the damage they inadvertently caused on a tumble while learning to walk?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. Yeah, that's definitely the kind of grandiose  
excuse I'd expect an emperor to come up with...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, why're you making such a big deal out of this?  
I don't remember you being so prone to excitement.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fo fou.  
(Special Translation: You'd be surprised.)  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Well, let us just say it is something of a black mark on our otherwise sterling history we would just as soon not remember. Surely you can understand our urge to hide our embarrassment.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
See, that's just it. It's not like you to be embarrassed about, well, anything.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, as the current strategic commanders  
in charge of operations...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...it's technically up to Gordy and me to decide  
who gets to go on a Rayshift to a Singularity...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but as the Master actually carrying out the operation,  
Fujimaru, you have a lot of say as well.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Still, are you sure you want to bring this overblown  
jest&ndash;er, emperor along on this latest expedition?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, at least they'll know their way around.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think they're perfect for the job.  
  
---  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Indeed, a wise decision! That keen insight is exactly  
why we chose you to be humanity's protector!  
  
**Sion:**   
...  
  
**Sion:**   
All right, if that is your decision,  
Fujimaru, I will not object.  
  
**Sion:**   
But I will insist on coming along this time, in my  
capacity as Novum Chaldea's weapons development advisor.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? You mean, you're going to Rayshift too, Sion?  
  
**F：Sion:**   
If it is my compatibility you are worried about, then you can stop. While there may be some issues, I am fully prepared to work around them.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hmm? We suppose you may come along if you wish...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
But know that as we are strictly Fujimaru's  
Servant, it is [♂ his /♀️ her] safety alone we will be concerned  
with.  
  
**F：Sion:**   
That is quite all right. I have absolutely no intentions of taking part in combat.  
  
**F：Sion:**   
And while my ability to protect others may be limited,  
I am very capable of protecting myself.  
  
**F：Sion:**   
As an Atlas Institute genius, I am actually quite  
proficient in both martial arts and sharpshooting.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hmm. Well, as long as you do not get in our way,  
then there should be no issue.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We trust you have no objections either, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hell no. I'd feel way safer having Sion come along.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope! Welcome aboard, Sion!  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So you're going too, Sion? That's great! Now I know  
I won't have anything to worry about. Oh, but wait.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Didn't you say you'd rather not be converted  
into Spiritrons if you can at all help it?  
  
**Sion:**   
That was then, this is now! There is no-no way  
I am going to pass up this chance to try it!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. Well, if you're sure.  
Okay guys, go ahead and hop in the Coffins.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I've got the Singularity coordinates locked in, and your existence verification accuracy tuning's already done.  
  
**Sion:**   
Keep a close eye on us, Da Vinci. Make sure you do not  
overlook anything out of the ordinary, no matter how seemingly insignificant.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
No worries, I got this.  
You guys just be careful out there.  
  
**Mash:**   
The Rayshift went off without a hitch.  
Although...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hmm. How terrible.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
If we did not know better, we would never guess this is our beautiful Xianyang. What is this miasma?  
  
**Mash:**   
There's a lot of dense curse-tinged magical energy permeating the air. Our Mystic Codes are protecting us from the worst of it, but without them, normal people would never have a chance...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Indeed. We doubt any of our citizens here are still alive.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Any we find here are likely to be transformed  
into something no longer human.  
  
**Sion:**   
This kind of environmental change is dramatic,  
even for a Singularity.  
  
**Sion:**   
What in the world could this Qin Shi Huang  
have been trying to do?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Well, we knew we would be facing ourself here, so we expected any disaster our younger self created would be at least somewhat contained...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
But we suppose it slipped our mind that we never do anything by half measures.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Still, all that said, we never thought our younger  
self would be so terribly foolish...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
How could they possibly have used  
up all of Xianyang like this?  
  
**Sion:**   
Used up!? Do you mean this younger self of yours used all of Xianyang's resources solely for their own ends!?  
  
**Sion:**   
I can understand how a quest for immortality  
could end up escalating...  
  
**Sion:**   
...but how could someone as esteemed as you end up causing a biohazardous disaster like this?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Nnn. Well, um, much as it pains us to admit, we can't  
say we would never have done something like this.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
At the time, we were frantically searching all of China for any possible method that could help us attain immortality, regardless of any danger they may pose.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Really, thinking about it now,  
it is no wonder Xu Fu chose to run away.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's Xu Fu?  
  
**Mash:**   
Xu Fu was a court sorcerer during the Qin period.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's said that Qin Shi Huang sent him out on an expedition with a huge entourage of researchers to the Far East in search of the secret to immortality.  
  
**Sion:**   
But apparently, he failed to find the sage  
world and ended up never returning to China.  
  
**Sion:**   
One theory says that he ended up in Japan,  
where he became a king.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So the mercury was only the tip of the iceberg...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Perhaps we could have saved ourself some embarrassment if we had called it sympathetic magic, as they do in Western Europe.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Honestly, even if it does possess an unchanging beauty, we can still scarcely believe we were reckless enough to ingest it...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
If only we could go back and tell our foolish younger self they would be better off drinking an entire cask of mercury before resorting to curses and spells! Ahh, we are so ashamed!  
  
  
---  
  
**D：Mash:**   
Huh!? Master, Sheba just sent us an alert!  
Hostiles are headed our way!  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Yes, it would seem now is not the time to bemoan our other self's appalling disgrace. The best way we can save face now is to fulfill our Servant duties and protect our Master.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Come, let us remind this ruined city what  
rule by a true emperor looks like!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...  
  
**Sion:**   
...You seem troubled. Does this mean even superhumans like yourself experience heartbreak in the face of tragedy?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
How can our heart not break at seeing our citizens&ndash;practically our own flesh and blood&ndash;come to such a horrific end? Especially when we ourself are responsible for it.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Remember, this is still a Singularity.  
Another Qin Shi Huang did this, not you.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Be that as it may, we are still one and the same.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We know all too well where human delusion leads.  
We have seen glimpses of it ourself.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Look well, Fujimaru, for what you see here is why  
we grew wary of letting the human race diversify.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Regardless of what sort of lofty ideals one espouses,  
fate will always have far crueler plans in store.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Fear of death... Worry of failure...  
Such things can all too easily lead people astray.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
It is impossible for any given ten people to complete every goal they set themselves. And if even one of those people should turn to evil, they will eat the other nine alive.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you don't think it's possible for humanity to progress?  
  
  
---  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
No human can hold out against fear and despair. Not unless they overcome their finite life span to become a Zhenren.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
In which case, we thought we alone should bear the burden of carrying humanity past the dangers that lay ahead...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...only for our world to end up pruned away.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Now, the right to challenge the future's cruelties  
is held by our citizens&ndash;by people.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Still, you must not forget. If you are to accept humans' potential, you must also accept that this disaster we see here will not be the last such tragedy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not happy about that, but it's still better than the alternative.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even so, we don't have any choice but to keep moving forward.  
  
---  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Heh.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
No matter how much we may think to threaten you, your noble gaze always has a way of tying our tongue in knots.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
All right, we can continue this discussion another time. Now come, let us put an end to this delusion at its source.  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
You...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Ahh, there you are. Hmm. We knew to expect you...but seeing you in person is truly nauseating.  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
Oho... You did it. You really did it.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
While we can understand your predicament, our young, foolish self, this failure is utterly abominable.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Don't tell us you did not expect this curse to leave such a miasma in its wake?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
What use is there in extending your own life  
if the entire capital must pay the price!?  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
Hmph. If we consider death to be part of life,  
then this is just another form of medicine.  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
We have not failed. We have succeeded at finally  
bringing China eternal peace under our reign.  
  
**Sion:**   
(This Qin Shi Huang? Really?)  
Excuse me, I have something to say.  
  
**Sion:**   
While I certainly have my own opinions about the morality, or lack thereof, of truly obtaining immortality, using it merely as a means to a political end is absurd.  
  
**Sion:**   
You obviously do not need to go to such reckless lengths.  
We have proof of that right here.  
  
**Sion:**   
See? This emperor achieved their immortality by ascending to the sage world, and brilliantly at that.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Ah, that may not be the best thing to say if your intent is to de-escalate matters...  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
The sage world? Now that is ridiculous!  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
That other self of ours is a pathetic fool who only achieved their own desired future at the expense of their world's!  
  
**Sion:**   
...!  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Oh? We are impressed you figured out our origin so quickly. But then, we suppose you are we&ndash;or at least, we as we used to be.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Then you would claim this horrific city of death is preferable to history under our guiding hand?  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
We do. We, and our empire, will no longer fear death or oblivion. Our rule will spread until destruction reigns far and wide! This is the truth of eternity!  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
All right, we have made up our mind! Any pity we may  
have had for you is gone. This...thing is no longer  
the Child of Heaven, nor the Heavenly Emperor. It is  
but a walking corpse.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
That throne is not meant to support the dreams of those who are already dead. You already have a mausoleum prepared for yourself, do you not? Then it is time you went, for it is where you belong!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
Graaah... Why do you oppose us?  
Why do you end us?  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
And just when we were about...to make our  
empire eternal...and rule over death...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
While we suspect any advice we have to offer will be wasted on a self that was unable to overcome death...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Trust us when we say: do not be so quick to anger,  
nor to bemoan your state of affairs.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
There is no need for you to carry the world on your shoulders. Who knows? Perhaps humanity will surprise you, and figure something out on their own.  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
Do not be preposterous.  
We were the only one...  
  
**Vengeful Spirit:**   
The all-encompassing emperor...  
meant to guide this world to its destiny...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
How shameful. Of all the dark periods in our  
history to be put on display for all to see...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
All right, we have accomplished what we came here to do. Let us take our leave of this place, and quickly.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We do not wish to breathe this filthy air one moment longer than is absolutely necessary.  
  
**Sion:**   
Accomplished what we came here to do, huh...  
So you are sure this is everything?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Of course. Were you expecting something more?  
  
**Sion:**   
...No, I was not. This was a textbook Singularity repair, and you performed your Servant duties perfectly.  
  
**Sion:**   
Congratulations on a job well done, Fujimaru.  
Come on then, let us go home.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yup, you guys nailed it, just like I knew you would.  
Great work!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Why don't you and Mash go take a nice shower and rest  
up for a bit, Fujimaru? Don't worry about the  
report; we can go over that later.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Are you sure, Da Vinci?  
That's not our usual protocol...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yup, I'm sure. I've got some adjustments to make on our gear, anyway.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, but would you mind sticking around a little, Qin Shi Huang? There's something I could use your help with.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hm?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't have to tell me twice!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You got it. Later then!  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Right. Now that we have all the facts, all that  
remains is to clear up the remaining mysteries.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Well now. Out with Fujimaru, in with the  
detective, is it? We don't like the look of this.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Oh, come to think of it, we just remembered we had plans to meet Shuwen for tea. To think it almost slipped our mind. Well, if you'll excuse us...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Do spare us the blatantly transparent lies, if you would. You're not going anywhere until we've had a little chat.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
See, we've observed a looot of Singularities over the years. Big ones, small ones, and everything in between.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So we've got more than enough samples  
to categorize any new ones...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...by comparing them against the  
data my past self collected.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Which is why we can say with complete confidence that this latest Singularity didn't just pop up out of nowhere.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's a dead ringer for the kind that only appears  
due to intentional external interference.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
And you suspect that we are to blame? We are flattered  
you would think us capable of such a thing, but that  
is giving even us far too much credit.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We admit, our Servant form has indeed materialized in our transcendent Zhenren body, the very peak of existence...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
But no matter how evolved we may be, we are still only one person. We do not have anywhere near the Authority we possessed in the holy mechanical form that achieved complete domination of our world.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, thank you for such a...lengthy and articulate excuse.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
True, the fact that you're a Servant now...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...does mean we have ways of keeping you in check  
thanks to Fujimaru and [♂ his /♀️ her] Command Spells.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But...if you were to regain the kind of power you had in your Lostbelt, that would no longer be the case.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
All right, let us say we are willing to tolerate the wariness in which you hold us because we choose to see it as a sign of the awe in which you hold us.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Even so, surely you don't truly think we are capable  
of making a Singularity in our current form, do you?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
For that matter, is it even possible to create  
a Singularity through artificial means?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Theoretically, yes. Though you'd need to be able to  
Rayshift, or have access to something equivalent.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
So what are you saying? You think someone misused your facilities for sinister ends?  
  
**Sion:**   
If you are implying that our security is full of holes,  
think again.  
  
**Sion:**   
As a hacker myself, I would never say that there  
is such a thing as a perfectly secure system...  
  
**Sion:**   
But I will say that, at least for Novum Chaldea's facilities, it would be impossible for someone to use them without leaving behind a log of their activities.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Quite so. As such, our primary suspect would be anyone  
besides us who might be capable of performing a Rayshift.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Come now, we could be here all day if we begin theorizing. For example, what if Rayshift technology is as ordinary in the future as light bulbs are now?  
  
**Holmes:**   
I assure you, there's no need to resort to such extreme arguments. It's perfectly possible to narrow down the field of suspects to those who exist here and now.  
  
**Holmes:**   
If we consider who could have gotten their hands on both Animusphere's theory and the Laplace software, and who possesses computational power on par with Trismegistus...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...then the guilty party must be the only  
one who could meet all such conditions.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'll admit that this was definitely a blunder on my part,  
but the fact is...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...when we brought the Shadow Border into the Chinese Lostbelt, it still had all the backup data we'd brought with us when we escaped from the Antarctic Chaldea.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I hate to say it, but at the time, I never considered the possibility that someone might seize and thoroughly analyze the entire Border.  
  
**Sion:**   
And of course, your other form in that Lostbelt&ndash;the one that had achieved total global domination&ndash;was a supercomputer.  
  
**Sion:**   
I really wish I had been able to see it for myself. I also  
wish we could have seen what happened there after we left.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. From what we were able to determine, it appears as though the Chinese Lostbelt disappeared rather quickly.  
  
**Holmes:**   
But of course, we had no way of determining how time may have passed on the inside. If its collapse came slowly, rather than suddenly...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...your mechanical counterpart would have had ample time to analyze the data they collected from the Shadow Border.  
  
**Sion:**   
And if that was not enough, your Singularity counterpart's remarks clinched it beyond any doubt.  
  
**Sion:**   
You may have thought you did a good job covering it up, but logically speaking, there is simply no way they could have figured out at a glance that you were from the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon.  
  
**Sion:**   
And that leaves just one possibility.  
  
**Holmes:**   
A version of you from the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon must have already made contact with your Singularity self.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Which means the mastermind behind this Singularity is not the Servant version of you that exists here at Chaldea...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...but rather, the mechanical version  
of you that ruled over that Lostbelt.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Are we wrong?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Hehe. Then tell us this: What would we possibly have to gain from Rayshifting once we knew we would be pruned away?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Even with Rayshifting, changing history would not be possible. The best we could hope to accomplish would be to generate a bit of space-time stagnation in the form of a minute Singularity.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
True. There's nothing anyone could do to avoid being subjected to the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But, if you were to go back in time far enough, you could definitely find a point when your timeline was still part of the Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Which explains why you insisted on coming  
along to this Xianyang Singularity.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I suspect the other Qin Shi Huang in the Lostbelt arranged for several Singularities of varying magnitude to see which one Chaldea detected...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...and as their accomplice, it was your role as Servant Qin Shi Huang to identify the Singularity in question.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
If a Lostbelt was ever going to generate a Singularity that could be observed from Proper Human History...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...it would have to be in their shared past, before the timeline diverged into Chronicle and Pruning.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And any Singularity taking place that far back in the past could be used to interfere with Proper Human History.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Look no further than the trap Goetia once set.  
  
**Sion:**   
The reason I accompanied you on that Rayshift was because I was concerned you might try something while you were there, but you gave no indication that you would do so.  
  
**Sion:**   
In which case, it is reasonable to assume that your true goal was something else.  
  
**Sion:**   
So I think you laid several traps...  
  
**Sion:**   
...with the goal of finding out which one you  
could use to invade Proper Human History.  
  
**Sion:**   
That was the reason you answered Chaldea's call  
when we summoned your Heroic Spirit, was it not?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
(Sigh) This sort of thing is exactly humanity's problem. You are all simply much too accustomed to war and conflict for your own good.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We could never bring this up  
in front of Fujimaru.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We needed to at least find out on our own  
exactly where your true intentions lie.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We swear... Did you think this through at all?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
If you knew you were going to accuse us like this,  
then you SHOULD have kept Fujimaru close at hand  
so [♂ he /♀️ she] could use [♂ his /♀️ her] Command Spells on us.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Your detective work may be sharp, but your shockingly naive lack of contingency measures in case we were the villain you believe us to be is exactly why we worry for Proper Human History's future.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
At any rate, we have already warned Fujimaru  
numerous times that if Proper Human History's humanity should end up as some intolerable abomination...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...we will establish our empire once again.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Then, you ARE planning to&ndash;  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Calm yourself. Before you truly lose your cool, let us remind you that we have not said we are going to put our plans into action.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Let us be clear: we have no intention  
whatsoever of getting in Fujimaru's way.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We came to Proper Human History so we could bear  
witness to [♂ his /♀️ her] fight, and we are happy to offer  
our assistance if [♂ he /♀️ she] should need it.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Remember, we have already abdicated our former throne.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...Then why go to all this trouble?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We have genuine trust that people such as  
Fujimaru will pave the way to a bright future.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
But, as we believe they say in your time, “Trust, but verify.” Indeed, as a politician, we are not willing to risk gambling with our world's welfare.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
So if there should ever happen to come a time...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...when Fujimaru and other people like [♂ him /♀️ her]  
are unable to overcome humanity's current crisis...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...then we shall step in and build a new humanity,  
where we are once again the only true person.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
**Sion:**   
...So you agreed to your contract with us while thinking we would fail? How is that not a betrayal?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
True, we are sure there are some Heroic Spirits who  
serve Fujimaru out of faith or friendship. However.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
While some fools may believe that a world which cannot be saved by good people is not worth saving at all...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...we do not number ourself among them.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Fujimaru and we are bound by honor,  
and defeating the Foreign God is a matter of justice.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
If there should ever come a time when we must weigh the two, we will choose the heavier one every time, for that is our duty as an arbiter.  
  
**Sion:**   
...So you are still claiming that your actions were only meant as a means of combating the great reset of humanity?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Consider it a form of insurance.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We are heaven-sent to rule over a world of humans. We will be damned if we allow a nonhuman invader to take this world for their own.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
If Fujimaru should one day triumph  
completely over the Foreign God...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...we will gladly admit we were being overly cautious, and forget all about these contingency measures.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Indeed, our original goal in rejecting all these  
Singularities was always to ensure a victory of the people.  
  
**Sion:**   
Good grief.  
  
**Sion:**   
I hope you are aware that it is difficult to take this seriously when we watched another version of you who succumbed to their ambition...minutes ago.  
  
**Sion:**   
(Though that being said, I certainly do not consider  
that spirit to actually be Qin Shi Huang.)  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
How many times must we tell you? We have overcome death and lived over two-thousand and two-hundred years longer than that younger self of ours.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Nor should you forget that we have attained enlightenment in the sage world. Do not doubt Zhenren like us when we say that our perspective has changed.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
Besides, while we thought this form of insurance might be a clever idea at first, we are no longer certain.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
There is just...something about this Rayshift system  
that does not sit well with us. It smells of evil.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Evil? How do you figure?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
The fact that you saw through our plot so easily means that the Crypters could easily do the same.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Well, much as I appreciate your caution, I can't say the same for your recklessness.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We swear, things would be so much easier...  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
...if you and Fujimaru and everyone else would simply emulate our way of thinking.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sure that would make your life much easier,  
but don't hold your breath. It ain't happening.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I can't speak for other places, but Novum Chaldea will never sign off on any kind of plan that requires sacrificing others' lives, for any reason.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Because a victory won like that wouldn't  
actually be a victory at all.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hmm. While there are some aspects to your  
way of thinking I could agree with...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...at present, our most pressing problem by far is  
removing the remaining Trees of Emptiness.  
  
**Holmes:**   
So I believe our alliance will continue to hold&ndash;at least, as long as we share a common enemy in the Foreign God.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I think so too. Plus, it also looks like a safe bet  
that you genuinely don't mean Fujimaru any harm.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But don't forget, Qin Shi Huang,  
we'll be keeping a close eye on you.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
If you do anything to betray Fujimaru's trust,  
you better believe we'll have some “contingency measures” of our own. Is that clear?  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
We were just about to say the same to you, Heroic  
Spirit. Fujimaru represents the potential held by  
the next generation of humans.  
  
**Qin Shi Huang:**   
So if you truly do not want us to reestablish our empire, you had best do everything in your power to  
ensure [♂ he /♀️ she] emerges victorious, no matter the cost.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou? Fooou!  
  
**Mash:**   
A-are you okay, Senpai?  
You're not coming down with a cold, are you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, I'm fine.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm okay. I just got chills for a second.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
True, you don't seem to have a fever. Hehe, maybe this  
means someone is talking about you behind your back.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If they are, I just hope they're saying something nice.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe. But for some reason, it feels like I'vegot the weight of the world on my shoulders...
