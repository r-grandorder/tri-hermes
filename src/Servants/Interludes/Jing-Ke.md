# Jing Ke  
  
## The Wind is Strong and the River Cold  
  
**Jing Ke:**   
Ah, Master and Mash. Good timing.  
There is a thing I want to ask you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sure, what's going on?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I want you to train with me. I want a simulated battle, but its setting is a little complicated.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Roman taught me how, and I memorized it...  
But, I have a bad feeling.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
My intuition never fails in this kind of situation.  
I'm sure I will kill, no, I will break that device.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see. That's one fantastic intuition.  
And, it's good you talked to us about it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let me take care of fine-tuning the settings.  
You can always count on me.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Oh, I appreciate it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, how do you want it?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Defeat the king, this is what I want to train.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. I suppose a situation similar to the one you were once in is all right?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Of course!  
That's the way it should be.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then, the simulated battle will start now.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
As you already know, I failed to assassinate the first emperor.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Nevertheless, I'm really thankful of Master for summoning me and letting me serve.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
But, I can't just relax like this.  
I must succeed, even if only virtually.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
To slay with this dagger, I'm still a little far.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
So, I will go one step closer.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...Of course.  
Soldiers rushed to his rescue.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Only unarmed civil servants were around the first emperor, but I can't expect such a good situation every time.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Then, let's start slaying them.  
As fast as possible. From now on speed is everything.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jing Ke:**   
And move another step forward. If there is a mage,  
he will summon something to protect the king.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Let's see.  
A tough, defensive golem would be perfect.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I must slay it instantly, too.  
Polish up the dagger's edge even more&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jing Ke:**   
And, it's almost over.  
Now, the only remaining prey is the king.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...I made a mistake here. I misjudged the emperor to be an immobile, corrupted man.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
He was tyrannical, but at the same time, he was great.  
I should've considered he could move and confront me.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
He knocked down my flying dagger, and ran away quickly while I was slightly shocked.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Yes, this is the end.  
I will take the king's head&ndash;let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jing Ke:**   
...Yes, this is the end.  
This is checkmate for the king.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Of course, in this case I'd perish too, but that can't be helped. Though virtual, I think it's good enough.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
After all, this is nothing more than a fabrication.  
The fact remains that I failed to assassinate the first emperor.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
But if I sacrifice my body, certainly I will be of some use to you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't want you to die.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't waste your life.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...Ah, you're right.  
I will gratefully accept your kindness.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
But unfortunately, this is the only way I know how to fight. And this is the reason I was summoned.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
You must use me.  
And when I vanish completely, lament for me.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Your tears are my everything.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
That way, I would be able to think that my sacrifice had served a purpose.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...Don't worry.  
That doesn't mean it will happen.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Until then, I'll enjoy this world with drink in hand.
