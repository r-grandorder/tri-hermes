# Artoria Pendragon - Lancer Alter  
  
## Unwakeable Dream, Unending War  
  
**Mash:**   
Is this a&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
battlefield?  
But from what era?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? What?  
Where are you guys?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It looks like some battlefield?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You've got all your arms and legs, right?  
Yeah, the both of you have proper vitals...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure what's going on, either.  
Doctor, how's it going on your end?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's see. According to my observations...  
You haven't made it to the Rayshift coordinates.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It looks like something interfered with the Rayshift process. Hmm...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, not interfered...  
If I were to phrase it properly&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Like Fujimaru was pulled somewhere suddenly, willingly?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? Really?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I really don't remember that.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait a second, Senpai.  
There's someone over there, at twelve o'clock.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lancer... Altria, right?  
Senpai, did you summon her?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I don't have time to talk.  
They're coming.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up something moving towards you!  
Judging by their momentum, they probably think you're enemies!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No choice. Get ready for battle!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master! They're human troops without any magical energy reaction, so&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Don't hold back.  
Take them all down.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-But we're up against&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Here they come. Get ready.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Battle complete.  
Hostile forces...have, uh, been eliminated? What's...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This is my battlefield.  
Though it might've been altered in this dream.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I wanted to make use of my lance, as much as possible,  
so I asked Master something I shouldn't have.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You did?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't remember.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
I got permission from you subconsciously.  
Sorry about that.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
My special characteristics as a Servant are what brought this about, I imagine.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Characteristics? Like a Reality Marble of some sort?  
But she doesn't have that kind of Noble Phantasm...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This inquiry bores me.  
Now&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Let's fight.  
All the easy ones are done with.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...A magical energy reading! I remember this feeling...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have something closely resembling its values on record!  
No doubt about it, this has to be her other self!  
  
   
**Altria?:**  
&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;There's another of her with a Holy Lance Rhongomyniad?! W-What's with double Rhongomyniads!?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
How interesting.  
The only one good enough for me is myself.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Let's go, Master.  
At any rate, if we don't defeat her, you can't return.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Guess we have no choice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, get ready for battle!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Master.  
Starting combat with the enemy Servant.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It smells of battle. Yes. I can't be satisfied by just taking out weak opponents.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
A warrior that fights with all they have.  
That is my desired opponent&ndash;  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...W-We managed to take her out.  
The battle is over...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whew... So it's over...  
I worked up a sweat just watching.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Altria?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Hmm.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe you wanted to fight by yourself?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe we shouldn't have interfered?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
No&ndash;  
I am your Servant, nothing more.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
My strength includes yours.  
I don't really consider this fight one-vs-many and unfair.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Though questions remain, so I can't say that I'm satisfied. But that was good enough for now.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
In any event, let's get back to your fight.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Give me a good battlefield to fight on,  
Master.
