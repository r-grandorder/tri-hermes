# Orion (Artemis)  
  
## Unsweet Honeymoon  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hello, Master! Are you here?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please leave.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not home.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
How mean!  
Darling, this Master is neglecting his duties.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Darling?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, please don't stare at me like that.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fuukaaaa!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
It's fine, it's all right, it's not like it'll hurt you.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Hmph!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You (Orion) are in trouble, aren't you?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
That's right. I'm in trouble.  
Physically.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please leave.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I just remembered something, gotta go.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling,  
This person is so heartless.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Just because Mash is here is no excuse!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
???  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...Just tell them what you want already.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay!  
Um, we want to go to France!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For what reason?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Our honeymoon!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please leave!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
We're here...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Wow, so this is France!  
It's wonderful! The air's so different than Greece!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sorry, she's being so selfish...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Let's get this honeymoon started!  
First, the Arc de Triomphe!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Arc de Triomphe was built in 1806,  
so it doesn't exist yet...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
How about the Eiffel Tower?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's 1887.  
If you're willing to wait another 450 years or so...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww! No way!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Right, right, are you done?  
Let's just wander around a bit and go home.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I really don't feel like going on a tourist trip...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Sigh... I guess we'll have to see the towns or something.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
But it's probably boring without the Arc de Triomphe or Eiffel Tower... Let's go, but don't expect too much.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww, it really is boring.  
The only things different are the buildings and clothes.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
There's people,  
there's dogs...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
And there's monsters...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Why are there monsters here?  
Oh, forget it. Let's just fight them! Help me out!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
What? I don't wanna!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Just do it!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okaay.  
It can't be helped, let's kill them!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew. I didn't expect to see monsters...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
What are they doing here?  
This world was repaired, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Something might be happening.  
We have to look into it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do that.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Agreed.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh? But our honeymoon...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Right, right. Well, the honeymoon's delayed.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Noooo...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, fine! Fine!  
Listen, Artemis.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
"This is our honeymoon."  
We're fighting monsters on our honeymoon.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
We'll sightsee and beat bad guys.  
Good times all around.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Orion...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sounds fun, right? Sounds great, right?  
I know it sounds totally fun to me!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Yeah, you're right!  
Darling, I love you!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Your love is way too clingy. No thanks.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
That's so mean!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master, do those two like each other, or not?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you think?  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm not sure.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're lovey-dovey.  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Love is... Very deep.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Where are we?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
An abandoned military camp, I think.  
There shouldn't be anything interesting here.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Yeah, the only interesting things would be...  
You see all those bags in the corner?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I do...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Body bags, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They are.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...They're moving around.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aah! That's scary!  
Orion, protect me!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
It's the other way around, dummy!  
I need you to protect me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So this time it's the living dead, huh?  
Artemis, let's fight!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay! Orion needs my help, which powers me up!  
Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Orion:**   
...Whew. That was hard work.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You did nothing.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You did something?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
Master, don't say that.  
It's depressing... It makes me really sad...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Sad Orion is so cute!  
Mmmmmmm!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
You'll crush me! You're crushing me!  
And I'm not cute, I'm cool!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Come on, let's go somewhere else. This time,  
I'd like someplace that doesn't smell like blood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-Okay, we'll go somewhere else.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...This place reeks of blood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry.  
But this castle should have been purified long ago&ndash;  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww, my honeymoon...  
Our trip as newlyweds...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Don't worry, as long as we defeat whatever's lurking here, I'm sure the smell will be gone.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hmph... I'm really irritated now!  
Whoever runs into me should just blame their fate!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Let's go, Orion, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Artemis:**   
Okay, we beat them!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sigh, oh brother...  
I'm tired (mentally, even though I did nothing)...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To think Lamias nested up in the castle...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
My honeymoon is ruined...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...Hmm?  
Hey, Artemis.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
What is it, Darling?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Here.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh? This is...a ring?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
The Lamia had it... Well, you want a ring for your honeymoon, right?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Listen, I know a ring I took off a Lamia isn't going to make you that happy&ndash;  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
No, I'll treasure it! I'll treasure it forever!  
Yay! Hooray!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sigh. Oh, brother...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Master, Mash.  
Sorry for the trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not at all.  
...I see. Their love is very complex.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it's kind of nice to watch.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I-It's not like that, okay!?  
This is... um... it's not like that!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No one likes a male tsundere.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
It's not like that, I said&ndash; Argh, whatever!  
Mash, just let me snuggle between your breasts!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please stop using me as a way to get out of trouble!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...What are you doing, Darling?  
You idiot! Idiot! IDIOT!  
  
  
## A Certain Love Song  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hey, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not here, leave!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not home!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Good answer, Senpai.  
But the door's already open so that won't work.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
What's up, guys?  
We've come to cause more trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, so trouble is guaranteed...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I want to go to America!  
Take me there!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No way!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can't!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...And here we are in America.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yay! Broadway!  
Let's go to Broadway, Darling!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Um... Broadway is...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not here.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
If you can wait another century or so...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww, I'm disappointed! But that's okay, anywhere's fun as long as I'm with Darling!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Come on, let's go!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sorry, can you come with us for a while?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Fine.  
Let's go.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Wow, it's a town! How wonderful!  
It feels just like a Western!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Are there cowboys?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think there are any in this era...  
Wait a minute. Why is there no one here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That cry... Is that...  
A wyvern?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, wonderful!  
A dragon!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Wait, I'm sick of dragons.  
We fought a bunch of them at sea.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I don't know who it is, but they suck at picking enemies.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, let's fight them!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Right, right. Let's do it!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
I don't see any Celtic warriors...  
I guess this wasn't their doing.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
It's strange, huh?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something bothering you?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
No, sorry.  
It's nothing.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I was just... Yeah, I was just thinking which I like better, Mash's legs or breasts.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
&ndash;Darling?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
No, um, well, wai&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aww,  
Orion is such a silly person.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He is a person, right?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm a person, okay!?  
This is just a temporary form, okay!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Sigh.  
Hey, Orion?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Huh? What is it?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
All these empty plains are boring me!  
We came all the way to America!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sigh, there's nothing we can do.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Then let me tell you this funny story about how I met this guy's wife when she was wearing nothing but&ndash;  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...That's not a funny story, is it?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
It's not, is... BWRAGH!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Like, sheesh! HMPH!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She just said “Hmph!”  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Hmm? Not again!  
First wyverns, now what!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Golems! Golems, I see!  
Fine, fine! I'll do it!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oww...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hmph!  
Where are all these monsters coming from?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Master?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Master!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...Sorry, but don't say anything.  
It's better if I tell her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh? What? Are you keeping secrets?  
Come on, you have to tell me, too!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...It's not a secret, but, um, well, you see...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...Basically, don't you think that all these monsters who show up in this world are our fault?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
&ndash;Huh?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I mean, I'm nothing special,  
but you're supposedly a god, right?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Even if not in your Divine Form, you still have some influence on this world.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Distorting it, opening holes and what have you...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
So it's kind of obvious that weird things are gonna pour out from there&ndash;  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...So what?  
I'm not allowed to go to other worlds?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Only where a Holy Grail War is being fought?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Well, I guess... that's how things look.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
WAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  
No, no, no, NO, NOOOO!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sigh, what do I do now...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I mean, I thought we could finally, finally go outdoors on a date!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Without having to sneak behind Big Brother's back!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I wanted to hold hands, and hug, and make out and stuff!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
WAAAAHHHH!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sigh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...W-What do we do, Master?  
She's bawling. She's totally bawling.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just leave it to Orion.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
Thanks, Master.  
Could you help with something else, too?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
What?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Does it really matter?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Does what...matter?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Does it matter if there are enemies?  
It doesn't mean you and I can't go out.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I mean, you're one of the gods of Olympus!  
Does a god really care if she causes others trouble!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
B-But I can't do that!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
You retaliated a hundredfold to those that peeked on you when you were taking a bath, didn't you?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
(Sob) You've got me there!  
But I was embarrassed!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Then it doesn't matter!  
What kind of god cares what happens to other people?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
But&ndash;  
  
   
**Orion:**   
One more thing! ...Throw those stupid worries that I'm going to hate you into Hades or something!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
It's too late! It's way too late for me to hate you for stuff like that now, dummy!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
(Sob...)  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A... A dragon!  
It's directly above us, and descending!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Artemis, you ready?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yeah... Yeah!  
That's right! I'm a god! I'm super-duper important!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
So I'm allowed to cause a little bit of trouble, right? 'Cause I'm a god!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
All right! Let's do this!  
Orion, get on my head like always!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Sure, sure, let's win this!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yeah!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Artemis:**   
Easy win!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Whew, I worked up a sweat!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
(Pant, pant) ...I say this all the time,  
but fighting as a plush toy is rough...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, hey! Hey! Master!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Um, I might cause a lot of problems for you in the future, but&ndash;  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Thanks for having me with you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm ready for it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Thanks! Teeheehee!  
I like you almost as much as Orion!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
If there's a god you like, let me know, okay?  
I'll introduce you!  
  
  
## Golden Anniversary!  
  
**???:**  
Master! Master! Please hide me, Master!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not here now, leave a message.  
   
**???:**  
Waaah! Your rejection hurts my poor little heart!  
I beg of you, Master!!!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
A murderer! I'm being chased by a bloodthirsty killer!  
It's a murderer in a red and green striped sweater and a hockey mask!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Orion, what's going on!?  
   
**Orion:**   
Just open up! We'll talk then!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Don't tell me you're not going to open up!?  
You devil! Oni! Artemis!!!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Daaarling♪  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, Lady Artemis has made her appearance!  
Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I understand!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
If this is about pretending to be Nursery Rhyme's partner to trick the female staff of Chaldea into fawning over me...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I regret my actions from the bottom of my heart!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...You were doing that?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Ah, so you didn't know...then forge&ndash;gyaaah!!! Please! Please don't twist me like that! I don't bend that way!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't see anything...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm going to bed...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yoo-hoo, Master! How are you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um... Who's that next to you?  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh this? It used to be Orion. Now it's a rag.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
You can use it to clean the floors!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Cut it out!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I thought I was going to die!  
Actually, I very nearly DID die!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, you're fine. I held back.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm good.  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yep, yep. Being good is a wonderful thing☆  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Does darling appreciate his health now, too?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Yes! Absolutely, yes! Especially with you!  
Hooray for health! Not hurting is wonderful!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, what's all this, then?  
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
...What is it?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, right! So I've been wanting to ask Master...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Golden...  
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
Wedding...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anniversary?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufoufoufoufou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, yes, Fou.  
Food time? Here you go.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Mash, that was a sad response.  
As a goddess, that absolutely infuriates me!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-my apologies. I was just surprised that it was a golden anniversary...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doesn't a golden anniversary mean...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it is a celebration for a couple who's been married for fifty years.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The celebration is said to have started in the year 1860 in Germany, and the custom spread throughout Europe.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, I see. It must have been a big deal if a couple was together for 50 years in the nineteenth century.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
No wonder people want to celebrate.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Isn't it wonderful? I admire that kind of celebration...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The custom is to give gifts of gold, or anything made in pairs.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...So what's this golden thing have to do with anything?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, um... Artemis, your marriage was quite recent...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'M STILL SINGLE!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
How cruel! But we did get married! Married! M-A-R-R-I-E-D!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
We even went on a honeymoon, and you even gave me a ring!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's having a tantrum...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Artemis is correct.  
You gave her a ring, and you went on a honeymoon.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Heh. Miss Mash. You've forgotten one critical thing: I'm a nice guy who goes around freely like a wandering cloud in the sky.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
From one journey to another, from port to port...  
I start from Greece and go all around the world.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you want to travel around the world...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To do a lot of Celtic-ing with a bunch of women.  
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
DAMN RIGHT!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
(Gasp!) Oh crap! I didn't mean to say that out loud!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Teehee. Is that so, Orion?  
Then I shall tear this wandering cloud to shreds!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
NOOOOOO!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I think this golden anniversary is a GREAT idea!  
Now that I think of it, we're Heroic Spirits...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...and Heroic Spirits essentially have no concept of time.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I feel like we've been together for fifty years already.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
You're absolutely right, darling! For fifty years, our love as a married couple has grown stronger!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's been brainwashed...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What makes this sad is that...though it could be harmful, this shouldn't be much of a hindrance to us if we don't do anything...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Now come, let's do a golden anniversary!  
Um, what do we do on a golden anniversary?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Shall we gather a bunch of humans with the golden touch, like King Midas?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please no.  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, you're right! A golden statue is nothing special these days! ...If that's the case, it has to be...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
A Rayshift trip to travel around the world!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Mash...)  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(Yes, I have a very bad feeling about this. They are definitely going to get Senpai in all kinds of trouble...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Let's just slowly back out of the room so they don't notice.)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!!!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Teehee, you're not getting away! Come, Master!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
You're going to help make sure our golden anniversary goes beautifully!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift successful.  
We have safely arrived at the French seaside.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good work, Master.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Ahhh, what a wonderful breeze! The ocean is outside my jurisdiction but that just makes it all the more exciting.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
We're in an era where I don't have to fight for territory. So let's have a nice, peaceful talk about our married life!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's Orion?  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Darling!?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hahahaha! Successfully escaped!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I mean, I know we'll eventually go back to Chaldea, so I am definitely going to get punished...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
But to hell with that!  
My name's Orion, the famed hunter of love!!!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm a hero with a real lust for life, if you know what I'm saying!  
Because when I'm around, it's always bear season, eyy!  
  
   
**???:**  
～♪  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Whoa! I spy a real sweet hottie over there!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I only see the back of her head, but it's a black-haired beauty! Prim and proper! Looks like I hit the jackpot!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Woohoo! I'm gonna snuggle her by pretending to be a cute creature!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
My body is a cute teddy bear!  
No one can resist a cute stuffed bear!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hewwo, pwetty wady, I'm Owion!  
  
   
**???:**  
...!  
  
   
**???:**  
What the...!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Ah!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
My goddess senses are tingling! I sense danger!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling... My darling's...skull...is getting caved in...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go save him!  
   
**Artemis:**   
Right! Hold on, my darling!  
We're coming to rescue you!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
And then afterwards, if you can explain to me IN DETAIL why you fled, that would be appreciated!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Artemis may be worried about Orion, but she is still REALLY angry...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh. Well, he'll be missed.  
   
**Artemis:**   
He's not dead yet!!!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Let's go, Master!  
Let's go and save my darling!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
There will be many mouths-to-mouths!  
Much smooching!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I hate to break this to you, but mouth-to-mouth won't be effective on a caved-in skull!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Ummm, according to my goddess senses, he should be around here...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
There!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Kyuuu...kyuu...kyu...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Orion...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Has turned into a creature that's only cute...  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
Come to your senses, Darling!  
I shall immediately do mouth-to-mouth on you!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hng!!! (Squeeze)  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Gagck!?  
...!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-S-S-S-S-S-Senpai! Orion's face is turning into something unbelievable! Even though he's only a bear! Even though he's only a plushie...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Punch Orion with all my might.)  
   
**Orion:**   
Ahhh... Aaaaaagck!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Pull Artemis away with all my might.)  
   
**Artemis:**   
Kyaaah!? Master, touching someone else's wife is fiendish!!!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
And doing so in front of Mash...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's fine! I know this is all a misunderstanding, so I'm not mad!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
I thought I was gonna die. Actually, I did die. TWICE! Once from my caved-in skull, and again from getting suffocated!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad you&ndash;  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Master. Have you ever wondered why you're alive?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A few times...  
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
We both...have it tough...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
My apologies... Something like a tiny wild animal jumped on me, so I punched it to smithereens without thinking...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Martha...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes, I know! I know what you are thinking!  
But I hope you understand my predicament as well!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
As you know, in this getup, I become more aggressive than usual.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
So...I couldn't help it... I'm sorry! I regret my actions!  
So much so, I will double my praying time!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
This woman's amazing.  
That was the first time I ever felt my insides leaking out.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
His first time... How dare she be my darling's first!!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
This is unforgivable! You're supposed to be a saint... Have you no shame!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
The only person who can hurt my darling is me!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh boy. Aren't you just full of cheerful bloodlust.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And she's your wife.  
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
What. A. Let. Down.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Uh, um... I'm not sure if I can say this, given that I was the one who directly inflicted this holy punishment...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Actually, I am not foolish enough to get involved in lovers' quarrels or domestic disputes...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm not like that, but...Artemis!  
Your love is a bit too aggressive!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
First of all, love should be tender, even when you're hurting your beloved.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No matter how fiendish, devilish, demonic, or even...um, ursine your partner is&mdash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I can say with certainty that unrequited love is no good!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
It's not unrequited! We are very much in love!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm actually a little hurt to be called fiendish, devilish, and demonic.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No. If it truly was a mutual love, no married man would so casually hit on another woman.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Even if Orion is guilty, I can see that Artemis also has need for improvement and reform.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I do not intend to criticize the ways of the Greeks, but I am called the patron saint of wives!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Artemis and Orion! I shall correct your twisted, unrequited love with my holy fists!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is going to hurt...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Head trauma, here I come...  
  
  
---  
   
**Martha:**   
Well, yes, I'm afraid that's the plan! Don't worry.  
I will make sure not to hurt you much, Fujimaru!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Artemis:**   
Ungh... She's tough! Darling, were you holding back!?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
'Course not! I always take battle seriously!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Mnnngh...as obsessive and unhealthy as it is, love is still love...I suppose.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And based on Orion's behavior, it doesn't seem like it is completely unrequited love...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
That's right! Our love is mutual... It is!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mutual love... To think of others, and love others.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It doesn't appear that way... No, but maybe...those two seem to have some bizarre sort of love of their own...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Even if they do not follow the same path, or if it's unrequited, as long as they respect one another, that may be fine...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Well, there are indeed very dangerous unrequited affections in this world...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And yet... I suppose...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Either way, I seem to have jumped to conclusions. One cannot say that just understanding each other can be called love.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm sorry, Artemis. And Bearion.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No matter what form it takes, love is unchanging, and it is one of the primal emotions. One should love greatly, and so find great happiness.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Our beliefs may differ, but love is the same all around! Orion, let's love each other to the fullest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh? I thought my head felt light. Darling's gone.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He sneaked away a minute ago.  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Daaarrrliiing!!!  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Orion:**   
Fwahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I don't know how or where I escaped to, but looks like I ended up in a different world!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
What should I do? It'll be scary if I get found now. Maybe I should hide out here for a couple of days until things cool down.  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh? Oh my, oh my.  
A guest. It's a guest! And it's a bear!  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, sir! Are you the one she's been waiting for?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Not sure what you're talking about, but sure!  
  
   
**???:**  
I see. Then we need to have a wedding!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Uh, actually, wrong person!  
I mean, wrong bear!  
  
   
**???:**  
It's a wedding! The entire country is going to party!  
The princess will surely be pleased!  
  
   
**???:**  
Her prince has come back!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Time to be a sneaky bear...  
  
   
**???:**  
No! You can't run away! (Grab)  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Gyaaah! Let go! You got the wrong bear!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Nothing good can come of me posing as a prince in a fairytale place like this!  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't be so naughty!  
  
   
**???:**  
A bad prince like you...needs to turn into a ■■■!  
  
   
**???:**  
This curse won't break until the princess kisses you!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...What the heck!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Here! I've got darling's scent!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm exhausted.  
   
**Mash:**   
You really are getting dragged around the world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Where could Orion have fled to so quickly?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean...the scent of your prey?  
   
**Mash:**   
Master's burn doesn't have the usual sting...  
Maybe because jet lag has [♂ him /♀️ her} worn out?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
What a cute town...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
After our golden anniversary celebration, I would love to live in a home like this!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Master, since you saved the world, I want you to find a nice property for me!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
And I want you to live nearby, so we can be neighbors!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
You know, it's important to have good neighbors!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good neighbors...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Now all I need is my darling...  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh? Oh my, oh my.  
There are so many visitors today!  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm so happy. Adults and children both are welcome in the Land of Sweets!  
  
   
**???:**  
Why? Because I can just turn the adults into children, and then it's fine!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nursery Rhyme...!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh my, you are a cutie.  
But... I'm sorry, my heart belongs only to my darling!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
But that strange fate of yours, make sure you treasure it, okay?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Anyway, have you seen my darling?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Darling...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The talking stuffed bear.  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh no... You can't! That prince bear is the princess's!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...What did you just say?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
The prince has finally come home to his sweet princess!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
And we're going to hold a grand wedding party to celebrate! You can't steal someone's true love in a fairytale!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Oh? Uh-huuuh...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey Master. Sounds like my darling is at the princess's place.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
How strange. If he's not here, where could he be?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master...this is bad! This is very bad!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm afraid the Land of Sweets is going to be set on fire, melting the chocolates and candies... Even the cakes will get charred!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Calm down!  
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
It's fine. I am calm.  
But I will never forgive Orion.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
A grand party with a princess...  
This isn't an affair... This is the real deal!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
This was supposed to be a happy golden anniversary celebration...but to learn that he's in another serious relationship...! Orion, you dummy!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Protect the Land of Sweets, everyone!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure if they're enemies...but let's ready for battle, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Kyuuu. I'm dizzy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Poor Nursery Rhyme is down!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I will not allow my darling to get married! I'll capture that bear and take him to file divorce papers right away!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, and Master, use your authority to annul the marriage! That way, he won't be a divorcé!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling, where are you!?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Um... Excuse me... Are you perhaps looking for a bear?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Brynhild!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Are you the homewrecker!?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Please, no... It is not what you think...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I wanted to return him to you.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Come again?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling! No... Look at you...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I thought I saw a similar-looking chocolate during last year's Valentine's Day...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's mouthing something...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“Help...”  
  
  
---  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Um... I was searching for Sigurd...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Nursery brought this bear thinking he was Sigurd...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Even when I said he wasn't, she wouldn't listen. She said, “He may be a chocolate bear right now, but he'll turn into Sigurd when the curse is lifted.”  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
And so I was a little flustered.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is there a way to lift the chocolate curse?  
  
  
---  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes... According to Nursery...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You KISS him!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You what, now?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Kiss!?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, that's right. Kissing him will lift the chocolate curse!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
His bear curse may also get lifted, but I'm not sure, since that's not my specialty!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So that's why Brynhild was flustered... She was afraid that whoever could lift the curse wouldn't show up if she left.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes, I was at a loss.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
This bear is not Sigurd, but there is no doubt he is a hero.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
No matter what form he'd taken, as a former Valkyrie,  
I didn't feel right abandoning him...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey Master, why do you think darling tries to escape?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Weddings, golden anniversary celebrations... They don't really matter to me... Well, I might not go that far.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
But as long as my darling just stays with me... As long as he and I can live together forever, for eternity...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
That's all I really need.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's scared he'll start to hate you.  
   
**Artemis:**   
Scared...that he'll hate me?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...That may be correct.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
No matter how intimate a man and woman might be, if they are together for long enough, they may end up killing each other.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
That is not because of pure hatred, but hatred that stems from love.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
The more one loves, the stronger their wish not to detest or be detested becomes.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Human emotion is not something that is constant...  
But it shines all the brighter for it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He loves, therefore he wants to be pursued.  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I know! I know!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
The prince falls for Cinderella when she flees!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That bear flees from you because he wants you to always feel excited!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Because eternity is too boring!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
When you're super bored, you might start hating the person you're with!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's why you flee! The chase keeps you interested in the other person!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Artemis:**   
...I see. So that's how human emotions work.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
As a Divine Spirit, that kind of thinking is incomprehensible to me. I can't imagine eternity being...uncertain...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...True, it may not be something you can comprehend.  
I really only understand it in theory.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Eternity is boring... So you say.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aw, my darling is impossible! He wants me to keep loving him by making me so anxious!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Fine. If that's what he wants, I'll chase after him for eternity!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
As long as my heart swells from the occasional, whimsical kindness from him, I will go absolutely crazy for my darling!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Yes, yes, my Maiden Circuits are in overdrive! Now, my darling! I shall lift your dreadful chocolate curse!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Good morning, my darling!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Eh? Huh? I thought I was chocolate...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Ack! Artemis!? I-I'm sorry I ran away!  
It was just a spur of the moment thing! I swear!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Yep! It's fine, my darling. I forgive you!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Eh, seriously!?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Normally this kind of offense would result in you reducing me to my constituent atoms!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Wait, did I end up in a parallel world? Is this for real?  
Oh, no, I'm in a world that's gonna get pruned, aren't I!?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, but if it's a parallel world...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Come, my darling. Let's continue our golden anniversary celebration!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Where shall we go next? It is a golden anniversary, so maybe the Temple of the Golden Pavilion in Japan?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Or perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Anywhere is fine. As long as I'm with my darling, it will be wonderful!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Why hello there, delicate-looking girl.  
I don't see much of your type in Greece.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
How would you like to escape into a love adventure, hmm?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Um... I can't... My lance will become lighter and lighter...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It could even float up and away like a balloon...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Wha&ndash;whoa!?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay, my darling.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Let's go get you set on fire at the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. It's fine, you'll burn well!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Or the Golden Gate Bridge is fine too.  
You can bungee jump without a rope!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Well, I guess that's one way to go...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...What the heck am I making clever commentary for!? Aaand Artemis is just her usual self!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
HEEELLLP MEEE!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master, do you have any closing remarks?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Love takes so many forms!  
   
**Brynhild:**   
That wasn't...much of a closing remark...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Love is scary!  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That's my line.
