# Vlad III - Apocrypha  
  
## Legend of Dracula I  
  
**Vlad III:**   
History is a cloth woven from truth and dreams.  
At times the truth is too brutal, so we paint over it with our dreams.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...However, there are those who embrace delusions.  
They crush the truth, and delight us with deception.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;That is to say, to be frank, I will not forgive "Dracula."  
Not ever.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;Are you awake?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's happening now?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Has something happened?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry, Master.  
I know it's late.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Vlad has something he wants to talk to you about.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;It's mixed.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mixed?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My memories. You see, I was born the second son of my father, Vlad II, and was ruler of Wallachia.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Although I was driven to misfortune, I have no regrets over my life.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
However&ndash;since my materialization as a Servant,  
I have been haunted by a different memory.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Could those be of&ndash;Dracu...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I apologize.  
Please continue your story.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You're right. The memories of that dreaded vampire.  
People I've never seen before glare at me, and try to drive a stake through my heart.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...The hearts of men! They are full of absurd naivety and incorrigible stubbornness.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
They affix imaginary personalities, imaginary histories, and imaginary stories to reality.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But they have no idea how much trouble those affected are going through. Therefore, heed my orders.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Travel with me to a different era, and eliminate the imaginary history. &ndash;It should be easy.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Even imaginings are based on real tales, and those tales have authors.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
We will bring an end to them. It should be easy for us.  
&ndash;Don't tell me, you're going to say no?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course not.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...W-Well, that's right.  
Defamation is a problem that can't be ignored.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Regardless of the outcome, or how we arrived at it...  
Revealing the truth is the right thing to do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You think we can?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. At least I think so.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Once we start tracking Dra...'s footsteps, the place with the highest magical energy response...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...will most likely be the origin of Dra...'s legends.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's just that... Can the commonly known legend of Dra... be erased that easily?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Why are you still talking?  
I gave you an order. Hurry and make haste.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, sir.  
All right, let's get going.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're in London.  
We're picking up a strong magical energy response here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Most likely, the biggest difference between the original Vlad and the vampire Vlad is whether he visited London or not.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Normally, Vlad has no connection with this place whatsoever.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;So, this is London. I see.  
What a dreadful place.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Naturally, Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra never actually existed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, it's possible there were actual women being attacked, and having their blood sucked&ndash; Women who resembled the characters.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Fine.  
Commence your investigation.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, sir.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But we have no clues at all.  
Doctor, do you have anything on your end?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well... I have picked up several small traces of magical energy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it's hard to say if those are powerful enough to establish the legend of Dracula.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I'll keep trying!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;No, that's fine. I'm well aware of your devotion to this task. However, it vexes me that there's nothing I can do.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It's true that later generations would brand me a tyrant for my reign.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
However&ndash;even so, I am sure it wasn't enough for people to start calling me Dracul.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Vlad...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
That was&ndash;the cry of a woman!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I picked up a strong magical energy response.  
Mash, you should go take a look.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I will accompany you.  
Right&ndash;I hope we run into this vampire.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Please...stop...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;"Kazikli Bey."  
  
   
**Woman:**   
What?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...I see. This is quite intriguing.  
Look, Mash and my Master!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Completely unfitting for this era, for this place&ndash;  
On appearance alone, this is indeed "Dracul."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
A monster that transforms into a bat,  
and preys on human flesh&ndash; Truly despicable.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Prepare for your death, you heinous bat. In my current rage, I don't care if you're the Devil himself... I'll crush you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That sound just now...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It looks like he's calling his allies. Fine. Saves me the trouble of hunting them down. How efficient.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Oh how I wish every war was like this.  
Wouldn't you agree, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You are absolutely right.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's crush them all right here.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I couldn't agree more, Master!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Let the devastation commence!  
Otherwise&ndash;show us just how much of a devil you are!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Vlad III:**   
Hmph. Perish without a trace, you filthy beasts.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You, girl.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Y-Yes?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Worry not. This beast shall no longer trouble you.  
Return to your home, and indulge in peaceful slumber.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Y-Yes, sir.  
Pardon me&ndash; What is your name, sir?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Vlad III. Remember it.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Hmm. I believe it's safe to assume the history has returned to its proper path.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, yes.  
I think&ndash;this will do the trick.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Magnificent!  
Then let us return.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Sorry for forcing you to accompany me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, not at all.  
It's quite all right.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Yes. Tonight you should rest as much as you like.  
I will be in my spirit form.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Even if we correct history,  
the chance for the legend of Dracula to be erased is...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pretty low?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Almost none at all?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But, for Vlad&ndash;this IS his wish for the Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who knows what might actually happen?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But at the very least, people's perception of Vlad III might change&ndash; That would be a miracle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All we can do now is hope and watch.  
  
  
## Legend of Dracula II  
  
**Vlad III:**   
Hm... London again? We've already taken care of that devil... Is there something else?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure, but we picked up something in in the area.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Perfect, then! Even the defeat of a small foe would be a worthy addition to my legend!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My name remains infamous, but I shall not be known as demonic nor as vampiric.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Very well. Let's go, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do our best!  
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Ah. It seems we've found it. It seems our foe is a mere wraith this time, rather than a devil.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, but that doesn't mean it is not malicious.  
The Demonic Fog still seems to be lingering in the city.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It may normally be “just a wraith,” but right now it's a deadly evil spirit.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Heeelp...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go rescue her!  
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Oh, I know. I shall do what I did before: Kazikli Bey!  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Wh-what!?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Woman. Stand back.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
That creature has crept into your world, but it is a being that should not exist.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Touch it and you will die.  
If you value your life, leave!  
  
   
**Woman:**   
B-but, but...I can't...move...!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Oh... Then I have no choice.  
Master, stay back and protect her.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I shall impale that wraith.  
Normally, my stakes are reserved for punishment...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
To threaten to harm civilians even after death... Unforgivable! I shall destroy you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Vlad III:**   
Vanished like the mist. How petty.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But with the Singularity gone, how could there be a problem with evil spirits...?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I suppose I should expect as much from a demonic city like London...  
  
   
**Woman:**   
U-um. Thank...you...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get home safe.  
  
  
---  
   
**Woman:**   
Thank you very much...!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Wait.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Y-yes?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My name is Vlad III. Remember it, keep it within your heart, and live the rest of your life to your fullest.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And listen.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Some of the things I do may seem odd, but I am in no way related to vampires.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Understood?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
UNDERSTOOD?  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Y-yes!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Hm. Now at least that woman will never think of me as a vampire.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Well, let's continue.  
Mash Kyrielight, have you found anything?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes... In the northern part of the city, there is a response very similar to the devil we just saw.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, just like last time, it is a weak response.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...This is just speculation, but there is a high possibility that it's a Demonic Beast that we're just assuming is a devil.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's likely here because of the residual Demonic Fog still in the area.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Or perhaps it was summoned for some purpose related to magecraft.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is... Could this be a summoning circle of some sort?  
  
   
**Man:**   
A monster!  
Monster!!!  
  
   
**Man:**   
Get to safety now!  
Hey, you too...!  
  
   
**Man:**   
It's surely the devil!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Ah. So this is the devil.  
Laughable. It's no more than a beast gone mad.  
  
   
**Man:**   
H-hey, you...!?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I shall quite literally rip you to shreds!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Vlad III:**   
What trifling nuisances.  
Such pathetic opponents may even weaken my spear.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Wh-who the hell are you?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Ah. You ask my name.  
Then I shall answer.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My name is Vlad Tepes.  
You there, repeat it...  
  
   
**Man:**   
U-um...Vlad Tepes?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Correct. If it's hard to say, you may simply call me Vlad III. Either way, there's one very important thing you must remember.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Listen well: Vlad III is NOT a vampire.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Repeat!!!  
  
   
**Man:**   
Vlad III is not...a vampire?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Very good!  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Vlad III:**   
Now all that's left is the mage.  
I will not ask him to come to me.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
No...I'll chase him round perdition's flames before I give him up. I shall show them what it is to be Lord Impaler.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
...Wh-who the hell are you guys?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You do not know me?  
I am Vlad Tepes&ndash;  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Vlad III...of Wallachia? You lie.  
Lord Vlad perished long ago!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Yes, that is correct.  
I fought and died as the ruler of Wallachia.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
What is done is done. The story of my life has been swallowed in the annals of history. However, I will not tolerate anyone who glosses over the truth in later years.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
...What are you talking about?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
There's no need for you to know.  
After all, I'm going to destroy you.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Ack! N-no!  
Summon...I summon thee! Come forth! Save me!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Help me...!!!    
   
**Mash:**   
A summoning circle...!  
Is he trying to summon something again!?  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Ahhh! It's here... It's here!  
Kill them! Kill them all...!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Now what has he summoned this time?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This's a super giant organism reaction... Could it be...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did he manage to summon...a dragon to the 19th century...?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
There's no need to be surprised.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
The seven eras had stood once under fire. If they are undergoing repairs, it wouldn't be surprising something like this can happen.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Y-yes... I did it! My clan's ambitions have finally been fulfilled!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Using this dragonkin, I shall bring all of London's mages under my command!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Now all the Lords of the Clock Tower will be erad&mdash;  
  
   
**Mage:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The mage...!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Gyaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!  
It's... IT'S EATING MEEEEEE!!!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Why!? I was the one who summoned it...! Why!?  
Sto&ndash;Gyaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Pathetic. Only through luck and coincidence did he succeed in his summoning. Without the ability to control his thrall, there is no point summoning it.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Fine.  
O almighty Phantasmal Beast... Dragonkin!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My father revered thy name, and deemed thy form perfect for battle!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And as his son, I have been despised by my enemies, by the people, by history itself... Not as a dragon, but as the devil!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And now, I shall grapple with thee...a being Father deemed perfection itself. What irony!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But I am grateful for this evil fortune! It may be twisted, but I will make a most worthy opponent for you!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I, Vlad III, the son of Dracul...shall sink my fangs into your neck!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Dragonkin...incoming!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do this!  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Indeed! Taste my deadly spear!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Protect the people of the city!  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Yes! How like my Master to be conscious of such a thing, even in a situation like this!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
If we were in the right era, you might have made a respectable king.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Now, let's do this!  
  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Vlad III:**   
...Impressive, dragonkin. As a creature that possesses part of my name, you truly were a worthy opponent.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's the opposite, my lord.  
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Ahem.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I suppose we've managed to improve my name's ill repute here.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
A mysterious hero who saved London from a dragonkin... Not bad. Not bad at all...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(If it's mysterious, then no one will know it was him...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh no! A crowd is gathering!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's move out! Master, Vlad...hurry!  
  
   
**Man:**   
U-um...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Hm? What is it?  
  
   
**Man:**   
If it's all right...may I take a photograph with you?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
A photograph? Hm. I'll allow it.  
Master. Let's take it together.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that... C-can we do that...?  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I'll allow it.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Even that Saint George&ndash;Georgios&ndash;has made a hobby of it. That surely means it is not something that would give offense to God.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Master. My collar is not crooked, is it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-is this okay?  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Ha... I have knowledge of the modern world. I know very well that such contraptions don't steal one's soul.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Pity it will be monochrome, though...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I think Vlad is missing the point...)  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Man:**   
Here we go!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-this picture's not going to be left for future generations, is it...?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Do not worry. Even if it were, nobody would know what kind of photo it was anyway.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It is destined to turn to dust someday, much like that dragonkin we just defeated.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I appreciate you accompanying me on my endless journey to fulfill my desires.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It may be futile. It may all be in vain.  
It may be a meaningless and ludicrous journey.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But such a thing is not to be fought. It is not in my nature to be abashed.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And. While I savor all of these endeavors...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I simply cannot take pride in the fact that I am a vampire. Not ever.
