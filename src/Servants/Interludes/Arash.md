# Arash

## Lonely Soldier, Brave As a Lion

**Arash:**
...We've got barely any equipment. Be careful, okay?

 
**Arash:**
You need to prepare to go into the forest.
You can't just walk in there.

 
**Arash:**
But, well, I guess this isn't a real forest, right?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, this is a battle simulation.
I want combat data for forested areas, you see.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So I thought bringing a veteran Heroic Spirit would be good experience for Fujimaru.

 
**Arash:**
What an honor. My job is keeping Fujimaru from being too reckless, right?

 
**Arash:**
It'll be hard to take it slow, but I am sure you'll get something out of this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks!
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, leave it to me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's just you and me this time.
 
**Arash:**
That's right.
Let's do this.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
...I'll be watching the Command Room this time.
Sorry, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
B-But I'll help in any way I can!
I'll watch for any enemies that might show up!

 
**Arash:**
Hmm? Can't you guys make enemies appear and disappear?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nah, it would be boring doing that every time.
This time I had them appear randomly.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So if you tell them where the enemies are, all that programming work I did will be wasted...

 
**Mash:**
No, Doctor. Just think of this as practice for providing support from the Command Room.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But is there any point in you doing that?

 
**Mash:**
We're training to be ready for everything. Isn't that right, Doctor?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm counting on you.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, I'll do my best!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Next time, you will come too.
 
**Mash:**
Yes! I'd love to!

 
**Arash:**
Sorry, missy, I'll be borrowing your Master for a little.

 
**Arash:**
I'll get your Master back safe... Wait a second.
You don't get hurt in a combat simulator, right?

 
**Mash:**
That's right, but serious injury will result in minor psychological trauma...

 
**Mash:**
That goes for Servants too.
Arash, please be careful.

 
**Arash:**
I'll be fine. I'll protect your Master for you.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is practice for fighting without Mash, too.
Though Mash will always be with you during Rayshifts...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...it's quite possible that you two will get separated upon arrival.

 
**Mash:**
It's hard to imagine me leaving Senpai's side, but&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
But you're right. We can't be sure it won't happen.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's true.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. If we ever Rayshift into space, it will take us some time to rendezvous.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll never leave you, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you, Senpai.
I'll try my best to stay with you always...

 


---
 
**Arash:**
Hmm... What was it? It's...

 
**Mash:**
Arash, is something wrong?

 
**Arash:**
I think there's a phrase to describe you two.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

 
**Arash:**
Deeply connected? Best friends?
No, no, no. Um, let me see.

 
**Arash:**
Deeply in love?

 
**Mash:**
A-Arash!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe...he's right?
 
**Mash:**
Not you too!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Y-You're making me blush!
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, um...well...

 


---
 
**Arash:**
It's important, right?
A Master and Servant are&mdash;

 
**Arash:**
No, I guess not. It doesn't matter whether you're human or not.

 
**Arash:**
You're comrades, risking your lives together.
It's best for you to get along.

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. But wait, that doesn't just go for me...

 
**Mash:**
...but for all the Servants who've contracted with Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
You too, Arash. We're all comrades, risking our lives together, right?

 
**Arash:**
Huh? Yeah... you're right.

 
**Arash:**
Come to think of it, you're right.
Haha, I tried to act cool, and it failed, huh?

 
**Serenity:**
...Arash is a great man.
Many know his name.

 
**Serenity:**
Many know his deeds as well.
Even today he is widely respected in Western Asia.

 
**Serenity:**
His name and achievements are carved in legends, and sung in songs.

 
**Serenity:**
Yes, song.
Did you not know this, Master?

 
**Serenity:**
The song survives to the present day.
Shall I sing a little?

 
**Serenity:**
“He&mdash;”

 
**Serenity:**
“He stood on the top of Mount Damavand, and readied the arrow of fate.”

 
**Serenity:**
“His name was Arash, and the rising sun was his friend.”

 
**Serenity:**
“...The generals sing of his victory.”

 
**Serenity:**
“Strong, pure Arash, with all of his life, fired but a single arrow.”

 
**Serenity:**
“Two countries were engulfed in the flames of war, and with his arrow he saved them both.”

 
**Serenity:**
“All eyes were shocked as his deed, and his bravery became a legend.”

 
**Serenity:**
“His arrow was faster than the fastest comet.”

 
**Serenity:**
“Afterwards he was never seen, and his name alone became legend.”

 
**Serenity:**
“The other side of the Oxus River became the new border. By its clear waters both countries built peace.”

 
**Serenity:**
“He is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.”

 
**Serenity:**
I changed a bit, but it was mostly like this...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...A lonely warrior?


---
 
**Serenity:**
Yes. Thus it is said.

 
**Serenity:**
Arash was the great hero of Western Asia.
He lived and fought alone, they say, in the distant past.

 
**Serenity:**
...The truth however, is unknown.

 
**Serenity:**
A legend is a legend. It does not always represent the truth.

 
**Serenity:**
Records are the same way. They are not absolute.

 
**Serenity:**
I cannot say for sure...
But...

 
**Arash:**
What's wrong, Master? Space out in the forest and you'll walk right into a tree.

 
**Arash:**
Don't drop your guard even in a battle simulation, or else you'll get hurt. Even here, you'll go numb, right?

 
**Arash:**
It's not just trees you'll be running into.
There's beasts and monsters about too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Monsters?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Like chimeras and stuff?
 


---
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, a forest is nature's home.
So of course, there are monsters here.

 
**Arash:**
The mages would call it... “Mystics,” was it?
They may be rare, but monsters are a part of nature.

 
**Arash:**
They were common in my day.
The king I served was a descendant of a dragon slayer.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A dragon?
 
**Arash:**
That's right, and a strong one, too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...A wyvern, or something?
 
**Arash:**
You mean the subspecies of western dragons?
No, I think it was worse than that.

 


---
 
**Arash:**
Real dragons are rare, but they do exist out there.

 
**Arash:**
They say there aren't many left these days, but the Rayshifts send you to the past, right?

 
**Arash:**
So stay focused in the forest. Mash, the Doctor, and the other Servants can protect you.

 
**Arash:**
You're the core of the battle, Fujimaru. We need your power to summon Heroic Spirits and use Command Spells.

 
**Arash:**
Win or lose, it's up to&mdash;

 
**Arash:**
Your orders... Whoa!

 
**Mash:**
I've detected random monsters!
Wait, some have already been defeated?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Arash's Arrow Construction skill!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He was blessed by the goddess Armaiti, and is a legendary bowyer too!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He can make and fire arrows using magical energy in real time!

 
**Arash:**
There's your explanation.
They're coming, Master! Let's do this!

 
**Arash:**
Give me your orders. First we take some out, and then...

 
**Arash:**
We retreat as fast as we can.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Retreat?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Couldn't we just wipe them out?
 


---
 
**Arash:**
They're random monsters. There's probably no need to, but...

 
**Arash:**
If these things are “natural,” then a larger pack might be nearby.

 
**Arash:**
It's like seeing an enemy scout.
There might be an army nearby.

 
**Arash:**
Always go into training like it's the real deal!
Picture the risks you might face on the battlefield!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You may be right!
 
**Arash:**
Haha! Right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't we just tiring ourselves out for nothing?
 
**Arash:**
Hahahaha! Come on, don't be like that!

 


---
 
**Arash:**
First, we fight! Then we retreat at top speed! Let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Arash:**
...The sun's set.

 
**Arash:**
The forest can be a little rough at night.
You'd feel better with some light, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hold on a second.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I ran so fast I'm out of breath.
 


---
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, take some rest. We ran, but that doesn't mean we've escaped from the enemy.

 
**Arash:**
To survive in the forest, you need water, food, and a safe place to rest.

 
**Arash:**
It's different than fighting in battle.

 
**Arash:**
We've got some water and food, yeah?
Not a lot, since this is a simulation.

 
**Arash:**
I can keep us safe. There are no enemies around, and even if one randomly appears...

 
**Arash:**
I'll protect us.
Until you're ready for combat.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.
 
**Arash:**
It's fine. I'm your Servant, you know.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can you see what's around us?
 
**Arash:**
Sure can.
I've got “good eyes.”

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry to keep dragging this out.
I'm worried about Fujimaru's stamina.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I want some night combat data too, so I hope you don't mind keeping this up.

 
**Mash:**
Don't push yourself too hard, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
I have a real dinner prepared.
It'll be waiting for you when you're done.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looking forward to it.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. So am I.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Simulator food is flavorless.
 
**Arash:**
You're right. These are called rations, right?
They're not bad...

 
**Arash:**
But not good either. I miss beer.

 


---
 
**Arash:**
I've started a fire, don't get cold.
Lie down and rest if you want.

 
**Arash:**
Rest when you can. Eat when you can. Even outside the forest, keep that in mind in order to fight.

 
**Arash:**
I'm sure you know that by now, yeah?

 
**Arash:**
You've Rayshifted many times already.
You've retrieved many Grails from many eras.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess I have a lot of experience.
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, it's impressive.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It doesn't seem real to me.
 
**Arash:**
Doesn't it? ...No, maybe that's just how it is.

 


---
 
**Arash:**
Fujimaru, can I ask you something?

 
**Arash:**
You've fought a long time, right?
Trying to save the world.

 
**Arash:**
How are you doing? Are you feeling tired?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's kind of rough.
 
**Arash:**
...I see.

 
**Arash:**
That's right. It's okay to say how you're feeling.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can still keep going!
 
**Arash:**
...I see.

 
**Arash:**
Don't push yourself too hard, Fujimaru.

 
**Arash:**
You may be the only Master who can Rayshift, but well, you know...

 


---
 
**Arash:**
There's a limit to how much a single person can do.

 
**Arash:**
You have your Servants. You have Roman and Da Vinci at Chaldea.

 
**Arash:**
And... you have Mash. She's your partner, and she worries about you more than anyone.

 
**Arash:**
So don't try to do everything by yourself.
When things get tough, you can say so.

 
**Arash:**
It's not as if you're fighting alone.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I've got you, too.
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, that's right.

 
**Arash:**
I'm here, too. If you need me, I'll be your strength.

 
**Arash:**
If you're saving the world, I'll be at your side with my bow.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn't random, it comes with advance notice!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!

 
**Mash:**
It's time, Senpai!
The last battle of the day!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is this coming from your experience?
 
**Arash:**
...Maybe it is.

 
**Arash:**
When I was still alive on Earth...

 
**Arash:**
I tried to do everything myself.
I tried to save everything myself.

 
**Arash:**
The slain, their killers, plunderers, their victims. Everything. Everyone on the earth I could see.

 
**Arash:**
...I tried to save the world.

 
**Arash:**
The world was still so small back then.
So I told myself that maybe I could do it.

 
**Arash:**
I was formed from remnants of the Age of Gods.
I'm tougher than a human, and I possess some Mystics.

 
**Arash:**
My limbs. My eyes. My knowledge.
The Goddess gave me many things.

 
**Arash:**
I fought. I fought alone, under the banner of the dragon-slaying king...

 
**Arash:**
I kept fighting, to end a war that lasted decades.

 
**Arash:**
Both my king's nation and the enemy were exhausted.
A mess.

 
**Arash:**
Nobody wanted to fight anymore.

 
**Arash:**
So I ended it.
By myself.

 
**Arash:**
The king's people, the enemy's people, everyone wanted to end it, and I...

 
**Arash:**
I created it, their last chance.

 
**Arash:**
...I did it alone.

 
**Arash:**
The king was worried about me, but in the end, I had subordinates but no friends.

 
**Arash:**
There was no one I could call a comrade.

 
**Arash:**
I chose to be alone myself.
Being born more than a human, it's only natural.

 
**Arash:**
Why, you ask? It's simple.

 
**Arash:**
To me, humans were people I had to protect.
So I kept my distance from them.

 
**Arash:**
...And in the end, I was alone.

 
**Serenity:**
I cannot say for certain...
However...

 
**Serenity:**
“He is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.”

 
**Serenity:**
The man I saw seems to be the exact same person who's still celebrated throughout the ages.

 
**Serenity:**
I can't be certain, and I have no proof.

 
**Serenity:**
But I think... he was so much greater a hero than any mortal man could be...

 
**Serenity:**
He was too strong. He was too pure.

 
**Serenity:**
Because of that, none could stand at his side.

 
**Arash:**
...My bad. That was a pretty deep conversation.

 
**Arash:**
Hmm? What is it? You've got a strange look on your face.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn't random, it comes with advance notice!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, d-don't interrupt them now!
This is important!

 


---
 
**Arash:**
Looks like our break's over, Fujimaru. They gave us fair warning. Now's the time to get on your feet.

 
**Arash:**
I wonder what it'll be, maybe that dragon subspecies?

 
**Arash:**
I'll take on a sphinx or a Demon God Pillar too.
No way am I gonna lose to some soulless data!

 
**Arash:**
Now, give me your orders!
Let's give it all we've got, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
I am not picking up any more enemies.
You've won, Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
I can't believe you beat them so quickly...
You're amazing, Senpai! Arash, too!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Did I screw up the data settings?
I don't think I did...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, good work! I still have to analyze it, but I think this is good data!

 
**Arash:**
Whew...I'm glad that's over.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work, Arash.
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, you too.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Next time, let's fight together for real.
 
**Arash:**
Yeah, if you need me!

 


---
 
**Arash:**
...But it's strange, you know.

 
**Arash:**
This is probably the third time I've fought to save the world. No, maybe the fourth?

 
**Arash:**
Who knows how many Holy Grail Wars I've been in?
But, well, you know...

 
**Arash:**
There's one thing I do know.
It looks like I've got good luck with Masters.

 
**Arash:**
I'm glad to be by your side. If you need my help, I'll always give everything I've got.

 
**Arash:**
More so than when I was alive!

 
**Arash:**
...Let's save the world, Master!
