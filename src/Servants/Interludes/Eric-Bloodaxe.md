# Eric Bloodaxe  
  
## Terror of the Bloodaxe  
  
**Eric:**   
Uuhnn...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Eric?  
What's the matter?  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Uuuuuunnn!  
Uhn...Gah...Guh...Ghnn!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
Fou, fou, fou!  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Ghnn&ndash;!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
S-Stand back, everyone!  
Eric is a Berserker!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He could go on a rampage!  
Fujimaru and Mash, get away from him!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eric!  
  
   
**Eric:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Eric:**   
...Y-You scum... You scoundrels... Are you the ones... who use my husband...for your ends?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?  
  
   
**Eric:**   
My name is Gunnhild. Normally, I would make you pay with your lives for the insolence of summoning my husband with your Holy Grail&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
G-Gunnhild!  
Eric Bloodaxe's wife?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If I'm not mistaken, she used witchcraft to put a deadly curse on his enemies. Even after her death, she continues to fight for him...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
B-But how is she contacting us?  
And from where?  
  
   
**Eric:**   
But I understand your situation.  
This time I shall permit you to use my husband.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
However, my husband is unable to fully unleash his power. That's because of his weapon, the Bloodaxe.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
This is the blood-stained axe formed out of the flesh and blood of demonic beasts.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
When allowed to drink the blood of several demonic beasts, its true power will be unleashed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Demonic...beasts?  
But, where would we find...  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Fear not.  
I will "summon" them now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up several lifeforms!  
Prepare for battle!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This is outrageous...  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Yeeeaaaarrrgh...  
Kill...demonic...beasts!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Here they come!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew...  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Demonic...beasts...blood...bloood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The axe is...drinking their blood...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The axe's magical energy level is rising.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. So it wasn't a bluff when she said its power wasn't fully unleashed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've detected two more lifeforms.  
Please keep heading toward the forest.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
Eric, let's go.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Fu...  
Fuuuuu...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou is warning us about something.  
There are traces of a large beast moving through here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are large marks like something was dragged.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A snake?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
An alligator?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Either way, it's huge.  
Let's go after it.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Eric:**   
...Hnnnng...axe...blood...  
I want blood, blood, blood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
C-Control yourself!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here they come!  
They're&mdash;Lamias!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Whew.  
Somehow we got through that.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Heheheheheh...blood...blood!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, this is what we call "viewer discretion advised"  
...All right, this is the last one.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's on the other side of the forest, but it hasn't moved. Its lifeform reading is the most powerful of all. You need to be careful.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Hahahah...It's there...I know it's there!  
Demonic...beast!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There it is!  
That's...no way...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Chimera...the legendary beast with the heads of a lion and a ram, and the tail of a snake!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's more, it's considered to be a high-ranking demonic beast! Even from here I can sense its overpowering desire to kill...  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Master...Let's go...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Forward, Eric!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Kill!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Eric:**   
Your... Blood... Is... Mine!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Eric:**   
Hyahahahahah! Take that!  
Take that! Take that!  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Your blood...your flesh...everything...is mine!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The axe...has started to glow ominously.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahh, now I see. What an overwhelming amount of magical energy. This is that axe's true form.  
  
   
**Eric:**   
Master...  
I look forward...to serving you more...Heheheheheh!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gee, well...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...We certainly seem to have awakened one monstrous Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As long as you can control it Master, there's no problem... Right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
L-Leave it to me.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-I'll do what I can.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's not very reassuring Master.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!
