# Paracelsus von Hohenheim  
  
## Devil's Quest

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Foe yesterday, ally today, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It feels so bizarre, you know? He was one of the masterminds behind Project Demonic Fog...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...but now he's one of our allies. A miracle of the Heroic Spirit summoning system, I suppose.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I admit I was startled when he said that he wanted to go to "the London of that era."  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That's understandable. I attempted to commit vile crimes against the world and its people.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It's logical for you to doubt me.  
However&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I truly do not wish for the human world to be destroyed.  
Thus, I sympathize with your goals and objectives.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Now I believe that it's possible to save all of my beloved children.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...My former self running that Project may have laughed in contempt at such a notion.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
But now... Now that I've entered into a contract with Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I have faith once again.  
In people. In the world.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...In the existence of allies of justice capable of fighting evil.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Allies of justice&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That is none other than all of you. You defeated me as I reached out to the Project at the edge of despair.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Allow me to say the following with the deepest gratitude.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Thank you.  
I beg you to show me your power once more.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It depends on the situation.  
Mr. Paracelsus.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mentioned unusual changes occurring in London as it corrects itself&ndash;that is what you claim?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean by "unusual changes?"  
The Demonic Fog is gradually dissipating.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As the era is corrected, London should return to normal without having to wait for the Demonic Fog to clear up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And yet,  
you seem to be agitated.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Why is that&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He senses something?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He knows something?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
To Master's query, all I can say is this.  
Yes and no.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It's true that I sense some kind of connection.  
But I also know that there's something in this place.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Namely&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Never mind. Let us speak later.  
Something remaining in the Demonic Fog approaches.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's right!  
Multiple magical energy readings detected in the fog!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're likely the automatas!  
They're bursting with magical energy, so be careful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
Senpai, give us orders!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Prepare for battle!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Destroy the enemy while maintaining a barrier!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
&ndash;Preparing for battle!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Ending combat.  
All enemies destroyed.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...Very impressive, Master.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Let us be off then.  
I must show you firsthand what I know.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
There's an underground space under the southern tip of Regent's Park...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It's part of the underground facility for the Mage's Association Or rather, for Clock Tower.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
You could say it's one of their quarantine areas.  
There's something here that has been sealed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Something?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Stuff like...dangerous magical tomes, Mystic Codes, and catalysts?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Magical tomes&ndash;  
This is basically what I'm referring to.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In particular, there's one tome that was used to seal a powerful evil that almost manifested itself in this world.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That tome, along with many other magical books,  
was carefully sealed with powerful spells.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Even the spread of the Demonic Fog could not weaken the seals placed on the tomes.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Just like other dangerous things that were sealed.  
However...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You believe that these seals have been broken, correct?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your reasoning?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem quite certain.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
I'm also bothered by his self-assurance.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...It's simple.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
The reason is that if I existed in this London and continued to pursue my designs&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
&ndash;I would break the seals without fail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh!? Does that mean you're going to break the seals now!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
No. I'm not the one who will break the seals.  
It will be the one still here&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;To be more precise, the "me" from here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This voice&ndash;  
Wait, I've detected a new Servant!  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Show yourself.  
Loather and mourner of evil, and yet is evil himself.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
You who would crush all life with the very hands that would hold your dear children... You abomination.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I am thou... Thou art I.  
Thy name is my name&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Paracelsus von Hohenheim!  
The consort of evil!  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
...Oh dear.  
What an unfriendly way to address yourself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There are two Paracelsuses?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Which one is the real one?!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
How easy it is to confuse you.  
But I shall speak only the truth.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
We are both real.  
I am thou... Thou art I.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
The Servant Paracelsus beside you whom you duly summoned and made a contract with.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
And I, born of Servant Paracelsus' magical energy that returned to the fog when you defeated him.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
Both share the name "von Hohenheim."  
Both are real.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
Admittedly, my existence is somewhat unstable.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
For the Holy Grail is already gone! Materialization while lacking ways to summon Heroic Spirits!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...He seems to be right. Observational results show that his magical energy is weak.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Demonic Fog...  
Has given birth to a final Heroic Spirit?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes, exactly. That's why I'm in a hurry.  
In a hurry to destroy this era.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
At this rate, this era will be completely restored.  
If so, I cannot destroy it with my own hands.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
My existence will likely disappear.  
However, I can't let that happen.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I have accepted the destruction of humanity as fate.  
One cannot stop it. Thus&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
&ndash;I have no choice but to go through with this!  
  
   
**???:**  
<span style="font-size:25px">GAAAAAAAA&ndash;!</span>  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Massive magical response!  
There's something&ndash;behind him!  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It seems the seal has been broken.  
It seems my other self is quite efficient.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No time to praise yourself!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How do you repair the seal?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
We must make haste.  
We must destroy it before it fully activates.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
If what was sealed materializes,  
the Sixth Imaginary Factor&ndash;No&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
&ndash;We must destroy it.  
Along with my other self barring the way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Prepare for battle!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do this, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
Preparing for and entering battle immediately&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Large-type enemy, destroyed!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What a powerful enemy...  
But somehow we managed to win...  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
How disappointing&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
That is all I can say to you after giving up.  
For the world will be incinerated.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
No.  
You are wrong.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That is what I can say, as I will not give up.  
I know the world will be saved.  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
...Hah. How absurd.  
To think that "I"...  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
...the one who continued to choose evil despite having no desire to, would be punished...  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
...by my own hand...  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
Ah...  
The end of this pathetic, ugly self...  
  
   
**Paracelsus?:**  
This, I offer to you...Misaya...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy Servant has gone completely silent.  
...Ending combat.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What a terrifying opponent to face...  
Well, we are in the heart of the Mage Association's lair.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was as fearsome as Fafnir.  
It's a matter of luck that we pulled through.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That's not true&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
You are all capable of victory.  
Even if it were to awaken once again.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
You are a bulwark against evil.  
You are truly the allies of justice that I believe in.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Thus,  
no matter what fearsome opponents you may face...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...no matter what betrayals you face,  
no matter the depths of despair you witness...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It is impossible for you to lose&ndash;
