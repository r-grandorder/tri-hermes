# Hans Christian Andersen  
  
## Human Observation  
  
**Andersen:**   
How are you, Master? It's good to see that you're not looking disgruntled today.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I am so disgusted with my super-boring life that my brain has turned to stone.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I feel like as if I've been transformed into a dumb monkey. I'm overwhelmingly lacking enrichment in my life.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Look. Don't you have anything to say as my Master?

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stone bread?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Enrichment?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Huh? You don't know the taste of a completely-dried bread? Scandinavians start their breakfast   
   
**Andersen:**   
by forcefully washing down a piece of rock-like bread with a drink like lead-boiled water...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, that trivia aside,  
what I want to say, Fujimaru, is...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Give me something new to write about, or if you don't have anything, then give me some money.  
I'll have some fun at the bar to kill some time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, Mr. Andersen is sounding more arrogant and reprehensible than ever.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you do anything to get on his bad side?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't do anything.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Andersen is always like this.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So you say you're not at fault.  
Of course. That's what I remember, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Andersen.  
We don't have any resources to waste here at Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please behave yourself, and work on a new book.  
Personally, I request a sequel of The Little Mermaid...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Tch.  
That story is so popular among women and kids.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I wrote that story to mock the idiots in this world,  
so I don't understand why it would be taken as a touching tale.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What&mdash;M-Mister, what did you just say?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I said, that is one of the worst trash that I ever wrote, you fool!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Geez. I made the ending so obvious,  
but people kept calling it a tragedy or tragic love story.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Not only is she finally released from love at first sight,  
but she even gets a soul as a reward in the end!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Listen. The best part about love is when it's purely yours. That's my conclusion, at least.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You ask me to write a sequel, but why can't you understand it would only drive Little Mermaid to further despair?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Uh... What, you look like it's the end of the world.  
...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm saying, don't ask me to write a sequel to a story that ended already. It's the reader's privilege to imagine what happens after the ending.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Fine. If you don't have any money,  
some new inspiration will do.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Take me wherever you can, Fujimaru.  
France would be nice for now.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What are you doing, Mash? You're coming, too.  
We'll end up dying if it's just me and Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew.  
Is this place alright with you, Mr. Andersen?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Yes. Anywhere is okay as long as I can stay away from my desk. Let's enjoy the city of France first...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, hostiles approaching! Looks like ghosts from the Hundred Years' War manifested using the Grail's power.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmm. Soldiers from the past are reappearing?  
Interesting, why don't you play with them, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm against physical labor but I will bear with it to get something to write about.  
Make this battle a good one, yeah?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Andersen:**   
Not bad. I never thought of this.  
But perhaps it was too late.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Andersen?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Fujimaru, Mash.  
Let's move on to the next location.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You went on quite a rampage in Rome, correct?  
Then let's head to the Italian Peninsula, where my heart belongs!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't do it by choice...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought you said you hate physical labor...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Skip the commentary, and you call yourself my editor?  
Let's go check the next observation object already!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Apparently, we've pushed his buttons as a writer.  
Let's just accept it and keep him company.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I found you!  
How do you do? Take that!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
What's wrong with you people! Especially that kid there! His face has "bad guy" written all over it!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Wow, so aggressive! As expected of Roman Soldiers, their brains are always on vacation.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mister, with all due respect. Anybody would get mad if a stranger suddenly threw a mud ball at their face.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What? All I did was add fuel to the fire!  
Fujimaru, make sure you keep them alive this time, too!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Andersen:**   
&mdash;Well.  
Now that we've finally ventured out into the ocean.  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Ohhhh, our prey is coming to us!  
Guys, this is a non-stop party!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Should we strip them? Or strangle them? Ridicule them?  
Whatever. Let's just kill them and let off some steam!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are we surrounded?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're already in huge trouble?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, this is what happens when Andersen fixes the coordinates right on a pirate ship!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hahaha. Sorry, I underestimated the pirates' IQs.  
I had no idea how dumb they actually are.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
They aren't worth observing. I'm going home.  
You guys go ahead and beat them up for me.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
They may be a memory of the sea, but they're still humans. Beat them to a pulp, and make them regret their actions.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You don't have to tell us! We'll do that!  
And you should reflect on your deeds for once, too!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Gotcha. Oh, Mash, about the sequel to The Little Mermaid, can I base the Prince on those pirates?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Absolutely not!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Andersen:**   
Now I'm satisfied. Good work, Fujimaru.  
I had an experience like no other thanks to you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...We're finally back.  
We had a rough time, huh, Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aimlessly fighting through all those eras...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was good combat experience for us,  
but why did you do it, Mr. Andersen?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
To observe people, of course. The weapons people of those eras used, how they fought.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Even primitive combat reflects human thought.  
The differences of all those eras will make a great reference.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Observe people... Then, you must love mankind. Right, Mr. Andersen?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Huh? Don't be stupid!  
I've no interest in mankind. I just needed data.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Not only the soldiers, I learned something about you two as well. Maybe I will write it into a book someday.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you for that.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Being written about by one of the three greatest fairy tale authors, I'm embarrassed just saying it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I think it would be a great honor.  
Dr. Roman would get so jealous.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll pass.  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah, you're right.  
Count me out, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You're a more thoughtful person than I imagined, Senpai...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
You two get along so well.  
You're so easygoing.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I made a contract with you as a Servant because I had no choice, but now I've changed my mind.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
It's hard to find partners for this crazy fieldwork, you know.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I think I'll get a little more fired up from now on.  
A little. Very little. A tiny bit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad I was able to help you write, Mr. Andersen.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Don't you understand that's a separate matter?  
This is why I hate my readers...
