# Edmond Dantès  
  
## Nightmare; or, the Call of Love and Hate  
  
**Narration:**   
...I can't see anything.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Black. Dark. Lightless. There was only a sinking sensation, like I'd fallen into somewhere very, very deep.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Or is there nothing there to see? I don't know.  
I can't even tell whether my eyes are open.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Where am I? I don't know. Am I standing or sitting?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I try to speak. My lips don't move. My tongue doesn't move. No sound comes from my throat.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Ah. Am I in a bad situation?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
My body does feel heavy...  
  
   
**???:**  
Looks like you have fallen deep.  
  
   
**???:**  
But yes. It's probably why it was you of all people.  
  
   
**???:**  
Welcome, Fujimaru. Welcome to the deep place where all sorts of carcasses fall, sink, and remain.  
  
   
**???:**  
...Hmph. What's with that look?  
Those lost puppy eyes are a waste of time with me.  
  
   
**???:**  
Of course, time is meaningless.  
At least in a place like this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Are you by chance...?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Do you know me?  
No. It can't be. You know nothing.  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't you get it, Master?  
Fujimaru.  
  
   
**???:**  
I have come from a place far beyond love and hatred. And so, I am somewhat...different from the version of me you know.  
  
   
**???:**  
...All right. They'll be here soon.  
  
   
**???:**  
You must leave this place. I am the one who shall burn away the remnants of darkness festering here.  
  
   
**???:**  
My flames shall scorch your self and soul, and I cannot guarantee your safety.  
  
   
**???:**  
Forgive me. You do not belong in a place like this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't want to.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know what's going on, but I can't leave you alone.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
...I see. Then keep up, and mind the flames.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...What are you doing here, Berserker?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll ask you the same question: what are you doing in Master's room? It is the middle of the night.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Sleep is necessary to maintain the health of a human body. I advise you to return to your own room to rest, Mister Edmond Dantès.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
I am a Servant. You are as well.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm speaking of Master. Our conversation will interrupt [♂ his /♀️ her} sleep cycle. Though [♂ he /♀️ she} may be sleeping peacefully right now...  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Peacefully, is that right?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Something the matter, sir?  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
No. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she} is sleeping, that's fine.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
I was worried some residual effect might remain in [♂ his /♀️ her} consciousness... No, it's nothing. Forget about it.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Mister Dantès.  
May I ask a question?  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
If you must.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
It's been bothering me for a while, but it seems an emergency operation will be necessary.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I must take action before it is too late. Leave it to me. I shall pursue the most effective treatment for the injured area.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...Master is not injured.  
As you pointed out, I hear peaceful breathing.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
No. Wrong, Sir.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I am talking about you. Your mental state is injured.  
If it's the surgical removal of the affected area you require, leave it to me.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Mercédès. I know of your wicked ways, but to go that far seems excessive, even to you?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Just like that. That statement. You may not realize it, but your outbursts suggest that you're mistaking me for someone else.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Swift, decisive action must be taken. Yes. You have uttered troubling nonsense about the sleeping Master.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...Wait.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
No. Measures will be taken.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Don't you dare come at me with a scalpel in one hand and a gun in the other. At least hold the scalpel in your dominant hand. No, that's not what I meant to say!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Why are you watching Master sleep, anyway?  
You must have sensed some sort of abnormality.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
I don't know if it's instinct, or if you sensed something in [♂ his /♀️ her} magical energy, but you are correct. You've read the situation right.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Master is in contact with many Servants, so how did this happen to [♂ his /♀️ her} mental state?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Stop talking nonsense.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...Mercédès.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Like I said, my name is not Mercédès.  
You are suffering from an affliction of the mind.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
It appears that you do not see me as a Servant.  
You call me Berserker, yet still call me Mercédès.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I am not her. I am not the woman whom you call by that name.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Of course not. Your Spirit Origin doesn't have the memories of those seven days.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yet...whenever I hear that name, strangely...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
It makes me long for something far away...  
Something that I no longer possess.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
However, as I am still not this Mercédès, there is nothing for it but to take the appropriate measures. Thus...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I shall disinfect that mental state of yours.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Oh. He has fled.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Unbelievable. Next time I see him, I must be sure to tend to him.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...A dream where Nightingale was arguing with someone?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something like that...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't remember it all that clearly...  
  
  
---  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What a strange dream.  
I am no expert in interpreting dreams...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if you would like, shall I try accessing Chaldea's database?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even I can do that much.  
It's not like we're booting up Sheba or Trismegistus.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Oh? Are you trying to perform oneiromancy?  
Leave it to me!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Since ancient times, as far back as the Age of Gods, humanity has tried to interpret the meaning of their dreams.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The most famous of dream interpreter of your modern time would be Sigmund Freud...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But my dream interpretation is one of a kind! Hee hee.  
I call it&ndash;  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Thrilling DC dream interpretation!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Exciting AC dream interpretation!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Huh...!? If you shoot AC through your brain, it'll be a “Scanners” kind of head explosion catastrophe!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Haha, you know nothing, furball! AC is harmless to the body! It's even healthy if used in the right amount!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It can do anything! For example, it can observe how neurons communicate in detail!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Let us decipher what is inside Fujimaru's head once and for all!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
For example, what is Master's favorite dish?  
And of course, what is [♂ his /♀️ her} favorite AC!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Argh! You mean things like what kind of clothes Master likes! And of course, what is [♂ his /♀️ her} favorite DC!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...What kind of DC...?  
You misspoke, Edison. You're making no sense.  
  
   
**Edison:**   
   
Look who's talking!!!!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-they're fighting again... Those two are really going at it. It's such a childish fight! And they've already come to blows!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But to be honest, observing the brain is a bit much...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds interesting.  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai! I know it sounds interesting...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But those two may really lay bare everything in your mind. If that happens...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have a feeling it would do more harm than good...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Things like your favorite food wouldn't be an issue...  
But certain other types of information that might be revealed...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...They would definitely cause problems!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, I'm not down for invasion of my privacy.  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right! It's no good!  
It's not right to look into other people's heads!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Well said, Mash. You're quite right.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Things like this must be done in secret. It was my fault for bringing it up in a public place like this.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Let's put both Lemurian oneiromancy and the dream reading I learned directly from the Mahatmas on hold for today. Yep.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm sorry.  
And... You two bratty geniuses!  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
   
Y-yes, ma'am!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Don't start fighting as soon as you see each other! If you have that much energy to spare, go to the simulator!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Twenty consecutive Soul Eaters and Spriggans!  
Work out your extra energy that way!  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
Wh-whaaaaat!?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What did you say!? Be polite!  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
   
Yes, ma'am!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I can't believe what I just saw. That...they really went through twenty consecutive battles!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Those two looked really determined.  
It was quite an inspiring sight to see.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Electric Lion's Proud Infinite Battle.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Electric Gentleman's Brave Infinite Battle.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Infinite... It really was intense.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, did you just stumble a bit?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, did I?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I might've gotten dizzy watching the infinite battle.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Oh, Master. Mash.  
What a wonderful morning.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Amakusa.  
Oh! And Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Good morning! Um, if my name's too hard to say, you can call me Lily, or Alter. Even Jeanne!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, then I will call you Jeanne Alter.  
Good morning once again.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes... Good morning!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Mentor, is something wrong?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
The smiles on your faces were simply dazzling.  
As warm as the sun itself rising into the sky.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It is truly wonderful, and fills my heart.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Y-you think so? Um, did I just get praised?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes. Of course.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...By the way, Master.  
Has anything new happened?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nothing really...  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Is that so? Well, then, never mind.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
As I'd expect of the avenging demon who advanced his own mentality to that state. I'm relieved to see that he is doing his job properly.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I had a dream about Nightingale.  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...A dream about someone arguing with Nightingale?  
I see, so that's what's going on.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
She, too, is perceptive, in a way...  
No. Never mind. Apologies, I have said too much.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Amakusa?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
No, nothing. I was only talking to myself.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Mentor, what are you talking about?  
I am so confused.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
This is rather a complicated matter.  
Well, if I had to cut it down to a single phrase...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...It's just a dream. The sort that someone like you, who's been through so much this past year, would have.  
  
   
**???:**  
...You've sunk down here again.  
  
   
**???:**  
Unbelievable. You really are a curious Master.  
  
   
**???:**  
You could have had a peaceful dream, or lain in a dreamless slumber.  
  
   
**???:**  
But instead you come here, to this awful place.  
I suggest you stop.  
  
   
**???:**  
Do you understand?  
This place is too dangerous.  
  
   
**???:**  
This darkness is indeed a part of your dream, but one normally would not see this. It is not a place where you should linger.  
  
   
**???:**  
The me here is quite different than the me you know.  
I may not always be so hospitable.  
  
   
**???:**  
Begone. And forget this place.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't look any different to me.  
   
**???:**  
...Ha. You make me laugh! You don't change a bit, no matter where you are, Master!  
  
   
**???:**  
No different, huh?  
  
   
**???:**  
Right. That's correct. I may be different from me, but we are in many ways the same person.  
  
   
**???:**  
I am the Avenger who existed during those seven days, and I am also the Servant who fights along with you.  
  
   
**???:**  
Both of them are essentially me.  
  
   
**???:**  
But, to be precise... The me here, in this place, is slightly different.  
  
   
**???:**  
I show my true ability in these darkest depths. I am one who looks into your soul, that shines brightly like the flames of hell.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're not going to smoke?  
   
**???:**  
...Ah, yes.  
  
   
**???:**  
I am afraid I lack a light.  
Or, have I handed you one before?  
  
   
**???:**  
Then, please. My dark flame of vengeance would simply char my precious cigar.  
  
   
**???:**  
(Puff) ...You're impertinent. Even in the black depths of a dream, you try to amuse me.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
...Tonight is the night to finish this.  
  
   
**???:**  
This is the cacophony of noise that has accumulated inside of you in consequence of your connection with so many heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**???:**  
They are remnants of dreams, shadows, and illusions. Dark things piled up deep within your soul. In a way, this is your... trash heap.  
  
   
**???:**  
The regrets, resentments, and shattered wishes of the myriad enemies you've defeated. Yes, that's right... everything from love to hatred.  
  
   
**???:**  
There is only one thing I can say to you now: begone.  
  
   
**???:**  
This is my job. It is not something you should see.  
  
   
**???:**  
Through your dreams, you have connected with the memories of many Heroic Spirits, and accomplished much, have you not? That is enough.  
  
   
**???:**  
There's no need for you to take responsibility for even the leftover emotions of corpses.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
...But, just in case. Fujimaru.  
  
   
**???:**  
If you wish from the bottom of your heart...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't want you to fight alone!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't leave you alone!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Ha...  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahahahahahahahahaha!  
Fine! Then do not fall behind!  
  
   
**???:**  
Mere droplets, discarded and decayed! Ones that could not even reach anger, but merely sunk and festered.  
  
   
**???:**  
I shall consume them with my flames!  
  
   
**???:**  
My prey is the very carcasses of the phantoms you fought within the memories of the Heroic Spirits that your soul watches over!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha. Yes, let their form be made clear this time!  
  
   
**???:**  
And mine as well!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...Come, let us eradicate those that wander!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Let's go, Master.  
We're going to take that thing beyond love and hatred!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Nightingale:**   
...We meet again, sir.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Indeed.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Master's room is up ahead. Do you have business there? It is already late, and interrupting one's slumber is bad for their health.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
No. I... Well...  
I suppose I'm just enjoying a midnight stroll.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
What about you, Berserker? The Mage King's threat is no more. Why are you so on edge?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I am not on edge. I am simply looking for a chance to disinfect your brain.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Your mental state is injured.  
Your mental state is polluted, abnormal.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...It's twisted. Injured. Wounded.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...Heh heh heh.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
You are...laughing?  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Of course I'm laughing! My mental state is far, far removed from any normal person's!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
I am the vengeful demon! I am one who ceased to be human ages ago! I am the Count of Monte Cristo!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...But I have no need of treatment from you. I am what I am, and I have incarnated as myself in this 21st century.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
As long as Master desires it, the Count of Monte Cristo shall exist. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she} continues to fight, I shall lend my assistance.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
To put it in your terms, the “injury” to my mental state is one that cannot be cured.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
It is precisely the fact that my mind is beyond love and hatred, beyond madness, that certain things become possible for me... It may not happen often, but it does happen.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
You are not making sense.  
Please speak clearly and concisely.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Treatment is unnecessary.  
Just leave me be, Mercédès.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
And do not come near me. Your straightforward ways are similar to Fujimaru's.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
And it is quite blinding...to me.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...?  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Go check on Master in the morning.  
[♂ His /♀️ Her} mind and body may be somewhat exhausted.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...After all, [♂ he /♀️ she} will have had a nightmare.
