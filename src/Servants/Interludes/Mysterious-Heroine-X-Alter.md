# Mysterious Heroine X Alter  
  
## XXXX. Mysterious Heroines  
  
**Heroine XX:**   
It's time...for the XXth Servantverse Servant Assembly!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Yaaay.  
(Clap, clap, clap, clap)  
  
   
**X:**   
What the hell are you talking about, you piece of junk?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
...Hmph. I am not junk. I am a robot.  
A killer machine that neither bleeds nor cries.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
...At least for today, if you all don't mind.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
　(Cocks head to side)　　　　 　　　(Nods falteringly)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You got it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Sounds like she's got her reasons.)  
  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Huh???  
  
   
**X:**   
Oh come on, you're obviously just disguising your voice! I can literally see you wobbling your throat with your hand to do it!  
  
   
**X:**   
There's no way a weird robot like that would exist in the Servantverse!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I don't have a problem with it.  
We already have Professor Babbagen and Evil Wind 2B.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
This is my room, by the way. It's got a kotatsu and everything. Hehehe. I've also got plenty of sweets to go with our tea.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(...)  
  
   
**X:**   
Oh please. As if a robot would ever want to go in a kotatsu.  
  
   
**X:**   
You're weirdly nice to the walking scrap heap, Ex...  
I don't know why, but I don't like it!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Oh... Really?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
She seems like a much better robot than my Black Knight Voloid. My Voloid can't even walk on two legs.  
  
   
**X:**   
I swear, just how low IS your opinion of your Voloid?  
  
   
**X:**   
And apparently, you're not even interested in trading that old bucket in for a newer model?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
What can I say? That Black Knight and I have been through a lot together.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
The Du Stallion II has seen better days, too...  
  
   
**X:**   
What was that!?  
  
   
**X:**   
Did you just throw shade at my beloved spaceship that's practically in factory new condition!?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
BEEEP. That was. A memory bug. Don't worry about it.  
  
   
**X:**   
Grrr, oh forget it! I'm just gonna help myself to ALL the sweets on the kotatsu then!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
By all means.  
Go ahead, Robot, you can have some too.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
As a Servantverse robot, you should at least be able to digest sweet beans.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
...(Eyes welling up with tears)  
Aw, Ex, you're the bes&ndash;(Cough, hack, cough)!  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Thank you. Alter.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Hm? Sure, no problem.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Everyone else, please feel free to help yourselves to the sweets, too.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
What would you like, Master?  
I also have some piping hot green tea.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A chestnut cake and chestnut dumpling, please.  
   
**X Alter:**   
You have excellent taste, Master.  
Chestnuts go great with all sorts of sweets.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
This chestnut cake not only has delicious chestnut adzuki beans, its crisp, crunchy shell is a work of art on its own.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This chestnut jelly is really soft and scrumptious too!  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
...I see. I now understand everything.  
Today is a day for evaluating different kinds of sweets.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Munch, munch) That's, um, probably not quite right.  
At least, I don't think it is.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Give me everything you've got, please.  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Oho...  
(Clatter)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-wait! X Alter, please put away your twin blades!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure Senpai only meant [♂ he /♀️ she} wanted to have one of every TYPE of sweet. Right, Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Hmm...  
All right, I suppose that is acceptable.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
And I do want you to have a firm grasp on the kinds of sweets I like.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
... (Venting exhaust in lieu of sighing)  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So, um... Now that we've all had some lovely tea and a chance to relax, maybe we should get down to business...?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I agree.  
What is this all about?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
This is the XXth Servantverse Servant Assem&ndash;  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
You have already said as much.  
What I want to know is, who chose these members?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I can understand why my pilot candidate and Mash might be here...  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
...but why would you ask me to attend a “Servantverse Servant Assembly”?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
As you all surely know, I am the proud steel guardian of Castle Csejte!  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I want no part of any world as slapdash and ill-defined as this “Servantverse.”  
  
   
**X:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**X:**   
You come from a world with a Japanese castle stacked on a pyramid stacked on a European castle. You have a giant steel demoness robot, Elisa Particles... How is that different than the Servantverse?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Blasphemy! Now be quiet and let me speak.  
Hmph...  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I hope whoever invited me here didn't do so solely because I'm a robot...did they?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(Hack, cough, cough)  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(There's no way I can say I just asked her to come so I'd have some extra camouflage for my cover story now!)  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Uh, beep boop, of course not.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(Monotone) I invited you here as an...honorary Servantverse Servant.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's weird. I could have sworn you were a full-fledged member of the Servantverse, Mecha Eli-chan.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I remember the demoness of the demon castle played a huge part in the CEO of Amazones' autobiographical movie.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There was the scene where you went diving in the liquid hydrogen oceans on a gas giant planet... Your trip to the Bermuda Triangle...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Your trip to that neutron star with the ultramagnetic field that's impossible to escape... And then there was&ndash;  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
What... What are you talking about? I've never done anything like that in all my operational history.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I was also told you're exceedingly knowledgeable when it comes to Western sweets.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
You can fight, you can sing, you can bake...  
You're the perfect robot come to life.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
They also said you make amazing Halloween-themed pies! I do know chestnuts and pumpkin are a sublime combination in sweets, so I can believe it.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I-it's really just a hobby. Anyway, I still don't fully understand, but, all right.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
If this is basically just a tea party for proper ladies,  
then I have no objection.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
(Besides, I've been invited to oil parties courtesy of Danzo, but I've never been to a tea party before.)  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Very well. An opportunity like this doesn't come around every day.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
As the guardian of Csejte with an understanding of Halloween, it's my duty to allow for elegant, stylish times like&ndash;  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Do you have any curry cake?  
Or maybe cutlet cake?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
(Twitch)  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
...Anyway, this is essentially a meeting, yes?  
So what's our agenda for today's proceedings?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Mecha Eli-chan's pretty much running the show now.)  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Hmm. I don't have any of the junky cake X likes...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But since it's not every day that all of us Servantverse Servants are gathered together like this, we probably should do something special...  
  
   
**X:**   
I know! We can have a one-on-one-on-one battle to see which of us is the strongest X of all!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well someone's a little too fired up for their own good.  
   
**X Alter:**   
You said it. That is hardly the sort of thing to suit a meeting.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(Nodding vigorously in assent)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd rather hear more about the Servantverse.  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I completely agree with my pilot candidate.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Wouldn't it be much more productive to acquire verifiable intel on any possible Servantverse threats, so we can come up with appropriate means to counter them before they pose a threat?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Especially when it comes to Foreigner-class entities!  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
I concur! (Venting exhaust)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... I don't think that's a threat we need to be overly concerned with...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That aside, I'd love to learn more about the world all you Xs come from!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think you two said you were roommates there, right, X and Alter?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
That is right. It really takes me back.  
  
   
**X:**   
Nobody asked you, you hunk of junk!  
  
   
**X:**   
That said, it's true that we were forced to share a dorm room back at Cosmo-Chaldea High School.  
  
   
**X:**   
Grrr, just thinking about it pisses me off all over again!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I didn't mind sharing a room in theory, but X was the worst possible roommate I could have imagined.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Now that I think about it...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...our teacher, Nameless Red, might have set that up to try and improve X's behavior, even just a little...  
  
   
**X:**   
Trust me, it was no picnic for me either, sister!  
  
   
**X:**   
We didn't just have to share our room. We were even forced to complete an assignment together...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An assignment? You mean, at Cosmo-Chaldea High?  
  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Yup. Killing villains, basically.  
  
   
**X:**   
I'm sure it was supposed to be Nameless Red's mission, but he pawned it off on his students!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I think it was on Planet Totooine.  
That was a seriously brutal case...  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
This was back in the start of season one.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's right.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
This was when our ratings were in the gutter, when viewers thought we were just another weird series.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Season? Ratings?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You've got to tell us more now!  
  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
Sure, no problem.  
So, Planet Totooine is...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
　　　　　　　　　– Planet Totooine –  
  
   
**X:**   
Gaah! Ugh, blech! I'm gonna be washing sand out of everywhere for days!  
  
   
**X:**   
How the hell does a planet RAIN sand!?  
Everywhere we go, it's just sand, sand, sand!  
  
   
**X:**   
What's next? Maybe a sand squall followed by a sand rainbow!?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
A sand rainbow. What a lovely concept.  
How very unrealistic, yet sublime.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But, unfortunately, this sandstorm is so cosmically big it's enveloping everything in Totooine's orbit.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Dammit... We don't have time for this.  
We need to hurry!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Getting Du Stallion II get shot down and having to make an emergency landing on this planet was not part of the plan.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I guess those reports that this area was getting unruly were true.  
  
   
**X:**   
Maybe we just should've waited for Black Bucket to finish repairing the ship!?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
First of all, he's not a black bucket.  
He's my Black Knight.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Second, we can't wait that long.  
Not with...my precious...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...sweet bean buns at stake!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I have to get to the Spacebucks that just opened on Totooine before they sell out of their special commemorative buns!  
  
   
**X:**   
Huh? Commemorative buns?  
What about our mission to dispatch that villain?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
The special Spacebucks version of Totooine's famous Zero Buns comes first.  
  
   
**X:**   
What!? You never said anything about some stupid mission like that before!  
  
   
**X:**   
...(Sigh) This explains why you were so excited about researching our destination...  
  
   
**X:**   
If only you worked half as hard to preserve peace in the Servantverse as you did on acquiring sweets...  
  
   
**X:**   
Huh!?  
Ex, get down!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Yikes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...  
  
   
**X:**   
Damn, I can't believe how accurate they are! Looks like we're up against more enemies than we thought!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
That shadow over there... Is that a sand raider?  
One of Totooine's mythical desert people?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Now I see... So that's how it is.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
These sand raider extremists are trying to stop Spacebucks' galactic expansion by any means necessary!  
  
   
**X:**   
Seriously!? Oh, hell no! I am NOT getting killed over freaking coffee milk!!!  
  
   
**X:**   
Good thing we can totally take these guys if we can just get in close! Let's get 'em, Ex!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Right. I won't let them stand in the way of peace...or of my sweet bean buns!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**???:**  
These two weren't part of the plan.  
Guess I've got no other choice...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
We didn't learn this until much later...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...but the incident on Totooine was just the opening act of a huge conspiracy.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I still find it hard to believe that the legendary bounty hunter, Edgy Fett, was masterminding the whole thing...  
  
   
**X:**   
Even in my wildest dreams, I never would've thought a guy that strong would be hiding out among the sand raiders...  
  
   
**X:**   
So we ended up letting him get away, failing the assignment, and having to stay behind for special training, AGAIN!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The legendary bounty hunter...  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Edgy Fett...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Short for Edgemiya Fett...  
  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's right. They say he'll only work for enormous cash bounties, and that even the League of Villains fears him.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There are also rumors that say he's the Alter of a certain hero, and that Edgy Fett is just a codename.  
  
   
**X:**   
It still burns me that we let him get away.  
If only Mr. Dual Pistols had been a Saber...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Anyway, our assignment might not have gone at all well...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...but the important thing is that I managed to get my hands on the sweet buns in the end.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
I see... At first, I thought this Cosmo-Chaldea High School was a place for raising defenders of justice...  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
...but it's actually a charity designed to try and give completely hopeless Servants a chance to be useful somehow.  
  
   
**X:**   
Nrghhh...  
  
   
**X:**   
Y-yes, I might not have had top grades, but so what!  
  
   
**X:**   
Their methods were never a good fit for my learning style anyway!  
  
   
**X:**   
Especially when it came to those smug-ass teachers!  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
What a terrible tragedy for you.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
So with your combined 2.0 GPA and your complete inability to work as a team, you were dispatched to different planets around the universe?  
  
   
**X:**   
That's right! Stupid Principal Lionhead made us go just to piss us off!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What sort of planets were you two sent to?  
  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
They were all very dangerous,  
but the one I'll never forget...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...is Planet Guntama... I could never forget it after what happened there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Guntama? That name sounds familiar.  
Isn't that your home planet, X?  
  
   
**X:**   
Hehehe. You got it, Mash!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's right. I latched on to X to mooch off her when she went back there during spring break.  
  
   
**X:**   
Not that I wanted to go back to my home planet or anything. Or for Ex to come with me in the first place.  
  
   
**X:**   
I would've muuuch rather hung out at a different planet.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But Guntama was the only place we were allowed to go after all the detentions we'd incurred at school.  
  
   
**X:**   
Can you believe that!?  
Just thinking about it still makes me sooo angry!  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Ha ha ha ha. At least you still got to go on break.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
I'd say that's better than nothing.  
  
   
**X:**   
It's not funny!  
  
   
**X:**   
Because of all that, I had to bring Ex along on a trip back home I never wanted to take to begin with.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
		– Planet Guntama –  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Oogh... What is this strange sensation...?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Is this Planet Guntama undulating?  
Is it some kind of curse?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I can't even think straight with all this watery stuff running down my skin. I feel gross.  
  
   
**X:**   
Pretty sure that's just sweat.  
  
   
**X:**   
That's the thing about Guntama: it's goddamn hot here!  
We're talking Red Ring of Death hot!  
  
   
**X:**   
The humidity in this season averages five thousand percent, and that's on a good day!  
  
   
**X:**   
This is exactly why I didn't want to come home!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I don't think I'm going to make it, X.  
It was a good life...while it lasted...  
  
   
**X:**   
Ex! Wake up!  
Argh, now I have even MORE crap to carry!  
  
   
**X:**   
Why don't you just take off some clothes if you're that hot!?  
  
   
**X:**   
It's not like swimsuit Servants ever go out of style, after all!  
  
   
**X:**   
Not that you'd ever catch ME dead in a swimsuit, though! No way, no how!  
  
   
**X:**   
All that aside...  
  
   
**X:**   
Guntama was never the most happening place, but I don't remember there being absolutely no trace of civilization here...  
  
   
**X:**   
Last I checked, it at least had a breezy summer resort area going for it...  
  
   
**X:**   
What happened here while I was gone...  
Huh!?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Mewhehehehe...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Your food, or your life...  
  
   
**X:**   
Wake up already, Ex!  
We've got savages popping up every which way!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I'm never taking these off...  
I don't want to freeze to death...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**X Alter:**   
Everything happened very quickly...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...but once we got the attackers to stop hunting our Spirit Origins, we somehow managed to reconcile with them.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
The leopard-tiger-jaguar-panther lady would go on to become a surprisingly popular Servant later.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
That was the midseason episode that was absurdly popular among children.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
It led to all sorts of spin-off series that took place on the mysterious planet of Guntama.  
  
   
**X:**   
Yup! I even became pretty popular myself...  
Hey! What's with all the spoilers!?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Oops.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Uh, no, it is nothing. I am just a devout fan.  
I cannot help but share my wealth of trivia.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Makes sense.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
You must be a huge fan of X's then.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Is that why you dress kind of like her?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(...Ugh. I know she's just from season one, but I still can't believe how clueless she is about a fellow X...)  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Uh, yes, I think that might be the case now. Beep boop.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I couldn't remember much about my past before I came to the academy.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
It wasn't until I came to Guntama that I learned these glasses were the secret key to restoring my memories.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
It also lead directly into “The Final Battle!  
Destroy the Bridge on Twin Planet Esaba”...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...the climactic episode of our first season.  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
...Huh? Esaba? Climactic episode?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
(Esaba... I've never even heard of that planet before.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is this Esaba another world you and X infiltrated?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Do sweet beans go well with buns?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Right around the time that episode aired, X and I were known as agents capable of single-handedly destroying entire planets in the course of our missions.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
So when the two of us worked together, we could limit the collateral damage to a single planet.  
  
   
**X:**   
Oogh.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
(Giggle) Do sweet beans go well with buns... I never would have thought to phrase a rhetorical question like that...  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
...Uh, a-ahem. In the future, try not to go around casually destroying planets.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Now, what happened next? I thought I heard you mention a final battle earlier?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Oh yes. It was a huge ordeal.  
That's why it wasn't just X and me there.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There were also other students from the academy, and even some teachers who were also active hero Servants.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
By that point, it was no longer just a school assignment, but an important military operation.  
  
   
**X:**   
Esaba...  
  
   
**X:**   
For some reason, just hearing that name makes my chest go tight...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
...? (What's going on?)  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
I have no record of any such episode...  
In fact, I do not even remember seeing it.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Oh? I guess even robots can overlook things then.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Esaba is an artificial planet that is in reality two planets connected by an interstellar bridge.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
It's home to an enormous factory that was targeted and occupied by the League of Villains.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
The villains repurposed the factory's incredible technology to create a huge army of military robots.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
While the individual units were no match for a Servant, the danger they posed came from their sheer, overwhelming numbers.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Our mission was to recover the manufacturing base in order to break the deadlock.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
		– Artificial Planet Esaba –  
  
   
   
		– Underpole Base Occupied by League of Villains –  
　　　  
		– Heated Defensive Line Battle Underway –  
  
   
**X:**   
...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
X? X? Are you alive? Can you hear me?  
  
   
**X:**   
(Huff...huff...) This is nothing...  
It's just a flesh wound...  
  
   
**X:**   
It'll take more than just a little battle to the death against the Savage Queen...  
  
   
**X:**   
...and a brawl with the squid legions of Tentacle General Sanity Gilles to take me down...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Don't forget Herc The Superhuman's baryon ax that Nameless Red deflected, causing it to pierce straight through your side.  
  
   
**X:**   
Oooh, right. Seriously, who IS that guy? Ow ow ow...  
  
   
**X:**   
If not for my Saber Ninja Art where I make afterimages with Spirit Origins, this could've been real bad for me.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...You almost certainly would have died instantly.  
Because even for a Servant, those were severe wounds.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But at least your questionable Saber Ninja Arts came in handy for once.  
  
   
**X:**   
Huh!? What do you mean, “questionable”!?  
...Ow, ow...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Our comms are being jammed...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Deep in the heart of enemy territory as we are, I guess it's no surprise. Plus, we got separated from our team.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Your injuries are very serious too. We need to hurry and find you somewhere safe to recover.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There's no telling when more battle Voloids might show up.  
  
   
**X:**   
What!? There's no way I'm taking a break in the middle of this final batt&ndash;Guh.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There, you see?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I'll stand watch and see if I can find anything useful. Black Knight, help me carry X somewhere safe.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Who else would I be talking to, Voloid K6-X4?  
Don't space out on me now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, g-got it!  
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**X Alter:**   
...There. We got past the enemy's automated defenses and made it inside their base.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Though I'm afraid X isn't going to have any opportunities to recover in here.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Huh? What is it, Black Knight?  
...There's still a hostile here!?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...! Who are you?  
  
   
**???:**  
Looks like your friend's out of commission.  
Good. That'll make this easier.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
No way...!  
Edgy Fett...!!!  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Whoa, easy there.  
I'm not about to waste any bullets in here.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Killing your friend while she's already got one foot in the grave won't earn me a single credit.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
The League of Villains has much bigger fish to fry.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
No, I'm more interested in you...Heroine X Alter.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
X...Alter...!? What are you...  
S-stop that... Please, stop.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
M-my name is...Ex...  
I don't...go by that... Ngh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ex? Are you okay?  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
I see. Looks like the brainwashing's stronger than I thought.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
But you still must have noticed how unstable you've been since you came to this planet.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
That vision correction device you're wearing was made here on Esaba. I'm sure you've already figured that out.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
But it was also illegally modified to maintain and reinforce your brainwashing.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Since you got here, an identical frequency emitted from the planet's automated factory has been canceling out their modifications.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Huh!? Reinforced brainwashing...?  
How do you know about this?  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
My last client told me to be careful around you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
X Alter? Did you just remember something?  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's right... I... I wandered around space...before I came to Cosmo-Chaldea High School... Ngh...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Black Knight...some of your memories have been encrypted, right?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Maybe my memories have something to do with...  
(Gasp...gasp...)  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Ahh... I'm glad X isn't awake...to see me like this...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
I'm afraid I don't have time for idle chatter.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
The League of Villains might have Lionhead's heroes in a tight spot right now...  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
...but it won't be long before the busybodies at the Galactic Police catch wind of this and stick their noses in.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Sooner or later, Esaba's going down. I was just planning my escape route when you showed up.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
So, I've got a proposal for you.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Come with me, and I'll take you to see the League of Villains' higher-ups.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
N-no...I won't!  
I'm a student at...Cosmo-Chaldea High School...!  
  
   
**X:**   
...  
  
   
**X:**   
(Ex's been acting weird ever since we landed on this planet. Going off on her own, being weirdly belligerent...)  
  
   
**X:**   
(At first I thought she just got up on the wrong side of the bed. But this explains what's been happening with her...)  
  
   
**X:**   
(...I don't get it one bit.)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Heroine X...?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(When did you wake up?)  
  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
(Whoa there. Keep it cool, Black Bucket,  
or you're gonna set off my ninja arts.)  
  
   
**X:**   
(I noticed someone was following us, so I was getting ready to fight back the moment they dropped their guard...)  
  
   
**X:**   
(But now, I don't know what's going on.)  
  
   
**X:**   
(I was all set to punch Chief Red's fast and furious looking relative here in the face if he laid a hand on Ex...)  
  
   
**X:**   
(...but as much as it sucks, I'm gonna have to wait and see how this plays out, thanks to these injuries.)  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
...Suit yourself. I've done what I need to,  
so I'm getting out of here.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
I just thought I might be able to cash in on a League of Villains reward. That's all.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...That's enough, bounty hunter.  
Please leave. Before X wakes up.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
...Heh. Just don't go dying on me.  
Be a waste of a good bounty.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
...Oh, I almost forgot.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Since I lost my shot at an easy payday, I guess I might as well drop a little tidbit here...  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
...I wouldn't count on a wound from a Savage Queen's heavy spear getting better anytime soon.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Not unless you've got a way of undoing an anti-healing curse.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
What...? That can't be right!  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
This passage leads to the center of the factory. Maybe it'll have something that can help a Servant heal faster.  
  
   
**Edgy Fett:**   
Assuming the defender Voloids don't get you first, of course.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...You're quite the busybody yourself, Edgy Fett.  
  
   
**X:**   
   
(I'll say!)  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
That's it...!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I can use this device to heal X.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Huh? No, wait. This is...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**X:**   
   
(What? What is it? Now I really wanna know!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's about time you woke up?  
  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
Dammit. They did see us coming in...!  
  
   
**???:**  
Who dares disturb my factory's harmony?  
  
   
**X:**   
Damn, doesn't look like we'll be able to talk our way out of this one!  
  
   
**X:**   
But that's fine with me!  
If they want to fight, I'll take them all on!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
X...!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
You don't have to do this. That guy is probably this factory planet's manager, and he's really strong.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Besides...I can't let your injuries get any worse.  
  
   
**X:**   
Don't be ridiculous, Ex!  
That's all the more reason to fight back!  
  
   
**X:**   
If I can beat this guy, I'll have academy credits for daaays! Then I'll be able to live it up and pig out every night until I graduate!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
(Sigh)... I swear, you never change...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
You might not have a lot going for you, X, but if nothing else, you don't want for bluster.  
  
   
**X:**   
Now you're talking trash about me!?  
  
   
**X:**   
I see. So you're planning to turn traitor!  
Well not on my watch, you aren't!  
  
   
**???:**  
If you wish to plead for your lives, intruders,  
you may do so in the depths of hell!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
We weren't talking to you!  
Just shut up and give us a moment!  
  
   
**???:**  
You underestimate me at your own... Hm?  
Is that...?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Thank you, X.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
You once shared a freshly baked red bean bun with me.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Now that I think of it, you've always been giving me things, and you never once asked for anything in return.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I've always wanted to pay you back somehow.  
  
   
**X:**   
Huh? I forgot all about that, but...okay?  
  
   
**X:**   
H-hey, why so close? This...uh...this isn't really the time to hug it out, I don't think...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Got you.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Black Knight, would you might dunking her, please?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you say dunk!? W-well, okay.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Stuff Heroine X into the machine)  
  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Huh? What're you&ndash;Ow!  
Hey, quit shoving me... Gaaah!  
  
   
**X:**   
What's the big idea!? What's all this freezing cold slimy stuff!? Aah, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!!!  
  
   
**X:**   
Ex, you traitor! You too, you overgrown bucket!  
  
   
**H：X (Frozen):**  
...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I can tell you're upset about this.  
I'm sorry, X.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I wish I'd found something that could have healed you, but I couldn't.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
This is a flash-freezing device.  
It's called a Carbon Coffin.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Even if I don't make it, I'm sure someone from the school will find you, thaw you, and heal you.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Even if the whole planet blows up,  
you should still be fine...I think.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Okay, Black Knight. Send me my battle suit.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
On it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't you need to take off your glasses?  
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
These undulations... I knew it! It's Alternium!  
  
   
**???:**  
So you're the lost Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. successor.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I might be destined to join the League of Villains one day.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But that day...is not today.  
  
   
**???:**  
...How dull. To think the Black Knight of the Round Table would be reduced to this.  
  
   
**???:**  
Any pride you had in infiltrating the enemy side is gone. Now you are ruled entirely by fleeting emotion.  
  
   
**???:**  
You are a traitor to our cause.  
  
   
**???:**  
Not even the notorious League of Villains would take someone who threw everything into such disorder back.  
  
   
**???:**  
You must be returned to them so that they can remind you of your place and put you back in it!  
  
   
**???:**  
You can start by becoming one of the parts that makes up the mechanisms of my factory, like a drive shaft, or a heat source, or a distributor.  
  
   
**???:**  
If you can't even do that...then die!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
(Sniffle)... I see.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
So the hero Servants were successful at bringing down Esaba and dealing a critical blow to the League of Villains.  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
There are few things worse than a factory that makes evil robots. You did the right thing. The heroic thing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So Planet Esaba was destroyed in an explosion caused by the gravity fields colliding.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And X and Ex were saved by freezing themselves in a Carbon Coffin.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Phew... Talk about a close call!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Yes, it was. Oh, but we still wouldn't have made it back without Black Knight.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
If it wasn't for his distress beacon, we would have been forever lost in the vacuum of space like so much debris.  
  
   
**X:**   
I guess the reason I can't remember all that must be a side effect of the Coffin's freezing process...  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Beep boop...  
(I'm pretty sure that's not how it works...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmm... Hm?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Senpai?  
Is there something strange about what she said?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It almost feels like my own memories don't quite match what we just heard...  
   
**Mash:**   
Really? That must be a very odd sensation.  
Maybe it's a kind of déjà vu?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What makes you say that?  
   
**Mash:**   
I, um, I guess it's just my Shielder Sense...?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
(Staaare)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(...Ex is looking at me veeery intently.)  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure everything is okay, Senpai?  
  
   
**Mecha Eli-chan:**   
Perhaps all this Servantverse information is memetically corrupting [♂ his /♀️ her} mind...?  
  
   
**X:**   
You were definitely nodding off a bit there, Master.  
Get it together, will you?  
  
   
**Heroine XX:**   
Yeah, for real, Mas&ndash;  
I mean, yes, you must do better.  
  
   
**X:**   
I knew there was something suspicious about her!  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Heh heh.  
...Shh. Let's just keep it our little secret.  
  
  
**--FLASHBACK--:**  
   
**X Alter:**   
This place won't hold much longer.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
But the battle seems to be going well.  
I guess the principal's team must have handled it.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Huh? You found another Carbon Coffin?  
Great job, Black Knight.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Although... The thing is, that device needs a lot of careful adjustments.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
There wasn't any time for this with X, but someone's usually supposed to stay behind and operate it from the outside.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
If it's not handled properly, it can also lead to issues with memory retention....  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
Huh? You can handle those adjustments no problem?  
And you can even do it from inside the Coffin?  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Hmm, I see. That would be perfect.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Yeah, you're right.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
I'm sure we don't have much time left...  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
...but I hope fate allows me just a little more.  
  
   
**X Alter:**   
May the Alternium be with you...
