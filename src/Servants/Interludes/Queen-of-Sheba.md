# Queen of Sheba  
  
## Harder Than Going Through the Eye of a Needle  
  
**David:**   
Ooof. Oh hey, Fujimaru.  
Are you by chance looking for the Queen of Sheba?  
  
   
**David:**   
Actually, in the hallway a few minutes ago...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You ran into her?  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
...I did not. Hahaha!  
  
   
**David:**   
I had some business with her myself.  
She's the Queen of Sheba, after all.  
  
   
**David:**   
She's the queen whose beauty was praised and noted in any number of texts and works of art. Even the Bible!  
  
   
**David:**   
And now that beauty has come to Chaldea.  
I always meant to introduce myself to her!  
  
   
**David:**   
I would start off with a brisk “hello” and a pleasant conversation starter. Then, I would lock eyes with her and seal the deal by taking her hand.  
  
   
**David:**   
You have to meet a person to know if you're compatible with them, you know.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know what you're talking about.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you're looking for someone to abi-shag...  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
Hey, I'm passionate about this!  
It's very important to me!  
  
   
**David:**   
With the help of a certain someone here (a fellow fan of bronze skin and fuzzy ears), I've done a bit of sleuthing.  
  
   
**David:**   
First, I checked when the Queen appears in common areas. Then I looked into her favorite facilities and how she likes to get to them...  
  
   
**David:**   
But not once have I managed to meet her. Hrmmm...  
  
   
**David:**   
I try to get a few steps ahead, but she always seems to see just what I'm planning, and so manages to evade me. I have only failed so far!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's impossible.  
   
**David:**   
I'm not exaggerating. It's all true.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll just go report you for stalking...  
   
**David:**   
Oh, no. I wouldn't recommend that, Master. I'll have you know that I'm always innocent. My good looks always help me beat the rap.  
  
   
**David:**   
But, should the security personnel be male, he may falsely accuse me out of sheer jealousy. How sad.  
  
   
**David:**   
Besides, I'm only acting on instinct. As a sheep herder, I'm inclined to gather any lost sheep&ndash;  
  
   
**David:**   
Okay, fine! It's my fault!  
Just put your phone away!  
  
   
**David:**   
...But honestly. Big as this place is, failing to run into someone at least once seems odd...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
Maybe it's because...she's using her power of looking into the future or something...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's annoying enough that going so far is all she can do...  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
You think it's annoying?  
But this handsome guy is so desperate!  
  
   
**David:**   
I know my actions can be problematic, but don't you think it's funny when you think about it? That fact I, for once, am failing?  
  
   
**David:**   
Don't you think that's a sight to behold?  
Oh, I hope the Queen of Sheba thinks so too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
King David's optimism scares me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wouldn't say anything if you weren't out of line.  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
Thanks for that uninspiring word of encouragement, Master. I'll just have to patiently wait for my encounter like a gentleman.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...we're back at the Command Room.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Da Vinci asked me to search for her...  
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where am I!? Why is there suddenly a desert!?  
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Meowhahaha!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Well, well...you fell right into my mousetrap,  
agent of the villainous universal genius!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
There's no use squirming to get out!  
Not so much as a rat is gonna escape on my watch!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
You'll get a punch! A kick! A body slam!  
Come at me! I've got moves like a jaguar!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Eh!? Eh? Jaguar Warrior!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But you're not even from the desert...  
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ha! Everyone knows cats and the desert go together like peanut butter and jelly!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
And now, the winds of South America will blow CATastrophically in this desert! What I mean is, you're gonna die!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ack!!! Ptttfttt! Sand! It's rough and coarse and getting everywhere! And drying out my famous toe beans!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
U-um...Jaguar?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I believe Master has some business with me...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Oh, I see... I understand. Except I don't!  
The only thing I know is that there are butts that need kicking for entering my territory!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I thought I made myself clear, lovely animal-eared girl!  
I can only remember and follow one command at a time!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
P-please wait! (Sigh)...  
I guess we have no choice.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I'm sorry to ask this since you only just arrived, Master.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
But would you mind giving me a hand in calming her down? I will repay you generously.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Anything for my Queen!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Understood. I'll look forward to your reward.  
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Oh gods! Oh gods!  
Have you forsaken me, Babylonia's&ndash;  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
...Babylo-lo!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...We're back in the Command Room!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ack...im...pawssible...  
So all this was just a desert meowrage...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hahaha...it was a short-lived dream...the real me probably is asleep at a cat cafe...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Whew...have you calmed down, Jaguar?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Yep, I'm awake, and I'm feline fine. Hm. I don't even know what a Babylonia god whatsit is...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Wow. Amazing. (Clap, clap)  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
That was an amazing illusion.  
So potent. It felt so real.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I could even feel the burning heat of the desert sun, and it was making me thirsty.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I'm sure that skill came in handy in protecting the kingdom of Sheba.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Kid Gil...don't embarrass me...  
That illusion wasn't the one I wanted to use...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Some of Chaldea's magecraft equipment on the fritz, right? It happens all the time, don't worry about it.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
That's a relief. That means there won't be any lawsuits... Anyway, this is bad!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I really didn't intend for Master to get caught up in this!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Kid Gil's here too? What's going on?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Does this have to do with Da Vinci calling everyone over?  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Oh, my... Oh, my...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Da Vinci was looking for me?  
I-I didn't even notice.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I'm sorry. Kid Gil and I were having a business meeting&ndash;I-I mean, we were in deep conversation, so I didn't realize...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
And I asked Jaguar to stand guard and make sure no one disturbed us.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Yep. I accepted the task for an hourly rate of three tangerines. One to save for later, one for sketching, and one to freeze.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Very suspicious...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you hiding something?  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Ehhh!?  
N-no! Nothing...nothing at all!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh, does it look suspicious?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I suppose it does.  
I guess Da Vinci does have the upper hand.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, right. So Da Vinci was&ndash;  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Eh!? Tons of lost manuscripts unearthed!?  
THE Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts!?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
And she's trying to figure out how to handle them!?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Well then just give them to me so I can auction them off! I've got this!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
We can even leave my handling fee open for negotiation. I've already opened up some back channels and&ndash;Oh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“Oh”?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“Back channels”?  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Ah...um...well... Oh, my... Oh, my...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hm? What's wrong, my animal-eared amigo?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
You just made this really devilish face that reminds me of another friend of mine.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get it now.  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
What do you mean, you get it now!?  
Explain, please.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Okay.  
So you all know that my treasury is...you know...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see. Can't authorize that.  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Ehhhhhh!?  
Nooo, Master!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Yes, exactly. It's widely known that my treasury is...you know...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Of course, I do have a fine collection of weapons and armor as well, but not only that, I also possess a vast number of ornaments and rare metals.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
But to keep them all locked up is such a waste...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
...That, at least, would be the modern take on it...and since we've had knowledge of modern norms granted to us, that is the conclusion that we came to.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
That's why...I've suggested Kid Gil try some investment ventures to fund a side business...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
It will serve as collateral to finance art exhibits for people to appreciate and admire. Growth industries where we can put his fortune to work for him!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
She has a great eye for appraisal...  
This arrangement would be beneficial for me as well.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
My treasury gets a bit more organized, and I get a chance to add some more modern treasures to it as well.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I still don't get why you brought Jaguar Warrior into this...  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Actually...you see...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I (discretely) approached some of the more...veteran Servants who have more experience in this modern world, seeking their cooperation...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Meow?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
U-um...do you have a moment?  
There is something I would like to discuss with you...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Well! If it isn't the great queen of the southern desert nation!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
You cannot imagine how excited I was to learn that you were summoned to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
How reassuring! Ah, how holy!  
You, an individual full of knowledge and divinity!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Together, we shall become the sword and shield of Chaldea and lead it down the path of righteousness!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Uh...s-sure...  
P-pleased to meet you...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Um...well...thank you for your time...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Excuse me...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, my! It is the Queen of Sheba! I am honored!  
Please, allow me to shake your hand!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...S-sure... Ooooucch! My bones! My poor hand!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You are the living embodiment of a miracle!  
Faith will surely take hold in this land now!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Should you need any help at all,  
please do not hesitate to ask me!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The fastest way to get a six-pack, the best bulking recipes...please leave all of that to me!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Um...okay... If I ended up needing that...I guess... Really...sorry for your trouble...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Tarasque...is so cute...I wish I had one... (Sob)...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
They are all great and reliable people, who hold the Queen of Sheba in the highest esteem...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
But they weren't the right personnel for THIS job...haha...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Heh. So you're looking for the right connections and market? It's not that I don't know a few...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
But all my sources deal in shady and dangerous addictive substances... Like gourmet candy.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So this is a business venture to earn you some spending money?  
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, then I know the perfect person.  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
WHAT!?!?!?  
It's not who I think it is, is it?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Are you perchance thinking of an individual whose name starts with “D”? Specifically, a king whose name starts with “D”?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Impossible!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
He's basically my chief business rival!  
A competitor!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Were I to team up with him,  
it would ruin my profit margins!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh, and don't forget that when the business takes off, I'll be taking my cut, too.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I'll invest as much as you need until then, of course.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Ack.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Something's bothering me...from a legal standpoint. Let me guess...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Sheba and Kiddy Gil...are you guys trying to get into some kinda shady business together?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Is this going to affect Chaldea's peaceful snack time situation?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I don't want to see Fujimaru and Mash with the expression of someone who's used up all their materials and embers.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Not in my Chaldea. I'd rather die than to have us eat only apple cores for every meal.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Th-things would never come to that...p-probably...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's suddenly not so confident.  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I AM confident!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wasn't your future sight going to get you a pile of money?  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
For one thing, if she did anything THAT flashy,  
nobody would want to do business with her.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Master, are you trying to get in the way of my side business? I'll have you know, I am not giving up on this endeavor!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at first, I wasn't.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I kinda feel like I should stop this, yeah.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hm! I agree with Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Time to boycat this plan! Losing out on three tangerines is tough, but it's gotta be done!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Start the simulator!  
Start the battle BGM!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh? This is...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A 3D image?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A simulation?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Meowhahahaha!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Behold the high-techiness of My Room instantly turning into a small-scale simulator room!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
It was so worth getting help from an anonymous member of Chaldea (a fan of fuzzy ears and big sister types)!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't put anything past that half-god, half-human feline!  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Heh. A couple squeezes of my toe beans, and she was all mine!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How much did this renovation cost?  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Don't ask about cost!  
You'll ruin our P&L!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...If brute force is what would make you listen...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Then maybe it wouldn't be so bad to let my fists do the talking to introduce this plan to Master!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh, wow. Looks like both parties are really fired up.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh well, I guess I did get on this ride!  
I'll just have to do my share for our business.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Shall we get down to it, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
His eyes aren't smiling...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's LITERALLY going to use body language, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Meowhahahaha!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
We won! Chaldea's snack time is made safe at the paws of your faithful Jag&ndash;  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Meow?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Excuse me for interrupting your...uh, deep discussion.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I received a report that the jaguar who's been looting our pantry is here.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Eh!? Oh crap!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
H-hey! Lemme go! Don't just lift me up by the scruff of my neck like that!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
...A-air...can't...breathe...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I got her. Target secured.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Sorry to cause trouble.  
I'll take my leave now.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
...! Mrrroooooow!!!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Pat)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci...did you come to check things out?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this...a note?  
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Is she telling me I need to deal with this?)  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why did you want all that money, Queen?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sure we could give you an allowance that will let you could live comfortably here...  
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Ah, yes. We did not get an explanation of why she wanted to start up a business in the first place.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Not that I much care.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're always so rational about things like this, Kid Gil.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Yes... That has been said before.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
But this is about her, not me.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
B-because...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
C...camels...!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I want pet camels!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
In Chaldea! I want to keep camels in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
But...after I researched a few things,  
it sounded...so difficult...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Camels? How many?  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
At least...maybe one hundred...  
A-and I'm not kidding!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
If there was only one, it'd get lonely!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, yeah, this isn't an environment camels thrive in...  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Why is Chaldea in a place like this!?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Let's move to the desert! The desert!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Ahaha...a full-scale camel zoo in Chaldea, huh?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Yeah, a few million dollars wouldn't be enough for that.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
The cost to build such a facility, plus yearly maintenance...it'd be upwards of three hundred mil!  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
After all, we're in such an isolated location that we might as well be trying to terraform Mars or something.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
So...it's impossible...isn't it?  
(Sob)... Camel...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh...this is?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Another illusion? Or a mirage?  
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh? This is different than the usual simulator projection.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Actually, according to Da Vinci...  
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
The Near-Future Observation Lens: Sheba keeps starting up because it synchronizes with the Queen of Sheba's mental state?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
And not just that, but it's affecting the other machines too, causing a bunch of problems?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
I suppose I should expect as much from something Lev Lainur created...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
But, that's strange.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
With so many Servants gathered here in Chaldea,  
why did this happen now?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Oh...I see...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We need to take care of the Queen's homesickness!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...By the way, about my reward...  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...Oh...okay...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Would an assorted camel-shaped cookie box suffice?  
They're all broken, though.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Camel... (Droopy ears)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Queen of Sheba!  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
What is it, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will take you to the desert!  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...You're not pulling my leg, are you?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Then...make sure you always bring me along when you go on a quest to the desert!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
And even if it isn't a quest,  
just take me whenever I ask you, okay?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I will be your camel!  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...Really?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Promise? I want one with one hump, okay?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
If you have two humps,  
I'll tan your skin and make you into a wallet.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As you wish, my Queen.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Heehee...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Teehee...heehee! Okay!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I'm feeling a bit better...  
Sorry to worry you all so much.  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
That's great.  
By the way, Queen of Sheba...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
If you would like to tamp down this “power”  
of yours, I think I can offer some advice.  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean...  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Yes. It's a side effect of her future sight.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This was all caused by indiscriminate use of future sight?  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Yes. It appears so.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Got it. I'll allow Kid Gil to help me once more.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please help.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Try to keep the mischief to a minimum...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Master, are you going to go to Da Vinci to report your findings?  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Understood. Good work.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
See you.  
  
  
---  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Aaack!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...Da...!  
  
   
**David:**   
Hmmm...I see...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Have you been waiting outside the whole time?  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
No. Absolutely not. This is just a really,  
really, really fortunate coincidence.  
  
   
**David:**   
Besides, if I was going to hang around outside, I'd have just knocked.  
  
   
**David:**   
I just so happened to pass by&ndash;  
(Fidget, fidget)  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
Hnnnrrrrrrgh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Her fur is standing on end...  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
...Hmmm. Ah! She truly is the unparalleled beauty of legend!  
  
   
**David:**   
I am unworthy of the honor of being in your presence, Your Majesty!  
  
   
**David:**   
...But you know what? I'm a bit disappointed...  
  
   
**David:**   
Just a liiiiiitle bit... She's not quite my type.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;Eh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, she's kinda tall, but is that really why?  
  
  
---  
   
**David:**   
Oh, how unfortunate!  
Unfortunate, but... Yes, I can move on.  
  
   
**David:**   
The queen is a beauty, but not really my type of beauty. Let's just leave it at that.  
  
   
**David:**   
Welp! Off to the cafeteria to enjoy some babka.  
  
   
**David:**   
See you later, Fujimaru. I will let you take the role of the Queen's escort!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
...Huh? WHAT!?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
WHAT IS WITH HIM!?  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
With that face...that voice...saying things like that!  
  
   
**Queen of Sheba:**   
I don't like him! I hate him!  
I want to go back to the desert!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't let that vagabond get under your skin, my Queen.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Looks like we're going to have equipment trouble for a bit longer...  
  
  
---  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Ahahaha.  
Master, you really do have your hands full!
