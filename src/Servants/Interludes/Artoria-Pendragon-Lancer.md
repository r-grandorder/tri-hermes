# Artoria Pendragon - Lancer  
  
## Sacred Lance King of Knights  
  
**Altria:**   
I see. So the Holy City you saw was the avatar of my sacred lance.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It is true there was a possibility that it could cause that. As you can see, I am rather lacking in humanity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lacking in humanity, huh... Now that you mention it, it's true that you feel a lot closer to the King Arthur we ran into in Fuyuki.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So are you saying that if you're displeased with Fujimaru, then you'll also become like the Lion King?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That you'll collect pure and noble humans, and use your sacred lance to imprison them?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That's...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hi there!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Roman and Altria?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey there, Fujimaru. Good morning.  
Need something from the Command Room?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...I'll be leaving.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. She left without saying a word to you after she saw you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, after what happened in Camelot, I understand she feels awkward...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So I guess it's not going well then, Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She won't really talk to me about it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She took off her helmet, but...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. She often comes to me to ask for advice, but she might not want to show her summoner any weakness.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, time heals all. She may have the same Spirit Origin as the Lion King, but the two of them are separate Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Given the chance, I think she'll open up to you in an instant.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hope so...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The chance? The chance, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Anyway, I'm going to lay down for a bit...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The chance... chance...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Merlin:**   
Good night! Welcome to Merlin's dream world!  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
What's this... REM sleep? That's not good! Did you go back to sleep after the alarm went off? Or are you taking a nap?  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
At any rate, I would suggest you get some deeper sleep.  
I wouldn't be able to bug you until you do!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No doubt... This is a nightmare!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There he is, the root of all evil!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Merlin:**   
I see. You're asleep, but your judgment is still sound. This is why I hate REM sleep, where the brain's half awake.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Well, I'm just kind of an observer here, but I'd still like you to welcome me.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Why, you ask? Well, you're worried about Altria, aren't you?  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Well, that's where I come in, you see.  
Just leave it to me!  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Altria's always been rather stubborn. But when she has her sacred lance, she can become a handful. Heh.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Geez, I wonder who would give anyone something so dangerous... I feel bad for that fool.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foooou!  
(It's you, you nightmarish idiot!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fou!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can understand what Fou is saying!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Merlin:**   
Of course you can understand.  
We're in a dream here.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
To be honest, I'd never expect Cath Pa...  
I mean Fou to be this close to you.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
With Fou here, I can't feed you lies woven into truth. I wanted to tease you a bit more and have some fun, but...  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Oh well, let's get down to business, then. You want to know what Altria is like when she's holding the sacred lance, right?  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
I'll lend you a hand, then. Fortunately, it seems like a channel is about to open.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
To be honest, I can enter anyone's sleep.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
During REM sleep, like yourself right now, the owner of the dream can “notice” I'm there, so I don't want to enter that much.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fou. Fou, fou, fo-fou!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(That's right. This idiot here gets all powerless when he's being noticed in a dream. You can crush him like the bug he is right now.)  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Hey, don't just go telling someone the secrets of an incubus! Besides, that's only when someone's in REM sleep!  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Anyway, I'm going to have you enter non-REM sleep. Take a whiff of my special magical chloroform.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Very good. Now your mind will leave your body and soul, and move to the world of a certain Heroic Spirit's mind.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
A flaxen-haired, green-eyed beauty. A shining lance.  
An isolated king. This is the Heroic Spirit you will meet.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
You can talk to them all you want there.  
Anyway, I'll be leaving now, so don't worry about me.  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
When you wake up, you will be a certified Altria expert!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooou!? (This scumbag here is just gonna do whatever he wants and run again!?)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Ouch...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where am I?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
So you've finally awoken, my contractor.  
Such a sinful human for making me wait.  
  
   
**???:**  
But I do understand. You are wondering about the true feelings of your contracted Servants...  
  
   
**???:**  
You wish to touch the shining inner mysteries of my spirit, shrouded in Mystics...  
  
   
**???:**  
It is only natural to wish so... It is inevitable.  
No, a forbidden act dictated by fate!  
  
   
**???:**  
I shall allow it, you perverse voyeuristic spirit! I shall reveal my ever-so-charming true self here and now!  
  
   
**???:**  
I am none other than the true wielder of the shining lance! The blond, green-eyed king! Yes!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Fionn mac Cumhaill is here, now!  
Now how about we shine!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're the one shining!  
   
**Fionn:**   
Of course. I am Erin's protector; naturally I sparkle. Well, I can dodge but I don't get invincibility.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So bright. I don't want to see any of it!  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha, enough with the jokes.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I am not a certain beguiling Lancer! You should have no reason to avert your eyes from my beauty!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fionn:**   
Anyway, let's set the jokes aside. I apologize, I got excited and wanted to have some fun.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I am here because I sensed the presence of evil. My pure-hearted Master is about to fall in the trap of an evil incubus!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I chased after that presence the moment I felt it.  
Come, take my hand.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
This kind of evil... No, perhaps not evil... Actually rather beautiful... I mean, what is this place?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
It feels quite similar to my homeland... But I have no memories of a city being built with this kind of construction technology...  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Tír na nÓg? Hahaha. No, it can't be. It's a bit too flashy and showy for the Land of the Young...  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Look out! Who are you!? Show yourself!  
You can't stop me from hugging [♂ him /♀️ her}!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That should be my line. That human is my contractor. Keep your hands off.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Well well, if it isn't the wielder of the sacred lance, the King of Knights! I see, so you are the one dwelling in this evil city.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hmm... This isn't good. This is really not good.  
Can I excuse myself to bite my thumb for a second?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I can figure out the layout of this place and explain it to Fujimaru once my wisdom swells.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...There's no need for that. When the time comes, I will speak with my own words.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Now, hold your lance and not your thumb, Fionn mac Cumhaill. The price you pay for trampling into my world is quite high.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha. So that's how it's going to be, after all, huh?  
I knew that was going to happen without biting!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I'd be mad too if someone trampled the memories of my homeland. This fight is unavoidable.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
But before that, I think I'll confirm just one more thing.  
Fujimaru, do you want to leave with me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, I just got here...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'll stay here.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fionn:**   
I can't believe you'd turn me down!  
What a faithful Master!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
But that's something to be happy and proud of.  
I guess any annoyances should take their leave.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
But it seems I have to pay the price first.  
Isn't that right, knight of the sacred lance?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Do not make me say it again. You talk far too much.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Or maybe you're just being too uptight? Don't you have anything to say to the Master that you chose?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Of course my Master is going to choose my lance! There's no need to say that out loud!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Now reroute your magical energy to me, Master!  
I will show you who is the better Lancer!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Very well! Then I shall face you with my full strength!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Needless to say, I'm summoning some Celt soldiers, too. That's what the full strength of a king is, okay?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Fionn:**   
Ughhhh!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Stand down, guardian of Erin! With respect to your exploits, I shall permit your retreat just this once!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, how very kind of you! You seem to possess a semblance of sanity after all!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
It's true that I'm just getting in the way! Farewell then! Goodbye, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Well then, Master.  
Why do you come to a place like this?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This is the world of my memories.  
Have you too come to expose my identity?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not my intent.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's all Merlin's doing.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
...Merlin?  
Oh...I see. So that's how it is...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But you bear some responsibility as well.  
You fell prey too easily to Merlin's cajolery.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If we had not formed a contract, you would already be dead. Exercise more caution in the future.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I differ from other Servants. It is not necessary for you to understand me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You only need to give me orders to fight. Everything else is inconsequential. Especially “mutual understanding.”  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Mutual understanding. Surely no such thing could exist between a human and me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why is that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even though we're talking right now?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
There is no reason.  
I am not the King Arthur you know.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
By bearing the sacred lance for too long, I became a Heroic Spirit with a Heaven attribute, rather than one of Humans or Earth.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...From your perspective, my vantage point is commensurate with a god's.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
So...I myself can no longer understand what is human warmth or laughter.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What I consider “good” and what you consider “good” are surely different.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I...am arrogant as I am merciless.  
You no doubt noticed during the last battle.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I punish what I cannot forgive.  
I obtain what is valuable through force.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I have not a shadow of a doubt that my way is just.  
I suppose you could say I am a tyrant.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Thus...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If I were to enter your circle, I would trample the flowers of your human joy.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
My former self would have been loath to do such a thing.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Perhaps I no longer understand such feelings, but I do not want to ruin the joy of others.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't you overthinking things?  
   
**Altria:**   
No. This is the truth, pure and unvarnished.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What lies beyond is the Lion King you all have fought.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So I guess we fought a Lion Queen, not a Lion King...  
   
**Altria:**   
What? Ah, I suppose a female king is in fact a “queen”...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I just don't like the sound of it. Am I uneasy because that hits a little too close to home...?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
...The vantage point of a god.  
I see. Such is the anguish of someone with power.  
  
   
**???:**  
God neither saves nor forgives people.  
  
   
**???:**  
God is the law, the nation, the world. Such an order collapses in the presence of human warmth.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Another trespasser...!?  
Who are you? Reveal yourself!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
One who became a divine Heroic Spirit at the end of your path for protection. Do not fear, do not fear...  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
My name is Romulus. Like you, I was worshipped as a god while I continued to walk the earth.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
The shining emperor. The noble lance. The great tree soaring into the heavens. That is me, this is Rome!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Romulus, the Holy Progenitor!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's glimmering!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Romulus:**   
Indeed, good words.  
Fit for worshipping a god. Thus...  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
<span style="font-size:25px">&mdash;Die!</span>  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
&mdash;You blocked Rome's spear.  
You resist the will of Rome.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Th-That was close...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Altria!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
What are you doing!  
Is this how they do things in Rome?  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You're not aware? A rightful person cannot endure the light of the sacred lance.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Perhaps you require an evil Master. One day, that person will go blind, heart gone cold, and become a mindless puppet who worships you.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You have no need for voices with a heart.  
Nor do you have need for a heart.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Deus Ex Machina. Goddess of the Sacred Lance.  
Return to your proper form.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
That is why Rome journeyed forth.  
To eliminate Fujimaru, your Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Mind your own business, Founder Romulus! I show no mercy to those who try to lay a hand on my Master!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
What nonsense! The Lance from the Ends of the World stands no chance against the Spear of the Founder!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Come, my children, my infinite branches and leaves! Show Rome your heroic selves!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altria:**   
Ugh... How can Rhongomyniad be inferior? Impossible... Yet the truth is that I cannot break through!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Don't you understand, King of the Sacred Lance?  
You are not drawing out the sacred lance's full potential.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Or should I say you were not intoxicated by it.  
You fought to protect your Master.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
However, it was not a fight to protect the world. Naturally, your lance would lose its radiance.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What...! My lance remains! It is as radiant as ever!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...You leave me no choice.  
I did not want to resort to action that's Un-Roman.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
However, sometimes violence is necessary.  
And that is now, Fujimaru.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...He's coming!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A frontal assault to finish us off...?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Romulus:**   
I ask of you, Fujimaru.  
Say you love Altria Pendragon!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whaaaaaat!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
Wh-What are you saying, you cur!  
So barbaric, is that how Romans fight!?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ignore him, Fujimaru, just keep channeling magical energy to me!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
All appeals from the peanut gallery are rejected!  
Fujimaru, say, “I love her!”  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Just how long do you intend to make a fool out of me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course I love herrrrr!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I! LOVE! HER!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
Whaaaaaat!  
Um... Right... Thank you!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No! Wait, I mean, wait! I do not require respect from my contractor!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Well, what if [♂ he /♀️ she} said the opposite?  
What if [♂ he /♀️ she} shouted, “I hate you!”?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I would be extremely sad!  
Even I can get hurt sometimes!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Precisely. So your own words betray you, King of Knights!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You not only rejoice in your Master's love, you also hold your Master in esteem.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Um, we just share the standard relationship of trust between Master and Servant...  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
That is fine. That is how it should be.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Knight of the Sacred Lance. You are the child of a dragon, yet you are human, and strive to be human.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Your soul still burns with passion. You possess a god's vantage point, but fall short of a god's heart.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You failed to become a mechanical god.  
And that, precisely, is&mdash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome, right?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Indeed. Rome is adventure&mdash;  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
The symbol for all that is human, graduating from the Age of Gods and gaining the heart to love fellow men as a human.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...I still do not possess... the heart...of a god...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're the same Altria as always.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're still the King Arthur of legend.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
You think so? It's hard...for me to accept, but...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...But, if you, my Master, say so, perhaps it is true.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hah hah. Being told something like that in such a loud voice would surprise anyone, of course.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Allow me to apologize. I said that you could not understand me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I will not retract that comment. It is an unshakeable fact that we are different.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But... I may have been stubborn. There are times we may understand each other despite differing positions.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
With that, will you fear me, or rely on me?  
I shall see firsthand.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Altria.  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes. I look forward to our future time together, Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I admit I'm a little scared.  
   
**Altria:**   
Y-Yes, that is true. I do not know...and it is not my fault, but...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I heard the Lion King stormed through the Holy City, so I will try not to turn out like that...

**???:**  
Bwahahahaha! King of Knights, you've finally warmed up a bit!  
  
   
**???:**  
I've been waiting. I've been waiting so long for this moment!  
  
   
**???:**  
This is the perfect chance!  
A Chance-sseum Tentyris!  
  
   
**???:**  
Prepare yourself! You're not exactly my type, but I've always wanted to make you bow before me!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
This voice...!  
   
**Altria:**   
...I see. Not being able to take a hint was something this excruciating...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I shall be careful myself, and not barge in when no one wants to see me.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
Doesn't this dream have too many guests!?  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, I agree. I shall make sure Merlin gets his just punishment someday.

**??? & ???:**  
How dare you rub PDA in our faces and ignore us!  
There are two of us here! Who do you think we are!?  
  
   
**??? & ???:**  
Bear witness to our earth-shattering alliance!  
We&mdash;  
  
   
**Gilgamesh & Ozymandias:**   
We are the first two kings of an ancient, golden age!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gilgamesh and Ozymandias...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, be as heartless as you can and crush them.

**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altria:**   
Well then. Is there anything else on your mind?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not particularly.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gotta thank Romulus.

**Altria:**   
...I wanted to speak more... about the sacred lance, and myself...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But it seems we are out of time.  
Soon you shall awaken.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well then, next time.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll visit you when I wake up.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, let us go back, Master.  
Or should I say, “Let us wake up.”  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Until we meet again, my Fujimaru.  
In the meantime, I shall practice how to smile.
