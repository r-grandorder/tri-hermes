# Leonidas I  
  
## Leonidas Boot Camp  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Master!  
I know it's sudden, but let's train.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Why?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For what...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Leonidas:**   
You're a mage. So perhaps you think physical strengthening is unnecessary.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
However, such notions may prove to be fatal.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
As the battles get fiercer and deadlier, it's essential to fortify your body.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
You must improve your strength and endurance!  
Relax, my calculations are flawless!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I feel even more nervous now...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not so sure about that...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Yes, just leave everything to me!  
Come on, let's be off.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We have arrived.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is a mock battlefield.  
Um...Senpai, are you sure about this?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Leonidas:**   
As long as I, Leonidas, am by your side, there's nothing to fear!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Let's start training!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Leonidas:**   
You're working up a good sweat, I see.  
Let's continue!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
OK.  
I will summon your next opponent.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Bring it on!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm, something's not right.Let's see&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What's going on&ndash;?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Ah.  
Rejoice, Master!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
It seems like our latest arrival is literally brimming with muscles!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm supposed to be happy about that?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's nothing to "rejoice" about!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-There's been a malfunction!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We seem to have accidentally summoned something that we shouldn't have!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, retreat immediately!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
What a silly suggestion!  
This is the perfect chance!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Come on, Master...let's muscle through this!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Ah, what a fine battle!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All adjustments complete.  
The final enemy has been set.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you want to do?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think it's fair to conclude that training is over for today...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Not yet! We must follow this through to the end.  
On to the next enemy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
The final opponent is a random enemy.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
...Um, Miss Mash.  
Just what is that, exactly?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Is it that, uh, you know.  
I think it starts with a "G."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it's a Ghost-type enemy.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
...Ghost...collective consciousness...science!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leonidas?  
You seem to be sweating quite a lot...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
What? No, not at all!  
I'm doing fine here. Just fine.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
You might not think so, but I once took on 100,000 men!  
A mere spirit devoid of muscles is nothing to fear&ndash;  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
I apologize, Master! I confess I don't know how to deal with ghosts!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
You see, my muscles are useless against them&ndash;!  
They seem smarter than me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's overcome it.  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Overcome it  
...you say?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
U-Uh, I suppose it's not hard to say we won't run into ghost again in the future.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Thus, I must stand my ground!  
Fear not, Leonidas!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
This enemy's nothing compared to a Persian army of 100,000 men!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't worry. Your attacks will work.  
   
**Leonidas:**   
What!  
...I see, you may be right.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Indeed, even these ghosts were once human!  
Thus, my muscles are not useless after all!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Very well, Master!  
Let us face this ghost!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Raaaaargh!  
We are ghost hunters!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Huff, huff, huff...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
What a powerful enemy...Contact with a ghost chills you to the bone. I just learned something...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Thank you, Master!  
I was able to overcome the ghost with your help.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
I swear to safeguard you from all enemies, to stave off despair, and to always bring you victory!
