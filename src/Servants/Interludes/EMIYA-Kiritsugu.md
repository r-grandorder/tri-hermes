# EMIYA - Kiritsugu  
  
## You, Like a Smiling Flower  
  
**Narration:**   
It was just another job.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
To them, it was just another minute Singularity. To me, it was a threat to be eliminated as a Counter Guardian.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There's no need to go into details.  
A target emerged, and needed to be taken care of.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I simply do what I was meant to do:  
I search for the enemy, engage, and eliminate them.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The fewer people I engage with, the better.  
At least, that's a personal choice of mine.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Heroic Spirits. Heroes.  
Many of those are mere shadows of mass murderers.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In my opinion, they are all repulsive.  
I prefer not to be by their side when fighting.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But working completely independently is also difficult.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It must be because of my lack of freedom as a Servant.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Requiring Master to accompany us for Rayshifts is a pain. But I suppose that has turned out to be a blessing in disguise...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Fujimaru, or Master, is quick to understand. And so we were progressing smoothly. This time is no different.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The source of the minute Singularity... It could be a fragment of a Holy Grail, or a remnant of the original abnormality in the timeline.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But they are all simple to track. A majority of them can be eradicated and handled with a single attack.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Should it be a life-form, we kill it.  
If it is an inanimate object, we destroy it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
We seek it out, and then swiftly...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...This time around, it's quite clear-cut.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It must be a remnant of the many things you defeated. It's not as powerful as what we encountered in the final Singularity.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's not alive.  
It's already dead.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
But it's taken in a shard of a Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Which then it turned into a minute Singularity.  
What a pain. There are far too many Holy Grails...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...and, of course, shards in this Grand Order.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry to take up your time, Emiya.  
   
**Emiya:**   
Likewise.  
Sorry to rope you into this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for finding it so quickly.  
   
**Emiya:**   
Finding the problem and dealing with it swiftly is my forte. I should be the one thanking you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
Now let's do it.  
I'm sure IT'S also tired of waiting for us.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Commence battle!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
Understood, Master.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Emiya:**   
It ends here, you worthless pile of nothing.  
I'm sure you're sick of living as an empty shell.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Mission completed, Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The minute Singularity has disappeared.  
We should hurry back to Chaldea.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work, Emiya.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We got it done quick thanks to you.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
It was nothing.  
I just did my job.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
......  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
.........  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
............  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you two doing in front of Emiya's room?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Mrow!?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hmmm hmmm hmmm, fweet tweet tweet♪  
(Humming and whistling)  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Um, it's actually a bit of a long story...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
It has nothing to do with the Holy Grail. I am...like a Divided Spirit that poured out of the Holy Grail...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
That makes me unique among all the Heroic Spirits. But me standing right here is not related to that whatsoever.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...We're just taking a peek.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's exactly how it looks!  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
When you're stalking prey, you hide in the darkness! This jaguar is sad to know you forgot the laws of the jungle!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
That's not it.  
We're not out to kill anyone!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why don't you just talk to him?  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes...you're right.  
We know that's the right thing to do...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
But that man doesn't want to see us.  
Even when we speak to him, he just walks away...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Honestly, we've run out of options.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Gasp!) Here he comes!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Deploying Noble Phantasm “Jaguar in the Black”!  
It'll make this whole place SUPER dark!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Come on, Miss Iri and Master!  
This way!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Be like glue, stick together and become one with the darkness...!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Ah! My shadow...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that a Noble Phantasm you don't use in battle!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You sound like a boss.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Hmmm...like the “Dancer in the Dark.”  
Perfect. Nobody can see us from the outside!)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(It's a nagual-like Presence Concealment.  
Behold, it can even hide friends other than Jaguar!)  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Wow, how wonderful.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Yep, yep. Miss Iri, you really are accepting and wonderful too, meow. You get a Jaguar stamp... Stamp! Once more for good measure.)  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Teehee. You flatter me, Jaguar Warrior.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(By the way, it will only work for Jaguar during battle. Obviously, I can't hide an entire group in the middle of a fight!)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Our prey is heading towards the Command Room.  
Come on let's TAIL him!)  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Roger that! Come on. Master, you too. Hold your breath and follow us. We're in this together now!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess I'll tag along.  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(That's the spirit! Big Sis is glad to have an understanding Master. Here, I'll give you this wonderful dead spider as a reward!)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Eh? You don't want it?  
But it's a paw-sitively perfect gift!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Chaldea has enough stalkers...  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Yeah, Jaguar thinks so too. I'm a teacher, after all. But they say: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, and a Blaze for a Bunyan.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(It's Emiya's fault for being so secretive.  
Even Big Sis thinks... No, that's not my point.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Even I'm concerned for him. What in the world happened to him to make him act like that.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(What's with the dark, gloomy aura? If we leave him alone, he's definitely gonna die alone.)  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(...Yes. I can't just sit idly by and watch that happen to him.)  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
............  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
.........  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
......?  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
...  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(It appears he was speaking with that Archer.)  
  
   
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**   
(What were they talking about?  
Let's go ask!)  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Mee-wow, Emiyan! The Emiyan who at least makes us feel kind of comfortable!  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
... (She appeared out of nowhere again...)  
Hello, jungle spirit. What business do you have with me?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ah... You're one of the few people who treats me properly, as a spirit! I paw-sitively love that!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I'm compelled to send over a nice hawk carcass or something as a gift...but now's not the time. What were you HAWKing about!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's...direct.  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Yes, that's the kind of bluntness I'd expect from Jaguar Warrior...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That was a lame pun, but hopefully he didn't notice her true intent.  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(The Assassin... He left already, so hopefully it's not that obvious. Oh my, wait a minute...)  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Does that mean we lost sight of him!?)  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
...  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
Oh, well.  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
After all, no matter how chaotic and full of ulterior motives your actions are, at least it's all usually done with the best intentions.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Yep, yep. That's because I'm an animal.  
  
   
**F：Emiya:**   
He asked about my magical energy consumption during battle. I answered as best I could.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Oh. That's insignifiCAT.  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Yes, that's quite ordinary.)  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Whatever! I've GATO-go, first Emiyan!  
Or actually, maybe you should be second...?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Anyway, until next time! It'd be nice if you made some good ta-PAWS so that I can have a nice drink soon!  
  
   
**E：Irisviel:**   
(Ah! Jaguar Warrior, wait, wait!)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, I spoke briefly with him.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
We spoke about what to be mindful when battling in groups. Other than that, nothing else significant...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes. I did just speak with him.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
We talked about battles in the Singularity.  
It wasn't that long of a conversation.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I actually had some questions for him of my own...but that should be for another time.  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
We spoke on various topics in magecraft.  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
He asked me a few things about grand magecraft and ritualistic magecraft, mainly about Mystic Codes.  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
And about the magical energy consumed when using things like that...  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
It was quite insignificant. It could have been covered in a few short words, really.  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
He was likely...  
  
   
**Lord El-Melloi II:**   
No, I'd rather not. This isn't something to involve myself in based only on speculation.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Argh. We lost him!  
Big Sis is a-paw-led!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Does Iri look relieved?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She looks happy, actually.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes, you're right.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I'm just happy.  
I was worried that he was all alone in Chaldea...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
That's what I've been concerned about this whole time. It's always been on my mind.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
But maybe that was just my selfishness talking. No matter which “what if” version of him would appear...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
To think that I would be needed...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I am such a greedy woman. I may not look like it, but I'm supposed to be a mature wife...  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ku...guwah!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
For Master Iri to say words like “mature” and “wife” without hesitation...ahhh, she has so much adultness!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Oh, y-you think so?  
A-and what exactly is “adultness”?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
This Jaguar is moved. I'm at a loss.  
But I haven't lost the game! NEVER SURRENDER!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Remember to always be a tough cookie, and grin and bear it!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Dammit!  
We're going to play again...fur real soon!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's gone...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, for now, good work...?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...  
  
  
**--SECTION BREAK--:**  
   
**Narration:**   
...I managed to get away.  
Ugh, what a pain.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Divided Spirits like goddesses...two special Servants. Having their attention is nothing but trouble.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
First Servant: Irisviel von Einzbern.  
Second Servant: Jaguar Warrior.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Those two seem to want to talk to me excessively, and it's obvious that they don't like me to be isolated in the way I prefer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That is why I sought out other Servants to talk to.  
I am not used to conversing with heroes of the past.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm assuming El-Melloi II must have caught on,  
but he's not one to talk. He's that kind of man.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Now, are the two Servants satisfied?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It really is a pain in the ass...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But this is nothing new. This isn't the first time I felt the burning gaze of two Servants in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It's none of their business. I suppose their interest stems from knowing another version of me from some other version of history.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Or something like that.  
How stupid.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Whoever they know, he is not me.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Yes, you're right.  
A different person.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
But there must be SOME sort of connection between us. Though you may not believe it...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
And besides, my dear...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
You're watching me...following me with those eyes.  
At times. Sometimes.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
How dare you enter someone else's room.  
You're like an Assassin.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And stop reading others' minds. I know that as a Divided Spirit of a Holy Grail...which makes you a part of the powerful wish-granting device...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...reading one's mind may just be second nature to you. But it's annoying to me.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I never meant to annoy you. Nor do I wish for you to take an interest in the version of me in this world.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
But...you know...to see you so alone...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...is very painful for me.  
  
   
**B：Emiya:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**B：Emiya:**   
That's your problem.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
You're right.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Not getting involved with others is my decision.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Kiritsugu?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't call me that.  
So...you do know that name...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Please get out.  
A day may come when the two of us speak...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
But it is not today, Irisviel von Einzbern.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I'm sorry, Kiri&ndash;  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Assassin.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A terminal of the Holy Grail.  
Transformed from an Einzbern homunculus.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
She'll be one formidable opponent.  
  
  
**--SECTION BREAK--:**  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I just saw Caster run out of Assassin's room, crying!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You're right.  
It seems that way.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what does that mean!?  
And why...why is my heart racing so much right now!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
...Who knows?  
Maybe because you're such a simpleminded brat?
