# Mochizuki Chiyome  
  
## Snakes... They Coil Around Me  
  
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, hello.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What a coincidence, running into you here.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I think this might be the first time for us to bump into each other without anyone else being around. Do I have that right?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Usually you look away or hide in Master's shadow the second you see me.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Let's see, I think your name was Paraíso...?  
No, no, wait, I've got it.  
You're that Kouga Mochizuki clan ninja.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Ulp...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
A-ah...ah...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Now what was your name again? Mochizuki...Chiyojo? Chiyome? Mmm... Chiyome's muuuch cuter, so let's just go with that.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What's your class, Chiyome?  
Assassin?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Why, what a coincidence! Mine too!  
Will wonders never cease.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
After all, you and I are both clearly...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
A-aaah... Aah...  
Ulp...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
(She's...looking at me...)  
P-please...stop... No... No...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...Forgive...me...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
My, my... She really doesn't care for little old me, does she?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Why, it makes me feel like a frog staring down a snake.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...Hmm?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Um, did you want to talk to me about something?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm in a bit of a hurry.  
I have to bring my sisters their meal.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, don't worry, this will only take a moment.  
You see...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
(Mumble, mumble... Whisper, whisper)  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
What, is this supposed to be a secret?  
Hmm... Are you sure she'd like that?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
You're a god too, right? Come on, can't you do an oni a favor? Pretty pleeease?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Nnn... I'm not sure...  
But, well... Hmm...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
It's not like this would be your first time, right?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Nnn...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chiyome?  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Yes, Master. It is I, Mochizuki Chiyome,  
Kouga Jonin.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Shuten asked me to come here...  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I-is that so.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I am here on behalf of the Lancer, Lady Medusa,  
who asked me to come to the Command Room.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
But, I see she is not here...  
What is going on?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Good evening, all.  
You see, I'm what's going on!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Lovely night, isn't it? Really gets my blood pumping, if you know what I mean.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Mind helping me take the edge off with a bit of exercise? Chaldea's got that “simulator” thing, yes?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You want to do combat training?  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Yeah, that sounds good. Seeing how we're the same class and all, I was hoping she could give me some pointers.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean, you want to spar with Chiyome?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Sounds like Master's on board with it.  
What do you say, Chiyome? Care to join me?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I-if Master commands it...I would happily go to the ends of the earth.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu, that sounds like a yes to me! That's the spirit.  
All right then, let's get started!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Chiyome:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...Snakes, snakes, snakes. So many snakes!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Wh-wh-what is the meaning of this!?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
There are so many snakes!  
It's like you're...purposefully...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you afraid of snakes, Chiyome?  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I-I...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you, Shuten?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Not a big fan of snakes, are you?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Chiyome of the Kouga Mochizuki clan. You use your curse sooo expertly, yet you don't seem at all accustomed to it.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What a waste. Don't you know how hard your ancestors worked to pass it down across generations?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
They sure didn't go to all that effort just so you could cringe in terror at an illusion of a snake...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I... That's...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold up.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you trying to torment Chiyome?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufufu, you stay out of this, Master...  
or I just might have to eat you.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Come on, you know how it is.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Humans love overcoming their weaknesses, right?  
Not me, of course. The very idea fills me with dread.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But you're a human-based Heroic Spirit, right, Chiyome? Don't you HAVE to overcome your weakness? Don't you want to?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I-I...  
I have no fear of...snakes...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Indeed, I have no weaknesses whatsoever!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, really? How silly of me. My bad.  
I'm relieved to hear that.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Then we can keep going without worrying about needing to hold back.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...  
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chiyome.  
   
**Chiyome:**   
P-please do not worry about me.  
I have no issue with this whatsoever.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can always stop the simulator if you want.  
   
**Chiyome:**   
D-do not be ridiculous! I was already swallowed up by a snake long ago! I have nothing to fear from one now!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
All right then, here goes nothing...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I do hope you'll forgive me if I end up squashing you like a bug.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chiyome!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Here she comes! Hang in there!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Yes, Master...!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I, Mochizuki Chiyome, shall carry out your orders to the letter!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Chiyome:**   
Snakes, snakes, and more snakes...  
I have had enough!!!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Just...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Just wh-what do you want with me!? Fine, I confess!  
I have been terrified of snakes since I was a child!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
But so what!? What would you know of the pain and suffering that comes from being born with the curse of Orochi!?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
How could you possibly know what it is like to be burdened with the knowledge that you will one day grow scales and become a serpent!?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
That day may be today...or tomorrow...or any of the days yet to come!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Or worse, perhaps that fate will not fall to me, but to my child, or my grandchild, or my distant descendant...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
But regardless of who is made to endure that fate, it is one that all of Orochi's shrine maidens born to the Mochizuki clan must bear!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Even in death, in this new, transient life as a shadow, my curse has not been lifted...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Do you have any idea how this feels!?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Hmm.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Nope!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Then cease your torment of me and allow me to serve the new master I have found in peace!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
After all this time...!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I have finally found a master that does not see shinobi as disposable pawns, but treats me with kindness and respect!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I can hardly fathom my fortune in meeting [♂ him /♀️ her}!  
I can never hope to adequately pay [♂ him /♀️ her} back!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
That is why I at least want to be of as much use to [♂ him /♀️ her} as I possibly can, to my very last breath!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
And yet...!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
You CEASELESSY seek to prevent me from doing so!  
Why!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chiyome...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Forgive my loss of temper, Master, but I am afraid my patience has reached its absolute limit!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
   
Lady Shuten-Douji!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Yeees?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
You are Shuten-Douji of Mt. Ooe...  
The oni of the Heian period...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
No! As far as I am concerned, you are no oni of Mt. Ooe! You are nothing less than the child of the great serpent god responsible for my curse!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I know that the ancient serpent, or perhaps dragon,  
known as Yamata-no-Orochi, was once worshipped as Ibuki Daimyojin...and that he had a single child to his name!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
You, Lady Ibuki-Douji!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...Well, well. You've got guts,  
calling me by THAT True Name, hmm, Chiyome.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
My, my... You must reeeally hate me...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I was hoping for something like this, but I really must admit, you've surpassed all my expectations.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What is it they say these days about courage? Ah yes. You've got balls of steel...figuratively speaking.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I do love a good display of courage.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Just look at you shaking in your boots, digging your heels in like a child trying to look taller than she really is.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
You really care for Master that much?  
You wanna serve [♂ him /♀️ her} so badly it hurts?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...I do.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Then...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...are you having a steamy romance with [♂ him /♀️ her}?  
You ARE a widow, as I recall.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
L-l-loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Mm... Is that so? Then what would you do if [♂ he /♀️ she} asked you to share [♂ his /♀️ her} bed?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
If that is what my Master requires,  
I would not hesitate!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Then you ARE having a little romance with [♂ him /♀️ her}.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I-I told you that loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another! Now, cease this at once! I will not have you slander Master's good name any further!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Even if you are the daughter of Ibuki...  
I will not let you insult [♂ him /♀️ her} again...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...no matter how much the cursed blood of my ancestor, Kouga Saburou, may torment me!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Be warned, Lady Ibuki!  
Your next word will be your last!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Come get me.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...Very well then! Have at you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Chiyome:**   
(Huff, huff...huff...!)  
Her magical energy seems...inexhaustible!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
(Huff, huff...)  
(Gasp...) We shinobi...do not usually find ourselves out of breath...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
So this is the power of an oni... Nay, the true power of Shuten-Douji, daughter of Orochi!!!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...And apparently, she is still only using a fraction of it.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Yet here I am, employing my full strength, to no avail. Is this is her oni power at work, or her serpent power?  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Nonetheless...  
I will not admit defeat yet...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...I refuse to lay down my blade until the very end!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's enough, Chiyome!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop this! Both of you!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
That's some fighting spirit you've got.  
Still not enough to take down an oni, though.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But hey, you tried.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Well, I'm satisfied. I give up. You win, I lose.  
See you around.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...I was watching the whole time, Shuten.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Hey now, what's with the pouty face? I was just about to take a hot bath. Step aside, will you?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Do you have a thing for getting mixed up in other people's business or something?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Why else would you go around teasing that half-assed snake demon who clings desperately to her humanity?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Come to think of it, you did the same thing with that whole pagoda thing a while back. It's almost as if...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Have you...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Don't tell me you've started feeling sorry for humans?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fu...  
Hehe, fufufu.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufufufufufufufufu!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!Hehe, hehehe!  
That's the funniest thing you've ever said, Ibaraki!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
You've got it completely backwards!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Backwards...?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu. It doesn't matter how many oni descendants or cursed bloodlines we get here. Those cowards could never be up to the task, since they wouldn't last a single breath against either you or I.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Humans, Heroic Spirits...they're all the same.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Just one little puff, and poof...they're gone.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
???  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.  
Don't mind me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You did great, Chiyome.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Way to go!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Thank you!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Although, I am still not sure if she was taking that fight seriously... I feel as though she was merely testing me.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
But regardless, my resolve will waver no longer.  
Orochi's curse may never leave me...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...and I may never entirely overcome my fear of it...but now I won't ever lose sight of where my loyalties lie.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
So please, worry not, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not a problem.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Glad to have you with us, Chiyome.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Thank you!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...I suppose I never did tell you about my ancestor, Saburou, and his curse.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I am truly sorry for that, Master!  
Truly!  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
I trust it hardly need be said at this point, but, yes, I am cursed, and there is nothing that can be done about it.  
  
   
**Chiyome:**   
So, if you wish to end our contract, and be rid of me and all the trouble I bring, I will understand...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not ending anything.  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You'll always be welcome here, Chiyome!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chiyome:**   
Thank you, Master!!! I promise to serve you to the very best of my ability!
