# Diarmuid Ua Duibhne (Saber)  
  
## Arrival of Twin Swords  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
A killer...you say?  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Indeed.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
I know little about the workings of the “simulator,” but I do know that a mysterious killer has been appearing there as of late.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
It is fortunate that this began during Master's absence, as they were quite a formidable foe...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
At any rate, we must remain on the alert.  
Would you be so kind as to inform Master?  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Y-yes, of course.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Although, um, why did you choose to  
approach me about this, Lord Tajima?  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Now then, if you will excuse me.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
W-w-wait! Just a moment, Lord Tajima!  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Is there a problem?  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, um...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
I just wanted to make sure...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
You say this killer appearing in the simulator is not what they call an “NPC”?  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Do I have that right?  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
That is correct.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
This person possessed the aura of a true  
swordsman...to an extraordinary degree...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
It was just yesterday that I encountered them.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
I was taking a walk in the simulator when...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...Who goes there?  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Show yourself.  
I can tell you are no mere enn-pee-see.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
So, you are bereft of speech.  
Or perhaps, you were born without a mouth.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
I am trained in Otomeryu. Ordinarily, it is not meant to be seen by the eyes of commoners...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...but now that the Tokugawa shogunate no longer holds sway, and I am a mere shadow of the true Tajima...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...I see little point in letting  
such concerns stay my blade.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
So be warned.  
Draw nearer, and I will cut you down.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...!  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Impressive.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
I must say...  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...your swordsmanship is a sight to behold.  
No human could make use of such a technique.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
You must be some manner of monster.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Or perhaps...a curse that has gained consciousness.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...Regrettably, I was unable to  
settle our duel before they left.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
It appeared they were dissatisfied with my swordsmanship.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
Yes... I had the distinct impression  
that one blade is not enough for them.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
It was as though they were searching for an opponent who wields two blades instead.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
I imagine they were taking the form of a dead man's essence, much like we Heroic Spirits.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
But now, they must have lost sight of who they are, and so have turned on those of us who carry blades of our own. What a pity.  
  
**Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:**   
...And so they have devolved into some  
mindless killer wandering the simulator.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
...So it is basically rogue data that is  
similar to a Heroic Spirit. Understood!  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
I'll go tell Master right now!  
And I'll let Da Vinci and Mash know, too!  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
...And that's everything Lord Tajima told me!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see. Thanks, Kiyohime.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
You're welcome, Master!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He could've just told me himself...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
He said it's because he doesn't  
know much about the simulator...  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
So...does this mean there's a bug in the simulator...?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Our scans haven't picked up anything, but the main point of the simulator is to project Heroic Spirits' Spirit Origins.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
With all that intricate data in the registry, it's entirely possible that a bit could have gotten scrambled somewhere and caused a problem.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides, Yagyu Tajima-no-kami's one of the best swordsmen who ever lived, right?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
If he felt like this thing wasn't just a normal NPC, I'm inclined to take him at his word. Something must be wrong.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. Welp! Guess we'll just have to run some comprehensive emergency system diagnostics!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Master.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, hello, Lord Diarmuid.  
What brings you here?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
If I may, I would ask that you  
please take me to the simulator.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I think I might have an idea  
as to who this miscreant may be.  
  
**Mash:**   
Okay, Senpai, Diarmuid.  
The simulator is up and running with no trouble so far.  
  
**Mash:**   
I'll be monitoring the entire system from here in real time, but please let me know if you see anything amiss.  
  
**Mash:**   
There aren't currently any NPCs in that area, so there shouldn't be anything unusual happening.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Mash.  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
If my instincts are correct...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...we should encounter our target soon,  
even if this place is meant to be deserted.  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you sure, Diarmuid? I've confirmed that your area is cut off from all external access...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes, I'm sure.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Whoever this is, they won't pass up their chance to find what they're searching for.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Can you tell me?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are they searching for?  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Me.  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
You were wondering why Lord Tajima didn't tell you about this yourself, right, Master?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I can answer that.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
It's because our miscreant must be some kind of curse. Or rather, feelings that have degenerated into one.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I just never thought it would look for me in the simulator, tracking me through the bonds we share.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Lady Kiyohime.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes! I'm here!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
There is the faintest trace of this curse still lingering on your shoulder.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
It is from when you spoke to Lord Tajima,  
after he encountered it here.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
That is almost certainly why he tried to distance himself from Master. To keep the curse away from [♂ him /♀️ her].  
  
**Mash:**   
Really!?  
  
**Mash:**   
But, our sensors didn't pick up anything when she entered the Command Room!  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Now that you mention it...I do think my shoulders feel a little heavy...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
I'd better burn that curse  
away later, just to be safe.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Impressive.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Lord Tajima must have come to you because he knew you would have been able to handle it without difficulty.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That...makes a lot of sense.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Kiyohime and curses do kind of, uh, go together...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Master?  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
That curse...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
No... Those feelings are directed at me.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I can still detect the scent of Danaan on them.  
I have no doubt that it is searching for me.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I considered trying to quietly handle this myself,  
so as not to trouble the rest of you...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...but that is not a decision I can make on my own.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I am sworn to serve you now, Master, and cannot take up my spear without your permission. That is why...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's why you came and told me.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Diarmuid.  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
You are too kind, Master.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Please be careful. This scent...  
The curse is drawing near!  
  
**Mash:**   
I can't see anything on our monitors...  
  
**Mash:**   
No, wait! I'm picking up a hostile headed your way!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my, he just radiates animosity!  
  
**Mash:**   
There is no way this is NPC data!  
These numbers shouldn't even be possible! Senpai!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm going to give it a shot.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll do my best to be careful!  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Worry not, Master! Virtual space or not,  
I will make sure no harm comes to you!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall be your opponent!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Damn! I can't finish him off with this Spirit Origin!  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Diarmuid!  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Master!  
  
**Mash:**   
The hostile shows no signs of disappearing! It's going to be fiendishly difficult to defeat them in battle!  
  
**Mash:**   
I think you should&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold on.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're trying to say something...  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...You are not the one.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
You are not the one.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Your spear is not enough.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Show me your true power. Show me the power  
of a knight raised by the sea-god Manannán.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Show me the sword of Manannán!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Master, stand back!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Hraaaaaahhh...!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Gáe Buidhe!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...You are not the one.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
(My demonic spear didn't work?)  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
(No, that's not it...!)  
  
**D：Voice:**   
...That's right.  
He wishes to duel with swords alone.  
  
**D：Voice:**   
No other weapon will lay him to rest.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
!!!  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm picking up a powerful magical energy reading!  
It doesn't appear to be hostile, but...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Are they here to fight too?  
No, wait. This feeling...  
  
**Voice From The Shadows:**   
...I'm sorry for the trouble. He is indeed looking for you, but he is also looking for me.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
You're...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Now I see...  
  
**Mash:**   
Diarmuid!?  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
You're lowering your spear...?  
Isn't that dangerous to do in the face of an enemy?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
It's fine. This shadow is different.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
If anything...I would say he's here to back us up.  
  
**Voice From The Shadows:**   
Indeed I am.  
  
**Voice From The Shadows:**   
However, I currently lack a corporeal Spirit Origin, and thus would like to make use of yours.  
  
**Voice From The Shadows:**   
If that is acceptable to you, Master.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Master, I would ask you to grant his request.  
We must do this if we are to defeat this opponent.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I trust you, Diarmuid.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Nod)  
  
  
---  
  
**Voice From The Shadows:**   
Understood!  
  
**Mash:**   
They're resonating with each other...!?  
It looks like Diarmuid's Spirit Origin is changing!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Servant, Saber. My True Name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, of the Knights of Fianna...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...and my two demonic blades are at your service!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Now! Curse who has taken form in our simulator!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
No... You are a pure, honest giant&ndash;a Giolla Deacair! But I also know you as the Fairy King Ábartach of the Danann!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Why have you come to Chaldea!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Fairy King Ábartach of the Danann!?  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Wh-who's that!?  
  
**Mash:**   
He's a king who ruled over one  
of the fairy kingdoms in Erin!  
  
**Mash:**   
In the Fenian Cycle of Celtic legend, he was said to have formed an alliance with the Knights of Fianna...  
  
**Mash:**   
...and in the process of forming that alliance,  
Diarmuid ended up fighting one of his knights...  
  
**Mash:**   
Although some accounts of that legend say that Diarmuid actually fought the Fairy King himself!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Yes... Yesss...  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
That is the knight of Fianna I have been searching for.  
At last, you have shown yourself before me.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
I saw your swordsmanship in my dreams. I saw your swords shining brightly atop the earth once again.  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Thus did my consciousness cross time and space to arrive in this digital domain...  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...At last, I have found you again, Diarmuid!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Not the invincible knight Fionn,  
with his demonic sword Móralltach and demonic spear Gáe Dearg!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Nor the figure of the Lancer with two demonic spears! No, at last, you have become a Saber wielding two demonic swords!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
A far cry indeed from the Diarmuid I saw at the spring on that fateful day...  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
...who was the only one able to leap  
beyond that precipitous cliff!  
  
**Mysterious Swordsman:**   
Ahh, I want nothing more than to defeat  
you and your two swords, Diarmuid!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...What a self-centered king you are.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Nonetheless, I understand how you feel,  
and I accept your challenge!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna! But now I stand before you armed with two swords, not spears!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Now, you shall know defeat!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Holmes:**   
Fascinating.  
  
**Holmes:**   
So two different versions of the same Heroic Spirit now coexist in one Spirit Origin? Hmm...  
  
**Holmes:**   
I suppose it is not totally dissimilar from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's case, though for you it seems to be a more temporary phenomenon.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Especially given how the Saber version seems to have made his way here via the connection he made to Ms. Miyamoto in a parallel world.  
  
**Holmes:**   
That particular Spirit Origin has, of course,  
been registered in our database by now...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...but I'm afraid that your current self can only maintain its manifestation for so long.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Therefore&ndash;  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You might as well enjoy yourself while you're here. This should be fun!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So, I'll put a little more in the way of resources into the simulator while you're here.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
After all, we're Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. You won't find this many Servants anywhere else! Ever!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There ought to be plenty of badass heroes here for you to cross swords with!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I, um... Are you sure about this?  
I never belonged to this world, after all.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Are you certain it will not be a problem  
to keep me here, even temporarily?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine! Don't worry about it!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's Lancer Diarmuid think?  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Oh. Well...  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Go on. What's he saying?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...The Lancer within me says we  
should accept Master's generosity.  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Then listen to him!  
Please, enjoy yourself.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
You are all very kind. Very well then, I shall  
do my utmost to enjoy what time I have here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Great! Then let's get started!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Four consecutive battles coming right up!  
  
**Mash:**   
Go!  
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...I almost feel as though I am dreaming.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Yet I doubt even the gods or the Fairy King could ever have conceived of something so wondrous as this.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Truly, I could ask for no better parting gift.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
You have my deepest thanks, Master of Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai... Diarmuid's Spirit Origin is forcefully reverting to its Lancer form!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Did you enjoy yourself?  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Of course, Master.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wish you could've stayed longer.  
  
  
---  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
It would seem this is it.  
It won't be much longer now until I disappear.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
But please, do not worry about me.  
My Lancer Spirit Origin is perfectly capable.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
I am still me, whether I carry sword or spear,  
and I will continue to wield them for your sake.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Now then, I&ndash;  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...!  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
That golden sword!  
Are you...the King of Knights?  
  
**Altria:**   
Forgive me. It would seem you no longer have time to spare for a duel.  
  
**Altria:**   
Perhaps we can remedy that some other day,  
Sir Diarmuid.  
  
**Altria:**   
As I see it, it may be best simply to summon your new Spirit Origin here...  
  
**Altria:**   
...but it is only through fate that we may have another chance to duel.  
  
**Altria:**   
And so, while I cannot give you my word,  
I can at least say this much:  
  
**Altria:**   
I hope we will meet again some day,  
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Knights of Fianna.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
...Yes. I'd like that very much.  
  
**Diarmuid:**   
Should that day ever come, King of Knights...we will have a battle for the ages!
