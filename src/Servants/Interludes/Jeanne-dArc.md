# Jeanne d'Arc  
  
## My God is with Me I  
  
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;I am having a dream.&ndash;"She" is smiling happily.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
To kill all evil, to trample over evil, it's the right thing to do.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's why she's "happy."  
That's why she's laughing.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Ahh... I don't have that kind of "emotion."  
&ndash;But still...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Could that be...  
"something" that is unattainable?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
There I was, thinking such foolish thoughts.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai.  
...Um, how are you feeling?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You look a little pale...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Really? You've been fighting battle after battle lately.  
Fatigue could be building up in you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It might be better to rest up today.  
I'll let the Doctor know.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Fou.  
...Can you look after Fou?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
OK.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sure.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Great, thank you very much.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm sleepy...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...ster...Master, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, thank goodness!  
This is no place to be sleeping.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where am I?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I do not know either.  
Most likely, this is France, I think...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mash!  
Master just woke up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! Thank goodness you're all right.  
I've finished scouting the area.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At the moment, I couldn't detect anything unusual.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Communication with the Doctor has been severed, which bothers me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, do you remember anything before ending up here?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I was afraid of that.  
...It's the same with us too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When I woke up, we were in this world.  
Master, for the time being, let's set up a camp.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor will notice something is wrong, and then he'll find a way to get us out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At the meantime, we'll explore this world.  
If we find anything unusual, we'll fix it&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How does that sound?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think that's fine.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Good.  
All right, let's get going.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Such a lovely breeze.  
It stirs in me the feeling I've returned to my hometown.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that so...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was raised in Chaldea, so I don't really get that kind of feeling...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But since you seem so happy, Jeanne, I'm glad for you.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I-I am sorry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne, your hometown is Domremy, correct?  
I wonder if it's close to here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you'd like, why don't you pay them a visit?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm afraid France is a very large country...  
I can't ask the both of you to accompany for that long.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Besides, I don't believe I should return.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
When I decided to save France, I made up my mind that I could never return to my village.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that so...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Have you ever thought about returning?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Hmm, you asked a cruel question, Master.  
Yes, I have thought about wanting to return.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Many, many times. Especially whenever I felt the burning sensation in my old arrow wound.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But you never returned.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
No. Even if&ndash;everything went well, and there was nothing to prevent me from returning.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I just felt that I should not return.  
I mean, I threw it all away.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
My family, my village, everything.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You can't be serious...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Hehe. It's all hypothetical anyway.  
I was captured, and put to the flame.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's all over now.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If we were to change that, I would end up like how Gilles was then.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;But, I don't understand why.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
On every occasion, people assumed that I have regrets.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...that really can't be helped.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You see, people tend to have regrets about their life&ndash;  
For simply being young.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, you're right.  
That is quite correct.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Time...If I had time, I would've done what I wanted to do.  
Or, I would've done the things I couldn't.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Even if I didn't have either... I could at least have found something that I wanted to do.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Humans have unlimited possibilities, and the younger you are, those chances skyrocket.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I simply threw that away.  
I was a fool, and certainly no saint.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Really?  
Then, I too have&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You too, Mash?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! No, I mean ...It's nothing.  
Forget about that, Master. I can see a town.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go. We must find out what era,  
and the situation we're currently in&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I think...they're fine with me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So it appears.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thanks to the Dark Jeanne's rampage in 1431, you got caught in a bad situation...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But this town looks peaceful.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank goodness.  
If it's peaceful, there's nothing that could be better.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The castle flag... It's the flag of England.  
This place must be...under England's control.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that certainly isn't the flag of France.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Is this one of the situation...  
That needs to be fixed?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Certainly if they're oppressed, but it feels unnecessary for now. We shouldn't accidentally cause any trouble...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Absolutely.  
That is absolutely right, but...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, I'm sorry. That was just my personal feeling.  
I am entirely your Servant now, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
At any rate, let's gather some information in the town.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me.  
  
   
**G：Citizen:**   
Yes?  
What is it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Pardon me.  
May I have a moment?  
  
   
**E：Citizen:**   
What do you need?  
  
   
**G：Citizen:**   
Hello, there.  
What would you like?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's something I'd like to know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
This is terrible!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you find something?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A surprising change after all!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
No. Nothing has happened.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes, that's right. The town is peaceful.  
Only tiny squabbles that the law could easily resolve.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But it seems in this world, England defeated Charles VII, and all of France came under his domain.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That means...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's right.  
I am afraid&ndash;"I do not exist" in this world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's really nowhere else left for us to investigate.  
I guess we could check out the castle, but that's it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...I find it hard to believe thatEnglish soldiers would allow us in.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, you're right.  
At any rate, let's get out of here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We weren't able to find any leads at all...  
I'm worried about tomorrow.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tomorrow is...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I know, tomorrow is another day.  
Hehe. Thank you for saying that.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oui?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, I'm sorry.  
I was praying to the Heaven...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Has Mash...gone scouting?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Master, can I speak with you?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...At the end, this world is the epitome of peace.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
England has set up a proper government.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Though it seems the French armies were slain&ndash;  
it happened quite a while ago.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master...  
Apparently, I was never in this world.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
France did not rise in defiance, was defeated, became the domain of England&ndash;and now enjoys peace.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
There may have been many twists and turns, conflicts and other problems...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But they overcame them.  
...They were able to overcome it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I do not exist in this world.  
It means...my very existence...was a waste...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think that's true.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Thank you. But, it's peaceful.  
There no longer is a heart-rending war.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's possible that I might even be in Domremy.  
I could be living my life peacefully in that village.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Common upbringing, common prayers, even a common romance.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you want to see?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Just a little.  
But, I feel it would bring me pain afterwards.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm sure that the me over there is happy.  
So I want to pray for her, just a little bit more.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master, go and join Mash and Fou, all right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, where's Jeanne?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. This indeed is a world where Jeanne doesn't exist&ndash;it is the epitome of peace.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But there's something wrong about this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If Jeanne doesn't rise, and France is not a reality, there will be big implications on history to follow.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have...a strange feeling about this...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's too peaceful.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that is absolutely right.  
This world is almost too peaceful.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no trace of disturbance anywhere in the town.  
You'd think there'll be more resistance for a land that was taken by force.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There was absolutely nothing wrong in the town&ndash;  
To me, that's actually more odd.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's take Jeanne back to town with us and look again.  
We need to dig deeper, I think.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...What's this...!?  
  
   
**E：Citizen:**   
Hello there.  
How are you?  
  
   
**E：Citizen:**   
Oh, what's the matter?  
What do you need?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...The current time is...1AM...right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In this era, it would be safe to assume most people would be asleep by now already...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But the streets are just as busy as during the day.  
...I knew it, something is off!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Let's head for the castle. The only place we didn't investigate during the day was that castle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sure!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
There's blood everywhere...and I am sensing a colossal amount of magical energy.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The wandering ghosts...are...French soldiers...!?  
No, there are Englishmen among them, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're attacking us!  
Master, orders, please!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Take this!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's finally...over.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The spirits of those dead soldiers... Wandering this world with regrets. It's just too many of them.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But in the town, there was not a single ghost.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Wait, who is in charge of the town to begin with?If there are no soldiers here, then what are they&ndash;?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know. But one thing is for certain.  
This door won't open any more.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Which means...they don't intend to let us get away.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Let's move on.  
I still sense something demonic deeper inside the castle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I hear footsteps.  
Several of them...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Remnants?...No, it doesn't appear so.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait, these are...werebeasts?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, orders please!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jeanne:**   
How did those monsters get here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It makes no sense to me either. However...  
I do feel that you're the key, Jeanne.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Me?  
True, this France is my homeland.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I will certainly not allow anyone to ravage it&ndash;  
...Huh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Notice something?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, that could be it...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
We must hurry to the throne!  
Most likely, this will solve this mystery!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...?  
Are we facing...a demon next?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Stay calm, Mash.  
That is only a monster that looks like a demon.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The one they serve&ndash;is you, isn't it?  
  
   
**???:**  
Eeeheeheeheehee! Right you are!  
Right you are! It is I who controls this demon!  
  
   
**???:**  
My name is Mephistopheles!  
I am a Servant granted the class of Caster!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's you...!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, so you know who I am?  
Is it possible that we have been allies?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
In that case don't worry!  
I have been summoned by someone else.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
That is to say, I can kill you all without any problem!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ugh...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mephistopheles...is your name, right?  
I have one question for you.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Do you?  
Then out with it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
What is it with this charade?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
That, you see&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Are you trying to tell me that everything I did was pointless?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Or possibly, since France does not exist now&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Are you testing me to see if I will raise my banner and rally the people?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
My, my! That is an excellent answer!  
I applaud you! A great round of applause, everyone!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So, what of it?  
How does that make you feel?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
To be honest, It certainly makes me feel awful.  
But in the end, this is all a fantasy.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I have nothing to fear from a fantasy.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
However, what about a logical fantasy?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This town is an actualization of the assumption,  
"what if you never existed."  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Jeanne d'Arc!  
O Holy Maiden of Salvation!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You alone do not make the world go round!  
Nay. Whether you act or not...the people are happy!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Neither a king nor a hero, and to borrow your own words, neither a saint as well&ndash;  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
How dare you worry about the world's transformation!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong with it?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Who asked you?  
My question was meant for Jeanne d'Arc&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's exactly as you say.  
...I may have been meaningless.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Heheheh.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;However, does one only act if there is meaning?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...What did you say?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The fate of mankind is bright, vibrant, yet cruel.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Just as life can be full of meaning, death can also have equally as much significance.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
People act when it's "meaningful."  
People don't act when it's "meaningless."  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Acting or staying immobile while knowing the future.  
To me, that is not what humans are.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Let me put it clearly!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm not looking at the future.  
I merely head down the path I have chosen for myself.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let me be even more explicit.  
"Tomorrow is another day"&ndash;That's all there is to it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That is my answer.  
Tell that to whoever hired you.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...I see. I see.  
I see. I see!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So, your heart will not break.  
In that case! I will have to physically break you.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...No. Wait a moment.  
I haven't been able to make really witty comments.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Could it be that I am the one that broke?  
Could it be? ...Yes, it could be!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Take this world as it is.  
Even if you have no hope, and all you have is despair.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...So people, without halting, can keep their chins up and move forward.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Regardless of brambles, regardless of pitfalls.  
I will&ndash;choose a path where I can march forward!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
Heheeheeheehee!  
Is my role to be over so soon!?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Well, I guess it's all right!  
If I am over there, tell myself that I said hello, all right?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Kind regards for the mischievous Mephistopheles!  
Until we meet again!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I'm so sorry for getting you involved in this, Mash and Master.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It seems that you and I must again  
...fight one more fight together.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
This is a fight challenging what I believe in.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If you would, please, Master.  
Will you join me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I promise.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Thank you, Master.  
  
  
## My God is with Me II  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Seventeen years living in that village.  
Seventeen years with my family.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Peaceful days spent helping out my parents and praying at the church. A precious time in my life.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...But I threw it all away.  
I left it all behind for the sake of victory.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master... Master, please wake up.  
...Oh, what a relief. You're awake.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where am I...?  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It appears we are on a deserted island.  
Well, not deserted now that we are here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could this be...?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master. I believe I am to blame for this. I'm very sorry for causing you trouble in such a busy time...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry about it.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Thank you very much, Master.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
As for our present situation... It seems there is nothing on this island.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It is small. I do not sense anything demonic...  
But there are no caves, and nothing man-made either.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Which means...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It appears that we are inside a dream, like last time.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
And there is one more thing that I have noticed:  
this time around, we are not in a place from my memory.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I'm embarrassed to say this, but I'm at my wits' end.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
What shall we do...?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait a moment. It appears...that there's no need for us to simply sit and wait.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
See!? There's a ship.  
It looks like it is coming towards us...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I sense very strong magical energy coming from that ship. Something is definitely up.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Based on the situation, it's likely some torment from my past, like last time.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...But the theme this time around is strange.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I may have seen the sea,  
but I've never been aboard a ship...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Should we ignore it?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Well, as we are alone on an island in the middle of the ocean, getting passage on that ship would seem to be our only choice.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Um...unless you are saying that you want to enjoy a leisurely vacation on a deserted island, Master...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
In which case, I will do my best to make that happen!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, please! That's not it!  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Hehe. I know.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Our only problem is that it's unclear what kind of people are aboard the ship. If only they were pirates, it would be easy...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Easy?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, if I take it on myself to discipline...I mean, persuade them, I'm sure they will listen to us.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Master. Something's coming.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
They've sent over a small boat.  
It seems they want us to get on it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
There doesn't seem to be anyone on that larger ship, though... Things just keep getting stranger...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're getting on.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, Master!  
Please be careful as you board!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It may be a trap!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I had my suspicions... It really IS a ghost ship...  
  
   
**Pirate A:**   
   
...Ungh...booze...trea...sure...  
  
   
**Pirate A:**   
   
Wenches... Good-looking girls...  
Amazons... Tanned... Abs...  
  
   
**Pirate B:**   
   
Pink hair... Ditzy...  
  
   
**Pirate C:**   
   
Braids... Glasses... Intellectual...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just like the Beard-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are pirates all the same...?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even in death, they think almost exactly like Blackbeard, don't they...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Either way, I cannot allow them to remain.  
The dead deserve a peaceful rest.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Strange. Something weird slipped in.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
L-looks like we got everyone!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The ship's starting to move...!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It appears the ship itself possesses magical energy. If we stop it prematurely, we will be stuck in the middle of the ocean.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...It doesn't seem to want to harm us.  
Let's continue our course.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In the end, man always seeks to make the impossible...possible.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
This is at once a diabolical power and a ray of hope, a desire to make the unknown...known.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Yes. That is what being human means.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That very fiendishness is precisely what led to so many discoveries in the Age of Exploration.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Conversely, the desire for righteousness and justice can make people commit acts of unspeakable cruelty&ndash;like when I was burned at the stake.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Man's vices can be forgiven... But what of his virtues?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master!  
I see a ship up ahead!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Is it...drifting? Its sails are tattered.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks like there are people on board.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
They're waving at us.  
The ship is coming closer, so I'm going to talk to them.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
What's going on? Did something happen!?  
  
   
**Crewman:**   
Help!  
We're about to sink!  
  
   
**Crewman:**   
Let us aboard!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, we stopped...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Looks like everyone's coming aboard regardless of what we have to say about it...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's help them out.  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Of course.  
Hehe. I'm glad we're on the same page, Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
You there!  
We'll extend the plank to your ship, so please hurry!  
  
   
**Drifter:**   
Thank you... Thank you!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Women and children first!  
You still have time!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Strange... So few people on a ship that size shouldn't be enough to sink it...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Is that everyone!?  
  
   
**Crewman:**   
No, there's more!  
There's still two on board!  
  
   
**Crewman:**   
Hey, you two!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Eh...? No...it can't be... Impossible...!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wh-why, why are you here!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Why are you here!?  
Mother...!?  
  
   
**Crewman:**   
Oh come now. You don't even know the half of it yet!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...Hello, hello! Long time no see!  
It's been, oh, a few days since we last met, I believe?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Everybody stop!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mephistopheles!  
What the hell are you...!?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Well, they're just background characters. I wouldn't want them to cause trouble, so just ignore them.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...Now then, Jeanne d'Arc. Excluding me, there are two people left on board this ship.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
One is your own mother!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Thank you so much for coming all the way from France!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Just kidding! Keheeheehee!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
But wait, there's more! Our last guest of honor needs no introduction...but I'm gonna do it anyway!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
He is...the filthy bishop who, under England's orders, led you to your execution at the stake!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
A real human dumpster fire... The man who was bribed for his judgment, who consigned your soul to the flames!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
The man who laughed and jeered while you were burning. Yes, you should know who it is by now!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Pierre Cauchon!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Eeexaaactly! Now let's untie these two!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This won't hurt one itty-bitty bit, okeydokey?  
  
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
...P-p-please don't pull...  
Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow!  
  
   
**Mother:**   
...Oh, Jeanne...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, but that ship of yours? It can only carry one more. Let more than that aboard...and it will surely founder!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now, Jeanne d'Arc!  
Make your decision!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Who will you save? Your mother, who has loved you your entire life, or this old geezer who scorned you to the very end?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Well? Well? WELL!? Whatcha gonna do!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Oh. The answer is easy.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I will simply get off. They can have my place.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...There was not a bit of hesitation there.  
Shoulda seen that coming!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Mother. You are probably an illusion...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I'm glad I could see you once more. Now, please, board our ship.  
  
   
**Mother:**   
B-but...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Bishop Cauchon.  
...You go too. Hurry.  
  
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
...  
  
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
I-I am not wrong.  
You are a witch!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...And that is fine.  
What a stubborn man you are.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come back!  
   
**Jeanne:**   
No. This is the right thing to do.  
I'm very sorry, Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm going with you!  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wh-what a surprise.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I don't know what to say, Master... I'm happy, but such an attitude will lead to an early death for you!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm one to talk? Y-yes, that's true, but...!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...How could you forgive a man like Pierre Cauchon?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
My mother's sadness will fade one day, just as, in time, my distaste for the bishop will disappear too.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It is the sole province of God to judge what is evil.  
As humans, all we can do is fight against it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
This man may never have my forgiveness, but salvation is a different matter.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If it's possible, I shall save him.  
However many times I must.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
But didn't you hear what his last words were?  
There was not an ounce of remorse in them.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It is not for me to demand remorse, regret, or repentance. After all, humans cannot be other than what they are.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Mephistopheles. This ship is going to sink, correct?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
You should move over to our ship one as well. You may be a Servant, but I'm sure it would still be a problem for you if you were to be stranded out at sea.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh my. You really are an interesting person...to your own detriment!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
But to the individual who had summoned me, I'm sure this is such a buzzkill!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I'm sure they are positively apoplectic right now!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So now I shall demonstrate that your choice was a mistake!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Eh...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A Noble Phantasm!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I did not want you to take this game so seriously!  
This is merely an imitation! A sham!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Ah, but then again, these things are imitations that are so very close to being real.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
At least, your real mother would probably have reacted the same way. And even Pierre Cauchon would definitely say what he said!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mephistopheles...!!!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...Ehehehe! Very good!  
I do so ADORE that look on your face!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master! That ship is no longer safe!  
Please jump over here!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-okay!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Aha. So Master's come too.  
Well then... Come, my Shadow Servants!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Shadow Servants...!  
Just who are you working for!?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, don't you worry your little head about that.  
It's playtime!!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
Keeheeheehee! I lost again!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
You were a strong opponent!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Kahahahahahaha!  
That's not how it was supposed to be, Jeanne d'Arc!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Our loss was determined the very moment you chose to sacrifice your own life without hesitation!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Why? Don't you get it?  
I am the great demon, Mephistopheles!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
If you don't fall from grace, the only other choice is for us to lose!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Well, looks like I'm still going to get overworked!  
Thanks for playing!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
See you again! Byeee!!!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
He disappeared again.  
It doesn't seem like we defeated him, though...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Still, I'm starting to understand what his intentions are.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's do our&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master? Um, are you by chance...mad?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You shouldn't throw your life away recklessly.  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Errr... But at that moment, there were no other options...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Well I, um, thought that would be the best solution...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please don't die.  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Um. Th-that line really gets to me...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But in that situation, the only choice I could have made was to do what&ndash;  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm glad you understand!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm still mad.  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I-I-I'm sorry!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I know! Chaldea!  
When we get back to Chaldea, I'll treat you to anything!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Whether we go to Boudica or Emiya...  
It'll be your choice!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
My journey will continue.  
But the end is also on the horizon.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even if that journey ends, I would like to continue traveling with you, Master. To fight as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Protecting humanity.  
Protecting virtue.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That is what I wish for, and nothing more.  
  
  
## My God is with Me III  
  
**Narration:**   
...I don't feel pain from being burned.  
...I don't feel grief from being cursed.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The only thing I feel is immense, overwhelming heartbreak. It's not my body that's being consumed, but my soul.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Since I don't seek salvation in ascension,  
the stake doesn't fill me with despair.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Instead, I find myself entranced by the flames.  
The beautiful, magnificent flames.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Even as they reduce my flesh to ash,  
I can feel the holy flames purifying my soul.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Thus began Jeanne d'Arc the Servant. The young girl's final moments, now little more than hazy memories.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...Wake uuup!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up pup pup pup!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That voice... Isn't that...  
  
  
---  
   
**E：???:**  
Wake up, or you'll start to hear my shrillest laugh in surround sooound!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you trying to curse me!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Theeere you are. Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!  
It's me, Mephistopheles!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
What an unexpected, but delightful,  
surprise to find you here!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
May I ask what brings you out this way, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Can I go back to bed now?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
No, no, no, nonono! We are long since past that!  
Yes! Long since past!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Sadly, our present situation is sliiightly less than ideal for sleepyheads!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Why is that, your pleading eyes ask?  
The answer is simple.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Because the way things are going,  
the world will soon be destroyed!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...All right, let's go over this world.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
As I'm sure you've already guessed,  
this is a non-dream dream. You know, that old saw.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
There's no getting in touch with Chaldea here.  
We may as well be cut off from the entire timeline.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
The only place this world connects to is itself.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I believe it belongs to Jeanne d'Arc.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And your task here is to destroy it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay...so what about you?  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Ooh, harsh! Well, you know,  
I have my own reasons for being here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing here, Mephy?  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Maybe I'm here because, of all the Servants in Chaldea, I'm the closest there is to everyone's image of the Devil?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, and I also have my own connection to that Ruler, as you know.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now, on that note, let's be on our way!  
The final battlefield awaits!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, I do beg your pardon.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Final battle or no, even I must admit that showing up dressed like the Devil would be in poor taste!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So, without further ado...!  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
What do you think?  
Now I look just like any other soldier!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow, that's handy...!  
  
  
---  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Of course, it might be easier to just cast a perception inhibitor spell and be done with it, but this way is more fun.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Now then, you there, soldier. It sounds like the whole town is abuzz. Pray tell, what might be going on?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Oh, they're about to hold an execution.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
An execution, you say?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Aye, they say Jeanne d'Arc finally confessed to heresy.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wha...!?  
  
  
---  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
My, my, whatever are we going to do now?  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Historically, this is where she is meant to be burned at the stake.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Even if, hypothetically speaking, we were to Rayshift in and save her at the last second...  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
...the end result would almost certainly be the same.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Whether Jeanne is burned at the stake,  
or ends up dying of old age...  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
...her role in history has come to an end,  
and I doubt it would have any other effect.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
If she succeeded at avoiding the stake and tried to stand on history's stage once more, I imagine there would be secret efforts made to...you know.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Assassinate her...?  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Indeed. I imagine Charles VII, or perhaps someone else, would betray her, and she would meet a bloody end nonetheless.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Betray her?  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Indeed. I'm guessing she would be betrayed again,  
and end up getting murdered anyway.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Aaanyway, none of that matters in this world!  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
There may be nothing to stop us from leaving her to her fate, but there is nothing stopping us from saving her, either!  
  
   
**Citizen:**   
It's Jeanne d'Arc!  
It's the witch!  
  
   
**Citizen:**   
Poor thing. I don't see why they have to execute her.  
  
   
**Citizen:**   
Hey, they say she's a witch.  
  
   
**Citizen:**   
Forget the cross! Give her a good stoning!  
  
   
**Citizen:**   
Is God going to punish all of us for this?  
Or just the priests carrying it out?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait a second. That Jeanne is&ndash;  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Indeed, she is. Or isn't, rather.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
That's neither Jeanne the Rogue Servant,  
nor the actual Jeanne from history.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
That's Jeanne d'Arc...the Ruler.  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Which perhaps means that if she's burned at the stake now, she may just cease to be your Servant.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What!? We've got to do something!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
Order! We will now carry out the sentence of execution on Jeanne d'Arc!  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
This girl claimed she was a saint! She claimed that she heard the voice of God! She defied the Church!  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
She had no compunctions about engaging in the worst kind of heresy. She is beyond redemption!  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
My, oh my. This is true of all these sorts of witch trials, of course...  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
...but I do so enjoy this gloomy atmosphere!  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Hm? Why are you looking at me like that?  
Do you think I'm not normal or something?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
To put it lightly.  
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Oh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, but then again, you are Mephy, after all.  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Hohoho, you know me so well! No wonder you've been able to keep me on as a Servant!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
Do you have anything to say for yourself, Jeanne d'Arc?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
...It would appear you do not.  
Very well, light the fire!  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
...So, what are you going to do now, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm going to save her.  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Ahh, just as I thought!  
In that case, I think I'll join you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you coming with, Mephy?  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Oho. So your going to save her is a foregone conclusion, and the only question is whether I will be joining you, hm?  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Of course I will!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
But first, another change of clothes...  
  
   
**E：Mephistopheles:**   
Ah tah ta tah♪  
Let's go do this thiiing♪  
  
   
**A：Prosecutor:**   
Hm? You there, who are you!?  
Soldiers, stop them!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Annnd switch!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Y-yeowch!? That's hot!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
What the hell was that!?  
That man... Don't tell me he's...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
The Devil!?  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
Settle down! Settle down!  
Soldiers, kill that jester!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Nobody's killing meee!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ah...  
You...!?  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
Khh...! Never mind that!  
Just light the cursed fire!  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
So what if the Devil has come to save the witch!?  
Kill them both and be done with it!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Please, stop this.  
Don't...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, but I can't leave you to burn!  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I mean it!  
This is wrong...!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I...I'm supposed to...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That doesn't matter!  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master...!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...You wished for it, didn't you, Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Huh...?  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
You said it, you said it, you said it!  
We heard you, we heard you, we heard you!  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
You did all hear that, didn't you everyone?  
[♂ He /♀️ She} said it plain as day, didn't [♂ he /♀️ she}?  
  
   
**Prosecutor:**   
Fujimaru said [♂ he /♀️ she} was going to save Jeanne d'Arc! And what's more...she herself asked to be saved!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That's right, Jeanne d'Arc has wished to be saved!  
Now, Jeanne. Darkness has awoken within you!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That's enough of the jester act!  
It's time to show who I really am.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
What the...!?  
You're...!  
  
   
**C：Mephistopheles (?):**  
My, my, oh my, my, my. What can the humble prosecutor Mephistopheles do for you?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
What the? Another one of me? You know, I could swear something like this happened before.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...This must be the next part of that dream...  
And that must mean you're here.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Figured it out, did you? Well, I guess it was getting kind of obvious by this point.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
A version of me dressed in black...! But I thought you disappeared after the Holy Grail was collected!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...It did. Since I was the Holy Grail,  
I was fated to disappear once it was collected.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But it turns out that the Holy Grail was nothing more than my source of magical energy. I exist because that's what Gilles wished for.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Even after the Grail was recovered and that time period repaired, his wish remained.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Nor did the wish itself ever disappear.  
In which case, why wouldn't I still exist?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That said, I'd lost almost all of my power. If I'd been left to my own devices, I would have disappeared...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But then...you stopped me, Jeanne.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You acknowledged my existence without even realizing the truth.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You discovered your own dark side...one that was never meant to exist in the first place.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...I...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's right. You didn't accept me.  
You said I couldn't possibly exist.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...And you were right.  
But I still had something to say about it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
   
I exist!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Whatever the circumstances of my creation,  
I was still created!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...But even though I could advocate for my own existence, there was only so much else I could do.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Namely, create a small world, summon Mephistopheles, and poke whatever darkness you had inside.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Sure, my last two attempts might have ended in failure.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But this stake...that was immutable.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
This was the place where Jeanne d'Arc's dreams came to an end.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Even if Jeanne herself had given up and decided to offer herself to the Lord...introducing a third party changes things considerably.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Especially one who wishes for nothing more than to save her, and is willing to act on that wish.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In other words...  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now do you get it? That's right!  
I'm talking about you, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You've gone and proven that Jeanne d'Arc did have a secret desire to escape her fate!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
In her very last moments, she saw hope in you.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And so she wanted to be saved!  
She wished for it! Desperately!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But she thought that wish was wrong,  
was evidence of her own dark side!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Once she decided to abandon what was right and cling to her own life, that was the moment I took root inside her!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
My, my, you don't say.  
Is that true, other me?  
  
   
**C：Mephistopheles (?):**  
Oh yes, quite true. Hmm, it's rather difficult to tell us apart, isn't it? Let me give myself another name.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
I'll be Mephistopheles with “(Enemy)” after my name.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Jeanne d'Arc's other half summoned me here.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Of course, just about everyone wants to stay alive,  
and there's really nothing wrong with that.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But for her and me...that wasn't true.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Right, Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ghh...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne!  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I was careless... I never expected to be forced to acknowledge her like this...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you okay!?  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes.  
But, it looks like...I really did end up acknowledging her.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But we can talk later.  
Right now, we need to stall her!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
This is it, Mephistopheles!  
The final showdown!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Indeed, indeed. Everyone, I would just like you to know that I'm truly sorry about this. ...Release!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Khh...!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
My, my. What shall we do now, Master?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I really must say that I think retreat remains an eminently viable option.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Good point. I suppose I am in your debt.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
If you want to wake up now, that's fine with me.  
Do that, and I'll let you go.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It'll be just like you never had a Ruler at all.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That'll take care of everything.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But...if you're planning on defeating me,  
not that you could...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Well, at that point you saving my life won't matter. You'll get no mercy from me.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
I'd get out of here if I were you.  
Go on, other me, persuade them!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Good point.  
All right, here's my attempt at persuasion.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Master, I'd get out of here if I were you.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
That shock alone has already transferred over half of Jeanne's power to her Alter.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Even if I joined you two,  
we'd all be hopelessly outmatched!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You do remember what your obligations are as the Master destined to save humanity, don't you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I remember.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...Then what's your answer?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm going to save her!  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I had a feeling you were going to say that!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm going to fight, and I'm going to win!  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I knew it!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Oh, my, what happened, other me?  
That wasn't very persuasive at all.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Of course not!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
If you think this is enough to stop [♂ him /♀️ her},  
you don't know Chaldea's Master at all!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Wooo! That. Was. Awesooome!  
I just wanted to say that, naturally!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whatever you say.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gah! My eyes!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Both:**   
?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master, are you sure about this?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm at less than half my full power right now.  
We may both be Rulers, but she has the upper hand.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'd bet the two Mephistopheles are evenly matched, too. There's no way we can win.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even knowing all that, are you sure you still want to fight?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've both seen worse, right?  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You didn't run.  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No, I didn't.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That way of thinking isn't going to get you very far.  
But, then again, that might be why I was summoned in the first place.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even if I am just a ghost who only happened to exist at one point...I think I can still help you.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
So we're going to fight after all, are we?  
What a shame.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Indeed. I'm a pacifist, I'll have you know!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
But, I guess that's okay!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
After all, I'm Mephistopheles.  
I make fun of saints and demons alike!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
You know it!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Okay, ghostly boys and girls, I hope you like playing with fire, 'cause the Dragon Witch is about to roast you alive!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Everything else aside, having two of him around is extremely confusing!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Couldn't agree more!  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Ugh, that clown is a real pain.  
Well, at least I can fight jester with jester.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now, what are we going to do about these scattered memories of yours?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Specifically, this group of ordinary,  
decent folk whipped into a mob frenzy!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Look at the anger on their faces, just like monsters! Hmm... I think I'll go ahead and turn them into REAL monsters.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Well, Jeanne d'Arc?  
Think you can defeat me now!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I don't know if I can defeat you,  
but my pennant is telling me I have to try.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's go, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Lord forgives all sin and wickedness. He rescues the lives that crawl forth from the grave, grieves for them, and takes mercy upon them...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
My, my, how impressive! It looks like ghosts just aren't enough to put up a decent fight anymore!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
In that case, how about this?  
Come on up, anonymous Servants!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Shadow Servants!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
What, them? Those are just a few shadows that happened to be hanging around.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
They're not even self-aware.  
Trust me, we have nothing to worry about!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Got you...!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
My, my, so you did!  
Well, Master? What's the plan now?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Don't tell me you're worried I might lose?  
You know they call me the Dragon Witch!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I wield disaster as a weapon. I was made to sow despair wherever I so much as breathe.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh no. Don't tell me...!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Wooo! That's amazing! I haven't felt my eyes almost pop out of their sockets like that in a long time!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Faf...nir...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's right! Fafnir, my adorable personal dragon. And this time...he's going to rid me of the righteous Holy Maiden once and for all.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Even so, I am not going to lose!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It doesn't matter who you call to come fight on your behalf! We'll beat them all!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What, because of God's blessing?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
In part. The Lord is always by my side...always helping, even if only a little.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But the other part is, of course,  
thanks to my friends and my Master.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
They console me when I'm powerless to do something,  
and pick me up when I slump in defeat.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's all the salvation I need.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I may not have been saved in history,  
but I know their desire to help me is genuine.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I see you're as much of a teacher's pet as ever.  
God, you piss me off.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Fine, then. Let's settle this once and for all. We'll see who wins: me and my dragon, or you and your Master.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Let's have a nice pleasant duel to the death, Jeanne d'Arc!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Just what I had in mind.  
Come at me, Fafnir, Mephistopheles.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Come at me...my other self who fell from grace.  
The Alter I once so vehemently rejected!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Wonderful. Then this will truly be the final showdown!  
At last, her long and winding journey will come to an end!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll back you both up with all I've got!

**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
No...way...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Welp, looks like we lost...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
But then again, I suppose there was only so far I could go as a jester. What a shame. Maybe we should invite someone more fun to join our little party.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Then again, maybe the Counter Force went easy on us, pitting me against you?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Not at all. If anything, I think it was a dreadfully cold-blooded decision. This Lord guy seems like a real sadist, if you ask me.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
After all, if I hadn't been here,  
that woman you're with would never admit defeat.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
The fact that you and I are equally matched means that she has only herself to blame if she loses.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Ohhh.  
Nooow I see!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
Well, there you have it, Master.  
I'm so terribly sorry.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles (Enemy):**  
It may not have looked like it, but I really was doing my best out there, you know?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How...?  
It shouldn't have been possible for me to lose!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You lost your power!  
I was the one who took it!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I didn't defeat you alone.  
We did it together.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes, I did end up creating you.  
But I didn't regret that at all.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Instead...I was happy. Happy to know I was actually the sort of person who wanted to live on more than anything.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Happy to know I was the sort of ordinary person who felt joy at seeing others come to her rescue.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
So I was genuinely happy to see that Master didn't think twice about saving me.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I didn't fight as a Holy Maiden. I fought you as just another Servant, and I won. That's all there is to it.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That isn't about faith,  
however weak or strong it might be.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...What a disgrace.  
Guess this is really it for me.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Nothing I did worked out, right to the end...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I don't know if I'd say that. I did acknowledge you as the darkness that exists inside me.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
You're another side of my Heroic Spirit. You could end up getting registered as an Anti-Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Who knows? Maybe there will come a time when your power will be exactly what is necessary to save the day.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Is that supposed to be a joke? I'd rather disappear forever than get dragged into something like that.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But if I have no choice,  
I hope I can at least change my class first.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm not cut out to be a Ruler.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...And that brings my story to a close.  
Master...thank you for everything. Sincerely.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know, thinking back on it now...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I kind of get the impression this was all my fault...  
  
  
---  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, it may well be.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But isn't that how it is with friends and allies?  
I know I've made plenty of trouble for you.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Besides...it's like I said earlier.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
This made me really happy.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I was so happy I got to see you running in to save me.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
No other reward could possibly compare to that.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That goes for you too, Mephistopheles.  
I was so happy that you came to save me.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Reeeally? I'm not used to this sort of thing,  
so I'm not quite sure how to respond to that.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
But, as long as you enjoyed yourself, that's all that matters. Even better if it made you smile!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Ahh, it really is fun being a Servant.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This little adventure truly was like a dream come true, so to speak! Well, see you later!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Haha, whatever you might be, devil or otherwise...there's nothing more beautiful, or more fun, than joining forces and fighting together.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
All right, Master, what do you say we awaken from this dream?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Your journey to protect humanity is still far from over, after all...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...And so ends one of the stories of Jeanne d'Arc.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Jeanne would go on to experience many things, and eventually, an Avenger of her would be born as well...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But that...is a story for another time.
