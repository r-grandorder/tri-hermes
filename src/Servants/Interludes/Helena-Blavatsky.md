# Helena Blavatsky  
  
## The World that She Sees  
  
**Paracelsus:**   
From time to time...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
From time to time, I wonder: do I fully comprehend the macrocosm of the three principles?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
My theory that the universe corresponds to the anatomy of the human body...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Am I correct in this? If not, then my entire operating paradigm has been incorrect all this time.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Yep. You're right.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Although, such a thing can only be considered to be the world's truth.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
As one who would know the Swirl of the Root, my idiotic agony must sound so trivial right now.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Yes. I'm sure that is true.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm not sure myself, but I sense Mahatma from your words.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
That's why I'm rooting for you.  
Good luck, Paracelsus!  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Thank you very much, Helena Blavatsky.  
You're brilliant.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You know the phrase “protection of the Buddha”?  
That's why I'm here...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm sure you're under such protection too. Probably. In fact, I'd say it's thanks to this protection that Chaldea still exists!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Even in the face of the Incineration of Humanity, we survived!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's why the Buddha is amazing.  
My master was especially amazing.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Not only am I able to borrow their palm heel, but they see and know everything. Beyond amazing, really.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The compassionate and merciful Kannon is also beyond amazing. I've never seen anyone with more to offer.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Yesterday, today, and even tomorrow...  
The protection of the Buddha is forever!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But you know, Wukong and Bajie didn't quite get it.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Oh really?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Right after their vows, they went straight for some meat! In an instant! In a heartbeat!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Wukong would say things like, “May the protection of the Buddha reach even my stomach!” That's not right! No!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Uh-huh. I see.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
In many sects of Buddhism, the clergy is forbidden from eating meat, right?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But then these disciples break such precepts immediately. Beyond annoying.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
On the other hand, I see that you are faithful to the Enlightened One's teachings, and I sense a high Mahatma from you. Good luck!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hee hee. You think so?  
Okay. Let us both devote our lives to our faiths!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mahatma...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What does that mean?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Hello, Senpai.  
I've been watching as you puzzled over this, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I honestly don't know what she means when she says that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do know that Mahatma was supposedly an existence of some kind that Helena mentioned often in her life.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A spiritual existence of high order. They apparently imparted wisdom and truth through documents.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And priestess figures who received such documents supposedly included Helena herself.  
  
   
**C：Mash:**   
...Details about Mahatma and their true form are a mystery. There is no mention about them in Chaldea's database, at least.  
  
   
**C：Mash:**   
Helena doesn't offer much in the way of detail on the subject, either.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's a Mahatma...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
...Hm? You called?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh. Hello, Helena.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
How do you do, Mash, Fujimaru?  
Do you two want to know about Mahatma?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Though you know... Hm... What shall I do?  
I could have you read my book about it. But, hmmm...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
“The Secret Doctrine” is a book of mysteries that covers ancient and modern science and theology.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That voice...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Hey. Who's there?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
It's an important book, and serves as the foundation of modern occultism, but it's not the sort of work we mages should use.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
...Sorry for the intrusion. I just heard a familiar title and couldn't help but respond.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
So you've read my book!  
Does that mean you feel Mahatma too?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Of course I've read it. I see.  
So you're THE Helena Blavatsky.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
I had hoped to meet and speak to you.  
Miss, would you spare me some time?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Of course!  
I get it! You're a fan of mine!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Birds of a feather?)  
   
**Mash:**   
(You're right, Senpai.  
It seems like they are getting along!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Incoming magecraft lecture.)  
   
**Mash:**   
(Perhaps.  
I'm not sure if I can keep up...)  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
What intrigues me is that much what you've said seems to contradict the teachings of Theosophy as a field.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Theosophy as a field involves study and exploration. Its pursuit of the truth of the world and gods is similar to what we mages do...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
But it is still just an academic field.  
It's not that Theosophy is similar to mages...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
But rather that mages are simply academics.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Yet...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Yet, you practice magecraft.  
Even while you speak of Mahatma and the Hierarchy...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
You cast a variety of spells, using the archaic magecraft foundation that Theosophy claims does not exist.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Eh? Y-you're right.  
I do not feel Mahatma from that as much.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's changed her usual line...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(Yes, this is a bit different for her...)  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
...What exactly do your beliefs cover?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Don't you think that the Theosophy that you speak of is making a mockery of the actual modern Theosophy?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Unless...instead of Theosophy, it's your own talents you are mocking...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
U-unnnngh.  
When you say it that way...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It's true that I was the one who spread Theosophy to the modern world, but in broader terms, it was like a new kind of Platonism or Gnosticism...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It included many things from the past, and in this case, it included Paracelsus's books too...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I guess you can say it's my philosophy. But... But...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The teachings really expanded during Adyarism or Yeats's time...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...In other words...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
   
AFTER I DIED!  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
M-my apologies.  
I did not intend to anger you.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You dummy! Why you... Why you...!  
Lord El-Melloi II's a stupidhead!!!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Stop tormenting me like the SPR!!! Waaaahh!!!  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
N-no, I had no intention to...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai! The usually kind and mature Helena...is throwing a childlike tantrum!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I've never seen her so angry before!  
   
**Mash:**   
You may be right. Helena is normally the one to calm Edison and Tesla down...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I like this side of her!  
   
**Mash:**   
   
Senpai!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hm, what's going on, teacher?  
Did you make a woman angry?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I never knew teacher was such a lady-killer.  
Yeah... I'm curious about how you'll handle this.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
No, I...  
Hm? What's that dark shadow behind you?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Oh this? It caught me back there.  
I thought I got away, but it looks like it followed me here.  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
   
IS...KANDAR!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, it's getting rowdy around here!  
   
**Mash:**   
It is, and now I sense danger!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have a bad feeling about this!  
   
**Mash:**   
Me too!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
... (Gasp!?)  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Wh-what is the meaning of this!? I can't believe you got so many people on your side! Explain yourself, Lord El-Melloi II!!!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Well then, that means I'll have to...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Um, no, please don't misunderstand, Lady Blavatsky. Please wait. That giant Servant is not on my side...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Thanks for calling me a lady. But too late.  
I've started up the Simulator.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Come at me, Lord El-Melloi II!  
You too, Alex and Mister Darius III!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You're all going to get a taste of the power of Mahatma! Brace yourselves!!!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Fujimaru and Mash!  
You're on my side! Got it!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Y-yes, ma'am!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Shoulda seen this coming...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
LET'S. GO!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Lemuria slumbers in the seas! The Hierarchy graces the skies! And...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And I! In the name of Mahatma... I'm going to let off steam!  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Wait, wait! Let off steam!?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Simulation battle, completed!  
For the time being, Helena wins...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it seemed pretty clear that El-Melloi II was attempting to throw the match...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm tired...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I am too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
W-well, all's well that ends well!  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes you're right.  
I like your thinking, Senpai...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
(Sigh) ...I'm no good.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I vowed to be nice, but sometimes I can't help but explode like that.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Especially when I think of the time when the SPR called me a fraud.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm sorry I gave in to my emotions, Mister.  
I'm embarrassed to face Mahatma.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
No, I...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hey, did you just say Mahatma, the great teacher?  
Do you know Mahatma?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Eh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
???  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
...Wait. Are you telling us that you know what Mahatma is?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Well, yeah?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, I'm not sure if that's true...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(Y-yes, Senpai... Even though Alexander talks like he's familiar with it...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Do you really believe Alexander knows what Mahatma is, when even El-Melloi II isn't sure himself?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Although, Alexander did learn from Aristotle in Mieza...so it may be possible?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Or perhaps, like Helena, he had a gifted mage nearby...)  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Seriously!? You know!?  
Of Mahatma!?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Yep. I do.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Oh my! That's amazing!  
Well I...do sense strong Mahatma!!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
(...Is it over?)  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
(Hm. It would appear to be.)  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
(Yes, indeed it is over. She's laughing.  
It appears our dear Helena is in a good mood now.)  
  
   
**Edison:**   
(Whew...even I thought the worst this time around.)  
  
   
**Edison:**   
(I was worried that fancy suit here triggered her by bringing up the times she was called a fraud, but it seems my fears were unfounded.)  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
(Yes. I thought the dimwit here complained about Helena's moving lab again. Evidently I was mistaken.)  
  
   
**Edison:**   
What did you say!?  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Say that again, fool!  
  
   
**Lion & Gentleman:**   
(Oops...shhh...)  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
You are right.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It is not unusual for each mage to have their own unique usage of odd words and phrases.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
For example, I use terms like “prima materia,” “transmutation product,” and “quinta essentia.”  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In the world of alchemy, especially during my time, these words were not unique...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...but not all mages use them. Come to think of it, I believe the first founders of the Clock Tower likely used different terms.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That's why this is probably the same for her.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
First off, there is no doubting her genius. Such people are generally misunderstood by the common masses.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
The Mahatma that she speaks of...and what that means...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In order to truly understand, one would need to be on the same level as her.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Oh, and by the way, Master...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Apropos of nothing, I just happened to prepare an elixir...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It temporarily strengthens the limbic system, the cerebral nerves, and even magical circuits.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Would you like a sip?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No thank you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope! (Nope!)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
...You right there. Yes, you.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Theosophy, was it? If that magecraft is what its name suggests, it must be a study of godly wisdom.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
It must be something that didn't originate in the Age of Gods, so I don't expect anything grandiose...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
But I don't mind it, Helena Blavatsky. I have a certain interest in those who strive to reach the gods.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Yes. Thank you, Medea.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
My magecraft was given to me by Hekate.  
Calling them similar is probably off the mark.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
But I do believe it's closer than that of modern mages.  
I sense yours is not obsessed with reaching the Root.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Um...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Y-yes. Yep. You're probably right.  
I do feel Mahatma from&mdash;  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
No, I'm sorry. Let me be honest with you, Medea.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
...?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The Mahatma and Hierarchy that I have been sensing until today...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I am not sure whether they are the same beings as the gods of the Age of Gods.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I personally believe that true Mahatmas are the supernatural beings who have reached the Swirl of the Root, or at least have come in contact with the Root.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Whether it would be appropriate to call them gods is something that I honestly cannot determine.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Hmm... I'm not experienced enough to recognize Mahatma and Divine Spirits properly.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But... But... There's one thing I know for sure.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Hekate. The Goddess Hekate...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Possessing Authority over the earth, the sea, and the sky, who offered many blessings to those who prayed to her...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I think she is one of the most distinguished deities in Greek mythology!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Seriously. From the bottom of heart.  
I sense tons of Mahatma!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Heh. You make me blush.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
For you to honestly admit your own inexperience and foolishness is proof of your growth.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Helena Blavatsky.  
Let me grant you the gift of words.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
The wisdom of the gods... A small shard just for you.
