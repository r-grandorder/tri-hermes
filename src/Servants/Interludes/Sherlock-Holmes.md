# Sherlock Holmes  
  
## Thinking of the Lost Time  
  
**Holmes:**   
Good day, everyone.  
  
**Holmes:**   
My name is Sherlock Holmes. I am the world's greatest detective, as well as its only consulting one.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I am both the progenitor of all detectives, and the essence of the very concept&ndash;one who reveals truth.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Today, I am here to guide you all towards a new mystery, and the facts that lie at its core.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I originally became involved with Chaldea when I began investigating the Incineration of Humanity incident in 2018, when I played a part in the Fourth and Sixth Singularities.  
  
**Holmes:**   
However, once Goetia, the King of Demon Gods, was defeated, and his plan to incinerate humanity foiled, the world was faced with a new crisis.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I speak, of course, of the bleaching of humanity&ndash;an event that has resulted in the entire earth being wiped clean save for the Lostbelts.  
  
**Holmes:**   
As you all surely know, this incident led to my gaining an official administrative advisor position at Chaldea.  
  
**Holmes:**   
And I must say, it suits me rather nicely.  
  
**Holmes:**   
While I continue to act as a detective, naturally, I've also found the work of supporting a larger organization to be quite stimulating.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Unfortunately, I'm afraid there  
is little room for optimism...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...given the sheer scale of this case.  
  
**Holmes:**   
My current theory is that in a sense, this bleached Earth phenomenon pairs directly with the Incineration of Humanity.  
  
**Holmes:**   
When Goetia incinerated all of human history, he did so by starting in 2018 and going back in time to collect the necessary energy.  
  
**Holmes:**   
That is to say, the infamous king never bothered to collect energy from the future, because he knew there would be no human history from which to collect.  
  
**Holmes:**   
So using 2018 as a single turning point, he headed back towards the past and succeeded at destroying humanity.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Conversely, this great reset has left the past untouched, destroying humanity now, robbing it of its future.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Given these facts, one could argue that the King of Demon Gods' plan was intended to avoid this very future...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...as it involved incinerating humanity and remaking Earth before it was wiped clean.  
  
**Holmes:**   
It is a dreadful problem and a horrific mystery. Even Goetia believed it beyond his ability to resolve.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Bad as things are, we cannot afford to stop seeking a solution. Not if we are to regain humanity, and everything else that was lost.  
  
**Holmes:**   
We cannot&ndash;will not give up.  
No matter what manner of hell may await us...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...we must continue onward. We must.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I, in turn, will naturally continue to provide my full support.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I WILL solve this case, even if I must consume every last bit of energy in my Spirit Core to do so.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Why, you ask? Why else?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Because...I am the greatest detective.I am Sherlock Holmes.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...Okay, Mr. Holmes, I've finished changing the security levels on all the Lostbelt records.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
What would you like to do about the library's request for hard copies of them?  
  
**Holmes:**   
That's quite all right. I'm happy to authorize it.  
  
**Holmes:**   
All parties involved with those incidents already have the clearance to view those records freely, so it shouldn't pose a problem.  
  
**Holmes:**   
More so given that these hard copies will be for Novum Chaldea's own underground library. There is not a single person here who isn't part of Chaldea, and therefore involved in some way.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I'll be sure to let the director know about this.  
Thank you, Mr. Jekyll, that'll be all.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
You're welcome.  
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I'll be cooped up in the central computer room for  
a while to assist Ms. Da Vinci and Sir Babbage...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...but if you need my help with anything,  
I can be here at a moment's notice.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Much obliged.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are those two friends or something?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They seem like they've known each other for a long time.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know what you mean, Senpai!  
  
**Mash:**   
They seem very comfortable working together,  
if not outright close with each other.  
  
**Mash:**   
It really is like they're old friends!  
  
**Mash:**   
Then again, maybe it's no surprise considering when the books based on parts of their lives came out.  
  
**Mash:**   
“The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” was written in the late nineteenth century, and while Sherlock Holmes novels continued to be published well into the twentieth century...  
  
**Mash:**   
...the first ones also came out around the end of the nineteenth! Not to mention they're both set in London!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Huh?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Ah, now I see. I thought I had told you two this,  
but I guess I never got around to it.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
That's right. I knew Mr. Holmes back when I was alive. He was always very kind to me.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
We've only had time for brief hellos here and there since we both came to Chaldea...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...but now that I finally know how to use a computer,  
I thought I would help him out when I can.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you knew each other when you were both alive, huh? That explains it!  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahaha.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait. In your...past life, Holmes?  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahaha.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come to think of it, you never did give me a straightanswer about whether you really existed or not...  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Are you certain? That particular topic can get rather thorny quite quickly, to be honest...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed, I'm always willing to obfuscate when necessary.  
  
**Holmes:**   
While the irony of me saying this as a short-lived Heroic Spirit is not lost on me, as a general rule, one mustn't try to unravel Mystics or the past.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Of course, that's not to say Mystics are a significant part of either Mr. Jekyll's past or my own...  
  
**Holmes:**   
But regardless, one's past is one's past.  
Dig too deep, and&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Holmes?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You okay?  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Holmes?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Then again, I wouldn't want to be so coy  
that you end up distrusting me, either!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Rest assured, at this point, I have no intentions of covering up anything that is clearly a matter of public record. Yes, Jekyll and I were indeed acquaintances in our lifetimes.  
  
**Mash:**   
Th-then, does that mean...  
  
**Mash:**   
...you and Mr. Hyde once went toe-to-toe like something straight out of a fan-fiction dream match!?  
  
**Holmes:**   
I do love that you're clearly such an avid reader, Ms. Kyrielight! And indeed, it's little wonder that question would be foremost in your mind.  
  
**Holmes:**   
But, I am sorry to say, the circumstances of how we came to meet were not nearly so exciting as that. If anything...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...they were one of my most embarrassing failures.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I only wish I had never tried to avoid facing Mr. Hyde...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
It's not your fault, Mr. Holmes. It's mine.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I'm the one who agreed to organize those case records, and read some of the ones I was clearly told not to.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Not to mention I was the one who ended up entangled in the spiderweb connected to those records...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...laid by the diabolical Moriarty  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Moriarty?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What???  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I was always fascinated by evil.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
So I think when I tracked down Moriarty, the wicked spider himself, my own evil side couldn't resist facing off with him.  
  
**Mash:**   
H-hang on, Jekyll.  
  
**Mash:**   
In R. L. Stevenson's novella, Dr. Jekyll drinks an experimental serum that causes him to gain a new, evil personality, the titular Mr. Hyde.  
  
**Mash:**   
As Mr. Hyde, his very body transforms to reflect his wicked nature, and he undertakes a series of awful deeds.  
  
**Mash:**   
Dr. Jekyll is so aghast by this turn of events that he ends up killing Mr. Hyde by taking his own life.  
  
**Mash:**   
And from what I've heard, the novella is a fairly accurate depiction of the events of your life.  
  
**Mash:**   
But, based on what you just said...  
  
**Mash:**   
It sounds as though the Professor&ndash;  
or rather, James Moriarty...  
  
**Mash:**   
...was somehow involved in you becoming Mr. Hyde?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Jekyll?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could you tell us more about what happened?  
  
  
---  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I-it's not a pleasant story.  
In fact, it's really quite depressing...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
And since Moriarty wasn't directly involved,  
there's really no need to go into it...  
  
**Holmes:**   
He may not have been directly involved, no...  
  
**Holmes:**   
But what about indirectly?  
  
**Holmes:**   
In time, the ingredients required for your serum became much harder to come by, no? That was his doing.  
  
**Holmes:**   
While I didn't learn this until after the case was closed, there was a time when the Clock Tower's alchemical catalysts were&ndash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
A-ahem!  
N-never mind that now!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Since we're all here now, Mr. Holmes, this seems as good a time as any to ask you something I've been curious about!  
  
**Holmes:**   
O-oh? And what might that be?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on, Jekyll, don't change the subject now!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, I wanted to hear more about what Moriarty did!  
  
  
---  
  
**Jekyll:**   
(Master!)  
  
**Jekyll:**   
(I'm rapidly losing confidence in my ability to suppress my, um, urges...)  
  
**Jekyll:**   
(And I'm worried Hyde may put in an appearance if we keep this discussion going for too long!)  
  
**Jekyll:**   
(So please, help me change the subject!  
I'm begging you!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(...Well, in that case...)  
  
  
---  
  
**Jekyll:**   
(Thank you, Master!)  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai? Jekyll?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Yes, um, you mentioned the Clock Tower, Mr. Holmes!?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
You know, I engaged in many different fields of study back in my day. I earned doctorates in law and medicine, a spot in the Royal Society of Scientists, and eventually even uncovered some of alchemy's greatest secrets...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
But in spite of all that, I never managed to set foot inside the Clock Tower. Apparently, not even my magecraft-adjacent work with alchemy was enough to gain entrance.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
In the end, I went to my grave knowing nothing about mages, the Mage's Association, the Clock Tower, or anything else pertaining to that world.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...But the same isn't true for you, is it?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
The fact that you mentioned the Clock Tower at all  
tells me you must have known that magecraft&ndash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
&ndash;That is, incredible Mystics exist in this world, even as they're unbeknownst to almost all.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...Well, yes, I suppose I did.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
!  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, you knew the Clock Tower circa 1900!?  
  
**Holmes:**   
I knew of it, yes,  
but my knowledge was strictly secondhand.  
  
**Holmes:**   
At the time, I'd decided to keep my distance from Mystics and other things of that sort.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I believed that my domain, and the cases I investigated, were solely within the human world.  
  
**Holmes:**   
However...there were times when I unwittingly  
encroached on the world beyond.  
  
**Holmes:**   
For example, in The Adventure of the Speckled Band&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
The Adventure of the Speckled Band!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, um, do you know that one, Senpai?  
If you don't, I'd hate to ruin it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I do, so don't worry about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
Understood!  
  
**Mash:**   
The Adventure of the Speckled Band was one of the  
most popular Sherlock Holmes stories of its day.  
  
**Mash:**   
It begins when a woman from Surrey asks Holmes to  
investigate the circumstances of her twin sister's death.  
  
**Mash:**   
Her sister died in a locked room, with seemingly no way for the killer to get in or out, and the last words she spoke were “The speckled band!” In the end, it's revealed that&ndash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
The “speckled band” was actually a venomous snake.  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. The speckled band was a snake the killer had been controlling by whistling.  
  
**Mash:**   
It had an incredible plot twist at the end, and I have no doubt that Holmes fans at the time enjoyed it a lot.  
  
**Mash:**   
But, it has one big plot hole: the fact that&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
Snakes, lacking ears, cannot distinguish between whistle tones. And that's hardly the story's only oddity.  
  
**Holmes:**   
There's also the fact that the killer enticed the snake with milk, the fact that the snake's venom should not kill its victims so quickly...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Truly, there is no end of contradictions.  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
**Holmes:**   
So if the story as written couldn't be true,  
what actually happened? I'll tell you.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't, so yes, please keep the spoilers to a minimum!  
  
**Mash:**   
R-right! In that case, I'll do my  
best to skip over the details.  
  
**Mash:**   
Basically, it's a locked-room murder mystery where the victim is killed under seemingly impossible circumstances.  
  
**Mash:**   
Holmes managed to solve it brilliantly, of course, but&ndash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Scientifically speaking, the “truth” still left a number of unanswered questions.  
  
**Mash:**   
Exactly.  
  
**Mash:**   
Of course, there's nothing wrong with that for a story, but if this case really happened as depicted&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
It would mean there are still  
greater truths yet to be told.  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
**Holmes:**   
So if the story as written couldn't be true,  
what actually happened? I'll tell you.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I suppose this may inevitably get into spoiler territory, as they say, but rest assured that it will still be a far cry from the events of the novel!  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
...There is great evil at work in this case.  
  
**Holmes:**   
A man of incredible intelligence is using his unique  
talents to commit crimes. I can think of no worse scenario.  
  
**Holmes:**   
At any rate, it won't be long now, Watson.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Very soon, the instrument of our villain's wicked ambitions will come to this room very in search of more prey.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I trust you have your pistol at the ready?  
  
**Watson:**   
Wh-what do you mean!? What instrument!?  
  
**Watson:**   
And hang on: you have ME playing Dr. Watson!?  
  
**Watson:**   
G-granted, you certainly help me out a lot, Administrative Advisor, so I'm not entirely unwilling to join you in retelling one of your old escapades...  
  
**Watson:**   
And I can't say I'm not honored that you chose me for the distinguished role of your most trusted colleague&ndash;one famously played by Edward Hardwicke, no less! Very well then, so be it!  
  
**Watson:**   
...What are we about to see, Sherlock!?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Some sort of curse. There is no more fitting term.  
  
**Holmes:**   
It comes from the Clock Tower's domain&ndash;the world of magecraft. It may sound fanciful, but I assure you that its wicked power is very real!  
  
**Holmes:**   
I expect the responsible party is most likely a Clock Tower dropout or, on the other end of the spectrum, a Seal Designated mage.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...Here it comes!  
  
**Watson:**   
Aaaaaaaaah! It's heeeeeeeeere!  
  
**Holmes:**   
I must say, whoever let something like this slip out of the Clock Tower ought to be ashamed. Not that any admonishment will do us much good at the moment.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Come, Watson, let's take care of it!  
  
＄91-90-05-01-1-1  
  
**Watson:**   
I-it's over! It's finally over!  
(Huff, gasp...)  
  
**Watson:**   
Wh-what in the world was that?  
  
**Holmes:**   
The sign that this case is now closed.  
  
**Holmes:**   
An evil Dark Arts practitioner was using curses with physical forms to murder his victims...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...but now that his curse has been routed,  
it's going to come crashing down on his head.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I expect he's dying from the recoil over in the next room as we speak. As they say, violence invites violence.  
  
**Watson:**   
Really?  
  
**Watson:**   
Then, you mean when I was shooting that monster just now, I was actually shooting the dastardly villain behind this latest murder?  
  
**Watson:**   
I s-say, couldn't you have said something sooner?  
I ended up firing every last bullet I had into it...  
  
**Watson:**   
...No, that doesn't sound like something Watson would  
say. Let's see... Damn, this is harder than it looks.  
  
**Watson:**   
On a different note, I don't know how I'm ever  
going to turn this incident into a book...  
  
**Watson:**   
Not to mention that if I write about what actually  
happened, I'm liable to draw the Clock Tower's attention...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahaha.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Oh, it's quite all right, Watson.  
I'm sure you'll come up with something!  
  
＄91-90-05-01-2-0  
  
**Holmes:**   
And there you have it. In the published record of these events&ndash;Sir Conan Doyle's novel, to be precise...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...a different “truth” was substituted for the  
actual facts of the case, as one would expect.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Nor was that the only case where the Clock Tower's  
involvement, or magecraft, was skirted around.  
  
**Mash:**   
You mean there were others!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Wh-what about The Hound of the Baskervilles!? I've always thought there were some things that didn't add up!  
  
**Mash:**   
Did it actually have something to do with the black dogs that appear in British folklore!?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed, it did. Most perceptive, Ms. Kyrielight.  
  
**Holmes:**   
But, I'm afraid I can't give you full  
marks for that insight alone.  
  
**Mash:**   
!  
  
**Holmes:**   
It wasn't only the black dog, you see. As a matter of fact, the King of the Storm was also involved with&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
...On second thought, I'd best not say any more.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I expect it will be far more entertaining once I've had a word with Mr. Edison about filming it for the big screen!  
  
**Mash:**   
#### !!!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.  
D-does that mean...  
  
**Mash:**   
...there might be a brand-new Sherlock Holmes  
movie made here at Novum Chaldea!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Easy, Mash! Just take it easy!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Your eyes are literally glittering with excitement, Mash...  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Did you hear that, Senpai!? Speaking as a huge fan of both the original books and the movie adaptations, this may be the biggest news since&ndash;  
  
**D：???:**  
Goodness, it's so lively in here!  
Hehe, what's everyone talking about?  
  
**Helena:**   
Whatever it is, it certainly can't be an evil scheme  
if it's got Mash so excited. Hehe, so what's up?  
  
**Mash:**   
Helena!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Good day, Madame Blavatsky.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahaha, don't be ridiculous, my dear Yelena. You know I would never engage in any manner of scheming.  
  
**Helena:**   
Hmm, I don't know, Sigerson.  
You've definitely got a mischievous side to you.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahahaha.  
  
**Mash:**   
Sigerson! That's one of Holmes's aliases  
he used in the original stories!  
  
**Helena:**   
I see. So you're all reminiscing, huh?  
In that case...  
  
**Helena:**   
Did you hear the one about the Himalayas yet?  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Helena:**   
What about the... What did people call it again,  
Siger&ndash;Mr. Holmes? The Great Hiatus?  
  
**Mash:**   
We haven't heard the one about the Himalayas yet,  
no... But I do know about the Great Hiatus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Great Hiatus, huh...  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm glad to see you know about it too, Senpai!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You know about it, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**   
Of course!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
There's a roughly three-year period of time between May 4, 1891, the day Holmes goes over the Reichenbach Falls with Professor Moriarty...  
  
**Mash:**   
...and April 5, 1894, the day he reveals to Watson that he's still alive!  
  
**Mash:**   
The Sherlock Holmes fandom refers to  
this period as the Great Hiatus!  
  
**Mash:**   
The explanation Holmes gives for his absence  
during this period in the books...  
  
**Mash:**   
...is that he spent this time overseas  
in places like Tibet and Persia.  
  
**Mash:**   
So then, when Holmes was off in Tibet&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
Yup! After he and I both faked our deaths in  
1891&ndash;him at Reichenbach, me in London&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
We went around exploring the Himalayas together!  
  
**Helena:**   
Ugh, I can't believe this.  
  
**Helena:**   
Why would the Clock Tower youngsters be coming  
after me now? Did I do something to upset them?  
  
**Helena:**   
They've left me alone for years, saying they don't care what I do since there's no such thing as Mahatma anyway...  
  
**Helena:**   
And now, out of the blue, they start sending assassins after me?  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
I expect they became more wary of you by virtue  
of the fact that you faked your death.  
  
**Helena:**   
Wary?  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Given the “genius” Madame Blavatsky's success at bringing modern occultism into mainstream Western society...  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
...they must have thought you were about to make a move on the magecraft world now that your public persona is gone.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Or something to that effect.  
  
**Helena:**   
You think they were paying that much attention to me?  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Hmm. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that  
you lack awareness of your own importance.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
But whether you are aware of it or not, Madame Blavatsky, the fact remains that modern-day Europe is in the midst of an unprecedented occult boom.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
While it may not have reached the world of true magecraft, the group of people who believe in ghosts and supernatural phenomena is far greater than you think.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Even the criticisms leveled by the Society for Psychical Research have done nothing to turn the tide. At this point, it is a genuine social phenomenon.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Which is why the Clock Tower, and the Mage's Association, cannot afford to completely ignore it.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Remember, they were supposedly forced to add a new department at the turn of the last century thanks to Count Cagliostro's influence.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
And if that is true, you can be certain they  
are keeping a close eye on you as well!  
  
**Helena:**   
I see...  
  
**Helena:**   
If only they knew I just wanted to let Annie deal  
with that stuff so I could be free.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Ah yes, Annie Besant, Madame Blavatsky's successor to present-day theosophy.  
  
**Helena:**   
That's her.  
  
**Helena:**   
I just wanted to stop being Grandma Helena,  
the old occultist lady who founded theosophy.  
  
**Helena:**   
I didn't want to deal with the British SPR and their incessant complaining, the Theosophical Society... Even my beloved Mahatma!  
  
**Helena:**   
I just wanted to be free of everything...  
  
**Helena:**   
...and live an ordinary life as a kind,  
gentle girl&ndash;one full of hope and possibility.  
  
**Helena:**   
But I guess I never will, thanks to the Clock Tower.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
It may not be the entire Clock Tower behind this. It could simply be Policies, or perhaps one of the other departments going off on their&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
Who cares? It doesn't change my situation.  
(Sigh)  
  
**Helena:**   
I was really looking forward to coming to the Himalayas. You were too, right?  
  
**Helena:**   
I was excited about seeing secret, winged Demonic Beasts in a land where no one else has ever set foot!  
  
**Helena:**   
But instead of some Phantasmals...  
  
**Helena:**   
...all we got were assassins and the Chimeras they  
brought with them. Ugh. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Reinforcements, hmm.  
Stand back, Madam. I'll take care of them.  
  
**Helena:**   
Thanks, Mr. Sigerson! I'll back you up!  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Much obliged. Now, allow me to show  
you once again what baritsu can do.  
  
＄91-90-05-01-3-0  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You threw a Chimera!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And you did all this when you were still alive!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Helena:**   
Yup! Just picked it up, and WHOOSH!  
I have to say, it flew surprisingly well!  
  
**Mash:**   
So your baritsu was just as strong when you were  
alive as it is now... I should have known!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Remember, these were not the Phantasmals of Greek myth, but mere imitations devised by late nineteenth-century mages.  
  
**Holmes:**   
If slamming them against a wall was enough to shatter all their bones, it is safe to say they never truly posed a threat.  
  
**Holmes:**   
In my estimation, they were no more  
dangerous than, say, a wild lion.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh yeah, because those aren't dangerous at all.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And we all know how safe wild lions are.  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Haha, a fair point. I certainly don't mean  
to imply they posed no danger at all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something on your mind, Jekyll?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? Did you just smile, Jekyll?  
  
  
---  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Oh, uh, I was just...  
How can I put this?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...I guess I was just a little...relieved to hear all that.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
See, part of me thought that, now that Holmes had materialized here as a Heroic Spirit...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...all the mystery surrounding him had been cleared up, leaving him with no more secrets.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
But clearly, I was wrong!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
It turns out that even when he was alive, he was breaking curses and throwing around man-made Demonic Beasts!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
So yes, I'm happy to find that you're still just as much a mysterious gentleman as ever, Sherlock Holmes.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...Is that your way of paying me a compliment, Jekyll?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Of course.  
  
**Helena:**   
A mysterious gentleman, huh?  
  
**Helena:**   
Mystery, mystery... Speaking of mysteries, there's still one big one about you, isn't there, Sigerson?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hm?  
  
**Helena:**   
We never did find out if you were originally a Rogue  
Servant, or if somebody summoned you here. Which is it?  
  
**F：Screen-Edge Phantom Gentleman:**   
!!!  
  
**Helena:**   
For that matter, how did you show up in the Sixth Singularity all on your&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
Mmph.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Hahahahaha! Now, now, Ms. Blavatsky, I think that's quite enough for now, don't you?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
(That was close! She nearly ruined all the groundwork I've been laying!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Professor!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you think you're doing!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
P-Professor?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
The spider!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Oh, yes, I do beg your pardon.  
It's nothing, really. Nothing at all.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I know how it looks, but I simply noticed some magical energy pooling right around here and thought I'd&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
Unhand the lady at once, Professor.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Ah, yes, of course.  
My apologies, dear Madam.  
  
**Helena:**   
Don't worry about it.  
Anyway, did you handle this pool or whatever it was?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I did indeed.  
Worry no more.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...James Moriarty.  
  
**Holmes:**   
The man by which all other evil is measured.  
The once king of villainy, and Napoleon of crime.  
  
**Holmes:**   
The wicked spider who trampled all over society without so much as a pang of conscience.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Surely I need not remind you of the many lives you ruined, or of the countless people you yourself hurt or killed.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Now here you are, claiming to be secretly good on the inside even as you remain steadfastly evil and unapologetic for your past crimes...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...and the first thing you do upon setting foot in  
this room is sneak up behind Madame Blavatsky's back?  
I'd say this calls for a heaping helping of baritsu,  
doesn't it?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
My, my, I could hear those knuckles cracking all the way over here! I suppose this just goes to show why one shouldn't indulge one's evil side too often!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Indeed, I have piled my misdeeds mountainously high!  
Am I up to something even now? But of course!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Still, all that being said...let's not get ahead  
of ourselves too quickly now, O Great Detective.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I'm hardly some cackling vampire going about making off with beautiful maidens, after all.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Or did you genuinely think a few snide remarks  
would be enough to get my goat at this point?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Well, Great Detective?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Hmm. Great Detective.  
What a positively stirring turn of phrase!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
However...  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I take extreme issue with you calling yourself that, Holmes. Frankly, you've got a lot of nerve, acting like you're some sort of hero of justice!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Or is my recollection of you naming yourself the ultimate arbiter of truth mistaken?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
That you mediate facts in the name  
of preserving human history?  
  
**Holmes:**   
There is no need for humanity to know the full truth.  
Indeed, they must never know.  
  
**Holmes:**   
That is precisely why I was given this Ruler Spirit  
Origin&ndash;to be both a mediator, and an arbiter.  
  
**Holmes:**   
It is because I'm meant to mediate facts and arbitrate all things to ensure that human history will always exist.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahaha.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Hehehe.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahahahahaha!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Hehahahahahaha!  
  
**Holmes:**   
You created a noise block in the mainframe, caused a Valkyrie to go berserk, created a mechanical Elisabeth...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed, it would take me days to recount your various misdeeds committed solely since coming to Chaldea.  
  
**Holmes:**   
You're the king spider, still scheming and plotting as much as ever, yet you act as though you are some benevolent protector of Master.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Where does the truth about you lie, Moriarty?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
You wish to know where you can find it, old boy?  
  
**Helena:**   
All right, that's enough!  
  
**Helena:**   
If you two insist on fighting, you can do it  
without getting Fujimaru and me mixed up in it!  
  
**Helena:**   
Besides, just look at poor Jekyll.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
M-me...?  
D-d-d-don't worry, I'm f-f-fine... Hahaha...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I'm fine...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, no, you're definitely NOT fine!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then what was Hyde doing there just now!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Y-you're right, Senpai!  
I thought I just saw Hyde there for a split second!  
  
**Helena:**   
Okay, break it up! No more arguing!  
  
**Helena:**   
If you just can't help yourselves, then let's take  
it outside the Command Room and into the simulator!  
  
**Helena:**   
Would you do the honors, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Go for it, Mash!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good idea! Let's let them get it out of their systems in the simulator.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
R-right!  
  
**Mash:**   
Arranging simulator settings now!  
Um, let's see, how should I split up the teams...?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Why, Team Detective vs. Evil Army, of course!  
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Hyde!?  
  
**Hyde:**   
The hell you just say to me, gramps!?  
All right, fine by me! I'mma kill you ALL dead!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now Jekyll&ndash;I mean, Hyde is here!  
And he looks like he's very, um, motivated to fight!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Good grief. It would seem Moriarty has left us  
with little choice but to clean up this mess!  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like Holmes is raring to go too, Senpai!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's get this combat simulation started!  
  
  
---  
  
＄91-90-05-01-3-1  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Nooo! You got meee!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
...Oh, drat.  
Now my favorite coat's all smudged.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Very well then, I think I'll be on my merry way.  
Today's baritsu really did a number on my poor back!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Oh, yes. That'll do, Hyde!  
  
**Hyde:**   
Huh!? The hell you talking about!?  
I can keep this up all&ndash;  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I said, that'll do.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
...!?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
D-did I...turn into Hyde again?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Now, as they say nowadays... Sayonara, suckers!  
Hahahahaha!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Good grief.  
Seems he threw subtlety out the window today...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
All that aside, this vision of London permeated by Demonic Fog certainly does bring back memories.  
  
**Mash:**   
The Fourth Singularity is where you accepted  
that request from Babbage, right, Holmes?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Yes, it is.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Unfortunately, I still have yet to fully complete it, much to my chagrin.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Though the first murder of humanity was prevented when Goetia and his mass incineration plot were defeated...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...it was not long afterwards that a second plot to murder all of humanity began, in the form of the bleaching of Earth.  
  
**Holmes:**   
This is easily the largest murder case in all of history. As such, I must do everything I can to solve it, starting with finding out why the Foreign God did it...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Yes, the Foreign God&ndash;a mystery of truly unprecedented scale, and a being we still know nothing about despite having conquered numerous Lostbelts.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I have no doubt I was given this Ruler Spirit Origin in order to unravel this mystery, and yet...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
At any rate, as a detective,  
I am obligated to determine what true evil is.  
  
**Holmes:**   
And given that I no longer have a human life to take care of, I am more detective now than I ever was in life.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed, it may be no exaggeration to say that  
I am the very essence of a detective.  
  
**Holmes:**   
...Come to think of it...  
  
**Holmes:**   
I've never told you why I became a detective,  
or what drives me to pursue cases.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I have no doubt that Ms. Kyrielight is already  
intimately familiar with my backstory.  
  
**Holmes:**   
She has clearly read Sir Conan Doyle's novels thoroughly, as well as seen a number of their film adaptations.  
  
**Holmes:**   
But what about you, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course I know it.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Well thank you. I'm pleased to hear that. In that case, I hope you'll indulge me in a quick refresher.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'd like to hear it from you.  
  
**Holmes:**   
As you wish.  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Why did I become a detective?  
There is one word that sums up my reasons nicely:  
  
**Holmes:**   
Justice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Justice.  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Yes, justice.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Believe it or not, I fight for justice&ndash;  
that is, what is good and right. Surprised?  
  
**Holmes:**   
While some famous detectives from modern stories seem concerned solely with solving mysteries for their own sake...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...I am not one of them.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Well, I do have a fair bit of aptitude for making deductions as well, as you can most likely tell from the nature of my Noble Phantasm...  
  
**Holmes:**   
But even so, I remain the one and only Sherlock Holmes.  
  
**Holmes:**   
And it is precisely because humanity is currently facing a true existential crisis that I must never completely forget where good and evil lie.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Murder is murder.  
It cannot be overlooked, no matter what its scope.  
  
**Holmes:**   
So I will not turn a blind eye to one taking place before  
my eyes, whether there is but one victim, or seven billion of them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So we're really dealing with the murder of all of Proper Human History...  
  
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. We must not let it succeed, no matter the cost.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...What about the Lostbelts? What do you think of them?  
  
**Holmes:**   
What do I think of them? I think they're serial killings involving entire worlds.  
  
**Holmes:**   
And what's worse, the culprit has ensured that their blood is on our hands.  
  
**Holmes:**   
We are no longer merely fighting for our very existence.  
  
**Holmes:**   
In order for our world to survive, we have been forced to commit unspeakable atrocities. All the more reason that the one responsible must be held accountable.  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...I refuse to let this stand.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I WILL see that the evil trampling over innocent people, sneering at the very idea of good and righteousness...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...and attempting to further their desires regardless of whom they hurt...is brought to justice.  
  
**Holmes:**   
For whose sake, you ask?  
Nobody in particular.  
  
**Holmes:**   
No, I pursue these cases purely in the name of justice.  
  
**Holmes:**   
At heart, that is who I am&ndash;  
Sherlock Holmes, protagonist of great adventures.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean, the protagonist of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels?  
  
  
---  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahaha.  
  
**Holmes:**   
True, I suppose I may have no right to call myself a protagonist any longer, now that I've shown you a wealth of evidence proving I once genuinely existed.  
  
**Holmes:**   
But, be that as it may,  
I am still the one and only Sherlock Holmes.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I am a detective, the revealer of truth, and the world's first consulting private investigator.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I am also one of the first “great detectives” that became the archetype for many detective stories to follow...  
  
**Holmes:**   
...which brings its own set of responsibilities.  
  
**Holmes:**   
And...I have my pride as well.  
  
**Helena:**   
...You never did answer my question.  
  
**Helena:**   
You really put on a show of it, too, with all that talk about solving cases in the name of justice!  
  
**Helena:**   
But you're still hiding some pretty big secrets,  
aren't you, Sigerson?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Good grief. I suppose it was a fool's errand to hope you would forget about that, Madame Blavatsky.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Nonetheless, I meant every word I said. I only attempt to solve cases in furtherance of justice in the world.  
  
**Holmes:**   
However, you are still correct.  
I do indeed have secrets.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Furthermore, there is still a great mystery regarding me personally that I have yet to solve.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Who summoned me in the first&ndash;  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Holmes:**   
............  
  
**Helena:**   
Sigerson?  
  
**Holmes:**   
...I know.  
  
**Holmes:**   
This is the most pressing question I face in this  
materialization. I'll need to find an answer eventually.  
  
**Helena:**   
Even if it means turning evil?  
  
**Helena:**   
Are you saying you're willing to resort to evil means in pursuit of supposedly just ends?  
  
**Holmes:**   
...  
  
**Helena:**   
Let me just make sure of one thing.  
Would Fujimaru consider this to be evil, too?  
  
**Holmes:**   
...No, [♂ he /♀️ she] would not.  
  
**Holmes:**   
If nothing else, Yelena, I can assure you of that.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I am resolutely on humanity's side,  
and that very much includes Fujimaru.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Think of it this way: I am a detective&ndash;one who has always fought for what is right, and will continue to do so.  
  
**Helena:**   
Are you sure?  
  
**Holmes:**   
I am, Madam. But if that is not sufficient  
for you...I will make you a promise as well.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Everything I have told you is the truth.  
I swear it.  
  
**Helena:**   
Hehe. And what exactly are you going to swear on? God?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Yes, well...  
  
**Holmes:**   
I swear it on the sight I saw back in  
that hidden cave in the Himalayas...  
  
**Narration:**   
On the proud, final moments of your fulfilled life.  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
...Oho.  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
(So even throwing him to the ground wasn't  
enough to release his grip on the knife.)  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
(The last of the Clock Tower's assassins is proving quite formidable.)  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
(But stabbing Yelena in the moment I stepped away from her is as far as you go!)  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
(I'm going to rob you of every  
last possibility you hold...)  
  
**Holmes:**   
  
(...so that you can never ever harm her again.)  
  
**N：Helena:**   
No...don't...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Coughing up blood with every word,  
her purple eyes pleaded with me not to kill him.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
I nod, and strike a vital point to knock the assassin unconscious, robbing him only of his current possibilities.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Yelena...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Why did this happen? How did it happen?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
A woman of your abilities should have been able to make short work of a lone assassin the moment he stepped into the cave...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
No. No, I won't dwell on what could have been.  
This was her choice, and she made it.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Earlier, she told me this...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
“Please don't kill them, Mr. Sigerson.  
I want to send them all back home alive, if we can.”  
  
**Narration:**   
  
“You know, I'm much older than I look.  
Old enough to be a grandmother.”  
  
**Narration:**   
  
“So, though I don't have any of my own, I don't think it's right for me to take the lives of people young enough to be my own children and grandchildren.”  
  
**Narration:**   
  
“After all, I'm already dead.”  
  
**Narration:**   
  
But Madam, you didn't truly die.  
That was a hoax, remember?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
To which she replied,  
  
**Narration:**   
  
“I know. But the moment I cut myself off from  
the world, I may as well have died for real.”  
  
**F：Helena:**   
Thank...you...  
  
**F：Helena:**   
Mr. Sigerson...  
No... Sherlock...  
  
**F：Helena:**   
It's...an amazing...coincidence...that we ran into...  
each other here... Then again...maybe it was...inevitable?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
I couldn't make sense of what she was saying...  
but I knew this feeling.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
As I held her in my arms, I could feel everything radiating out from her body.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Her life force was leaving her. After all she'd accomplished, she was going to die here.  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
Yelena.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
I took her trembling hand in my own, holding it tight.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
...And there, I saw it.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Perhaps it was the manifestation of some Mystic  
that secretly dwells deep in the Himalayas.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Or perhaps it was a fleet of silver ships able to cross the sea of stars, envoys of a great transcendent teacher that descended to Earth to be with their favorite disciple in her final moments.  
  
**F：Helena:**   
Are you...seeing this...Sherlock?  
  
**A：Sigerson:**   
I am.  
  
**Helena:**   
That light...it's so...bright...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Or, perhaps...  
  
**Narration:**   
  
...it was the glitter of the last faint tears running  
down her cheeks...  
  
**Helena:**   
...Sigerson?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Oh, yes?  
  
**Holmes:**   
What is it, Yelena?  
  
**Helena:**   
You tell me. Why'd you go all quiet?  
  
**Helena:**   
Also, I'm still waiting for a proper answer.  
What are you going to swear on?  
  
**Helena:**   
And don't mumble this time.  
I can't understand you when you mumble.  
  
**Holmes:**   
I swear on...  
  
**Holmes:**   
On second thought, that's not the sort of  
thing one should ever repeat. Hahahahaha.  
  
**Helena:**   
Huh?  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahahahahaha.  
  
**Helena:**   
???  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!!!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahaha, stop that.  
Hahahaha, that smarts.  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh, it's nice to see Fou warming  
up to you for a change. Hehehe.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hahahahahaha...
