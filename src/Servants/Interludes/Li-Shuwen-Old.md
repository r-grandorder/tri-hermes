# Li Shuwen - Old  
  
## Perseverance Will Prevail  
  
**Narration:**   
It is inherently difficult for humans to prevail against evil. The notion that they could defeat a god is similarly dubious.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But when a human is summoned as a Servant, such lamentations should no longer be given voice.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In China, there are two expressions that convey this idea well: “Shéng jù mù duàn,” and “Shuǐ dī shí chuān.”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Roughly translated, they mean “Little strokes fell great oaks” and “Dripping water penetrates stone.”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Therein lies the essence of human progress.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Interesting. So that is how the older and wiser Lord Shuwen sees things.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
You are quite a change of pace from your Lancer counterpart.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Did he do something to upset you? ...Aha, I see.  
You challenged my younger self to a duel.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
I did try to control myself, but I am afraid my excitement got the better of me while I was training.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
It seems I still have a long way to go.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I suppose it would be uncouth of me to apologize for instigating it then.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
That said, Houzouin...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Surely a man with your spirit and virtue could have resisted the temptation.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Is that not what being a Servant entails?  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
I am afraid it is not as easy as you might think.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Although I lived to the age of sixty, and still retain memories&ndash;or rather, records of that time, I do not have any of the more temperate sensibilities I gained with age.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
I have no fondness for fighting to the death,  
but I do get a bit hotheaded from time to time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll say! You guys came dangerously close to killing each other, you know!  
   
**Inshun:**   
Haha, I am sorry about that, Master. I knew I should stop, but I simply couldn't help myself.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm just glad I stopped you guys in time. It wasn't easy...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Knowing what I was like in my youth, I'm sure this younger me must have caused a lot of trouble for you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Inshun:**   
Come to think of it,  
Lord Shuwen, have you not met your younger self yet?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
No, I haven't. If I did, there's no doubt in my mind that we would end up killing each other.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I'm sure my younger self knows that as well as I do. That's why we've made it a point to never be in the same place.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Why would you end up killing each other?  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Is it because he would not want to see what he is like when he is older?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hardly. If anything, it's the other way around.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I've devoted my life to perfecting my martial arts. If I'd come across an older version of me when I was young, I'd want to fight him too.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I'm sure he sees me as either the culmination or the conclusion of everything he's worked towards.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
And as a young man, he would have no reason not to see how he measures up to that as he is now.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Indeed. I could not agree more.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
After all, it would be impossible for anyone besides a Servant to truly fight against oneself.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
And if that other self is a more mature version...  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
...the urge to resist seeing whether your current self is stronger than your future self would be irresistible.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Yes, precisely.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But you're not going to fight each other?  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I will if you ask us to,  
Master...but I know you never would.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Very true. It would be one thing if you were on opposing sides, but in any other circumstance...  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Nonetheless, I would also be very interested to learn which of you is stronger!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Isn't it obvious? It would be my Lancer self.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, which of you IS stronger?  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
My younger, Lancer self would say he is.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
And I would agree with him.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...That said...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...I would still win.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
And as long as I know that for certain, I personally have no desire to fight my younger self.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...But, if you'd still like us to fight even knowing that, Master, I'd be happy to oblige.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
...Oho. Now I see.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? I don't understand.  
  
  
---  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I mean that strength alone is not the sole factor in deciding the victor.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
For me, it is not the pinnacle of strength that I seek.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...It may sound like I'm just an old wolf that's lost his fangs, but this is a domain the Lancer can never reach. Kaka!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Though of course, if he has,  
that's all well and good too.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
It would just mean my victory is even more assured.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
???  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm still totally lost...  
  
  
---  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Heh...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Don't you worry about it, [♂ son /♀️ sport}.  
As a Master, you have your own path to focus on.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hmm. But if that alone doesn't convince you, there's an old story I know that might change your mind.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...A long, long time ago...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...there was a man with fearsome good looks and two viciously powerful fists.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The man desired strength above all else,  
and fought anyone who would accept his challenge.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The man won each and every fight, as if that were the only natural outcome.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Whether it was through innate talent, or countless hours of diligent training...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...the man kept winning so much that he came to be regarded as an invincible legend...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...even as he left a trail of corpses in his wake.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Not even stray dogs liked him. And why would they?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The intense bloodlust he gave off frightened all living creatures who encountered him.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Although the man had a teacher,  
and peers he once studied alongside...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...he always preferred solitude.  
  
   
**Man:**   
The way I'm going, I'll surely end up dead in a gutter.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man figured this is what fate had in store for him, and accepted it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The life of violence he led could only ever result in his own destruction.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
One day, he would fall.  
But that day would not be today...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Narration:**   
...Another day, another pile of corpses.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Tch...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
That said, the man did not always finish his battles unharmed.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Bruised, bloodied, a ferocious crimson tiger... Even the moon seemed to try to avoid shining its light upon him.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Naturally, there was no one around who would ever try to talk to hi&ndash;  
  
   
**Child:**   
   
Hey, what're you doing?  
  
   
**Man:**   
Hm?  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Child:**   
Hey, what're you doing?  
  
   
**Man:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Child:**   
Yikes, so many dead bodies.  
Did you kill them, mister?  
  
   
**Man:**   
I would be lying if I said I didn't.  
  
   
**Man:**   
I've resolved to kill no more than one person per day in duels, but this was nothing so honorable as that.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Gotcha. Are you gonna kill me too?  
  
   
**Man:**   
Of course not.  
You're hardly worth raising my fists over.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Aww, you're no fun.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man frowned.  
He had no intention of preaching about morality...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
...but he still felt that was not something a child should say.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Go away. This is no sight for children.  
  
   
**Child:**   
What's the big deal? Besides, they killed my brother.  
  
   
**Man:**   
...I see. So they were bandits.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Uh-huh.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Then you should be satisfied now. Go home.  
  
   
**Child:**   
But, there's still more of them.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
According to the child...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
...these bandits had built a hideout nearby,  
and struck out from there, raiding nearby villages.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
And since this area was too remote for the authorities to help, there was nothing the villagers could do.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
He also told the man how his brother was killed for daring to fight back...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
...keeping his voice calm and measured all the while.  
  
   
**Man:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man had no interest in fighting injustice.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
But he knew that if he did nothing, the child would soon end up following in his brother's footsteps.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
He could see the determination in the child's eyes, could see that he was willing to fight the bandits no matter what.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man had no obligation to help the child,  
and no quarrel with the bandits.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Still...  
  
   
**Man:**   
...Do you mean to go kill them yourself?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man then noticed the child was holding a small dagger close to his chest.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Yeah, that's right. I've gotta avenge my brother.  
  
   
**Man:**   
You won't survive.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Fine by me.  
  
   
**Man:**   
...You're too young to decide the manner of your death.  
  
   
**Child:**   
But if I don't do it, who will!?  
  
   
**Child:**   
Somebody's gotta make them pay!  
  
   
**Man:**   
Somebody, hm. So you don't care who that someone may be.  
  
   
**Man:**   
If a perfect stranger can go in your place&ndash;if it is not necessary that they be desirous of revenge&ndash;then there is no reason that someone cannot be me.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Give me that dagger.  
I'll bury it in their hearts myself.  
  
   
**Child:**   
...!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man continued, falteringly.  
  
   
**Man:**   
The truth is that I have no reason to seek vengeance myself. That's why I go around searching for opportunities.  
  
   
**Man:**   
It makes no difference to me if these bandits end up rich, or if a kid ends up throwing his life away.  
  
   
**Man:**   
But, as luck would have it,  
our fates have intertwined today.  
  
   
**Man:**   
I will honor that entangling and serve as a weapon in your stead. I'll be your spear, your fists.  
  
   
**Man:**   
If you can swear to yourself that your anger and hatred are justified...  
  
   
**Man:**   
...then I will use these fists of mine to crush those bandits.  
  
   
**Child:**   
...You mean it?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Crouching down, the man looked the child straight in the eye.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The child then handed the man his dagger,  
tears spilling down his face.  
  
   
**Child:**   
Please...avenge my brother.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Very well. Your life is now in my hands.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
As the man walked towards the bandits' hideout,  
he let his fighting spirit grow hotter and hotter.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Not even a starving tiger would dare attack him now.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
His bloodlust and delight in battle surged to their boiling points, and he made no effort to hide either.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Even the sleeping birds were startled awake by his murderous aura.  
  
   
**C：Bandit:**   
Hah? Why're the birds makin' so much noise this late at night?  
  
   
**Man:**   
Hmm. Which of you will be the first to die?  
It makes no difference to me.  
  
   
**D：Bandit:**   
Huh? Who the hell do you think you&ndash;  
  
   
**C：Bandit:**   
A-aaaaaah!  
  
   
**Man:**   
There is nothing to discuss. No need for words.  
Bring all your comrades here. Quickly.  
  
   
**C：Bandit:**   
S-somebody help! Hurry!  
  
   
**E：Bandit:**   
What's goin' on? The village hire some martial artist or something?  
  
   
**C：Bandit:**   
What're you so afraid of? He's just one man!  
  
   
**Man:**   
Now, now, go easy on him.  
He did well, at least for a bandit.  
  
   
**Man:**   
I'm glad you're all here now. It would be much more trouble to track you all down myself.  
  
   
**Man:**   
I've counted all of you. If the number of corpses fails to match that count when this is over, I'll know how many of you turned tail and ran.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man's words stoked the bandits' murderous rage further.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
But it was too late. The man knew that if they truly meant to kill him...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
...they should have attacked before surrounding him.  
  
   
**Man:**   
None of you will leave here alive. Now fight me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man smiled like a wolf baring its fangs.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**G：Bandit:**   
He's...a monster...!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The bandits' lifeless bodies were strewn across the ground, just as the man's own body was now bruised and battered.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
But that made little difference to either his feet or his fists.  
  
   
**Bandit Leader:**   
A-aaaaaah! Please! Spare me!  
  
   
**Bandit Leader:**   
I promise I'll do anything you want!  
I'll never kill again as long as I live!  
  
   
**Man:**   
Too bad you didn't have your change of heart sooner. This is payback for all the villagers you and your men killed.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Blood stained the blade a vivid red. The man continued on his spree, mercilessly felling bandits left and right.  
  
   
**Man:**   
...Guess I should go give the dagger back.  
  
   
**Man:**   
But I'd better wash the blood off somewhere first...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
The man made his way down the gloomy mountain,  
back to the boy's village.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But...  
  
   
**Man:**   
What the...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There was no one there to be found. Not even a sign that anyone had lived there recently.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It was clear to see that the area had been abandoned for years.  
  
   
**Man:**   
...I see. I knew retribution should be carried out swiftly...  
  
   
**Man:**   
...but I never considered that I'd missed the chance entirely. I truly am useless.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
   
Taking the dagger out from his shirt pocket,  
he found it had already half-crumbled to dust.  
  
   
**Man:**   
...I wonder whose vengeance I carried out.  
  
   
**Man:**   
Whoever you are, I bet you would have liked to do it yourself.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...And so, the man left the deserted village behind, with only the wind howling in his wake.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Strong as I was back then,  
I still couldn't make a difference.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
It doesn't matter how strong you are,  
you still can't change the past.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Hmm. Still, it sounds like there was nothing you could have done about that. Sometimes, people just die for no reason.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
In fact, neither life nor death carries any special meaning.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Those villagers do deserve to be mourned,  
but to try to save all of them...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Kaka. I am well aware.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I am far from the Buddha. I've never thought to even try to save all lives in this world.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
That said...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
There are things I can teach, and lessons I can convey.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
What I lacked back then was the composure to realize that.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I am neither a hero, nor a villain.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
So I thought, at the very least, I should leave what I've learned behind for others to study.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Even I have something I want to protect. These fists can be quite useful at getting to the crux of certain matters.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
...Still, Lord Shuwen, what you describe is nothing less than a break with your past self.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Is there nothing about that you regret?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Regret? Of course.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Seeing myself grow weaker by the day...  
Seeing my fists grow dull and ineffective...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
It would be stranger if I had no regrets at all.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
But, all those regrets are gone, now that I'm here.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
...Aha, I see. You make an excellent point!  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Late though it may be for me, perhaps that is what I should strive for too.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
All right, I think that's enough idle talk for now.  
Shall we get going, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds good!  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Very well.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Indeed! I'm glad we had this talk.  
  
   
**Inshun:**   
Now I am more eager to wield my spear than ever!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you're all set then?  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Of course. These fists are yours to command as you see fit.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Narration:**   
...His body grows weaker by the day,  
and with it, his fists grow duller.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
One can easily imagine his younger self mocking him,  
saying something like...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
“What were you doing with your life up till now, old man?”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But the old man would just laugh it off.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
He knows now that his fists are no longer a weapon he wields solely for his own sake...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...but one that cuts a path forward for those who follow behind...
