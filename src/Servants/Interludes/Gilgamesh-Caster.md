# Gilgamesh - Caster  
  
## The King's Day Off  
  
**Mash:**   
So we have taken you through almost all of Chaldea... What do you think, King Gilgamesh?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Honestly, I'm dumbfounded. Saying this is the group that will save humanity is a bold, bold claim.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Staff morale is at its absolute limit.  
Is this meant to be some sort of endurance contest?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Uruk was in better shape after being attacked by Gugalanna than this place is now.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Ah well, I suppose I will retract that. Forget it.  
I cannot imagine you wanting to be compared to THAT.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
While I appreciate the wise king's thoughtful criticisms, please understand that we receive no outside help.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We've operated for an entire year with only Chaldea's own stockpile of supplies. I hope you'll take that into consideration. Besides...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...the difficult battles have almost come to an end. This next one is our last. We just have to keep going a little bit longer.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
That might be fine with you, but know that life goes on even after the King of Mages is defeated.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is the duty of the commander, who is responsible for the lives of so many others, to always be thinking of the future.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
If you cannot do that, then turn command over to that Heroic Spirit over there.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, are you talking about me?  
Oh, King Gilgamesh, how do you do?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm not really one of his defenders, but the acting director is doing a great job.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Chaldea could easily have been utterly destroyed when it lost its director.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But Romani was the one who helped everyone back to their feet. Had I been at the helm, well...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I may have gotten more impressive results, but we would likely have lost more people doing so.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Buuut, I do understand what Gilgamesh is getting at. Romani works too much.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Take some time to rest before our last mission. All jokes aside, the way you're going, you'll end up killing yourself from overwork.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That would be a grave situation indeed!  
If the Doctor collapses on us now...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctors can't medically examine themselves...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, I guess there's that bit about practicing what you preach. Don't worry. I don't work THAT much.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I rest whenever I get tired,  
and my staff backs me up. Don't worry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And we can't ask Ereshkigal for a favor...  
   
**Mash:**   
No. Since we're in Chaldea, even if his soul leaves his body, we can't ask Ereshkigal to send it back...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Overwork, huh? I think I just felt a chill.  
Not that such a concept has any meaning to me...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Ah, but I suppose there's always a chance...  
Best to be careful. You too, Romani.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It'll be fine. I don't intend on collapsing anytime soon.  
I'll pace myself.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know, if I'm being honest, King Gilgamesh taking a personal interest in my health is a little bit unnerving, really.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Does that mean...he considers me to be worthy?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool. The number of humans I consider to be worthy must always remain very small.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
All I am saying is that you are Chaldea's Achilles' heel. Keep that in mind.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And if you cannot do something even that simple, then I have nothing else to say. I'll send you to the underworld myself.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
H-hey! He's unleashing his Noble Phantasm right here in the Command Room! Even when you get more mature, you're still alarmingly childish!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now, now. Grow up, both of you.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Why don't you rest for today, since King Gilgamesh is insisting? Fortunately, there's nothing that needs your attention right now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...(Sigh) I suppose. Well then, I suppose I'll rest after I check for Magi☆Mari updates...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's part of the problem!  
Skip the distractions part!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, yes. Fine, fine.  
I'll go turn in for the night.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...That man's unbelievable. He cannot even manage something as simple as going to sleep.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fine. I have an understanding of how Chaldea works, and now I shall rest. Don't bother me, mongrel.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
King Gilgamesh has gone back to his room.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You did a good job showing him around today, Senpai. Will you also take a rest?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dealing with him has me exhausted.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
That's understandable.  
He may not look like it, but he can be quite the handful.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He had so many questions... “What's that?” “How do you use that?” And on and on... Well, they weren't actually questions, but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was almost more like a test, right? It's his way of seeing how much Fujimaru knows Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. That's exactly what I thought he was trying to do.  
I think he was actually enjoying himself, though.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No wonder I'm tired. I'm gonna take a nap...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. I will wake you up for dinner.  
Good night, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I'm sorry for interrupting your rest, but something terrible has happened!  
The Doctor... The Doctor...!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He didn't collapse, did he?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He didn't die from exhaustion, did he?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
No. One of the staff members went to the Doctor's room to give him something to look over...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but since he didn't answer, and the door was open, they went into his room. He's nowhere to be found!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor is not anywhere in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You're late! How long were you planning on snoozing!? Well, I did just awaken, myself...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shouldn't you be resting?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You're four thousand years too young to be worrying about my welfare! Besides, any time spent not fighting the King of Mages is time spent resting to me!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You just worry about the matter at hand. Leave worrying about the future to those with Clairvoyance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you.  
So, King Gilgamesh...where is the Doctor!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Alright. Let me give you a quick briefing.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
First, seven staff members mysteriously fell unconscious. The condition doesn't seem to be life-threatening, but we also can't seem to wake them.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And...Romani has disappeared from Chaldea. We even tried looking in the tea room behind the storage room.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...What's that?  
I was not shown this room. Well, no matter.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Are there any other clues, Da Vinci?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Apparently somebody Rayshifted to Fuyuki in 2004.  
So, to Singularity F.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Oh? That place somehow sounds familiar.  
Fuyuki... Fuyuki... It's similar to Uruk. No...that's not it.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And? Is that all you know?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Those who collapsed were analysts.  
That's all we know.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If we piece together what we know so far, it looks like Romani somehow rendered these staff members unconscious...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...and then Rayshifted... At least,  
that's what the facts seem to point to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Dr. Roman had the aptitude to Rayshift?  
We've never really verified&ndash;no, but even if he did...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor is not the type of person to do something like this. Are there any other possibilities, Da Vinci?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You say that, but the only other possible culprit would be me...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But I'm here, and there's no reason for me to Rayshift to Singularity F in the first place.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Strange things happen in Chaldea all the time. We need to respond swiftly even to the worst of scenarios.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
At times like this, I wish Holmes was here...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
At times like this, I bet Holmes is elsewhere...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What's this about some detective?  
Have you forgotten that I'm here!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I can solve something so trivial as this in a heartbeat.  
You hear me? A heartbeat!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
However, even I can't see into the past.  
We'll need to be more proactive.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
We must go to the scene of the crime ourselves,  
Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes! I will make the preparations immediately!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
No, Mash. Not you. You're staying behind.  
A Rayshift requires an operator, yes?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The usual operators are unconscious,  
and so we shall need a replacement.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Luckily, we still have half of the operators.  
Ask them to teach you, as their kouhai.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...It will probably be useful later.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's... But someone must protect Master during Rayshift missions!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Did I not say I was going?  
Or do you not trust in my strength?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I do!  
There's no need to worry with King Gilgamesh there!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Good response.  
It appears I will have to be careful.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now, begin the Rayshift! We're going to head to the scene of the crime, Fujimaru!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood, Boss!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Leave the Doctor to me, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift successful. I'm glad there was an instruction manual that covered emergency procedures.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It helps that we have plenty of data on Fuyuki.  
But that Romani...where did he run off to?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now then. Did he elect to do this himself, or did someone make it look like that was the case?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What do you think, Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dr. Roman wouldn't just up and disappear like this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think he chose to do this.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I see. If you are so certain, it must be true.  
...Hm?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Bloodlust that can even be felt when using Presence Concealment. How boorish. How impudent. I suppose I should expect as much in such a hellish place.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hah! Trying to take my measure with an attitude like that. Absolutely laughable.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Stand back, mongrel. I'm going to capture that thing and drag the information we need out of it.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...Commencing operation.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hmph!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It appears you've put too much energy into concealing your identity and made yourself weak in battle.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Or have you underestimated me because I'm a Caster? Fool. I may be a mage, but never forget that I am the King of Heroes!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fuhahaha, hahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Retreat.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...Hm. Escaping the instant I let down my guard with my boisterous laughter. Such insolence. A coward who refuses to show their face is not an enemy to be taken seriously, in any case.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy concealed their identity completely.  
We tried to analyze them from here, but...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I see. Mongrel, of the Servants you have summoned, can any conceal their own identities?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jack!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wonder...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Someone who can fight while remaining anonymous...Jack the Ripper would be at the top of the list.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
HOW CAN THIS BE!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What's going on!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sorry. I just realized that a handful of Servant readings have disappeared from Chaldea, too.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It took us some time to confirm since we're missing some of our staff...I usually make it a habit to check on the Spirit Origin graphs...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I ran a quick check, and Jack is indeed missing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Spirit Origin pattern still shows it's in an excited state, which means she is still summoned...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We're trying to sort out which Servants are missing.  
Hold on a moment, okay?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's hard to believe the Servants would betray us...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(...This is all really convenient...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I'm picking up a Servant nearby.  
Please proceed with caution.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...I head out of Chaldea to hide a bit as usual, and next thing I know, I'm alone in this burning city...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Oh? Why, if it isn't Master and King Gilgamesh.  
What are you two doing here?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
That is what I would ask you.  
And answer truthfully. Fail to do so and die.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Let us simply say that I wished for everyone to have an opportunity to rest.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Everyone is under orders to rest in shifts, but I wonder, can one really call it “rest” when it is made mandatory?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
To be free of their distress and rest their minds...  
I believed that to be in their best interests.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
I regret to inform you of this, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears the unconscious staff members were all in contact with Paracelsus last night.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We found little medicinal satchels that read “Safe, Cutting-edge, Forward-thinking Von Hohenheim Brand” under each of their pillows...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
At least it didn't say “Conceited.”  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Never seen a shadier Servant...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And? What exactly did you do?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
The staff members were all exhausted, so I simply gave them special medicine, is all I can say...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Please rest assured. Leaving aside the question of ingredients, the medicine is both potent and effective. Until they have had adequate rest, nothing can wake them.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...Well, as to how exhausted they were...that is beyond my knowledge.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
So if, for example, they were exhausted from three days of constant work, they will remain asleep for three days.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool! If they sleep for three straight days, they will wake up dead! What about water and nutrients!?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes, yes... Well, we will simply have to rely on their natural resilience...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fine. Before we address the main problem,  
let us deal with this fool. Understand, mongrel?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my King.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's going to regret this!  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
That should take care of matters.  
Have you learned your lesson, Hohenheim?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It...hurts...very much.  
So much so that I want to try my own medicine...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
They were homunculi that I raised myself, but were not strong enough to compensate for my rather unremarkable fighting ability.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It pains me to use them as mere pawns...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I'm leading you into a trap.  
Would you still care to accompany me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, Paracelsus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'd better stop Dr. Feelbad over there!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hold it. I understand how you feel, but calm down, mongrel. There's no need to rush in like fools.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
He's a Caster. Unlike the Assassin we encountered, he will be easy to track.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
However, we should try to discern their intent before we do anything.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Does he want to separate us from something?  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Correct.  
See, you can do it if you try.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...He doesn't want to get scolded?  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...Unbelievable... So this is the level of idiocy I should expect from today's youth...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Think, mongrel. He is trying to lure us to follow him, so what is the one thing he would not want us to do?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
His retreat is an obvious diversion. Don't you think there is somewhere else we should be searching?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...The Greater Grail!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Right. There's nothing else more valuable than that here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you think that's the key in figuring out why Jack and Paracelsus are acting strange?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
What the hell, guys? So you just came straight here? Skipped the clever diversion and everything?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Shoulda figured casting the low-energy dweeb as a decoy was a crap decision from the word go.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Anyway! Guess it's greeting time! Hiya, Master and Lord King Sparkly! Nice job getting here and stuff.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Is that...the Servant detected at the Greater Grail during the Zero incident?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
His Spirit Origin isn't registered at Chaldea.  
What is he doing here?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Were you the one who abducted Dr. Roman?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Doctor, huh?  
Nope, no doctor or scientist friends here.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
But that guy?  
Doctor Roomy...was it?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Well I've got him, obviously!  
Cuz I accepted that job!  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Anyway, you wanna go, punks?  
I better warn you, though...  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Eh? Warn you what, you ask? Well, I'm super weak!  
So don't bitch when you kill me with that first punch!  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
But y'know... If you kill me with one punch,  
you'll never find that Doctor of yours!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What!? If we just attack, we'll never get the information we want!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
That is quite the novel hostage tactic, mongrel! A Servant putting his life on the line for negotiations alone...unbelievable!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Take it eas&ndash;no, go all-out!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash will find the Doctor!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! I'm scanning the surrounding area right now!  
So please deal with this enemy, King Gilgamesh!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Oh? Is that so? Did you hear that, Avenger who even I didn't expect here? What's your next move?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Hmmm, well, I really liked the bit where you don't care if I die. Not bad.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Honestly, this was supposed to be an ambush.  
I was never super worried about living or dying.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
As long as my words held your attention, that's all that matters.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Behind you, King Gilgamesh!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You call that a warning!? That was close!  
It would've been fatal had it hit anyone but me!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I suppose I'll let it go.  
Show yourself...third Servant!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It appears I missed my opportunity. I should have moved a heartbeat earlier for a proper surprise attack.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Or was it a matter of execution?  
Was our teamwork, perhaps, not so great?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Impossible... You too, Amakusa? Please tell us...  
What did you do the Doctor, and why?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well, you see...  
Avenger, do you have something to say about this?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
You're askin' me? Wasn't it something like...Operation Eradicate Chaldea, or something?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well, that's not exactly artful, but I suppose it will do. Yes, it's exactly what he said.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It was the opportune moment...let us leave it at that.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Always vague and guarded, I see.  
Is this the second time we've met?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I suppose it was not ME, specifically, who met you,  
but our connection is engraved on my Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I really must give it to you, apocryphal saint...  
I heard you died very easily in Uruk's jungles.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It never occurred to me that you'd have the spine to rebel. Did the ways of modern man wear on you?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahahaha! You may have made some valid points, but I'll leave the particulars to your imagination.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
The one thing I can tell you is that I am and always will be myself, no matter where I am.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Hey! Now that your surprise attack failed, hurry up and get this over with. Our opponent's not the type to be convinced in conversation.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Besides, these two are used to hearing your speechifying.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Anyway, it's just one dinky Caster. Instead of wasting your energy talking, how about you just kick his ass?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fine. I'll bite, Avenger.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
This magical staff is another of my precious treasures. I'm going to give you a taste of its power!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Yeowch! That REALLY stings!  
Hurts like hell, but you didn't kill me, King of Heroes!  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Now brace for this! It's time for the Avenger's grudge...a curse that doubles the pain you caused and returns it to you!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Avesta's reversal, is it?  
How dare you... I won't let you!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Ha!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Tch! Impudent...!  
But it was a good shot!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I imagine your battle at Fuuma's side was quite the sight to behold. And yet, you were still defeated.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Perhaps you met some terrible monster?  
Was your enemy a beast beyond your imagination?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes. I can never look at a leopard again.  
That Servant defeated me utterly.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
But what about you? You have the same sort of priorities and manner of thinking as I do...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...so I understand your train of thought. And if I know what you are thinking, I can find an opening.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hmph. It appears that rationality and cool-headedness of yours went out the window in that jungle. It's all well and good to be reasonable in your analyses.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But you are not strong enough to take initiative!  
You are what they call a pushover!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I will crush you both!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
By my order, ready the arrows! Use my treasures to show them the power that protects Uruk! My resolve shall flood the earth...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes, I know. And I am going into this battle with every awareness...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hm!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Divine Judgment!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Calm yourself! He's taken his turn, so now we're on a level field. Now it is your turn!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
! (Use Gandr on Amakusa Shirou...!)  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...!  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Oof, you went THERE?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Well, Super Amakusa's Noble Phantasm is super strong... I don't wanna die to the splash damage!  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Well, my only target is Gilgamesh.  
You, on the other hand, will be spared...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
! (Use Gandr on Aŋra Mainiiu...!)  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Aw man...!  
Ouch! Even Gandr hurts!!!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
So you managed to stop his Verg Avesta... A wise decision, as I would expect from my Master.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
His curse returns attacks much stronger to its victim. Had it not been stopped, the King of Heroes surely would have fallen, but...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...what about after that? My Noble Phantasm will hit the King of Heroes before he can act.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Allow me to demonstrate. Heaven's Feel, activate.  
Bring an end to all things...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hah! I can't stop laughing! Forget about me!  
You have underestimated my treasures!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Even if I can't move, my treasures know and enact my will! Take this...Melammu Din&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, hey, HEY!  
What are you all doing out there!?!?!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh!? Doctor!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Romani just barged in...  
We actually don't know what's going on ourselves...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Where the heck were you all this time?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Where? Actually, I was wondering what's going on here...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was just taking a nap in my room...for about four hours...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I had a really great dream...but a nap shouldn't make me a missing person or anything!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's a lie! You didn't show up on the surveillance cameras in your room!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Phew. It looks like we can end our battle here now that Dr. Roman is awake.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Guess so. Saintly here is awfully quick to throw in the towel. Ain't it a shame that you were THIS close to taking him down?  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Welp, guess I better just disappear.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Ahhh...but it was my chance to kill something that resembled a human...didn't matter who it was...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...Hmph. Does Merlin think I'll be grateful? I can't believe he'd stop this at the moment I was in mortal peril!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
No matter.  
If he woke up, there's no reason for us to remain here.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
We can talk more when we get back to Chaldea.  
Mash, prepare to Rayshift us back.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Sigh) I hope you know Rayshifting isn't free...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fine. I still don't understand the situation, but prepare for their return. Da Vinci, Mash, help me out.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Please do not forget to collect Jack the Ripper and Paracelsus, too.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
And Jack in particular listened to us very well, so please take especially good care of her later.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Let me get straight to the point. This whole crisis was, in actuality, a drill. Everything happened according to my design and guidance.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I made it look like Romani left Chaldea by Rayshifting, made the staff members fall asleep...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...and arranged for three Servants to act as enemies.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay. Um, why would you do such a thing?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
After touring Chaldea with Fujimaru,  
I got the general grasp of Chaldea's vulnerability.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I have tons of things to point out,  
but the biggest issue is the humans.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
This place's operation is dependent on each individual's skills. The organization would collapse the moment someone goes out of commission.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And while everyone seems to know this, there has never been any countermeasure of contingency in place.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
A solution...well, it may be difficult to find one until humanity is restored since there is presently no way to replenish lost personnel.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
So plans must be made to prepare for even the worst case scenarios.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Consequently, I anticipated certain possible crises.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The King of Mages could attack Chaldea directly, for instance. So this was to prepare for such an eventuality as well.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(So that's why the King looked like he was enjoying himself...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jack:**   
Hey, hey Mr. King.  
What about my reward?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Just a moment longer. I have never failed to reward those who deserve it. The longer you wait, the greater your joy will be when you receive your reward.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Okay!  
Don't forget Nursery's gift too!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now then. While the scenario did not quite go as planned, you all worked hard. You were like organs in a body compensating for other, missing organs.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Seeing how this has gone, even those who have fallen asleep may wake up and drift back off from sheer ease of mind.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And what about Paracelsus's medicine...?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I would like to reiterate that this medicine simply makes people sleep until they are rested.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
A single dose should have no significant side effects.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I have prepared a stimulant, but that appears to be unnecessary. Everybody should awaken shortly.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But what you said in the Singularity was more than a little disturbing...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I was only speaking of the effects of an overdose.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
This may have only been an exercise,  
but I would never lie to Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...Well, if you don't believe me, I suppose I am to blame for that. Try not to dwell on it too much...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I selected those who had the highest probability of turning on you. I wanted to test you all to see how you would react to the situation.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But you all managed to determine the cause of the issue and successfully executed a Rayshift. Even with some hiccups on the way, you all still pass.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So that's what happened...now I see the big picture.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I understand your concern, but don't you think you went a little overboard with all this?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What would you have done if the King of Mages had actually attacked during this drill?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I planned that part as well. Had there been an actual emergency, I arranged it so that everything would return to its appropriate place.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You fell asleep and no one was able to find you because Merlin assisted me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I knew it! That no-good Caster would definitely do something like that with a big smile on his face!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
After all, the Illusion power of that swindling mage can fool humans AND electronic devices! He'd have no trouble tricking our cameras!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But Chaldea wasn't the only thing that I tested during this drill. Mongrel...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...how could you not anticipate a situation where one of your Servants betrayed you? You're unbelievably naive and soft-hearted.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But they won't betray me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll do my best so that never happens!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...I see. It seems I am the fool for once.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
There's no sense trying to convince an idiot. And I suppose that makes me an idiot today for failing to consider that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What are you talking about, King Gilgamesh?  
This is Chaldea...humanity's final stronghold.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Infighting and backstabbing...those are concerns for after humanity is restored.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whether we are human or Heroic Spirit, everyone has assembled here for the same single goal.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...I suppose that is true.  
If it wasn't, I wouldn't be here, either...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fine. Forget betrayals.  
The rest...well, we shall see...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
By the way, mongrel.  
I quite enjoyed watching your reactions to all this.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
While far from ideal, your decisions were fascinating. Reflect back on your responses here later.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sooo...it sounds like I was the one who benefitted most from this? Not only did I get ample rest, but I had the best dream...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In my dream, Magi☆Mari did...ahh, nonono.  
Better if I keep that secret.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Quit your daydreaming.  
You're making it sound like I did all this for you.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, you didn't? This was actually the first time I had a different dream from my usual one...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...Hmph. I'm going to sleep. Wake me up if something happens. No, don't bother. I'll wake up on my own.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Annnd, he left angry...  
Well, I'm sure he'll be in a good mood again soon.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That king has a lot on his mind.  
He's not one to dwell on one single thing for too long.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But anyway...I'm sorry, everyone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If I were more dependable,  
I'd have woken up earlier...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's fine. It's good that you got enough sleep for a change. And we realized how much we value you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We wouldn't know what to do without you, Doctor. You're the one who's pulled everything together and led Chaldea this far.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. We'll be together forever.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, of course.  
We've all been fighting to reclaim our future.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I know I caused you all trouble this time, but I still want to thank you. Thanks. I feel like I slept well.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure it wasn't thanks to Magi☆Mari?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uh...n-no...of course...not...  
Well, maybe just a little...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway! We need to finish up our work for the day!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's almost dinnertime. Let's get our work wrapped up, and then all go to the cafeteria together!
