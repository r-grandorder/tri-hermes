# Tawara Touta  
  
## Slaying the Great Centipede  
  
**Mash:**   
Battle complete, Master.  
Good work.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, good work. Fujimaru and Mash,  
I see you're both getting the hang of this.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
While you can't attack outright, you've gotten much better at analyzing and adapting to the situation as it unfolds.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After all, your objective in battle is to sustain as little damage as possible. Never forget that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I'm getting more confident on the defensive front.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When we were in Camelot, and I finally learned that the True Name of the Servant I fused with was Galahad...well, that has helped me so much...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The way I bear down...and instead of repelling the enemy's attack, it's like I ward them off, or even return the move...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get it. “Oaks may fall when reeds stand the storm.”  
   
**Mash:**   
That's so eloquent, and it embodies the spirit of martial arts. That should be the motto for all Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, it's not all about skill.  
Sometimes a defense must be unyielding as steel.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The long-awaited counterattack...!  
   
**Mash:**   
C-counter? Well, I hear Galahad was skilled at such things...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I... It's still hard for me to read the enemy's movements...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you're talking about a reversal technique, maybe aikido. Swordsmanship, karate...those types of martial arts all focus on responding to the enemy's moves.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Oh hey, Master. I've been looking for you.  
I wanted to let you know it's almost dinnertime!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, so you're in charge of dinner today, Touta?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Haha. Sorry to disappoint you.  
But hey, at least my cooking is simple and manly!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I'll let the others make varied and exquisite dishes. Nobody can beat me when it comes to sheer quantity!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, the rice that you cook is delicious,  
Touta. The grains come out so fluffy.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Fluffy, huh? Well, now that puts a smile on my face. You'd make a good wife, Mash.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I don't carry around a bag of rice for nothing.  
White rice is always a source of power!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
There's nobody who could best me in any dish that pairs with white rice.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
And you can always come back for more! Salted salmon, seasoned nori... Eat it with whatever!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gulp...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm...getting hungry...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, if everyone just ate Touta's rice,  
it'd be a big help with our operating budget.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Yeah, right? Oh, hey... So this is the seemalayter that I've heard so much about.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I heard it's a strange contraption,  
but how does it actually train you?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh right, you've never used it before. This device can take you anywhere around the world or to any strange land.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Since you're famous for killing all kinds of strange things, this device would probably entertain you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Legend says that you once defeated a giant centipede, Touta. I'd be very interested to see what it looked like!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Heh, cut it out. You're making me blush.  
I'm not used to so much praise, or talking about myself.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But conveniently, there's this contraption that could help us out. I'd be happy to show you what you want to know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you going to show us how you defeated the giant centipede?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I'm always in favor of eating good rice. And no meal tastes better than the one you have after facing a life-or-death experience!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Now then, Lord Peach Hair. Give us the biggest centipede you have. I'll show you a proper bug hunt!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is that what you want? The simulator is useful, but unfortunately, we don't have any data on giant centipedes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it, we've never fought a giant centipede in any of the Singularities...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
On top of that, the centipede you're talking about was big enough to have coiled seven and a half times around Mt. Mikami. Recreating something like that would take a while.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Shucks. So no giant centipede...  
Pity, since it was quite the sight.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If only we had an abundance of funds.  
If all we ate was Touta's rice...maybe one day...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's have dinner.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hm...I would love to do that, but now that we've started this conversation, I'm not in an eating mood...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm terribly sorry.  
I started all this with my impossible request.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
No, no. My own immaturity's got me riled up and now I can't calm down.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But you know what, Mash, Fujimaru. Even if we don't exactly have what we want, it's just a matter of improvisation.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I may have been blessed with many things during my lifetime, but that doesn't mean I had everything.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Rather, working around a situation like that is my forte. And, Lord Peachtree, if you don't mind a small request...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That could work.  
That shouldn't take too much resources.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Then I ask that you prepare accordingly.  
Wait right there. I'll bring in the proper actors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is turning into quite the spectacle...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder when we're going to eat...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...And so you're all inside the simulator. I'll try to use what we have to simulate the period in Japan for you...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, you know, if there's anything off, just...let it slide, please!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Thanks, Lord Roman.  
Sorry to rope you into my selfish whims.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you managed to figure out the giant centipede?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't tell me it's going to be Cú Chulainn Alter...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Heh. Don't sweat the details.  
Just sit back and watch. I hope you enjoy it.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Now then. Let me tell you the tale of the giant centipede. It was when I journeyed to the province of Shimotsuke.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
When I arrived at Seta in Oumi, I ran across some civilians who seemed to be distressed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, there are people gathered in front of a bridge.  
Did it collapse?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Nope! It was a giant snake about sixty meters long lying on the bridge.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
It wasn't doing much, really, just sitting on top of the bridge. But the civilians were all terrified and nobody was willing to try getting over or around the snake.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hiiisss!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ohhh, so THAT'S the giant snake...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But no mere snake could hinder me.  
I simply ignored the giant snake and crossed the bridge.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hup!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Did you just step on me? You told me you were only going to step over me during the rehearsal...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Uh, well, I just remembered...back then I was quite intoxicated...and so the giant snake and I...well...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So, you picked a fight with the snake.  
No one told me about that part.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Therefore, I, Kiyo...I mean, the giant cute snake atop the bridge will not tolerate such lies!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Ha! That's the spirit, Doujouji!  
You sure know how to liven up an act!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
This is act one, Fujimaru!  
Tawara Touta, heading out!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
(Pant, pant)...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
When I lost my temper, I feel I crossed a line unbecoming for a heroine...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master?  
Did you happen to witness my transformation?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I saw nothing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I totally blacked out the last few minutes. Yep.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Yeah. Even Fujimaru says so,  
so why don't you cheer up?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I apologize for messing up the plan.  
Very sorry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even Touta apologized.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go out for a meal once we're all done.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well... If you insist, my dear Anchin...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
(Gasp!) (This is my moment in the spotlight.  
It's time for Kiyohime to shine!)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
(It's time to monopolize Master's burning gaze!)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ahem... Your fighting was truly impressive.  
I'm sorry if it looked like I was testing you.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Actually, I was here on this bridge because I was waiting for a strong individual like you to come.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
(Good save.)  
Oh? And who exactly are you?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I am a dragon deity who has lived in this lake of Oumi for years.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I see. I knew you were a metamorphing being, but I didn't expect you to be a dragon deity. I'm glad I didn't kill you.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Recently, a giant centipede that lives in Mt. Mikami have been wrecking havoc on the neighboring village.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It would have been ignored had it only hunted down wild beasts, but now it has begun to prey on livestock and even on my own kind.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That giant centipede is nothing but a headache to us.  
I ask of you: Would you slay this wicked beast?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
You may call it a giant, but a centipede is still just a bug. Squashing it should be easy. I'll head over to Mt. Mikami and slay that thing in no time flat.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
At the request of the dragon deity,  
I headed to Mt. Mikami right away.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Really? Right away?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If I heard the centipede was huge beyond all imagining,  
I would take time to plan before I went...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
If one had a cool head, yes, that would have been the logical move. But for some reason, I was riled up.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hm. It must have been because the battle against the dragon deity was so intense. I'd pretty much put all of this at her feet, really!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Either way, I had also forgotten that I only had three arrows in my possession.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So you faced a great monster that overwhelmed even the dragon deity...with just three arrows!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
Something's coming toward us!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
It's here! The giant centipede of Mt. Mikami has finally made its appearance!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Crap! The Genji!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh...why are they connected like a train?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
We couldn't replicate a giant centipede, but I wanted to create something that would frighten someone to their core with just a single glance.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
And, well, those three fit the bill. So, I asked them to consent to being put in the bizarre position of forming a centipede like this.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
...Yes. We are lined up holding a jump rope, and we are running in unison. We look like a group of children at play, and so it is a bit embarrassing.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
But if Lord Tawara Touta is requesting this,  
we cannot refuse.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
I am a little conflicted about playing a demonic role...but I shall become a centipede for Master!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
And if this be entertainment for Master's enjoyment...then tonight, the three of us shall play the part the very best we can!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah, it's good for 'ol Raikou to act like a kid sometimes! Can't be a general all the time!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And so...lemme hear some NOISE for Minamoto Tribe feat. the Golden Genji Power Train! YEEEAH!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hm. I was the one who planned all this, but it's actually still a terrifying sight. We went too far.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Lord Raikou is especially...scary.  
She's not really getting the whole “play” aspect of this.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
(Don't tell me... Did she not have any friends to play with during her youth...?)  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
(No, no. I should leave that alone.  
Nothing good would come of it!)  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Okay! Now let me show you some proper monster slaying! Come on Fujimaru, let's enjoy this!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
Uh, just to clarify...we agreed that I would “win” the moment my arrow hits Lady Raikou's headpiece, correct?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Of course. That is, IF the arrow manages to get around my sword and hit the target.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hm. This may prove to be more difficult than the actual slaying of the giant centipede! Ha!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Halt! As long as I'm around, your arrows will never reach Lady Raikou!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Heh. That's some big talk. But hey, if you have that covered, I'll focus on ATTACKING! Ha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leave the frontline defense to us!  
Touta, please focus on getting Raikou off our back!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I'll just get her from here.  
Mash, hold your position!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...but...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Right there is fine...the angle and position of your shield are perfect!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Huh? Where the heck is that Tawara fella aiming at?  
He's not the one for make-or-break moves&ndash;  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh my...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Seriously? He ricocheted against Mash's shield and managed to hit Boss's headpiece!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It's one thing to do it with bullets,  
but that just ain't how arrows work!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Rather than reflecting the arrow, he actually corrected the arrow's course... What a fantastic demonstration of his superior skill, even with only a single arrow!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Well, Mash also mentioned she was getting the hang of using her shield, so I knew it would work.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
And that Round Table shield of yours is pretty impressive. To see it just deflect my strongest shot... Man, I might lose confidence in my abilities!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not true, Lord Tawara... The sensation of the arrow flying by was like a wave in the air itself!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And when it hit my shield, well, there was no doubt in my mind that you could shoot down even a god!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(But...as skilled as it is,  
how come he usually throws bales of rice?)  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Phew. So the theatrical recreation of the giant centipede battle has ended. It was an honor to have witnessed the Great Hachiman Bodhisattva move there.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Yes. An intentional miss resulting in hitting the target. This is truly what you call a bull's-eye.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Wonderful, Lord Tawara. The stories of your valor I heard in my youth were indeed true.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
It's nothing. All I did was catch everyone off guard. I would never be able to do that a second time. More importantly, my compliments to the head of the Genji. Now that it's over, I'm trembling.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Had I missed, you would have rushed in and lopped my head off in one stroke, am I right?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh my.  
Whatever do you mean, Lord Tawara?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Even if you were correct, I am sure you would have easily repelled the attack!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Uh...yeah, let's go with that, and leave it there!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
To think even my trembling would get a reenactment...  
I didn't expect something like that to happen!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Your body trembling... Was it really that terrifying?  
Even though you fought so valiantly?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Of course I was scared. Even I could be spooked by things that frightening!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
To realize after the fact that one fought a great demonic insect that would devour even the gods...there's no way one would NOT be scared.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But that was the last thing on my mind back then. After all, I was blessed by one like a heavenly maiden.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I was so focused and fired up, I could have risen to the heavens. Motivation surpassed any fear I had.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
After all, adventure and lethal battles are for the young. It was a good experience for me.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Dauntless, yet brisk... I suppose if it wasn't for that kind of characteristic, the dragon deity wouldn't have asked for your help.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Totally. Ya just gotta wait until god-devouring insects pass by on its own. Yet to get rid of it with just some dinky arrows...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But as you can see, boss Tawara ain't someone who brags, but you saw that he's a super scary monster killer if he gets serious.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
After all, that Masa...  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Ahem. Kintoki, my dear, I cannot walk.  
Perhaps it was because I hit my head.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Would you mind carrying your mother?  
I hear that the cafeteria has breakfast ready for us.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
I'm sure everyone is hungry after this battle.  
How about we all head over for a meal?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, yeah!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tons of Tawara-brand rice balls, please.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Sounds good!  
I love rice balls!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Let's have a breakfast buffet, Master! Knowing boss Tawara, he'll prepare tons of seafood dishes too!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I shall accompany you as well. Soup made from fish scraps does indeed sound appetizing.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hahaha! You guys are all too much!  
Putting in orders already!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But that's how it should be. A good meal is better than battle anytime. That's the way of the world!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Fujimaru and Mash, that's the end of my giant centipede story.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
If you're satisfied, then I'm satisfied.  
Now, let's all eat together!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Thank you for the meal, Touta!
