# Tamamo Cat  
  
## Overflowing Wildness  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Master, let's go hunting!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eek!? C-Cat!  
Don't surprise me like that!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh, sorry about that. My bad. My bad. I just can't keep my surging wild nature in check. You gotta understand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
E-Even so, it's unexpected...  
Come on, Senpai. Tell her to be more careful.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you hungry?  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Let's just say that's one of the reasons!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you want to sharpen your claws?  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Let's just say that I always want to sharpen them!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
But as expected, Master understands me the best!  
In this case, now we really gotta go on that hunt, no?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh! Nice design. That squirrel is really cute.  
Climb up on my paw if you like. Rather, get on it now.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Wahahahahahahaha! That tickles! That tickles!  
&mdash;Gotcha!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
Nnng, Gyagyaaaaaaaaau!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Wahaha! I got this cute little guy now! If you don't want me to squish him, then you'll join us Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no! Fou's been taken hostage...  
Senpai, Cat may not look it, but she's got brains!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. Cat's pretty smart sometimes.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Well, she is a "cat" after all...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I've seen this coastline before, Master.  
What sort of evil land is this?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A goddess once lived on this island.  
   
**Mash:**   
It's the island Stheno lived on.  
Don't you remember?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hmm.  
I don't remember at all.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
An evil god lived on this island.  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I knew it. I can feel it.  
I mean, this island is pretty gloomy.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
But, Senpai. Why are we really here?  
Is there something on this island?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now now, I already know what you're thinking,  
Mashy-Mash. This place is the nature's treasure vault, full of carrots.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
And here's proof of it. Look.  
There's a whole group coming out to meet us.  
  
   
**Monster:**   
Caaaaaaaaaaaat!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Are they enemies?  
Doctor, check for enemy lifeforms!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"The line you are calling cannot be reached. Since it's lunch time, any work outside of Grand Order will be declined."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
DOCTOR!  
Everybody is too relaxed this time!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Woof! We have control of the coast. On to the shore!  
I'll catch salmon in the river and animals in the forest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Cat went into the forest.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've stuck together this far.  
Let's stay together. After her, Senpai!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Get...out...!  
This river...is my...territory...!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Are you nuts? Nature belongs to everyone.  
It's just like a beef barbecue: first come, first served.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
...Hmm? Beef...? First come, first served...? Beef... Beef...beef...I'm recalling memories of Matsusaka beef...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Drool.  
Hey, are you the 5-star ranked beef?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Evil! You are...evil!  
But...Euryale is also...a little...like that!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Take your eyes off her for a second, and she gets us into trouble. Master, what should we do?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on! We have to back up Tamamo Cat!  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
The battle is over.  
That was one crazy, out-of-control fight...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Darn it all! The beef got away.  
I wanted to become friends.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I think maybe Asterios only came here to look for Euryale...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Except, Stheno was the one who lived here.  
Well, it's hard to tell them apart...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
But we've taken the river.  
It's time to hunt! I think I'll help myself to a salmon!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
You must admit, that salmon was a worthy opponent.With wet scales that sparkle like gems... I can't even!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow! One swipe! You're good at that!  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh stop it Master! You're making me blush!  
But that's because salmon hunting is what cats do best!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You only want one?  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yes. I only take what I need.  
That's the nature's code.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now it's time for the main event! Hunt the cows in the ranch! I'm taking some potatoes with me too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow! I didn't know... I wasn't expecting a plain like this when we came out of the forest...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
Watch out, Master!  
  
   
**David:**   
Sorry. But that's your first and final warning. Normally I'd give you four chances, but this time is special.  
  
   
**David:**   
You're sheep thieves, aren't you?This is the ranch that I've taken great pains to develop.  
  
   
**David:**   
Can you understand? Starting my own ranch has been my dream, my salvation for all the suffering I went through on the throne.  
  
   
**David:**   
Simply put, I will kill anyone who ruins my dream.Besides, I got a house full of wives to take care of.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a mistake. We've only come here to hunt&mdash;  
Er, I mean... Maybe it's not a mistake?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hahahahaha! This is the first time we've met.  
It's nice to meet you, King of the Sling!  
  
   
**David:**   
I don't particularly like that nickname.It makes me sound like I'm some kind of con artist.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Anyway, I'm gonna grab a carrot! But before that,  
maybe I should turn into a giant, like in the tale?  
  
   
**David:**   
No need. I'm not fighting Goliath again. You there,  
beautiful little beast. After I punish you, I'll make you my wife!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, another Servant battle!I don't think this is a hunting trip anymore!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**David:**   
Ugh, sure I don't have to pay rent here, but perhaps I shouldn't have picked this island.  
  
   
**David:**   
Oh, well. I can set up shop anywhere I like.  
Farewell, all! Just don't go overboard with the plundering!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
That David...  
He was really powerful for no reason, woof...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
No matters. The prize is in front of us!  
I will get my paws on that five-star beef!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
&mdash;Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? What?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ya rang?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Listen. If I get carried away, I want you to stop me.  
I'm a fierce fighting dog, not a seeing eye dog.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I'm only going to take one cattle.  
Alrighty then, let's go!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And, she's back.  
She brought back exactly one cattle.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yep. It was a good fight.  
Now I'm done hunting.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...umm, you only took a salmon and a cattle, right?  
When you said hunting, I thought it'd be more...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
What? Of course! These are just the ingredients.  
My ultimate goal is to make dinner for Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can cook?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
What are you talking about? I may not look it, but I'm a great cook. I'm actually a multi-purpose maid.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No way!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree with Senpai.  
I mean, you? Really? Ahahaha.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Here! I've made garlic steak,  
pumpkin terrine, roast chicken with diavolo sauce,  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
pumpkin pudding and pumpkin pie, and four kinds of canape that I whipped up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You really are a good cook...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I never lie, you know.  
How does it taste, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want you to always cook for me from now on.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Nyahaha! I'm so pleased you like it. No worries,  
it's my way of repaying you for what you do every day.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
This is getting embarrassing, so I'm going to close with that. &mdash;Now then, I think I'll have a carrot for my reward!  
  
  
## The Ring of Carnage  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Be patient, I have a long story to tell. That Tamamo-no-Mae is one horrible Servant.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now she's turned over a new leaf... I think? But when she was fully matured she was really terrible.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
When a demon fox gains a tail, its power will grow exponentially. When it becomes a nine-tailed demon fox, its power is immeasurable.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
When that happened to her, she became afraid of herself. Thinking that she would never get married like that, she ripped off her tails.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
One of those tails became me, Tamamo Cat.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Okay, here you go, Master!  
Today I've made a magnificent lobster!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks like you sauteed and simmered it...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that's an amazing American-style lobster!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Here you go.  
Puting some lemon on it makes it even more delicious.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow... So this is the essence of human civilization...  
Through cooking, we've distinguished mankind from beast.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just so you know, a cat made this. Hmm? ...Everyone,  
I am sorry to bother you when you're having fun...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you kidding me? A pointless enemy attack at a time like this? And inside the apartment even?  
  
   
**Monster Shadow:**   
Loooooooobsterrrrrrrr&mdash;!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It appears that they were attracted by the smell of the food! Since they're here for that, they're pretty tough! For some reason&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sh-Shadow Servants!?  
What's worse, they're all Berserkers?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Precisely. They're the shadows of the Servants who are always hungry!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
These guys are more powerful than what we've faced so far! Be very careful!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And save the lobster!  
I want some, too! Very badly!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
...Uh-oh. This is bad.  
Since I'm the same way, I can tell.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it, Cat?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You mean, we can't win?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
It's bad.  
The way I am now, I can't defeat these brutes.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
It's...like I was just telling you, Master.  
When we get serious, we turn pretty nasty.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I've put a seal on my Noble Phantasm until now.  
Master, will it help if I'm strong?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Will you still love me if I'm strong?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
All right, then I have no choice. It's time to get serious! No more messing around from now on!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Lobster chop!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lobster slash!  
  
   
**Shadow Servant:**   
Guh! Ghee&mdash;Aaaaaauuuuuugh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy Servants eliminated.  
Master, we successfully defended the lobster.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
You're pretty good with that lobster, Mash.  
I'm sure you'd make a pretty handy wife in the kitchen.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Wife!  
No...well...uh...I have no experience in cooking...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Cooking and fighting are very similar!  
They both smell of blood, and are both just as exciting.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
The greater the battle with the ingredients, the better it tastes. It's the same in relationships too. The one who wins gets to eat!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oohh... That's an interesting take.  
Very informative. Please tell me more, Professor Cat.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Fujimaru, are you sure you don't want to stop this? They're heading down quite a dangerous path...)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad Cat has made a friend.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad Mash has made a friend.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
But, finally my Noble Phantasm has been released...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
When our spirits become filled with gloom, we lose sight of ourselves. This is a slumberer's paradise, between dawn and dusk&mdash;  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
It's the physical manifestation of a pretty frightening tale, but I guarantee that it's easy to use. So go ahead and use it.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Master, from now on I'd like you to handle me with caution. Be strict, but sweet and sometimes gentle, all right?
