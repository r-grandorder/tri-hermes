## Class Skills

**Existence Outside the Domain: [C]**

In contrast to Foreigners gaining this skill as emissaries of Outer Gods, this still is suitably granted for one who is a man-made vessel who embarked into space as an envoy.

**Independent Navigation: [A]**

A skill equal to Independent Action. A skill originating from Voyager's main class of Voyager, where it is rank EX.

**Civilization Contact: [D]**

Another skill originating form his original class that can be called a friendly version of Civilization Erosion. It is hoped that one day, this shoddy skill will prove quite useful.

## Personal Skills

**Voyager of the Stars: [A]**

A limited version of the skill Pioneer of the Stars, this is a representation of voyages that span the stars, where any seemingly impossible journeys are made possible. A skill derived from his class as Voyager, where it is "Pioneer of the Stars", at EX rank.

**Swing-by: [A]**

A specialized combat maneuver. The target's kinetic energy is either taken away or imparted to change their speed beyond the usual limits.

**Protection of World's End (Space): [B]**

A skill normally applied to the sacred lance. Voyager has this skill because he possesses an anchor of the stars that is the embodiment of the end of the world.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Distant Cerulean Star: Pale Blue Dot
- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Planet Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0-999
- Max Targets: 1 Person

Pale Blue Dot.

A faint, tiny light Voyager barely saw when he turned around to look after travelling six billion kilometers. The thoughts of the people who sent him out into the unknown...all of their hopes and dreams for the future live in that tiny 0.12 pixel photo. And as he continues on his journey, the warm wind blows his golden sails.

Representing mankind's possibilities and hidden hopes, this strongly encourages his allies while lessening his enemies' will to fight.

# Character

## Pronouns

Pronouns: Boku (Hiragana)/ Boku (Kanji)

Second Person Pronoun: Kimi (Hiragana)

Third Person Pronoun: My friend (Hiragana)

## Personality

Gentle, and a bit untidy. While he doesn't say much and is prone to discreetly observe things, he isn't exactly the silent-type.

As befits a space probe, he is very curious, always seeking out new things and experiences. New smells and tastes excite him, and he is a sucker for delectable dishes and unique desserts.

Even when he is exploring the unknown, he can use his keen sense of direction and spatial awareness to keep from ever getting lost. He also has a great sense of hearing, and can remember anything he hears. Even though he has limited vocabulary, he is versed in various languages. He also enjoys listening to music of all kinds, and he can't help but feel drawn to live performances.

He quite likes donuts because of their resemblance to Saturn's rings.

He doesn't seem to like taking baths.

## Attitude Towards Master

While not restricted to his Master, if his heart gets through to someone, he stands by their side as a dear friend.

## Dialogue Examples

"I, ask, of you. Are, you, worthy of, being, my, Master?"

"Swinging By." "I'm really fast, y'know!" "Farther than anyone! Faster than dreams!

”Having someone special is a great. But sometimes, you can still feel lonely..."

"Look. This big blue planet. It's my most cherished memory. Because you, my friend, are there. When I think of it like that, then I am able to smile, always."

(Third Ascension Lines:)

”When my journey ends, I'll probably wanna go on another. But it will end sometime. Until then, you're my Master."

"In another world, I doubt I ever got this form...it makes me feel a little insecure..."

"Houston, do you read me?"

"I will guide them. Peoples' dreams. Peoples' wishes. Grant me your song. Your deepest feelings. They will reach the end of this unending journey. All racing towards, the sea of stars. Someday, we will reach our destination. Pale. Blue. Dot."

## Historical Character and Figure

In 1977, the unmanned probe Voyager was launched into the stars from an air base in Florida. The probe recorded many observations about the planets of the solar system, including Jupiter and Saturn, then continued its endless interstellar mission. Even now, he continues to journey through the starry sea outside the heliosphere.

## Character in FGO

Voyager is considered a young Servant for two reasons: he originates from a very recent period of history, and possesses the physical body of an eight-year-old. He is essentially a piece of exploratory equipment made of aluminum alloy that survived the Holy Grail War and ultimately gained a spiritron body equivalent to a human body in order to communicate better with his Master.

In consequence of this miracle, he lacks common sense, has a limited vocabulary, and his appearance is greatly influenced by the preference of Utsumi Erice, a Master with whom he has a close connection. Through multiple Ascensions at Chaldea, he is sure to grow into a formidable being fit to be a guardian of humanity.

## Standard Weapons

In his first Ascension, he drops stars like rain, and generates solar wind and such like something out of a fairy tale.

In his third Ascension he has lively, high-speed punches and kicks, while also performing cool stunts while driving a lunar rover.

## Related Characters

**Utsumi Erice**

Erice is the Master who originally summoned me. I even look the way I do because of her, I think. She can be a lot to handle, but since becoming her friend, we've been really happy.

**Kijyo Koyo**

She's strong, scary, and kind. Sometimes though, she looks really sad into the distance. I wonder if she had a kid a long time ago...

(Ascension 3)

**Edison**

If it wasn't for his competitive spirit, showmanship, and his reckless sense of adventure, I probably wouldn't have been born. That's essentially how journeys start.

**Chiron**

The mythological centaur!!! When I began my journey, I rode right along his back. This is sort of an assumption on my part, but...since then, I felt like he's always been watching over me.

**Jason**

The greatest "ship" in the night sky is his, of course. I'm not a "ship" in the sense that people can ride on, but my precious cargo I carry will someday reach it's destination.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I was contacted for the Requiem collab happened not long after Requiem went on sale, so I was very taken aback, but also did a little happy dance. I wanted Voyager's Ascension designs to really touch people, so I took great care in making them. His second Ascension is in the style of a certain Prince, while his third is a mix of motifs from space suits + flight jackets with Voyager being a slightly more matured traveler.
