## Class Skills

**Tool Creation: [A]**

One can create devices tinged with Magical Energy.

**Territory Creation: [B]**

One can create a “Workshop”, which is an advantageous position for themselves as a mage.

**Divine Core of the Goddess: [C]**

A Skill that expresses one being a perfected goddess. It has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and body. It mitigates almost all mental interferences, prevents the body from growth, and prevents the figure from change no matter how many calories are absorbed. It is a composite Skill that comprises the Skill Divinity.

Since Irisviel is not a Divided Spirit of a proper Divine Spirit, it results in the rank stopping at C.

## Personal Skills

**Sacrificial Resolve: [A]**

One’s feelings towards their loved ones, in which the person would not even spare themselves of committing self-sacrifice.

Applies a plus modifier towards the applicable effects of defensive/recovery Magecraft, Skills and items.

**Child of Nature: [A]**

Infants born on the wrong side of the World, whom will eventually become similar to those on that side. Even if they are not naturally occurring life, but living things manufactured by human hands, sometimes the World can give many blessings to them.

**Magic Medical Care: [A]**

Irisviel as a Servant can exercise advanced Healing Magecraft.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Song of Grail: O’ White Holy Grail, Sing
- Rank: B
- Classification: Magic Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0~50
- Maximum Number of Targets: 20 people

Connecting her love and motherhood to the Holy Grail, it temporarily answers a prayer that is sincere and pure. It is not a function as a wish-granting machine, but simply a Noble Phantasm that has Irisviel’s existence sublimated into it.

It grants a recovery effect to Irisviel herself and the people around her own position while cancelling out all bad status effects. It also cancels out all kinds of persistent damage that people are currently suffering from. If a fragment of their Spiritual Core remains as well, it is even possible to revive Servants that had reached the condition of being unable to fight.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: watashi
Second Person Pronouns: anata / ○○ (basically only to a close companion)
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ano hito

## Personality

A graceful woman. A transient Servant who is tender like a mother. Irisviel is gentle, overflowing with love and deep affections. And as a matter of fact————she is brimming with curiosity, much more than any other.

## Attitude Towards Master

Irisviel does not hold favouritism for anyone, and she comes into contact with the Master with gentleness in also the exact same way she is gentle towards anyone else. Due to some circumstances, she is a person who experienced the Holy Grail War in the past, and from that standpoint, she had assumed that some sense of distance should be kept between Master and Servant; it is possible to say that she has a tendency to maintain that distance appropriately.

## Dialogue Examples

“I’m Irisviel. My full name is Irisviel von Einzbern. It’s not the case that this is called an intention of the Holy Grail, but…”

“I shall decide on your punishment. One that’s appropriate… for your mischief.”

“Something I hate?… I’m generally commenting, but I believe a priest who uses Taijiquan[1], is expressionless, and likes unbelievably spicy things is no good of course.”

“————Start, Heaven’s Feel!”

“Please, protect the world. This world that man loved; this world that child should live in…”

## Historical Character and Figure

A sneaky person who came out of the Holy Grail. Someone who is the same as the terminal of the Holy Grail.

That is to say, by what kind of cause did this miracle happen? A terminal of the Holy Grail. An infant who returned to the Greater Holy Grail… had transformed into a Servant as its Divided Spirit. Here, Irisviel continues to protect a certain Guardian cursed by fate, being close to this person, yet far away from that same person, no matter where they are.

Unlike the nature that signifies the contaminated Holy Grail————“All the World’s Evils” – that is hidden within Fuyuki’s Holy Grail, Irisviel is strongly being endowed with the profile of the mother “Irisviel von Einzbern” as a wife. She is in no way a proper Divine Spirit, but if one were to apply her as a Divine Spirit for argument’s sake, she is probably an existence that is endowed with a disposition of an Earth Mother Goddess.

Why has Irisviel materialized? What will she do as a Holy Grail when she comes into contact with a person who has the qualifications? An answer has yet to appear for either enigma.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Since Iri is a character a lot of people know about, there was awfully a lot of pressure on me. Given that her design was where I simply put all of my own designs that I had already made for her together, I took more time drawing her than the other characters’ pictures I was responsible for. I believe the people who have Iri also knows this, but because she was used for an event distribution reward as a welfare, her outward appearance in her Ascensions is constant; however, to tell you the truth, she was initially not supposed to be distributed as a welfare, and I had even drawn the pictures of her 3 stages similarly like the regular Servants. In the future, Mr. Takeuchi accompanied me in her specification changes, and I got to draw up a rough design in which I picked the best points in each of her 3 stages, which then resulted in her present appearance. Because she is a distribution character, it appears many people have obtained her, and I am very happy for that. (Shimaudon)
