## Class Skills  
  
**Presence Concealment: [A+]**  
  
A Skill to erase one’s presence.  
  
When activated, it is almost impossible for the user to be perceived, even if they are a Servant. However, during the moment of them preparing an attack, the effect will be drastically diminished.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Curse Techniques (Shrine Maiden): [C]**  
  
Chiyome has acquired some kind of cursing techniques as a Shinano shrine maiden. Although most of her ability to use Curse Techniques has been lost at the time of her materialization as an Assassin, some power that is about equivalent to a Rank C Curse Techniques Skill has been left behind.  
  
**Curse of the Serpent: [B]**  
  
An unusual power that has been inherited from generation to generation. It is a curse by the “Great God Ibuki”, who is deeply related to the ancestor of the Kouga-Mochizuki family, and it torments the mind and body of the one who possesses the curse, but it becomes a powerful weapon as an invisible poison if it can be put under control. In each generation, one person – a human from the Kouga-Mochizuki family – will always be endowed with this power.  
  
**Kouga-ryuu: [A]**  
  
A ninjutsu system that was handed down the Kouga-Mochizuki family and regards a series of unique combat techniques as its core. A composite Skill that comprises the effects of the Ninjutsu Skill.  
  
**Ninjutsu: [A]**  
  
The general term for the espionage techniques, combat techniques, larceny techniques, torture techniques, etc., used by ninja. The version of ninjutsu used differs according to each school.  
  
Chiyome, who was born and raised as a Kouga Jounin and as the daughter of the Mochizuki family’s chief – the head of the 53 families of the Kouga, possesses an A Rank in this Skill.  
  
**Subversive Activities: [C+]**  
  
The ability to prune the opponent’s military strength in the preparation phase before conducting combat. Denotes a master of traps. However, the higher the ranking of this Skill, the lower one’s spiritual status as a Hero.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Kuchiyose – Ibuki Daimyoujin Engi (Summoning – The Origin of the Great God Ibuki)  
  
* Rank: C  
* Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
* Range: 1~30  
* Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
Through the curse associated with the legendary Kouga Saburou, who is considered to be the ancestor of the Kouga-Mochizuki family, Chiyome borrows the divine power of a fearsome Great God. Specifically, she employs in a limited fashion the Divided Spirit of the Great God Ibuki, the God of Mount Ibuki————namely, the Serpent God, Yamata no Orochi – who cursed Kouga Saburou through his clothes in the “Suwa Engi-no-Koto (Shintoushuu) (Story of the Origin of the Suwa Deity [Collection of Shrine Legends])” and the “Taikou-ji Kan’non-dou Engi (The Origin of Avalokiteśvara’s Shrine in Taikou-ji Temple)” – by means of a summoning. Magical Energy in the form of a serpent twines around the person that became the attack target, ending their life.

## Pronouns  
  
* First Person Pronouns: sessha / watashi  
* Second Person Pronouns: anata / kisama / oyakatasama [Lord] (to her Master)  
* Third Person Pronouns: ○○-dono / ○○  
  
## Personality  
  
A female ninja who performs her duties faithfully, even while tormented by the curse originating from her ancestor. Chiyome is very earnest. If her master says “Die”, she will swiftly do so on the spot. As a “Kunoichi”, she calmly conducts herself as the master’s eyes, ears, and at times, their blade, but a persona where she fears the Curse of the Serpent, trembles from it, and sheds tears due to it is hidden underneath that mask. She is calm and composed in the middle of her duties. She hardly says any jokes and the like, but… as a matter of fact, she likes merrymaking if it suists the occasion, and at times of being off work, she often changes her expressions in a fickle manner.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Chiyome is faithful. She is obedience itself. She establishes her Master as the master, and she works with her whole heart as a Ninja who obeys their commands.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“My True Name is Mochizuki Chiyome, a Kouga Jounin. My Class is Assassin.  
————I beg of you, please give me your orders, master.”  
  
“I am grateful and happy.”  
  
“This… is the Kouga-ryuu.”  
  
“I will bring down… the enemies of my Lord.”  
  
“Curse… this blood of mine. Revere… this sin of mine. Many months and years since Kouga Saburou, there is something here that cannot be shed away. Kuchiyose————Ibuki Daimyoujin Engi!”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
A woman from the closing years of the Warring States Period where she left her name in the “Renban Ken-no-Koto” at Nezu Village, Shinshu. Mochizuki Chiyome is a female ninja (kunoichi) who served the Takeda family of Kai, her origins being from the Kouga-Mochizuki family, but it is not certain whether or not she is actually a ninja.  
  
In some sense, Chiyome’s existence————contradicts the way ninja ought to be where they consider secret activities as their main purpose, and perhaps she is an ironic answer towards the notion of a “famous ninja”.  
  
◆  
  
In this work, Chiyome is an existence that possesses a fantastic power, having inherited a curse caused by a god from Kouga Saburou, the ancestor of the Kouga. While acting for the sake of her master as a Shinobi… she offers her prayers simply as the sole shrine maiden of a serpent for the sake of appeasing the ara-mitama of a god.  
  
In the “Seven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Blademasters”, Chiyome is one of the seven Heroic Spirit Blademasters summoned by a Sorcerer, and she stood in the way of the Protagonist as Assassin Paraiso. It is not certain whether or not she – who has been summoned again as a Servant of Chaldea – has the memories of Assassin Paraiso. But she has at least read the records of the events that remained as data… There is no person who can comfort her, who condemns herself for what she had done, except for her Master.  
  
## Others  
  
Warring States / Widow / Girl / Kunoichi / Shrine Maiden.  
  
Some Servants are worried that “She has too many attributes.”  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Tomoe Gozen**  
  
“She comes to greet me for some reason. I am grateful.”  
  
**Katou Danzou**  
  
“Speaking of Flying Katou, um… H-Hmmmmm…”  
  
(Speaking of Katou Danzou, Chiyome cannot forgive her because that person robbed from the Takeda family. Be that as it may, since it is a little awkward looking at Danzou, Chiyome averts her eyes away from her.)  
  
**Shuten-douji**  
  
“Uu… A-Ahhh… Ahh… She is looking… this way… B-But… I already…!”  
  
(Shuten-douji possesses the aspect of Ibuki-douji, the child of the Great God Ibuki–Yamata no Orochi. Therefore, as far as Chiyome is concerned, Shuten is a subject of awe and fear, and she instinctively freezes when seeing her.)  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
A miko, a ninja, and a widow who possesses the Curse of the Serpent. Because her attributes are piling up high just at the time of her setting, I can design her straightforwardly without worrying much. The large sword is a ceremonial sword she possesses as a miko, and the short ninja sword is what she uses in combat. In her Final Ascension picture, even in that sort of situation, I wonder if that is her mentality appearing when she is touching her ninja blade with her left hand. Furthermore, the sashes twining around her whole body are also her defensive armaments, her weapons and her tools, and it was supposed to be something that symbolizes “the curse that tightens itself over her body”, but um, um, no matter how you look at it, it is a HOT LIMIT; I am thankful.
