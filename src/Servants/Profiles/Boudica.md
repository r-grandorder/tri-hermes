## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [D]**

Boudica is able to nullify Magecraft spells that have a one-verse chant.

**Riding: [A]**

One can freely handle all vehicles and beasts except for those with a Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast ranking.

## Personal Skills

**Battle Continuation: [A]**

The ability to continue combat.

Combat is possible even while bearing injuries that place one on the verge of death, and they can remain alive so long as they do not receive a decisive fatal wound.

Boudica’s anecdote of her having continued to battle against the mighty Roman Imperial Army with an indomitable fighting spirit has been changed into this Skill.

**Oath to the Goddess: [B]**

An oath to Andraste, the Goddess of Victory in ancient Britannia. It grants a plus modifier to attacks against opponents one has determined as enemies whom they must triumph over. In Boudica’s case, the modifier comes into play only against opponents that are affiliated with Rome. It is particularly effective against Romans.

**Andraste’s Divine Protection: [A]**

A divine protection bestowed by Andraste, the Goddess of Victory. On the occasion of group battles, it grants a plus modifier to all checks made by Boudica and her comrades. Especially in battles with defensive objectives, it demonstrates its maximum effect.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Chariot of Boudica: The Chariot of Unpromised Protection
- Rank: B+
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 2~40
- Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people

A chariot. Its proper form is a chariot drawn by two fine horses. It represents Britannia, and as Britannia is a symbol of protection, it boasts high durability capabilities.

By releasing its True Name, the chariot makes its appearance and protects Boudica and her comrades. Although it has acquired a flight ability by receiving the divine protection of the Celtic gods, the offensive power of its charge is not particularly high. Its proper use is to function as a “shield” to protect comrades.

The figure of Boudica driving the chariot can even be seen in modern times as a bronze statue in London, at the Thames Path in the Westminster area.

# Sword of Boudica: The Sword of Unpromised Victory
- Rank: B
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~20
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A one-handed sword crowned with the name of “Victory”, just like Boudica herself. But for all that, it is by no means a Sacred Sword of the Planet, nor does it also mean that victory has been promised. A sword of an incomplete wish.

For its ability, it can shoot out a somewhat small Magical Energy projectile. This mass of Magical Energy is not powerful enough to the extent of being able to kill a Servant in one hit, but it is possible to fire them in rapid succession because of its low Magical Energy consumption, so the Noble Phantasm has relatively excellent usability. This ability can even be used without invoking its True Name. Whenever its True Name is released, it can unleash a barrage of multiple Magical Energy projectiles.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: atashi
Second Person Pronouns: kimi / ○○ (without honorifics)
Third Person Pronouns: aitsu / ano hito / ○○ (without honorifics)

## Personality

Cheerful, bright. Someone who will become friends with anyone and everyone (but Romans are an exception). Overflowing with motherhood, a companion who is pleased with being openly affectionate to anyone as her own child regardless of their gender. Although she is a warrior who draws on the flow of the Celts to do battle with pride, Boudica is primarily gentle. If she is urged to out of necessity, she will change into a female warrior persona. Because she is a Heroic Spirit, her bodily age is in her early years, causing even her disposition to take on more or less the nature of a young lady. She considers herself proud, knowing that her name means “Victory” in her language.

## Attitude Towards Master

Boudica comes into contact with her Master as an elder sister close to their age. Radiant. Kind. A gentle Servant who will even worry about “Am I not trying hard enough?”

The wish Boudica wants to make on the Holy Grail is “for Britannia to be peaceful.” Because Britannia was becoming a little harmonious since her lifetime – at the time when she was approaching her death – her heartfelt belief is not only for the British people to co-exist with the Celtic gods and the Fairies, but also for people and children of different races to live and laugh together in paradise, and it would be good for her if it becomes like that. (Even if she will not say it at all, she sheds large tears with pleasure, knowing that her wish is gradually being realized.)

## Dialogue Examples

“Hey, I’m Boudica, please treat me favourably. Hey, is it also ok if you can casually call me, Ms. Boudica?”

“Okay, I’m heading out, heading out~ Hey, it’s fine, don’t worry about it; I’m relatively fond of fighting anyways.”

“Hey, I’ll do anything if it’s good with me. Hey!————What do you want? Will you tell me?”

“What do you like? For me, it’s the connection between the heavens, the earth and the people. Also, it’ll be the beeest if there are some delicious MEALS!”

“Are you hungry? Alriiight, let’s make something to eaaat!”

## Historical Character and Figure

In the 1st Century, Boudica is the Young Battle Queen of Britannia. At the end of a vicious invasion where she and her daughters were disgraced by the Roman Empire, Boudica caused a rebellion with her spearheading the various kings of Britannia as she would not forgive the Romans, and although she made military gains for a while and overwhelmed the Imperial Army, in the end, she lost to Emperor Nero’s army, losing her life in the process. In future years, she became the legend of a “Queen of Victory” in Britain.

## Character in FGO

Boudica loves everything about Britannia. The wind and the earth. The flowers and the plants. The springs and clear streams. The insects and the birds and all the wild animals. And more than anything, she loves the people. She is close to her kind-hearted husband, King Prasutagus, and was blessed with a couple of daughters in her younger years. Except for when the skirmishes happen between fellow tribes, it is possible to say that Britannia is peaceful.

Boudica had even incidentally planned to get into contact with the Roman Empire – who arrived in Britannia from a land beyond the waters and built several settlements – and moreover, she had faith in them. She believed that conflict is something that can be avoided through dialogue and exchange. In fact, then Roman Emperor Claudius sought exchange more than conflict too.

But, on that day, at that time;
King Prasutagus died, and everything changed.
Succeeding Claudius, who died around the same time, was the newly enthroned Nero, and at the time when she ascended to the throne as Roman Emperor, the imperial magistrate imposed heavy taxes on Britannia, stole away their people’s plots of land one after another, and started to conscript those people as slaves. That is to say, these very actions were undoubtedly that of an invasion’s. Boudica carried out a protest furiously as the Queen of Britannia————What was waiting for her was a poor treatment that was so far as fierce. Scorn and disdain. Violence and disgrace. Pain and fresh blood. Though she received deep wounds to both her heart and body, she was still determined. For the rebellion against Rome. For the protection of her birthplace. For revenge. Thus, she became the Young Battle Queen.

Boudica brought together various kings from various places within Britannia, and she led this large army to oppose the powerful Roman army. The rebels; they received their bitter tears and suffering from the people of the abominable empire. Trampling down the three Roman settlements constructed in Britannia, they exhaustively killed the Romans without distinguishing them between soldiers and citizens. Even the women. As well as the children. Even if they were young mothers much like herself, and even if they were very young children, as long as they were Roman citizens, Boudica swung her sword without hesitation and struck them down.

The final decisive battle; it took place at Watling Street. Opposing the rebels was Roman army governor Suetonius Paulinus, who was known as a great commander. The extent of his military prowess he displayed in the distant land of Mauretania was so great, news of it resoundingly crossed over even into the land of Britannia that was separated two seas away. That capability being displayed in the suppression of Britannia’s western areas (present-day Wales) was formidable. Even with the allied forces of Britannia’s various kings that were superior to the Romans in numbers, will they really win? Boudica took on the challenge as she drove her chariot into battle. The allied forces of the various kings numbered 200,000, and the Roman Imperial Army numbered 10,000. Despite that, the difference in military strength between the two forces was expectedly overwhelming, and the rebel forces were defeated. With Suetonius’ ingenuity that did not differ from the rumours, and before the Roman soldiers’ extremely meticulous combat behaviours that were trained to a high-degree, the Army of Justice was completely defeated to the extent that it was over too soon.

Justice————

Camulonunum, Londinium, Verulamium. Trampling down the three Roman settlements, was it really the divine protection of the Goddess Andraste that gifted violence and disgrace to the Romans under the rebels’ scorn and disdain while Boudica herself was scattering pain and blood? Her daughters were exhaustively raped as much as possible. While in tears, Boudica was begging in her thin voice for mercy on her little children. That then, what was once her figure and voice, was that itself not here anymore? She thought of that while on the verge of death.

“Justice. I might have already let go of the things I truly wanted to protect.”

Boudica was deeply enshrined in the United Kingdom since the modern times, and on the occasion of materializing as a Servant, she has parted with her furious self from the time of her past battles. Boudica, as a Heroic Spirit, is her original self; that is, she surely swings her sword in battle as an affectionate woman. Britannia… when one from there thinks of their birthplace, they think of it as this mother’s power.

## Related Characters

**Roman Servants**

Boudica’s enemies.

**Nero**

An opponent Boudica is not pleased with. Honestly, she declares that Nero is her nemesis. However, if Boudica just knows how Nero is as an individual, she would be troubled in using her as an outlet of her anger. (After that battle, it is said that Nero reprimanded those generals for their actions so that they can know to the utmost of the cruel deeds they had done to Boudica and the others who were defeated in that battle.)

**Artoria and the Knights of the Round Table**

They are like Boudica’s cute younger sisters and brothers. Boudica regards that queen and those knights as the people whom protected Britannia, and she loves each and every one of them, whom all tend to be adorable cats, as her “younger sister” and “younger brother” whom succeeded in doing what she could not do. Every time they meet, one thing or another, she will bake for them and look after them. She says that she is their relative’s elder sister or their cousin’s older sister.

"Having said that, do you want to eat galette?”

**British Servants**

They are like Boudica’s distant children.

“Now, now, you came from quite a faraway place, didn’t you? Having said that, do you want to eat galette?”

## Comment from the Illustrator

It would have been good if the picture for Boudica’s Second Stage was her First Stage… I carefully drew in a way to add volume to her breasts, legs, and so on to show the impression of a motherly and tall character. Her scary facial expressions and Third Stage are very popular, so I’m very happy. Thankful~ (Aotsuki Takao)
