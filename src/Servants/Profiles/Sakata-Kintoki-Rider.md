## Class Skills  
  
**Riding: [-]**  
  
In exchange for Buddha’s providence which makes Kintoki inseparable from his cherished mount upon being summoned as a Rider he no longer has a need for this Skill.  
As a matter of fact, his Riding Skill has been sealed.  
  
**Divinity: [C]**  
  
His disposition as Raijin’s child has been emphasized upon being summoned as a Rider. At the same time, the aspect of him being the child of Yamauba has also been emphasized.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Thousand Miles Drive: [A]**  
  
Originally a Skill acquired from being together with his beloved mount.  
Bestows inexhaustible stamina to perform long distance movement for a long time.  
Also, this Skill is capable of demonstrating effects such as giving sudden surge in AGI parameter, and during full sprint, increases both STR and END parameters.  
Judging from the nature of his Noble Phantasm, this Skill will also increase its destructiveness when its True Name is released.  
  
**Innate Fitness: [A]**  
  
Born with a perfect (golden) body as a life form.  
Plus Correction is bestowed to his STR.  
  
**Animal Dialogue: [C]**  
  
Enables mutual understanding with animals that don’t possess language.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Golden Drive - Gold Drive  
- Rank: B  
- Type: Drive Noble Phantasm  
- Range: -  
- Maximum Target: -  
  
Golden Drive.  
A large motorcycle imbued with Raijin’s power.  
According to Kintoki, it is a monster machine possessing 2 million horse powers. Its maximum speed is 2500 kilometer (around Mach 2). Its name that has been given by Kintoki is “Golden Bear Mk. 1”.  
The cherished mount bound to Kintoki when he is summoned as a Rider. It possesses the ability to transform by its nature. But on this occasion, Bear Mk. 1 has been configured to perform a super charging dash during its True Name Release.  
  
(It only appears in FateGO during the usage of Yoroshiku)  
  
# Golden Drive Good Night - Yoroshiku*  
- Rank: B  
- Type: Anti-Personnel ~ Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 900  
- Maximum target: 1-50  
  
Golden Drive Good Night.  
  
---Mew’s TL--  
  
A charging dash on Golden Bear in its Super Accel Assault Mode.  
At maximum speed, it can reach hundreds of times its normal speed.  
Wreathed in lightning, Bear Mk. 1 flattens its targets. Its tires are actually Raijin's transformed drums, and their lightning grows more powerful as they rotate. In short, this attack becomes more powerful the further Golden Bear travels.  
  
"During my life, I was once plagued by dreadful nightmares when I lay down to sleep. These dreams, this... whirl of grudges by the many abominations, demons, and inhuman mysteries I slew, must have been sent by the curse of a Tsuchigumo. I was terribly weakened, and resigned to die.  
But, one night... Kintoki stood by my bedside beating Raijin's drums. He became brilliant lightning, and gently chased my nightmares away. Then, those cursed dreams, which had morphed into other-realms, were all incinerated by lightning."  
  
"Yes, thus he saved me. During my entire life, I never forgot the joy I felt that evening. Even now, I still remember it."  
"Hm? You ask what this has to do with Bear Mk. 1? Ah yes, well. The wheels of that iron horse are the very drums of Raijin which Kintoki used to save me that night."  
  
Above, a recorded conversation during Minamoto no Raikou's stay at Chaldea.  
This event is described in the Tsuchigumo illustrations of Utagawa Kuniyoshi, but their veracity is unknown.  
  
*literally, Night Wolf Death Nine

## Pronouns  
  
First person pronoun: ore, oira (basically when there’s no sense of impending danger, sometimes)/orecchi (rarely)  
Second person pronoun: anta/taishou*/ohime-san (rarely)  
Third person pronoun: aitsu  
  
*taishou = chief  
  
## Personality  
  
To uphold justice, and to crush the wicked!  
A special move to the rotten lot!  
However, that is also only when he feels like it. At times, he will disregard all the troublesome things and drives his beloved mount, becoming one with the wind---  
  
---that said, it is the world’s cruelty that things seldom go as one would hope. Only individuals whom he shares various deep histories with would close in on him. Such as, Raikou who, like a mother and a big sister, gave him unconditional love, Shuten-Douji who had once fought him to the death while being attracted to one another, Ibaraki-Douji who would bare her fangs at him every time due to her excessive feelings for Shuten.  
  
Still, it is not like Kintoki dislikes them entirely. For both Raikou and Shuten are fellows whom he had shared deep ties and feeling with. Without a doubt, they occupy a large portion of his heart. He simply can’t grasp the distance between them well when they have manifested in this world.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Meanwhile, surely Kintoki’s peace of mind lies in the Master who confronted him as an individual unrelated to his past, for whom he’s been dying to tell “For now, let’s just empty our head and go drive with this guy (Bear Mk. 1)!”  
Be sure to wear your helmet.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
- “Yo, Chief, so we meet again! Rider Kintoki has arrived at high speed! Ya wanna attack the mountain? Or ya wanna try breaking the sound barrier on the highway?”  
  
- “Rock’n roll!”  
  
- “Ain’t it obvious, boys?”  
  
- “I’m not gonna say I’ll become the wind, but let’s decide this with a drive that is even faster than the wind!”*  
  
- “Ya can tell me anything. Be it now or the past, I’ll be by your side, Chief.”  
  
*Interestingly enough, his Skill usage dialogue is “Leave it to me. I’ll become the wind.”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Sakata Kintoki. A member of Raikou’s Shitennou.  
He is the exact same person as the Kintoki who is summoned as a Berserker.  
It has often been confirmed that in cases where a Heroic Sprit is summoned into another Class there would occur a change not limited to their abilities, but also to their disposition, personality, Saint Graph, and so on. However…for Kintoki’s case, the extent of his close resemblance to his Berseker counterpart has resulted to a joke going around perpetuated among Chaldea staff: “He probably just changed his hairstyle and outfit.”  
  
In reality, this has become a summoning in which his disposition as Raijin’s child is emphasized.  
At the same time, because the aspect of him being the child of Yamauba is also emphasized, there is a possibility that he may become an even more “dangerous man” than his Berserker counterpart.  
One could also see him as the Kintoki who is riding in excitement from riding his monster machine.  
Yes, he is much groovier than the usual Kintoki.  
In a way, his current condition can be likened as to having received the best toy; the condition of peak happiness.  
As a result of having obtained knowledge of the modern world from here and there, he seems to have mixed up multiple meanings of “Rider”, and built a contemporary “Rider Belt” of his original design.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
Coming from his apparent misunderstanding of something, he now fights with his bare hand according to the honest and straightforward Rider Action*.  
They are strong attacks weaved with lightning.  
  
*the opening and ending of the first Kamen Rider  
  
## Golden Huge Bear Mk. I  
  
The motorcycle Bear Mk. I is an abnormal Devil Monster Machine.  
Apparently, it is a mobile machine, but not actually a motorcycle.  
Kintoki says it can transform into a giant robot.  
Kintoki says it is impossible to use it in town.  
Kintoki says it is modeled after a giant prayer weapon blessed by Hachiman-jin, which was used in battle against the giant “Tsuchigumo of Rendaino, in Kitayama” that has the size of Shinchuu (a heteromorphic giant creature that expunges calamity).  
The authenticity behind those claims is not known.  
In any case, it is fundamentally not used in FateGO

*Jujutsu mortified me so I took liberty in not confusing myself.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Kintoki is dyed by the culture of the present and so his Noble Phantasm is a motorcycle. I went with an easy to understand design by making him wear riders jacket. His signature sunglasses are left as is, his hairstyle is wild, and his figure is slimmed down a bit. In a sense, I’d like to think that this is probably the fashion that came about from Kintoki’s own misinterpretation of the word “rider”. His last ascension is my favorite. I had fun drawing it.
