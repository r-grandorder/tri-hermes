## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [B]**  
  
A powerful magecraft barrier granted to Miyu during her transformation.  
Invalidates magecraft with a chant of three verses or lower. Cannot defend against High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals.  
It also affects other statuses such as physical protection, healing acceleration, and corporal ability strengthening in the transformed state.  
  
**Unlimited Mana Supply: [B]**  
  
Literally infinite mana is supplied from the Kaleidostick.  
However, its output is restricted by the performance of the practitioner’s Magical Circuits.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
Pleasant-Type Mystic Code (Little Sister): [A]  
The little sister of the Weird-stick.  
Compared to the enthusiastic older sister, she’s calmed and rational.  
But after all, she’s a man-made Nature Elemental.  
The obligation to manipulate the Master and induce fun and weird situations hasn’t changed much.  
Furthermore, she has the tendency to make the costume of her contractor have more exposure in comparison to her older sister for some reason.  
  
**Willpower of the Little Girl: [B]**  
  
Miyu’s strength of will has been sublimated into a skill.  
Her noble determination won’t be shaken by half-hearted things, and enables Battle Continuation even if she receives a lethal wound.  
This isn’t something congenital, but a spirituality acquired by going through several experiences.  
But perhaps her obstinacy may be similar to her old brother’s.  
  
**Wish of the God Child: [EX]**  
  
A skill that minimally releases the property that indiscriminately realizes the wishes of oneself and others.  
Her wish will surely reach the heavens.  
  
**Hypnotic Radio Waves: [A]**  
  
A mysterious feature built in Sapphire.  
Spreads radio waves with a powerful hypnotic effect, and overwrites the memories of the humans in the surroundings.  
If used for evil it could ruin a country, but unlike Ruby she doesn’t make use of it for fun, so please rest assured.  
Furthermore, maybe because it burdens the brain, the IQ of the hypnotized humans decreases by 1.  
(Unused in 『FGO』)  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Hoshi ni Negai wo: Shine on the starred heavens, new moon of the earth  
- Rank: EX  
- Type: Anti-Unit~Anti-World Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~???  
- Maximum number of targets: ???  
  
Wish Upon a Star.  
Temporarily controls the nature of the God Child that indiscriminately grants the wishes of people, and realizes desires for a limited time.  
Since it’s a Noble Phantasm that only focuses on the Master’s wish of 『wanting to protect Human Order』, a relationship of mutual trust becomes more important than anything else.  
The nature of the God Child was supposedly lost due to the wish of Miyu herself, but the reason why it was registered in her Saint Graph was because she’s in 『a form that grew while retaining the nature of the God Child』.  
Maybe because the body is different, maybe because the land is different, the reason is unknown but it doesn’t seem to be an omnipotent wish-granting device like the original.  
  
That moonless night in which she became Emiya Miyu.  
Her old brother said that her modest thoughts hidden inside would be wished not upon the moon but upon the stars.  
That landscape, those thoughts, those words became her Noble Phantasm.  
The moon that shines above the earth and bundles wishes throws its light to the summit of the dark sky.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
First person pronouns: わたし (watashi)  
Second person pronouns: あなた (anata) / 〇〇さん (name-san)  
Third person pronouns: 彼 (kare) / 彼女 (kanojo) / 〇〇さん (name-san)  
  
## Personality  
  
Because she was raised in a state almost like confinement since she was born until now, she’s ignorant of the ways of the world.  
Nonetheless she’s likely to get overly theoretical since she has knowledge from books, and she often reacts in ways that slightly deviate from common sense.  
She has knowledge of Physics and Mathematics at university level, but on the other hand her communication skills may be lower than a kindergartener’s.  
In everyday life and in battle, she favors rationality.  
Gáe Bolg 5 seconds after the encounter.  
She has an extraordinarily deep affection towards Illya, the first friend she made, and the lily flowers often bloom in profusion.[1]  
It feels like she puts all sorts of weight in the definition of the relationship of 『friends』, but thinking about the environment in which she was raised it’s unavoidable.  
It seems the view of friends her old brother spoke of had some influence, but well.  
Chloe apparently is a rival-like existence that scrambles for Illya.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
She understands her role in Chaldea, and accepts it with composure.  
Of course, she’s used to being instructed on her actions by humans of an upper position.  
She won’t doubt about using her power for the sake of people, for Master’s sake.  
She sees the Master as a boss. She pays respect to their achievements, not to their character.  
If the bonds are deepened, she will eventually notice that the Master’s spirituality is close to that of Illya.  
But if Master tries to meddle with Illya, there will be no mercy.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
「People…… can’t fly」  
  
「Today, right here, I’ll put an end to the battle!」  
  
「My only friend is Illya. Don’t get close to Illya anymore」  
  
「…… Wishing to a star. If only one thing could be granted ——— I want to be real siblings with Shirō-san」  
  
## Depiction  
  
A kid born in the old family that has taken roots in Fuyuki from the Tenshō era, the Sakadzuki family.  
She has the paranormal property to grant the wishes of people.  
The Sakadzuki family was destroyed in the disaster that happened in Fuyuki, and Miyu was found by a certain father and his son.  
After that, there was the equivalent in comic of about 2 volumes of this and that, and she became a magical girl like Illya in a different world.  
In terms of mana quantity, she’s above the weakened Illya for no apparent reason.  
She is good at the relatively muscle-headed style of quick movement and high-output blasts.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
She appears in the collaboration event 『Magical Girl Cruise ~ Prisma Codes ~ Re-install』.  
She became a long-awaited playable character in the re-run.  
She obviously hopes to be in the same room as Illya at Chaldea.  
The 3, counting Chloe, seem to have fun chattering as usual.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
She’s equipped with the Kaleidostick 『Pleasant-type Mystic Code Magical Sapphire』.  
Besides mana bullets of high-density mana shot from the stick, slashes with mana thinly stretched in the form of a blade (melee attacks are possible too), high-power blasts and such can be freely used depending on the situation.  
Fundamentally the output of each shot is greater than Illya’s.  
Also, unlike Illya, who can fly, she moves making footing in the air with mana.  
She can’t move flexibly, but is able of quick linear maneuvers.

If I’m with Illya, I can face any hardship.  
If I’m with Illya, every food is delicious.  
If I’m with Illya, I can always sleep soundly.  
If I’m with Illya, baths are fun.  
If I’m with Illya…….  
  
**Chloe von Einzbern**  
  
I think that er… going kissy-kissy regardless of the situation is improper.  
Even Illya’s reputation may fall so I’d like you to restrain yourself.  
Chloe: 「Then I’ll suck from Miyu instead」  
Miyu: 「Huh?」  
  
**EMIYA**  
  
I can’t put it in words properly.  
That’s why, please let me just say this once.  
——— Thank you.  
For helping Onii-chan.  
  
  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Taking notes from Illya, the first and second Ascensions are her usual looks. The third Ascension is the form of the if of「What if she became a magical girl while retaining the power of the God Child……」. Sapphire reads the mood and changes as well. For Miyu the power of the God Child is like a curse from a certain lineage, but on the other hand there’s the aspect that she was able to meet her old brother and Illya because she had that power. The Miyu who naturally uses the power of the God Child, understanding and accepting it, is a form I couldn’t draw in the original story so I feel very happy to have been able to introduce it in FGO. Her lines also separate her feelings as the God Child and those as Miyu individually. (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
