Admittedly, the second line is BC. Ish.  
I have no idea whats going on.)  
  
**Protection of Faith: [A+++]**  
  
A skill possessed only by those who have sacrificed themselves to a single religious view.  
It is called a protection, but it is not a grace given by a higher being.  
What is there is an absoluteness of one's mind and body, born from faith.  
...When it is too high, it causes abnormality in one's personality.

He possesses different versions of this in different classes.  
From the grounds of the surroundings, a countless number of spears grows and judge the enemy. A demonic torture castle (Drakulya) of iron hammer and curse, unleashed from the demonic spear. Because it targets every hostile enemy soldiers, it is a Noble Phantasm that shows its true value during batttle of one-against-many.  
Perhaps due to its origin, it possesses the special characteristic of increasing the pain depending on the enemy's sins of depravity and immorality. Increases destructive power against target for purge; enemies who had comitted "desertion", "immorality", and "violence".

## Personality  
  
A man of justice, possessing iron faith and steel patriotism. He is severe towards both others and himself, yet he also possesses an excelling eye for tactics and austerity; a military man of both honor and morality.  
However, it is exactly his too deep of faith that causes abnormality in his personality. Wearing black armor and bloodstained mantle, he had changed into a knight of bloodstarving madness.  
Sacrificing the value that he believed in, it was exactly because his thought was too pure and genuine that other's way of thinking is incapable to intervene his. Due to that, roughly speaking conversation with him doesn't hold  
Count Vlad, who protected the faith that be the hope of the people, had lost his life by the hands of those very adherent. Within him, manifested as a Servants, are nothing but rage and grief.  
  
As can be seen from his Noble Phantasm, Stronghold of Impalement (Kazikli Bey), he is summoned as a Servant of Lancer Class.  
The hero who had defended faith and saved the Christian world rages at his untimely death and laments the avarice of the people, leading to the outcry that demands to know whether or not true love truly exist. That figures of his is as if he had appointed himself as God's apostle.  
He, who is known highly as not as the benevolent ruler of Wallachia but the vampire Dracula, is a Heroic Spirit who has been fabricated by the people in later era.  
  
(TLnote: patriotism was literally love of country defense in japanese but was too long for my taste)  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
He wishes for solace upon his grief, sorrow, and dryness; however, as he is summoned, in accordance to the contract he simply follows his Master as a Servant, as a spear of pure massacre.  
From his past life's regret, he carries within himself a madness not unlike that of a Berserker. However, should his Master is one who embodies profound faith and love without any falsehood, his aspect as a mad knight weakens and he becomes the spear that strikes down any enemies in order to protects his Master's heart.  
Compatibility with the Master becomes most important in order to demonstrates his abilities to their full extent. However, during the Holy Grail War of the moon, he acquired the greatest Master he could possibly hope for, and as he delight on it and declared "Plunge to the madness that is love. That sight of yours is most beautiful of all." as he performed splendidly in battle.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
"Infidels and depraved ones! Does your self consciousness amount to but nothing!?"  
  
"Oh Lord. By this blood of this sacrifice may your thirst be appeased.... Kazikli Bey!"  
  
"So be it, death upon you! Oh beast without love, neither you nor I have any reason to prowl about above this world!"  
  
"Be it at any place and any age you are, conflicts are eternal, and there is no end to the puppets clothed in human skin. So be it. I shall kill through and through."  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Vlad III, ruler of Wallachia who truly existed in the 15th century.  
He was the hero that hold on to Wallachia's independence against the imminent threat of the Turks. He is also known as the shield of Christianity.  
For the sake of protecting Wallachia to the very end against the Turkish army, he is known for his severe conduct, such as bringing to justice the nobles who had ruined his domain and sentencing to death by impalement the twenty thousand Turkish enemy soldiers. Those are undeniably acts with the intention to protect his country, but due to its excessive brutality, he would later be be made as the model of the novelist Bram Stoker's horror novel "Dracula".  
To begin with, Dracula was a title he had appointed for himself, meaning "son of dragon".  
His father, Vlad II was a knight of the Order of the Dragon belonging to the Holy ROman Empire, and it is the origin of his self appointed title of Dracul.  
Count Vlad believes in the love for the Lord and amends injustice as his duty as a noble demands it. However, the feudal lords wallowing in the wealth of the privileged class dislike his honorable poverty, and so the military man who had protected Christianity fell by the hands of machination.  
  
## Role in previous work  
  
He appeared in Fate/EXTRA. With his Master Lun Lu, he fought for her sake, for her Master who brought solace unto his own grief and sorrow. He referred to her as his wife. Being a fabricated Heroic Spirit, No Name (Emiya) revealed that he is the model Bram Stoker's horror novel "Dracula", and one whose real image had been twisted and distorted due to it. In Fate/Apocrypha, a Lancer who holds the same name as he also appeared, but......  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Vlad III**  
  
Seeing my own figure, one who reigned as a feudal lord, I do wonder what is in his mind, seeing the version of him who lived as a knight.....  
  
**Nero**  
  
The trailblazer of Christian persecution. Of course, she and I simply can not cooperate. We cannot, but I, Vlad III, too am someone who had turned into devil at the end of my faith. As a mutual devil, we are assuredly perfectly compatible to slaughter each other.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
I thought of him as a bit of a troublesome old man because Lun Lu isn't around in FGO, and I drew him with a straight, low angle composition so as to be more intense and more troubling compared in EXTRA. But then when he was implemented and raise, I feel like a lot of super cute aspect is seen, and I genuinely thought that it would've been better if I drew him with a much tender expression.
