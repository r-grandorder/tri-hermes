## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Knight of Owner - A Knight Does Not Die with Empty Hands
- Rank: A++
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum target: 30 person

Knight of Owner.
An ability Noble Phantasm that grants the attribute of "one's own Noble Phantasm" on anything he holds.
No matter what kind of weapon or arms it is (for example, an iron pole, a fighter jet, or a gun), once he hold it in his hands, by surrounding it with magic energy it is turned into a pseudo-Noble Phantasm equal to D-rank (Berserker's black magic energy surrounds and wraps the weapon in a vein-like manner in such cases).
In the situation where he takes hold of a Noble Phantasm of a higher rank than D-rank, he is able to put it under his control while keeping its original rank.
However, this ability's range of use is limited to things that he can recognize as a "weapon". (For example, even if he could transform fighter jet into a Noble Phantasm, he cannot do the same to aircraft carrier due to recognizing it as "something different from a weapon".)

## Personality

One of the Knights of the Round Table. The Knight of the Lake.
With his signature weapon Arondight in hand, he is considered to be the strongest when it comes to individiual prowess.
He had fallen to madness many times due to the matters surrounding Queen Guinevere, and accordingly is quite compatible with the Berserker class.
During his live, he was known for his excelling personality befitting to one noble and virtuous, a knight among knights. But he has lost his reason by means of Mad Enhancement, turning into an existence with negative emotions such as hatred and murderous impulse within. However, should he catch sight of Saber even during a combat, he would immediately break out and charge her, displaying a tenacity towards the king.
It's not that he held resentment towards King Arthur; he harbored not even a fragment of grudge towards the king who blamed herself.
Being the cause for the division within the Round Table and unable to save Guinevere, he simply thought that he should face judgement. Due to that, he, driven by madness, only wished for the king's condemnation. All the while displaying hatred, a "grudge incapable of resentment", and persistently attacking her.
As for his many talents and qualities, for all that he was born with such a high spec bordering overpowered, none of it was of any help for breaking through his conflicts; a tragic figure of a knight.
Furthermore, the issue his origin, being treated as the source of discord between him and the Knights of the Round Table, raises his disrepancy even further.
For the senses of value between that of the Round Table from Britain, of complete devotion for the sake of the island, and that of Lancelot from France, of a land separated beyond the sea, are fundamentally different.

## Attitude Towards Master

When he was alive, his immoral love with Queen Guinevere ended up being allowed by King Arthur; he is tormented by a sense of regret, of wanting to be condemned of that crime of his. Due to his root being his too serious nature instead of being an excellent knight, he had been summoned as Berserker yet strives for the best performance as a knight. However, only during the case that he is placed on the same battleground as King Arthur that he would go even further from that...

## Dialogue Examples

"A----urrrrrr!!!"

"I am-----
The alienated-----
The ridiculed-----
The despised-----
Praise not of my name-----
Envy not of my self-----
I am the shadow born from the radiance of Heroic Spirits-----
The darkness born of the shade of dazzling legends-----
And so-----
I hate-----
I resent-----
That noble shadow itself is my disgrace-----
That honor is eternal, and so I am contempted forever-----"

"I have.... by your hand, been judged.
O king... by your hand, and nobody else's, had my sin been inquired..."

"For me to be allowed to spar with you in the end, even with my face distorted such as this...
To die in the king’s arms, before the king’s eyes... haha, it is as if... as if I am such a loyal knight..."

## Historical Character and Figure

The multi-talented son of King Benoic of Gallia (now France), who had been sworn friends with King Arthur.
When Benoic had been attacked by his bitter enemy King Claudas, Lancelot was hidden by the Lady of the Lake and brought up on the kingdom of fairies. Growing up, he was appointed as a knight under King Arthur and joined as one of Queen Guinevere's guards. His respect and affection towards the Queen soon changes into love, bringing about the tragedy of Britain.
He possesses the famed sword Arondight that brings down even dragons, but there are also cases where he took elm branch or snatched away his enemy's sword and used it as his own weapon.
Ha had conceived love from many ladies, including the enchantress Morgan. From him and Elaine of Corbenic, who had assumed a queen position by means of sorcery, his son Galahad was born.*
Each time such a story went heard of, Lancelot who accepted condemnation from the queen again and again fell into madness; the reason of why he, a perfect knight, was granted an element of Berserker.
When their immorality was exposed, Lancelot rescued the queen who had been placed for execution and sheltered her on his own land, but then amidst the war in Britain, Mordred's rebellion occured. Lancelot's reinforcement didn't make it in time; he then entered priesthood and bade his short life in Britain farewell.

(*IRL legend have it that Elain of Corbenic, being a sorceress, tricks him into believing that she is Queen Guinevere and he sleeps with her, and the ensuing pregnancy results in the birth of his son, Galahad.)

## Character in FGO

He doesn't have any particular appearance time in the main story for the duration of 5 chapter.
However, his strength is definitely not a half-hearted one; receiving enemy's attacks using just chopsticks & transforming falling wooden logs into Noble Phantasm armament in succession during his interlude story.
In addition, even if he takes off his helmet, his countenance, rumoured to be peerlessly handsome, is unable to be seen due to his Skill.


## Role in past works

Appeared in Fate/Zero. He showed his true identity during the last moments of Fuyuki's fourth Holy Grail War. During his live, he had a deep connection with Saber; and so when he ended up being summoned as a Berserker and expressed such deep resentment it gave Saber such a shock and emotional damage. Seeing Lancelot's case, to once again be able to meet someone one holds respect and affection to should have been a stroke of luck, but it ended up giving the too serious Saber excessive misunderstandings instead. The Nuisance.
Also, he actually speaks quite splendidly in spin off works.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I was like: Three stage transformation? No way, impossible! I'm really sorry... The original design wasn't made with the assumption that it'll be mass produced, so it would be a trouble to draw big changes. But perhaps it is exactly because of that that one can say the design can be used just as is even after several years passed. When in his third stage he changes to his characteristic weapon Arondight, secretly I retorted "No way it's gonna have the same attack power as the iron pipe." (Koyama Hirokazu)
