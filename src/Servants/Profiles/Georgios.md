## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [A]**  
  
Cancels all A rank magic and below. As a matter of fact, modern magi are incapable of hurting him.  
  
Even if he is thoroughly assaulted by a magus’ spells and magic, he will emerge completely unscathed.  
  
It would not be wrong to call such an ability a 'magus killer'.  
  
**Riding: [B]**  
  
Capable of operating most rides with above average capacity, but he is unable to ride phantasmal kin.  
  
It can be considered that his own ability as a Rider does not really amount to that extent, and it is the ability of Bayard, the horse that was given to him, that is truly outstanding.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Guardian Knight: [A+]**  
  
This is a rare Skill granted to Georgius, being a noble knight and a saint aspired to “protect” many countries.  
  
Through a genuine sense of duty in protecting others, he displays a tremendous rising in defensive power albeit temporarily.  
  
**Soul of the Martyr: [B+]**  
  
A Skill that negates mental interference.  
  
He had been compelled to renounce his religion and forced to undergo many form of tortures, yet until the very end he had not waver in his faith.  
  
**Battle Continuation: [A]**  
  
Fortitude granted by the blessing of the land. It's possible for him to fight even on the verge of death, surviving as long as his injury is not decisively lethal.  
  
**Instinct: [C]**  
  
The ability to always “feel” the most optimum course of action for him during battle. In Georgius’ case, only during the act of protecting would said sense be possible  
  
(In FGO, it is fundamentally not utilized)  
  
**Divinity: [C]**  
  
Revered as a saint throughout the world, he boasts faithfulness that exceeds that of small religions and some ancient gods.  
  
Moreover, Georgius’ origin traces back to the Middle East god of harvest, Ba’al.  
  
(In FGO, it is fundamentally not utilized)

# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
- First pronoun: watashi  
- Second pronoun: anata  
- Third pronoun: kare, kanojo  
  
## Personality  
  
Exceedingly earnest, with a gentle and sincere personality; an ideal saint from any point of view.  
  
Even those who calls him dull and uninteresting would probably end up trusting that personality of his and believe that he would never tell a lie.  
  
His hobby is camera. If he is summoned to the modern era, he would almost always carry a camera with him.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Even that gentle disposition of his would of course change, depending on the Master, .  
  
….That being said, the very fact that they are able to summon Georgius probably already shows how the Master’s personality is to begin with.  
  
He would be sincere towards the Master, but his personality is not one that would hold back on admonishing them. At times severe, at times lenient. One can say that his role is that of an ideal teacher.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“This be Ascalon’s truth. Thy are a dragon; and thus, sinful! Ascalon!”  
  
“Rider, Georgius. I have come in response to your summon. Come; we shall do the very best we can.”  
  
“My hobby, is it? Hmm… I suppose it would be the camera by which was handed over to me since I had been summoned. Indeed, taking pictures wherever I go is a private enjoyment of mine.”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Georgius (Saint Georgius, St. George, Sant Jordi, Sancti Georgii). A saint of the teaching of Christ.  
  
In possession of the mystical blade Ascalon, he is famous of the act of dragonslaying.  
  
He is also a man of valor, accomplishing martyrdom for the sake of the teaching of Christ.  
  
His main anecdotes include the close to the original “Golden Legend”*, as well as the mythical “Seven Champions of Christendom” where various arms of the witch made an appearance.  
  
There is also a theory that states that he had appeared as a reinforcement during the Crusades, leading the force of the heaven.  
  
* The Golden Legend is considered to be the closest to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Marta**  
  
A close friend in the saint team. He places tremendous trust in her.  
  
“Although I must say, I am more well known.”  
  
**Jeanne d’Arc**  
  
A close friend in the saint team, albeit on a different branch. As a fellow saint, he is quite proud of her fame which rivals or even surpasses his own.  
  
“Although I must say, I am quite stronger.”  
  
**Jeanne Alter**  
  
Something of a mishap that defiles the name of a saint. Perhaps it was due to such a shock, that Georgius is incapable of seeing Jeanne Alter.  
  
“Although I must say, my camera is somewhat out of focus.”
