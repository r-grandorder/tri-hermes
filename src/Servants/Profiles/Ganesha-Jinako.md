The story of how his tusk was broken because he noticed that Parashurama’s axe was a present from his father Shiva and made point to take the hit instead of dodging is a famous one.  
There are multiple other versions, including one where his tusk was always broken and another one where he threw it at the moon.  
  
**Vinayaka: [EX]**  
  
Ganesha’s other name. It means “the best”.  
This is also the name of Demons whose property is becoming an obstacle.  
This connected to the idea that success will come to you with you overcome this obstacle, resulting on the belief that he is the god who removes obstacles.

- Rank: C  
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1-10  
- Max. Targets: 10 people  
  
Mr. Ganesha’s stress-relief Noble Phantasm.  
It’s actually just an excessively heavy tackle with their body completed covered in divine aura.  
  
# Ganesha Vighneshvara (Follow my principles, for I am the god of obstacles)

Unusable outside of special circumstances.  
Ganesha means master of retainers and Vighneshvara is Ganesha’s other name meaning god of obstacles.  
By taking his property as the Remover of Obstacles to the purest level, she can manifest an absolutely inviolable force field.  
If used offensively, its absolute might can shove away any obstacle standing before her.  
And of course, defensively, she can use it as a perfect shield to block any attack (obstacle) from others.

## Pronouns  
  
First person pronoun: Boku/ (rarely) watashi or atashi    
Second person pronoun: kimi    
Third person pronoun: ano hito  
  
## Personality  
  
Ganesha’s sense of duty is deep inside her body but on the surface Jinako’s personality is pretty much the same as always.  
A big chicken with neet tendencies.  
A helplessly lazy, completely self-centered and self-defeating woman on her x0’s.  
However, her fate lead her to go through some kind of impactful experience, so it could be possible that for her squeeze some of the neet pride that’s still left in her husk… maybe.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
“I’m sick and tired of this Grail BS! I want to go back to my old body already… Actually, you could send my back to my old world, Master!”  
She interacts with the Master as a younger brother for her to spoil.  
Basically, “You chose to adopt this useless god here, so you’re not going to escape your responsibility, ok?”.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“I’m Jina… the aloof and solitary God Servant Ganesha, so I suck at this whole servitude deal. I just live how I want, eating when I want and playing games when I want!”  
  
“Wait, Masteeer! Since you’re leaving, bring me some candy and juice when you’re back!”  
  
“Hehe, where you’re getting at asking me what I like, you dog~!  
Ah, if it’s for a present, I want a card. I know what kind of card. I know you do. Get me that card.”  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
A Pseudo-Servant of a Divine Spirit in a human vessel… or so it seems. Her creation process is full of mysteries. To be honest, she's full of minor glitches.  
The name on her Saint Graph’s profile displays what’s believed to be the name of the human mage serving as the host but for some reason the data is conceptually corrupted in a way no one can read the name.  
For that reason, the Chaldea staff, Master included, decided to call her “Mr. Ganesha” since that’s what she was calling herself.  
It’s actually not confirmed that the Divine Spirit inside her really is the Indian god Ganesha.  
  
In rare occasions, people with implied connections to her randomly say her name, but they can only do so unconsciously, and the others never process her name as a word.  
Due to the Extra Class she’s manifested in, it’s easy to deduce which superior AI is somehow involved in her creation… but the truth is still hidden in the darkness, or perhaps in the Inner Moon of another world.  
  
Ganesha, the Indian god she claims to be inside her, is said to be the son of Shiva and Parvati.  
To be more exact, Parvati created him from the filth on her body.  
Parvati made him to stand guard and not let anyone pass while she was bathing. And that’s when Shiva came in.  
Since Ganesha didn’t know Shiva was Parvati’s husband, he stopped him. And since Shiva didn’t know about Ganesha either, he feel into rage for being treated like that and ripped Ganesha’s head off.  
Parvati lamented her son’s death and Shiva promised he would bring their son back to life, but he couldn’t find the head.  
For that reason, Shiva revived him with the head of the first elephant he found… And that’s the most well-known reason for the elephant head.  
  
Ganesha is the god of fortune and prosperity, the god of learning (it’s said that the Mahabharata was made by him writing down the story the Rishi Vyasa was verbally narrating), and the god of obstacles later turned the ** god who removes obstacles**.  
  
## Role in the game  
  
The Servant summoned by the Counter Force to confront the Indian Lostbelt.  
Due to her manifestation having special circumstances in both the vessel’s selection and the land she was summoned in, it’s fair to assume that she possessed a variety of cheat codes like the aforementioned name bug.  
  
“What the heck, why this black sheep treatment? I’m the victim here! I was just some stale bread average joe until a God with really weird taste came to me and said, ‘We’re compatible, do the thing’ and shoved the big responsibilities on my face!? At least buy me dinner first!”  
  
As you can tell from the quote above, all indicates the consciousness of the vessel human is stronger.  
She understands fully well that she is a Divine Spirit and that she was summoned for a very specific reason, but even so, due to the host’s strong personality, she incessantly rambled “Whaaaaaaa, I can’t save the world”, as anyone who knows her would’ve expected.  
But that’s was only until Chaldea arrived and she met the protagonist.  
After all, they had by their side a Lancer Servant she’s seen before…  
  
## Role in previous entries  
  
Jinako Caligiri is one the Masters appearing in Fate/EXTRA CCC.  
Although she had the luckiest roll in the Moon’s Holy Grail War, summoning Lancer Karna as her Servant, she ran away from her battles and isolated herself in the warehouse because she’s a neet and chicken.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
Staff, axe and overwhelming weight.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Parvati:**   
  
“Mother! I know you meant well, but the FILTH on your body is really not okay as material to build a son!?”  
  
**Asvattaman:**   
  
He’s regarded as a semi-avatar of Shiva (his father), so, to Ganesha, he’s a scary older man who smells like his father… in other words, an uncle he doesn’t want to get too close to. He does respect his actual father, but liking is a different matter.  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
  
“Yes, we’re both shut-ins. But she’s doujin princess and I’m just a complete neet. Doesn’t look like we would get along very well… except we did. We really were the same on the inside. The more we got to know we each other, the more I was begrudgingly forced to accept that. No clue how, but it is what it is. We just exchanged a few words and before I knew it we were playing videogames together all the time.”  
  
**Beni-Enma:**   
  
“Hello, I’m sorta in a vegetarian diet right now… So, I was wondering if you could maybe good junk food-like food that fits into…  
Huh, ‘Of couwse that’s an acceptable wequest’? Ah, you don’t need to bother counting calories.  
French fries are vegetables and delicious so they couldn’t possibly have any calories in it!”  
  
**Darius III:**   
  
“H-hey, hey. Dunno why but I got the impression that dude’s looking at me like I’m his mount or something…?!”  
  
**Karna:**   
  
“Haha… Wherever we go, Karna never lets go of his usual Karna ways…”  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
I wanted to draw her with more arms!!!! I thought Jinako’s design already had some Ganesha elements from the start (like her belly) so I made a really legit Ganesha design without having to change much from the base. Honestly, I had way too much fun drawing her belly, so I made it a little too big… I’m sorry… The statue opens by sliding the front side to the sides. (Wada Arco)
