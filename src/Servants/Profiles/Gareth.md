**Gareth of the Beautiful Hands: [B]**

While working in the castle disguised as a kitchen boy, Sir Kay nicknamed her “Beaumains (Beautiful Hands)” for her fair and beautiful appearance. At the time, Kay did not realize that it was Gareth in disguise.

In other words, Gareth had fair and lustrous skin, and her hands were especially beautiful.

Originally this should be classified as a Noble Phantasm effect, but in the game this effect manifests as a skill.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Ira Lupus (The Raging She-Wolf)
- Rank: C++
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm

Ira Lupus: The sublimation of her skillful jousting techniques as a Noble Phantasm. After dealing a series of raging blows, she pierces her enemy with a lethal hit.

When she fought to protect her best friend Lady Lioness (Dame Lyonesse) in the past, she defeated a great many famed knights with a single lance, such as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Galihodin, Sir Galihud (not to be confused with Galahad), Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, King Agwisance of Ireland, King Carados of Scotland, King Uriens of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus.

On another occasion, she challenged King Arthur to a joust, and was praised and given the epithet “Raging Wolf” for her fighting prowess.

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: watashi/jibun/Gareth  
Second person pronoun: anata/ **-sama/ **-dono/ **-san/Sir **(for KoRT)  
Third person pronoun: kare/kanojo/ **-sama/ **-dono/ **-san/ Sir **(for KoRT)

## Personality

A tragic girl knight courageous and puppy-like in nature.

Once she becomes attached to someone, she will never betray them no matter what—even in death, as once shown by her way of life.

## Attitude Towards Master

She will immediately trust her Master the very moment she meets them, feeling some sort of fate at work. That said, she doesn’t seem to understand the nature of their connection. She appears to be having trouble processing the Master-Servant relationship.

“Suppose this is the relationship between a king and his knight… If so, I already serve King Arthur. Labelling this as a senpai and kouhai relationship would be easy to understand, but you already have Miss Mash as your kouhai… Hmm… Hmm…”

## Dialogue Examples

“I am Gareth. I am the Round Table Seventh Seat, a knight who served under King Arthur!”

“Good day to you, Brother.”

“My hands often get praised! Hehe.”

“Please…do not speak ill of Sir Lancelot. He saved the queen, and I believe what he did was right.”

## Historical Character and Figure

Gareth was the seventh seat of the Knights of the Round Table led by King Arthur of Britain. She was a young girl knight born to King Lot and Fae Queen Morgan, and the sister of Gawain, Gaheris, and Agravain. Mordred the Knight of Treachery was her half-brother.

She was also known as Guerrehet and Beaumains (Beautiful Hands).

Gareth was the newest addition to the Round Table and the least experienced knight. She held respect for all her senior Knights of the Round Table. She was especially attached to Sir Lancelot and often followed him.

Gareth went through numerous trainings as a squire (such as working in the castle disguised as a kitchen boy, fighting her brother Gawain, and pursuing learning under the fae folk) and eventually became an official member of the Knights of the Round Table. Like Gaheris, she did not accompany their eldest brother Gawain after her knighthood and instead chose to become an attendant of Lancelot.

♦

Gareth was loved by many for her brimming potential. Even the other Knights of the Round Table, not just her brothers, spoke highly of her claiming that “she will become the greatest knight one day” and that “in time, she will become a true knight rivaling all her brothers.”

When Agravain plotted to indict Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot of adultery, Gareth opposed him. She said, “I will not speak of unsettling statements about Sir Lancelot, who conferred the title of a knight to me,” and left the scene filled with deep sorrow.

Later, Agravain caught Lancelot in the act of committing adultery, but this resulted to him losing his life in retaliation. Gareth was then ordered to attend the captured Queen Guinevere’s execution. Gareth complied but made it clear that she would be witnessing the execution against her will and attended without wearing armor or carrying weapon on her person. This decision would lead to her demise.

Gareth’s unarmed head was cracked open in Sir Lancelot’s rescue of the queen.

Many lives were lost in this chain of incidents. Agravain, Gaheris, and lastly Gareth—Having lost his siblings, how tremendous must have been Sir Gawain’s grief? Thus, a schism divided the Round Table, and the glory of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table came to an end.

## Character in FGO

She honors chivalry, and believes in and follows justice. She is proud to serve under the King of Knights, and even now considers being chosen as a member of the Round Table the greatest honor of her life.

She still respects Sir Lancelot. Even if the knight who blindly rushed to rescue Queen Guinevere never caught sight of her figure on the day everything spiraled to the end… And even if the knight did recognize her but still slew her without hesitation, she respects him all the same.

## Standard Weapons

**Her favorite jousting lance**  

Although Gareth’s skill with the lance is justly proven, this lance has been enhanced multiple times by Merlin’s magecraft and has become a type of Mystic Code.

On another note, hmm… So he’s called an English gentleman? I see.

## Comment from the Illustrator

The instruction I received was to draw an “untrained squire”. She’s a hard worker who earnestly polishes cheap steel, turning it into shining armor. Her first and third ascensions have the themes kitchen/errand boy and Knight of the Round Table, respectively. The cartridges attached to her waist holder are based on grenades. I drew her final ascension with hopes that she, as a Heroic Spirit, could become [the player’s] partner in the story. (Nekotawawa)
