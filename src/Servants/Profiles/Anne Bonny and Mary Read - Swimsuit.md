A combination Noble Phantasm in which Anne, who has equipped a musket, covers for Mary, who wields a cutlass in her hand. The materialization of their anecdote in which, just before they were arrested, these two fought hard up to the very end while being surrounded by countless numbers of soldiers. If the state of affairs around them are disadvantageous, the more disadvantageous it is, the more advantageous the damage bonus they acquire. Even if they changed into swimsuits, their style did not change that much.

First Person Pronoun: watakushi
Second Person Pronoun: anata
Third Person Pronouns: kare, kanojo

**Mary**

First Person Pronoun: boku
Second Person Pronoun: kimi
Third Person Pronouns: kare, kanojo

## Personality

They begin their approach in the same way as the original Anne & Mary whom attained Bond 5. Since it is summer, they feel a little bolder in approaching their Master.

“It’s completely OKAY if you see them to that extent; it’s even OKAY to touch them. Will you proceed with this up to the very end?”

## Attitude Towards Master

They are a rare pair of female pirates, but this time, they carefreely visit the Master in swimsuits. With a ‘Bonny!’ feeling, Anne attacks the Master in a swimsuit with a high degree of exposure, while Mary pouts in dere towards the Master with a physique that has a ‘Read!’ feeling to it, turning into a pincer attack.


## Dialogue Examples

Anne: “Come on Master… Making us fight with such an appearance! You’re such a brute, hahah.”

Mary: “I really protested this to Master, but…”


Mary: “Hey Master. Listen, Anne might come to excessively compel you, but that person is so going to persistently arouse you instead. So you shouldn’t go along with her ride, okay? If you get on board with that, I’ll scorn you, really scorn you! REALLY!”

Anne: “Master… Master, Master, Master. Hehe, what a wonderful sound. Even if they’re passions that will only last for a single summer, I’m happy right now. Yes, awfully so.”

## Historical Character and Figure

As a matter of course, it is the same as the time when Anne & Mary were a Rider.

## Character in FGO

Due to getting into swimsuits, the duo decided to notify to others more and more of their dere frequencies. Furthermore, they truly do not want the Master to feel something along the likes of them wanting him or her to choose either one of the two; rather, they intend for the Master to choose them as a set.

## Standard Weapons

A musket.

**Other Swimsuit Characters**

“What are you afraid of? Here is The Great Duo that combined the set of large and small. It doesn’t matter how alluring the others are, for there’s no one out there that’ll surpass our charm!”… or so they think.

**Blackbeard**

“Shouldn’t we gouge out his eyes for the duration of the Summer Period?”
“Acknowledged.”


## Comment from the Illustrator

You know, I set these two up with those appearances. Last time, I really did not consider that Anne as she is would truly undergo Ascension too. I was able to accept tearing off her skirt and stockings to put into that feeling of revenge. Although I even like skirts, I also really love waists and bare legs that nicely reach that thickness. It is a swimsuit event this time after all, right?

Last time, I was imagining Anne & Mary’s golden age that included the time when they were pirates, but this time, these women themselves recognize that they have these transient lives as Servants, finishing their once human lives after they were clearly arrested, and that became the premise of these designs. I attached to their wrists some shackles as their collars, of which one of them has each other’s hair so that they can be together even when they die separately.

Mary’s additional weapon… well, I wonder if it was something that was impossible to exist if it was from that era… so I guess it became a fictional weapon that came from something floating in my mind. Perhaps during Mary’s lifetime, it was a product stolen from the site that manufactured and dispatched only one of said weapon and was made for rich people, and although her heart was unusually drawn to it and she wanted to wear it on her person, it was heavy, easy to break and hard to shoot and kill with, and it was difficult to repair those peculiarities, so it seems that there was no opportunity to make use of a little bit of that item up to the very end when her life was taken into custody.

Even so, it is different right now after Mary died. Having pulled it out from her memories as something joyful in her mind, it is probably that sort of feeling, among other things, that makes her start taking it out completely to her heart’s content compared to when she was not up to the task of using it during those times. Naturally, during the times when she does battle, it breaks every time she uses her Noble Phantasm, so it is a weapon similar to garbage that does not even have a great Mystery behind it. Given that she can repair it as many times as she likes, do you not think that it is probably not satisfying for her to smash it apart when she is using it without any sense of hesitation?

In the picture of Anne & Mary’s Final Ascension, these two women are allowed to remove their shackles, and they put their hands on top of each other’s; this unlikely scene is only after such things are reached. A large quantity of gold coins and a pirate flag (although frankly, that pirate flag is almost unable to be seen) are laid out underneath their buttocks, and it was fun for them to enjoy themselves a lot. Also, they are wearing the smiles called tomorrow. Because Mary is satisfied with this and that, she is not holding onto her weapons. But Anne cannot relinquish her weapon. Even if she shows a smile on her face, the fact is that she is still anxious. Even if she is grasping this as an ephemeral dream, it is nevertheless the embodiment of a lingering attachment she does not want to lose this time.

Although, since a heavy story such as that does not suit Anne & Mary as they are now, well, think of that as further nonsense. If that is a heavy story, then let us try discussing instead about how nice is meat that seems heavy and looks soft - hey, let us try to stick to that. Right, it is an important point for meat to seem heavy.

Why is that Anne’s established body weight? Because that is how it is posed. Oh, after all, since she has a tall stature, an excellent body build, and splendid muscles as well, even with a light estimate, she has to be at least - no, being responsible for somewhat sensitive talks like this must go through a different section, so I am a bit reluctant to really answer that, alright?
