## Class Skills  
  
**Presence Concealment: [D]**  
  
A Skill that suppresses one’s presence as a Servant. It is suitable for espionage activities.  
  
Although he is an Assassin, the act of assassination is close to impossible for Sanson.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Executioner: [A++]**  
  
Severing evil with evil; the ultimate judgement act. Damage increases towards those with the Evil Alignment. Also, a Servant will also become a target in the case that the acts of that Servant are regarded as evil.  
  
**Medical Techniques: [A]→[A+]**  
  
Modern medical techniques that surpassed the medical technology in those days – when superstition was running rampant – by several levels. Still, this Skill is not compared by the standards of the modern era, but is instead determined by the standards of the era that the Servant lived in.  
  
**Human Anatomy Research: [B]**  
  
A concept placed on the “other side” of execution and medical techniques.  
  
Sanson was not negligent in doing research on where he could wound the human body that would result in the person not dying, prognostic symptoms not being left behind, and so forth. Speaking of it from another angle, he is good at understanding where it is okay to wound someone at the time of fighting against them.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# La Mort Espoir: Death is the Hope for Tomorrow  
- Rank: A  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~10  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
La Mort Espoir (The Death Hope). The materialization of the true execution tool: the guillotine. Whether or not it can be avoided is decided not by one’s resistance to curses or their Luck, but according to the concept of “whether or not one can bear with the fate of dying eventually.” It is a so-called “Mental Interference”-type Noble Phantasm, and Heroes who have anecdotes of “being executed” rather than dying in battle undergo a disadvantageous check.  
  
When the True Name is invoked within mid-range, the manifestation of the guillotine happens. One second later, the guillotine drops, and the judgement takes place. In the case that the target failed the check, the guillotine falls without change and their head is decapitated.

## Pronouns  
  
- First Person Pronoun: watashi  
- Second Person Pronoun: anata  
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo  
  
## Personality  
  
A mild young man who dearly loves “humans”. Sanson hates “evil”, but not “evil people”. He believes in God, but at the same time further understands that God “does nothing.” For that reason, he bears the lamentable sense of duty of severing “evil” with “evil”. Extremely strict in regard to the law, he has a motive where if he is able to achieve victory against an enemy, then he wants the “death penalty” to be called off, and while he accepts doing battle against Servants, he does not kill Masters.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Sanson basically revolves around the position of serving his Master with a neutral point of view. However, in the case that his Master attempted to coerce him into doing evil deeds such as eating souls, it will lead to hostile acts from Sanson, acts that could include his suicide.  
  
Although Sanson appeared as Berserk Assassin in “Orléans – The Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons”, his character on that occasion was obstinate since he had literally gone mad. He does not want to give pain to lawbreakers and evildoers. Even if it was an unconscious desire – a desire where he rather wished for a slash so swift and painless, it gives the victims the illusion of a heavenly paradise as consideration for their deaths.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“Servant, Assassin. I have called on you, responding to your summons.”  
  
“The disappointing thing is that I cannot kill humans. Nevertheless, if that is fine with you, then please use me.”  
  
“It is an ironic way of life. It is because I do not want to hurt people that consequently, I studied the techniques on how to hurt them.”  
  
“There are no likes of pride in a household of executioners. I do at least mean that I myself have no pride. The reason for that is just… love. For them at least, for they appear to be struggling in pain up to the point just before their deaths————”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
An executioner during the time of the French Revolution. Charles-Henri Sanson was involved with the executions of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, and many others. The reason that a mere executioner got so famous was that, in spite of being in an executioners’ household that boasted a history of more than two hundred years, and in spite of being in the faction that opposed the death penalty too, it was the result of things like being the person who carried out the second most death penalties in history.  
  
The Sanson House was a contradictory existence, having lived while being financially blessed despite having a low social status as “executioners”. Even when the country turned around because of the French Revolution, a verdict of innocence was handed down against the execution of the Sanson House which had continued for generations. To guillotine without their will; that was their role.  
  
Charles-Henri Sanson, just then in those turbulent times, became the Executioner————Monsieur de Paris. Sanson executed targets from every social class, from figures such as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre whose reputations were literally linked with the history of France, to as far as obscure people.  
  
In particular, the execution of Louis XVI seemed to be an extreme shock for even Sanson, and after Louis XVI’s execution, Sanson entreated some priests to hold a Mass for the King. That was a counter-revolutionary crime at the time of the French Revolution, and it was something so serious, it became a capital crime, but even so, Sanson repeatedly held a Mass for the King.  
  
It has also been noted that Charles-Henri Sanson was an exceptional advocate for equality even in those days. Sanson helped abandoned patients as a physician, and he accumulated research so that the people having their sentences carried out would have no pain and prognostic symptoms.  
  
————Supposing that… it was something anybody and everybody would not concern themselves with, and it was even something that would not be rewarded… Sanson would put up with the agony and respectably continue on with that role.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Marie Antoinette**  
  
As everyone knows, a respected and beloved queen, maiden, and eternal existence. For what reason did Marie leave those words behind to Sanson without even any fear of sorts just before her execution?  
  
**Amadeus Mozart**  
  
As everyone knows, they have a relationship as fellow perverts… “As rivals, we are rivals!”  
  
**The Chevalier d’Éon**  
  
“I am sorry, but can we not be together?“ d’Éon said. Sanson wants to cry a little.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Not to mention the Noble Phantasm’s guillotine and the 4 horse heads on his shoulders, the designs of Sanson’s outfits, such as the wheels, ladders and crosses, are used as motifs of torture and execution tools. For the fact that Sanson is a Servant of the French Revolution, I looked up the details of his bloodline, career, etc. as well, and it was extraordinarily enjoyable reading them. He is fundamentally a serious character who also has an additional facial expression where he looks down on someone while laughing, but it turns out that sort of thing was unexpectedly in the BAMBOO BROOM DIARY… (Shima Drill)
