## Class Skills  
  
  
  
**Riding: EX**  
  
Wow, Fran-chan can ride Babbage – Locomotive Form.  
  
That form, is just like Today’s Dog. (A little special on dogs in Japan’s news)  
  
Today’s Fran.  
  
  
  
**Magic Resistance: E**  
  
Because she’s sluggish, she can’t resist much.  
  
  
  
**Mad Enhancement: E**  
  
Speaking, troublesome.  
  
  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
  
  
**Summer Galvanism: B+**  
  
A somewhat different Galvanism for summer.  
  
Specifically, by receiving backup from Babbage, a steam engine is also sending power.  
  
Demerits: Hot, sluggish.  
  
  
  
**Hollow Wailing towards the Intense Heat: A**  
  
Fran-chan’s a bit hot, very sluggish, tired, and sulky.  
  
That form, is like a large dog that has been defeated by the summer heat.  
  
My, how cute.  
  
  
  
**Moderate-load: C**  
  
Since Overload is bothersome, she’s Moderate-loading.  
  
  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
  
  
# Skewered Plasma Blade: Skewering lightning blade  
  
  
  
* Rank: D~B  
* Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm  
* Range: 1~3 (length)  
* Maximum number of targets: 1 person  
  
  
  
Skewered Plasma Blade.  
  
She rapidly fills the Bridal Blade with energy by vigorously spinning it.  
  
After doing that, she jumps and pierces. That enormous electric energy, is enough to inadvertently stun the other party.  
  
  
  
# Bridal Blade: Maiden’s Chastity (Lightning)  
  
  
  
* Rank: C  
* Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm  
* Range: 1  
* Maximum number of targets: 1 person  
  
  
  
Bridal Blade.  
  
A sword that has been evilly reformed by the two inventors.  
  
As a result of wishing to reduce the weight, the mace turned into a sword. Why.  
  
(Fundamentally not used as a Noble Phantasm in『FateGO』)  
  
  
  
# Character  
  
  
  
## Pronouns  
  
  
  
* First person pronoun: わたし (watashi)  
* Second person pronoun: あなた (anata) / おまえ (omae)  
* Third person pronoun: あのひと (ano hito)  
  
  
  
## Personality  
  
  
  
Completely defeated by the summer heat, she’s sluggish, bothered, and exhausted.  
  
A bit cooler with a swimsuit, at the same time she has the faint expectation of getting cooler by feeling the wind in the race.  
  
  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
  
  
Rolling while saying “hot”, she’s rather tempting.  
  
Because it’s become easier for her to talk since the rank of Mad Enhancement has been lowered, she’s a bit happy to be able to interact with the Master.  
  
That said, same as when she was a Berserker, a relation of『being able to understand each other through the eyes』is ideal.  
  
  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
  
  
『Uuuuhhh…………… Sluggish, tired, hot』  
  
  
  
『Papa?』  
  
  
  
『Simple』  
  
  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
  
  
Swimsuit Frankenstein, cute and looks like a large breed dog.  
  
  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
  
  
Since it’s summer, even the steadfast Fran is showing her Master a loose attitude.  
  
She occupies Master’s bed when at a hot place, rolling while lazily and tiredly basking on the air conditioned.  
  
Since she theoretically doesn’t have a trace of evil, seeing this Servant innocently wanting to occupy the bed makes you go 『Gnnn』.  
  
  
  
## Character concept:  
  
Swimsuit Fran-chan is cute!  
  
Cute!  
  
C-U-T-E!  
  
That’s all.  
  
  
  
Seriously speaking, Saber Fran who became bothersome because of the summer heat.  
  
But she tends to go berserk sometimes, hahaha you’re in trouble either way hahaha.  
  
The image is 『a large breed dog that is listless because of the summer heat』.  
  
  
  
## Normal armament:  
  
**Bridal Blade**  
  
  
  
『A bit heavy』A complex transformable energy blade that has been improved with evil remodels by two crazy inventors, upon hearing the laments of a young girl.  
  
Thunder energy makes it transform as the girl wishes depending on the situation. It’s a weapon packed with the romance of young boys, but it isn’t that exciting for Fran.  
  
Incidentally, the first victims apparently were the two that remodeled it as they wanted.  
  
  
  
## Related Characters  
  
  
  
**Charles Babbage**  
  
A gentle yet strict parental figure.  
  
Scolding her procrastination, he made sure she participated in the race. Nagging but she likes it.  
  
By the way, can you transform into something?  
  
Since it’s steam–.  
  
I see.  
  
  
  
**Archer of Shinjuku**  
  
A grandpa that is sweet with his grandchildren, simple. But, although he looks sweet he may be about to conspire some crime without being noticed, a rotten evil boss.  
  
  
  
**Other swimsuit Servants**  
  
Everyone’s exposure is amazing–.  
  
To get there, I think I’ll get tightly wrapped with bandages.  
  
  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
  
  
The motif for Frankenstein’s ear parts is screws, because she’s Frankenstein’s monster. At the beginning, I though of attaching them to the temples but I’m glad to give it up. The third stage having bandages was inevitable too because she’s Frankenstein’s monster, so it’s unavoidable that her final Ascension art has an ecchi feeling. (Okazaki Takashi)
