**Magical Resistance: [C]**

If they are simple Magecraft spells, Marie can nullify them.

**Riding: [A+]**

It is possible for Marie, the Royal Authority’s heaven-sent child who was gifted to the royalty from God, to freely handle all vehicles and beasts, including the white horse that is the symbol of the French Royal Family. Regarding the Dragon Kind however, they are not able to be mounted.

## Personal Skills

**The Grace of God: [B]**

Born to be a beautiful monarch, Marie is provided with the finest beauty and body.

**Beautiful Voice of Captivation: [C]**

A natural constitution of having a beautiful voice. It works as a magical Charm Effect towards males, but evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.

**Beautiful Princess: [A]**

A charismatic nature not for leadership, but to bring and attract to one the people in their surroundings.

For Marie, who possesses this Skill at Rank A, she can pull a knightly character to defend her just by simply existing as she is.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Guillotine Breaker: Glory to the Crown of Lilies
- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people

A Noble Phantasm that symbolized the glory of the French Royal Authority. An Anti-Army Noble Phantasm. Its exterior appearance is that of a beautiful horse composed of glass, which contains the French Royal Family’s coat of arms (the crest of the lily flower).

Marie can call forth this horse by its True Name Release, the horse running through the battlefield while gently scattering twinkling particles of sparkling light, causing damage to the antagonists of the Royal Authority. Simultaneously, it cancels out Bad Status Effects on allies and recovers their health and Magical Energy.

(The Noble Phantasm’s former name was Fleur-de-Lis.)

# Crystal Palace: Lovable Radiance for All Eternity
- Rank: B+
- Classification: Barrier Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0~100
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1000 people

A Barrier Noble Phantasm. An enormous palace – which boasts of elegance and represents the influence of the French Royal Family of successive generations – makes its appearance, temporarily ranking up Marie’s and her allies’ Parameters. Even though the Royal Authority had died out, the people and the France that she loved will remain for eternity – that is called Marie’s faith, which calls forth the Crystal Palace as a symbol of growth and a new age.

Having the same name as the “Crystal Palace” constructed for London’s Great Exhibition in neighbouring England is in no way an irony and the like, but rather, it seems to be something that shows how wide Marie’s love is. “Ooh, I love it! The Crystal Palace of London’s World Fair. So, it served as a reference during the occasion of my Noble Phantasm being arranged, but I wonder if something like this could be an issue…?”

## Personality

An image (idol) by birth. Soothing the people with a smile, gaining adoration with a gaze. Marie was born to be loved, and this is not a theory to her, but her actually feeling this as an instinct. Accepting the fact that she is an image, and finding joy in that, she set her heart on conducting herself as what was desired of her. That mentality is already not far off from some kind of goddess.

Marie never hates the people. As she was born for the sake of being loved, she therefore loves the people. If the people deem her to be unnecessary, and even if they shout at her, capture her, and kill her, she will show a smile to them even at the moment of her death. However, because her mentality as a Servant is fundamentally being stopped at “the moment she married Louis XVI, visited France as its Queen, and was blessed and loved by the many citizens”, she does not easily display her aspect as a tragic queen. (It is not the case that she has no memories after that moment. Nevertheless, the stage of her mentality and character is simply at “that time”.)

Upfront, and spontaneous, Marie will speak of anything she thought of. She will openly say the things she likes are what she likes, and the things she does not like so much are what she dislikes.

Marie likes baths. Awfully liking to keep herself clean is an influence from her mother, Maria Theresa. Because she says that “The light perfumes with a scent similar to flowers and herbs are pleasant”, the perfumes she uses are not that strong.

Marie is a spendthrift. She completely wastes money on one thing or another as she pleases without even understanding herself about this trait.

## Attitude Towards Master

As the bond with the Protagonist (Master) deepens, it will reach the point where Marie will display the aspect of her tragic side. It is very evident that she is “the very idol who continues to scatter love, yet whose scars remained imprinted on both her body and mind.” And yet, she still smiles beautifully. Never, will Marie desire for the erasure of the tragedy.

## Dialogue Examples

“Everyone, I love you all————Thank you, Vive la France!”

“For everyone who’s fond of me, please, I wish you all to be blessed with a wonderful grace!”

“Hey, let’s dance, let’s sing! This will be a delightful ball!”

“Boisterously like a flower, like the sunshine.”

“Brioche is delicious. Do you like it? What did you say?”

## Historical Character and Figure

A French Queen of the 18th Century whose genealogy corresponds to the House of Habsburg. The consort of Louis XVI. An ephemeral lady. Born between Maria Theresa, a descendant of the House of Habsburg – the great German royal house – and Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, a person originating from the House of Lorraine as its Duke, Marie Antoinette was born and raised as an existence that symbolizes “the rule of the nobility” of the European world, but in the violent torrents of human history where the absoluteness of the Royal Authority was continually being lost, she lost her life before the changes of the world.

Loved as a symbol of the Royal Authority, being blessed while living————
Detested as a symbol of the Royal Authority, shown contempt as she ended up dead.
The protruding eyes of the nobility, political marriage, living the royal court life, and then, revolution and execution. It is possible to say that that way of life and manner of death of Marie’s became the embodiment of the Royal Authority as an evident “idol”.

Although Marie became a target of hatred by many people before and after the Revolution, her impaired reputation has been restored in modern France; when famines came about, she would cut royal court expenses to make donations, she would personally request the nobles to provide support to the people, and so forth; thus, it is being confirmed that she was a woman who thought of the citizens.

There was a tragedy. But————
Marie will never wish on the Holy Grail for the erasure of the tragedy. She will only carry out her own role. In other words:
Radiance to the heavens. Blessings to the earth.
————Happiness… to the people.

## Concept

Marie’s concept is an “Idol Queen”. An idol who flew down to France of the 18th Century. Or… a glass angel (as a symbol and embodiment of a pure and fleeting thing, and not as a religious motif).

## Standard Weapons

Marie’s singing voice. While it is a voice that charms people, it is also a declaration of the exercise of power by the Royal Authority. For Marie, who materializes as a symbolic existence, she can conduct magic damage towards the antagonists of the Royal Authority with just a singing voice.

## Related Characters

**Amadeus**

Around the time when Marie was seven years old, there was a moment where, on the occasion of a six-year-old genius boy, who was invited to a palace in Vienna as a performing musician, falling down, she had extended her gentle hand to him. As a matter of fact, this genius boy would be later known as Amadeus Mozart, and he proposed marriage to the beautiful Marie (who at that time had the name Maria). The answer at that time was…

Even now where he became a Heroic Spirit, Marie recognizes that she “likes” the sincere and fun Amadeus. That is to say, this “like” has not changed in any way or form from when she felt it during that very youthful time.

**Charles-Henri Sanson**

The executioner who hoisted the guillotine for Marie. During her lifetime, Sanson was also the companion who raised his voice to her during her final moments. Just before her execution, it is said that Marie expressed her words of apology regarding the incident of her stepping on Sanson’s shoes.

**The Chevalier d’Éon**

Marie completely recognizes d’Éon as a “woman”. Furthermore, Marie deeply respects d’Éon as a person who devoted herself to secret missions and diplomacies while she was a woman. Marie had given a dress to d’Éon during their lifetimes. For Marie, she thinks about going out with d’Éon as a fellow friend and not as a master to a servant, but…

## Comment from the Illustrator

‘Given that she is an Idol Queen, shouldn’t her outfit also be stylish?‘ That is the direction it became. Since portraits of Marie Antoinette remain where her hair was in its best days and she wore a big hat, her hair has a substantial volume even though her head may appear in this way, but it’s HUGE whenever I look over it again, isn’t it?! Although I put in a motif of a white lily on some parts of her, the tips of Marie’s twintails are especially my favourite. (Ginka)
