## Class Skills

**Divine Core of the Goddess: [B]**

A Skill that expresses one being a perfected goddess since birth. It has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and body. It mitigates almost all mental interferences, prevents the body from growth, and prevents the figure from change no matter how many calories are absorbed. It is a composite Skill that comprises the Skill Divinity.

As Astraea is a Pseudo-Servant, it results in the Rank stopping at B.

**Independent Action: [A]**

The ability to remain independent for a while even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one’s Master.

As Astraea has Rank A in this, it is possible for her to maintain materialization in this world for a week even if she is without a Master.

**Territory Creation: [A]**

One can create a “Workshop”, which is an advantageous position for themselves as a mage.

Because Astraea possesses Rank A in this, it is possible to create a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.

## Personal Skills

**Protection of the Scales: [A+]**

A Skill that originates from the Authority of the Divine Spirit Astraea. A Skill where the Scales – which is the symbol of Astraea – dwell within her body, deploying an absolute defense against the targets that should be judged. However, due to the inclinations of the possessed human, it has been modified into a Skill that is oriented towards hand-to-hand combat. In other words, a pro wrestler cannot be toppled over.

**Magical Burst (Star): [A+]**

A Magical Burst Skill unique to Astraea, who is called a star maiden. It should be possible for her Magical Energy – which stems from the nature of the gods and the stars – to change its property, but perhaps due to the influence of the possessed girl, it is inclined to change into an extremely offensive-oriented property.

**Judgement of the Stars: [A]**

A Skill where as long as one has become a target of judgement, not to mention a human on earth, but even a Divine Spirit can receive judgement via the power of the stars.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Custos Morum: Now is the Time of Judgement; State Thy Name
- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Crime Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~100
- Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people

Custos Morum (The Guardian of Morals). A Noble Phantasm where the Scales – which is her primary Authority – are materialized, before it takes the targets that should be judged to the courtroom of the starry sky and then dropping stardust onto them with the amount of stardust dropped being dependent on their crimes. In contrast with Ishtar who shoots out the concept of Venus in a single blow with all her might, Astraea dumps the concept of the many stars that are spread out over the night sky without any restraint.

Furthermore, the meaning of Custos Morum is “The Guardian of Morals” in Latin, which was a popular name for the Star Chamber court that was once set up by the Tudor Dynasty of England. Astraea judges the targets with this court of the stars.

By the way, Astraea originally finishes her Noble Phantasm by exhaustively shooting magic bullets, but there is an alteration due to being fused with her human vessel where she adds a backdrop to finish them off.

# Iam Redit et Virgo: Let Order Be Returned Here
- Rank: EX
- Classification: Anti-Punishment Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~100
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1000 people

Iam Redit et Virgo (Now Justice Returns). Astraea’s Second Noble Phantasm. If her First Noble Phantasm is the Scales that carry out the measurement of one’s crime, then her Second Noble Phantasm is a Noble Phantasm related to the Sword that continuously carries out judgements.

There are many extreme conditions in that Astraea cannot invoke this without assembling all the people involved with the incident in question, the full story of the crime(s) committed is clearly laid out, and moreover, the location of gathering is close to the stars, but when those conditions are cleared, it has an extraordinary effect where it restores the original forms of everything that was distorted according to those crimes. Although enacting the collapse of providence, such as the restoration of the dead and time retrogression, is beyond its power, as long as the things being restored are within the limits of the Noble Phantasm, the strength and precision of the crimes would become irrelevant as it nullifies everything brought according to the outcomes of those crimes.

The Noble Phantasm’s name comes from one of Virgil’s Eclogue and from the American phrase ‘New order of the ages’. The golden age has finally come back, and order has returned here.

## Pronouns

## Personality

Astraea, the embodiment of justice, has chosen a worthy person for possession. A person who was born for the purpose of standing above others————If one was to approve of that sort of concept, then it must be her. An aristocrat among aristocrats who does not lose their integrity while appearing to be more of a mage than anyone else. A rare girl who selfishly exercises the power of Mystery, and hopes for the future of Mystery, while still not losing her dignity. Because of those, the girl accepts the Authority called Justice as her own duty while never using it recklessly as a privilege of hers.

… But aside from those sorts of virtues, the girl has a notable characteristic where if she discovers a rare or precious thing, she considers it a target that should preferentially be brought under her own protection. In other words, the most graceful (hyena) in the heavens.

Even if it is the Master’s personal belongings, the girl may protect (seize) it if it is something worthy to her. It seems that one should be careful if they must reveal a rare/precious article or technique before her very eyes.

## Attitude Towards Master

Of course, Astraea is also the embodiment of (human) justice, so she will not spare her efforts in her contributions to restore the Human Order. If it was an inexperienced Master, she would inspire them in that they still must lead the others. Simultaneously, coupled with the character of the possessed girl, she will be strict in pointing out the Master’s behaviour. If she feels the Master’s behaviour is indecent, it seems that she will not hesitate to break into her (extremely physical) guidance protocol (that includes giving them a dropkick).

## Dialogue Examples

“I have come in response to your summons. Here is the Judgement of the Scales, the Justice of the Stars. I am called Astraea, a fragment of everything that is eternally good. You who are my Master, are you ready to be measured?”

“Magic bullets in 1, 2, 3… and then, my backdrop and a falldown!”

“Then here… will I open the court of the stars.”

## Historical Character and Figure

Astraea’s origin is as one of the three Horae sisters in Greek Mythology. Although she is considered to be a daughter of Zeus and Themis, the descriptions of her in the field of mythology is scarce. There are legends where – as the gods started to leave one by one as it became the Iron Age, an age where immorality is running rampant – Astraea remained behind on the surface to appeal to everybody the virtue of justice until the very end. And after that, there were tales, although only few, where the Scales she carried became the constellation Libra, while she herself became the constellation Virgo.

In posterity however, Astraea, her mother Themis, and Iustitia of Roman Mythology – in which both Themis and Iustitia are regarded as one and the same as Astraea – were given another name and implication.

Namely, Lady Justice. The Goddess of Justice. If one were to find a statue of a goddess holding a sword and scales before a courthouse or a law office, that would be them.

## Character in FGO

Normal Catchphrase: “Do have your fill of the Justice of the Stars, the Judgement of the Scales.”
Catchphrase from her other side: “The Justice of the Stars! Namely, a backdrop!”

Astraea in Greek Mythology————Her aspect as the “Goddess of Justice” (Lady Justice) in Roman Mythology is stronger than her aspect as a daughter of Zeus and Themis. This aspect as Lady Justice originally had rigid features as part of her functions and inflexible disposition, but due to being influenced by the girl she possessed, she will now try to guide the people herself. It is also the same reason why – although she is a Servant who carries a sword and scales – she is excessively obsessive about hand-to-hand combat, tossing both her armaments away at a critical moment, for her justice is surely hand-to-hand combat (pro wrestling). Perhaps it is said to be a nuisance, or perhaps it is said to be an inevitability due to the girl she chose to possess, but that girl’s style matches with Astraea, who is tenacious and unparalleled as a Divine Spirit that possesses judgement functions, and she ended up becoming one of the best Servants in regard to pure hand-to-hand combat performance.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I am regretful as I wanted to draw Astraea more diligently, even if I had to draw without sleeping, as there were a large number of jobs with short-term deadlines being piled up over the schedule period I had originally planned for drawing her. (Azuma Toh)
