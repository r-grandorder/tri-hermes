## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [B+]**  
  
Nullifies all magecraft with less than 3 incantations.  
  
Receives almost no damage even from rituals and greater magecraft.  
  
After changing her Saint Graph to Saber, it seems some of her skills have also been upgraded.  
  
**Riding: [A]**  
  
Medb being Medb, there is almost nothing or no one she can't ride.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**If I Change Into My Swimsuit: [A+]**  
  
Her ability to enchant the masses or specific people.  
  
At A+ its power is tremendous.  
  
(Usually this would be a composite skill that includes Golden Rule (body), but in FGO its effect is a bit different)  
  
**Eau De Toilette - White Honey: [B]**  
  
Medb's voice and breath are endowed with a honey-like sweetness, which allows her to influence the target's stats just by existing.  
  
In the case of animals or humans without protection against magical power, she should be perfectly capable of bending them to her will.  
  
For example, it'd be easy for her to turn a small boy into a brave warrior comparable with a veteran. Conversely, she could also take a hardened warrior and turn them into a child.  
  
She can even freely mess with a Servant's stats if they don't have the means to resist.  
  
A skill similar but different to "Alcoholic Fruit ".  
  
When using this skill, she applies perfume to herself, so if one were to interrupt her, the skill could maybe be interrupted...But one must wonder how many people are out there who can actually stop Medb.  
  
**Discipline of the Queen (Sea): [A]**  
  
Medb's charisma as a queen has now reached the level of violence.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Fergus My Good-Looking Brave - My Dear Boyfriend's Rainbow Sword  
- Rank: B  
- Type: Anti-Unit  
- Range: 1~20  
- Maximum Targets: 1~10  
  
Fergus My Good-Looking Brave.  
  
Fergus was one of Medb's lovers during her life, and now she's taken his demonic sword Caladbolg to use as a weapon.  
  
It is possible to use it by casting its true name, but Medb's holding back this time. Even Medb, or rather, precisely because this is Medb, there is no way that she would ruin a beautiful resort by causing an earthquake.  
  
Nobody knows if her having this Noble Phantasm is due to her legend of being able to make any hero hers, or if she simply borrowed it from the Fergus in Chaldea.  
  
Its power obviously decreases compared to when Fergus uses it, but its flexibility and versatility have been upgraded in exchange.  
  
Whenever Medb cutely swings the sword, small rainbows become visible.  
  
# One-shot My Love - My Dear Romantic Rendezvous  
- Rank: A+  
- Type: Anti-Unit  
- Range; 1~40  
- Maximum Targets: 1  
  
One-shot My Love.  
  
A one-time summer romance. A one-time commemorative photo (one-shot).  
  
The normal Medb possesses the special attribute of having the Noble Phantasm of every hero who fell for her, but having changed her saint graph with a swimsuit, she also gained a new Noble Phantasm.  
  
In other words, this is a fearsome anti-unit sure-kill Noble Phantasm that utilizes one of Medb's greatest weapons, her 'beauty'.  
  
Medb will be walking while humming, and by simply giving her target a 'Well, hello there', they will inevitably fall for her and be trapped in a summer love. It is inevitable.  
  
The target will then have no choice but to fall exhausted into the summer sky after being toyed with by her.  
  
Whoever gets targeted by this Noble Phantasm should feel proud of themselves.  
  
After all, only the few chosen good-looking braves, or rather, good-looking slaves are the ones who get approached by Medb.  
  
This is a Noble Phantasm that works by using her charm, but surprisingly it doesn't apply a continuous charm effect.  
  
'Well, that's what summer romances are like, right?', is what Medb herself says.  
  
# Character  
  
## Personality  
  
She's the same as always.  
  
Pure and clean. The seductive and vicious Queen Medb.  
  
The beautiful flower that blooms at the center of the universe.  
  
Or rather, the grand flower with seeks to engulf the whole world with her blooming beauty.  
  
In addition, she's now something similar to a gravure idol. She's aware of her nature as someone who draws other people in.  
  
Since Medb is well aware of the power and value of her own body, it was only a matter of time before she settled into modern times and became a glamorous Servant.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Same as always.  
  
She will not give them special treatment. She simply treats them as any another fan or photographer worshipping her.  
  
There are rumors that she'll allow you to conduct a private photo session if you get her to say something like 'looks like you're quite the good-looking brave yourself', so please do your best.  
  
## Miscellaneous  
  
It seems she's gotten really into making her own albums.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Cu Chulainn:**   
  
I'm already loved and worshipped by so many people, so I don't want you, ok?  
  
(Or so she wants to say, but can't. She really loves Cu. If he still won't look at her, then there's no choice but to resort to brainwashing. Or so she had decided, but when she finally meets Cu she just wishes he'd tell her something like 'that saint graph's not bad'.)  
  
**Fergus:**   
  
T-h-a-n-k-s❤  
  
Let me borrow your wonderful sword for a bit, ok?  
  
I could change my own Saint Graph if I wanted, but hey, a Saber's gotta have a sword, right?  
  
Yeah! Now I'm a Saber too!  
  
I'll go beat up Cu!  
  
**Scathach:**   
  
I finally got a swimsuit!  
  
Now I can have a summer battle on even footing with that woman.  
  
...Or so I thought but she didn't say anything and just gave me a grin. What's her deal!?  
  
Scathach-Skadi:  
  
She has her same face, so how is she so different...  
  
And how come she interests me so much?  
  
Hmmm...  
  
Well for now, let's just go to the beach together!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
  
I can't help but be concerned about her status as widow.  
  
It doesn't seem like she's simply being faithful, but, that girl is like...  
  
...I guess I have no choice but to confirm it myself.  
  
**Any male Servant she likes:**   
  
I think that would feel different when I'm a Saber, compared to when I was a Rider.  
  
So now I have to confirm ❤.  
  
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
  
I hate men who won't obey me.  
  
He won't stop talking proudly about his wife either, what's with him!?  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
I was instructed to make Caladbolg into a weapon that could change and turn into a whip, then I also got some really extreme Medb-like suggestions from Takeuchi, and well after I kept stacking things on her the design was obviously rejected (lmao). As for Medb's swimsuit, her first one's the only one suited for swimming comfortably, her second stage is for beachside photoshoots, and her third stage is for indoor studios. Her cute little penguin friend becomes about as big as a polar bear on her final ascencion, and he's super soft to the touch too! (Takayama Kisai).
