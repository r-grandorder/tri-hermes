## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Half-Dead Bloodaxe: The Blood-Slurping Bestial Axe  
  
- Rank: C  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~2  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
The dark red axe Eric usually brings alongside him. Something that was processed with the Mystical Beast that he once defeated and made into an axe. Surprisingly, it seems that this Mystical Beast that was made into this axe is still “living”, and it has been surviving by continuing to sip on blood, seeking blood as nourishment. If it is not given blood within a fixed time, it would starve and completely die. If that is the case, its power as a weapon would become a mere shadow of its former self, so periodic supplies of blood are needed.  
  
# Bloodbath Crown: Bloodstained Coronation  
  
- Rank: B  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel (Self) Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 0  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
It is Eric’s Madness Enhancement doping that was caused by Gunnhild, a Black Mage. Eric charges into the enemies and minces them without even caring about the likes of the damage being caused by himself. Of course, he also gets injured by the damage caused by himself in its own way. The realization of the anecdote where he slain altogether his own close relatives and made his self-introduction as the Norwegian King. Although it is not an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it is a Noble Phantasm suitable for fighting multiple opponents. However, even the damage he accumulated on the occasion of his return from the bloodbath will be just as severe. It would probably be better for him to refrain from using this Noble Phantasm if he does not have the means to recover as he is now.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
- First Person Pronouns: ore / watashi  
- Second Person Pronoun: omae  
- Third Person Pronouns: aitsu / yatsu  
  
## Personality  
  
The distinction between friend and foe is barely being established, and some intelligence exists, but that is just all there is. Towards the enemies in addition, Eric hastily charges at them. However, there are extremely rare situations where he regains his sanity. Sometime during that period, it becomes possible to even converse with him according to an intermediation done through Gunnhild.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Eric has absolutely no cunning intentions and the like. He is something like a beast of prey, just only trying to slaughter his enemies. He also has particularly no pickiness regarding whoever his Master is, coming to a clean decision about that matter. However, it is different with his wife Gunnhild. She will come to address the Master through Eric when her husband is summoned, utilizing some kind of method to do so. Gunnhild always transmits a complaint about how she is not tolerant of the fact that Eric was summoned just to be used, not to mention that it is an insult that he was summoned as a Berserker, and so forth. A monster wife so to speak.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“GR, GRRRr, GRRRRRRRRRRR!”  
  
“… I am just now manipulating these words by getting help from my wife. Stop the destruction of the world. If it is for that objective————gr, ngh. NOISE, gr,”  
  
“… Okay, there is a chance again. In short, what I want to say is this: I am thankful that you summoned me and are making use of me. End of transmission. Sorry, Gunnhild.”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Eric the Bloodaxe King. He is a king who ruled over Norway around the 10th Century. However, he only reigned over a period that did not even fulfill three years, and after that reign, he escaped to England and was installed as a mere feudal lord of a rural area.  
  
Nevertheless, Eric slaughtered his many brothers for the Norwegian throne during those three years. Even though his nickname, the Bloodaxe King, has no elegance, and even if his brothers shared the same blood, his tyranny would not come to a stop. And in the shadows, it is said that the one operating behind those scenes was the “Witch” Gunnhild, who married Eric. Gunnhild was a staunch female mage, but at the same time, she appears to have deeply loved her husband Eric, and after Eric’s death, Gunnhild composed poetry on behalf of giving praise to him. According to those, Eric is the Sixth King on the throne who came after Sigmund, the Hero of Scandinavia, and it is said that he was welcomed as a great warrior by the Great God Odin… Well, that love for Eric continues even now whenever Eric is summoned, a complaint from Gunnhild suddenly being delivered to the summoner through a curse technique and out of nowhere.

Eric does not have any (because Gunnhild is scary).  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
At the time when I became responsible for Eric, I thought, “But I had hardly drawn any male characters at all until this person…”, and I was fairly flustered deep down inside. It seems they said he smacks of a man… so I searched for images… and decided on giving him a happy trail! His evolution differences would be better if I had made some bigger changes. He always proves to be a reliable help by going around in EXP quests. BAMBAMBAMBAMBAMM!! (Aotsuki Takao)
