**Mash:** 

We successfully rayshifted!

A desert landscape… Hot winds are blowing. Please be careful from exhausting yourself.

...Large number of hostile signals detected in our frontal direction!

From outward appearance it seems like they’re only knights in heavy armor.

But the magical signal indicates that they’re clearly abnormal!

Retreating seems impossible. Preparing to engage the enemies, Master, your command!

For now let’s prioritize securing our own safety!

## Node 1 - Loading (excerpt)

”Baptism of the Sand”

Violent gusts of wind assult the body.

Lung breathes in what seems to be pure heat more than fresh air.

The seventh rayshift.

Master and Mashu arrived at the newest singularity in A.D. 1273

What lies waiting for them was a vast desert that shouldn’t exist.

Scorching sun and violent wind.

What creeps in towards them, in the land of Middle East that turned into a desert, was a group of ”knights” clad in steel.

At that moment, when the battle was about to start…

”Well then, shall we start, everyone?”

The voice was from someone whose voice they’ve gotten used to.

**???:** 

...Stop right there!

**Mash:** 

!

An unknown rampaging buggy car, could it be!?

**Da Vinci:** 

Of course it’s me!

**Mash:** 

Da Vinci chan!?

**Da Vinci:** 

Whew, I barely made it in time~!

Sorry for my sudden interrupt but I’ll be accompanying you two on this rayshift!

**Mash:** 

That’s great to hear! Ah… But…

Shouldn’t you be in charge of the command center?

**Da Vinci:** 

Well, it’s because this strange inconsistency I’ve been observing…

...it has already grown too large to ignore anymore.

Seven singularities that emerged among the Panhuman History.

Those are both known and unknown road, has been acting as a compass for us…

However it seems that the situation has turned increasingly suspicious.

TRISMEGISTUS also produced the following result:

”This operation is simultaneously a known and an unknown. This trip for the restoration is both an ’enrollment*1’ and a ’revision’”

**Mash:** 

???, What is that supposed to mea...?

**Da Vinci:** 

I have absolutely no idea either. That’s why I’m here to experience it firsthand.

Well, but first we must prioritize retrieving the grail. Let’s hurry up to Jerusalem, both of you!

**Mash:** 

Erm… I am still quite a bit confused but…

It really feels safe if we can rely on you, isn’t it, master?

**Da Vinci:** 

That’s right that’s right. Rely on me as much as you need!

I’ll prove it to you two that even in combat my usefulness doesn’t diminish. There are also somethings that I am enable to precisely because I’m a Caster.

First, let’s take down those knights in front of us!

Well then, let’s go, everyone!

**Mash:** 

Yes… I leave the commanding to you, master!



## Node 1 - Post-Battle dialogues

**Mash:** 

It’s over. Thank you for your hard work, master.

**Da Vinci:** 

Let’s recap what we need to do here again: We have to fix this singularity no matter what.

And the Holy Grail is an absolute condition for that. Retrieval of the grail shall be prioritized over anything else, are we good on that?

**Mash:** 

Yes.

**Da Vinci:** 

And… About the whereabout of the grail, I’ve already located it.

It’s the holy ground Jerusalem. SHEBA detected an enormous magical reading there.

Well, to be honest, while it’s true that Jerusalem is the most important location on this era…

I can’t help but feel somewhat lackluster. Why couldn’t the grail be at some place like an Egyptian temple in a middle of a desert or something?

**Mash:** 

I understand that you love adventures, Da Vinci-chan, but there’s absolutely no temple around here…

**Da Vinci:** 

That’s right… Why did I have an idea like that in the first place…?

Well, since we’ve already made out objective clear, let’s head straight to Jersualem!

**Mash:** 

To the east, right?

**Da Vinci:** 

You two don’t have to worry about transportation: Leave it to the ”Unit Sphinx” right here!

**Mash:** 

Unit, Sphinx…?

Oh, you mean that buggy car?

**Da Vinci:** 

That’s right!

I planted my mana absorption device at its core. So it’s basically an improved version ornithopter.

And its name is ”Unit Sphinx”!

Ride on in, both of you, LET’S GO!

**Mash:** 

Whoa!

Da Vinci-chan, what’s wrong? Why did you suddenly break?

**Da Vinci:** 

Both of you, look, our surrounding…

**Mash:** 

Y-Yes

It seems that there’re some buildings around us…

W-Wait!

I mistook them for buildings but they’re actually gravestones! Every single one of them!

**???:** 

It’s a graveyard. A graveyard.

The road to Jerusalem is scattered with these gravestones.

I’m used to seeing inhumane acts, but what kind of monsters properly built a gravestone for his victims?

**??? 2:** 

…Assassin

Talking is unnecessary. If there are servants’ magical reading from them…

**???:** 

Then it means that they might be the culprits, right?

You see, I was summoned yet have no master. Plus the thing I was before I died was a killer.

So I don’t have any intention to lecture you guys on morals but…

At least let me offer you my prayers. So please go straight down to the hell, you monsters!

**Mash:** 

!?

W-Wait! We don’t have any connection with these slaughte-!

**??? 2:** 

…

…

**Da Vinci:** 

Whoops, so it seems that they have no intention to listen. Here they come!

To The East

Scouring through the desert, the group keeps running. As Mash and master are trying to hold on while the buggy keeps accelerating, a sudden realization strikes them.

...It’s a road.

The road on a desert. This is not an animal road. It’s man-made.

Was there anything like this on the thirteenth century?

Plus, what’s the meaning of these gravestones surrounding them?



While they’re still bewildered, two heroic spirits approach them. One is a samurai leaking out dangerous air.

The other is a woman who has a cover as if to seal away her eyes…

## Node 2 - Pre-Battle dialogues 1

**Mash:** 

Commencing battle, master!

**Assassin?:** 

Come!

## Node 2 - Pre-Battle dialogues 2

**Assassin?:** 

Hey, Rider, are these things your familiars?

**Rider?:** 

Yes, but… They won’t hold on much longer if this continues.

## Node 2 - Pre-Battle dialogues 3

**Assassin?:** 

...To be expected from monsters who built these graves!

I will be your opponent! Izou the manslayer!

**Izou:** 

Medusa! I leave the supporting to you!

**Medusa:** 

Ha… Carelessly blurting out true names like that… Well, anyway, leave the supporting to me.

**Izou:** 

Hahahahaha! That’s the spirit!

**Mash:** 

Two hostile servants approaching! Prepare to engage!

## Node 2 - Post-Battle dialogues

**Izou:** 

What…?

Aren’t you guys the monsters who built these graves?

But you guys are emitting servants’ magical signals.

If you’re not the culprits, then who is?

**Mash:** 

I still can’t the exact details…but it should be the one who utilized the holy grail to create this singularity.

Handiwork of the opposing force that aims to destroy the human foundation, the ”Demon God Pillar”*2

**Medusa:** 

...Demon God Pillars… From King Solomon’s 72 Summoning Rituals?

So do you mean that the old Israeli king Solomon is the one who created the singularities?

**Da Vinci:** 

Hm? Why did you think that it must be Solomon? *3

Oh… Wait… I see. So that’s what it seems to you if thinking normally. The ”demon god” and ”pillar”.

Anyway, even if those aren’t demons… They are not some magic rituals invented for humanity’s sake either.

They are clearly a kind of living organism.

They’re called ”Demon God Pillar” merely because, to us, they look like a pillar.

…Wait. So who exactly decided to call them ”Demon God Pillar” in the first place…?

**Izou:** 

You guys sure speaks confusing stuffs huh…?

Well, anyway, so basically 1. You guys are proper heroic spirits. 2. The master there is a good person.

And 3. You have a way to do something to this, singularity?, thing, right?

**Mash:** 

Yes, if we manage to retrieve the holy grail, this singularity will no longer be able to maintain itself and the proper history will be restored eventually.

And we have also pinpointed the whereabout of the grail, it’s the holy ground Jerusalem.

That’s why…

**Da Vinci:** 

Whoever residing in Jerusalem must be the one who caused this desert to emerge in the first place. Not only that, but also the road, and the large amount of gravestones.

This desert, this road, and these gravestone, they obviously did not exist in the proper history.

Details on these graves also have a strange feeling on them…

**Medusa:** 

…

…

So it means that we had a misconception about one thing…

It’s not ”The culprit killed people walking on this road and built these graves”

...But rather…

”The culprit was killing these people WHILE ALSO building these graves AND the road”

**Izou:** 

Is that so?

**Medusa:** 

It makes sense.

**Izou:** 

Hmm.

Well, then, what’s Jerusalem?

**Medusa:** 

I heard that it’s the place called the Holy Land. The end of ”The Road of Pilgrimage Expedition”.

It’s currently called ”Lost Jerusalem”.

**Mash:** 

...Lost Jerusalem…

**Da Vinci:** 

The ”lost holy land” huh… It intrigues me what exactly was lost then…?

## Node 3 - Pre-Loading dialogues

**Mash:** 

So that’s the capital of faith, Lost Jersualem…

A large number of people are assembling before a gigantic gate…

**Medusa:** 

It seems that they are refugees. Quite a lot of them.

**Da Vinci:** 

Wait. Let’s stop the Unit Sphinx.

This sensation… Something is coming. Be careful.

**Izou:** 

Look, the gate.

**Medusa:** 

It’s open. People are coming out from the city, but that’s…

**Mash:** 

!

They’re knights of pilgrimage expedition! Master!

**Izou:** 

That’s not the only thing.

There’s also clearly a servant cladding in that bright red armor!

**Mash:** 

… !

**Guardian Knight:** 

Everyone…

The age of human is going to perish. And this small world is not an exception.

The Lord has issued his verdict. No place on the earth would be left for men.

Yes, no place except this city of faith, Lost Jerusalem…

Nothing except here will be left…

But everyone, you don’t need to worry.

Our king has voiced his desire to accept everyone, regardless of race or religion.

… But before that, we need you to discard one unnecessary thing…

**Mash:** 

(...Unnecessary thing?)

**Izou:** 

(What the hell is that knight in red blabbing about!)

**Medusa:** 

(Shh, Izou. Shut. Up.)

**Izou:** 

(Murmur)

**Guardian Knight:** 

The unnecessary thing, that is…

**???:** 

That is ”Your Body”

Everyone. Please forgive me.

I want to save everybody.

I want to accept everyone, but that’s not possible.

Your body is your life. You can even say that your body is your entire being.

But, let’s discard it.

The city of faith has limited resources, it cannot possibly sustain every human with their physical bodies intact.

That’s why…

… My city of faith will accept everyone, only your souls…

Go, Knight of Protection, Georgios, and the ones who know my soul, the pilgrimage knights!

Bring the lost souls here… And cut down their unnecessary body right now, everyone of them!

**Refugee:** 

Eh… No… This is not real, right? Wait, why they are raising their swords!?

Stop… Stop, stop, please stop! Please! Don’t kill us please!

**Mash:** 

!

The knights, they’re trying to…!

**Izou:** 

YOU MONSTERS! How dare you to raise your blades against women and children!?

**Medusa:** 

Izou! Wait!

**Da Vinci:** 

Those refugees can’t escape. They’re completely surrounded. That king intends to do this from the very start!

But if it’s only us we can escape. Do you get it, master?

… What?

”We’re going to create and opening for them”, you say?

**Mash:** 

Yes! Anywhere is fine. We need to break through a point in their formation!

Master, lend me your magical power! I’ll definitely not lose!

**Da Vinci:** 

…Ha, so it can’t be helped!

Even if we can’t save a thousand maybe we can save a hundred! We’ll collapse those knights’ formation!

Wailing wall

The group who gained new allies continues to march through the desert, on the road of pilgrimage, and they reached its end.

The desert that violently denies every living being's survival. Standing in a middle of this desert is the city of faith, the sole habitable location.

Lost Jerusalem.

The gate that was closely shut was opened.

After the declaration of the strongest gatekeeper, the "Knight of Protection", The ruler of the city shows himself before his refugees...

## Node 3 - Pre-Battle 1

**Izou:** 

You monsters! I’ll cut you down!

**Medusa:** 

Don’t rush in! Stay calm, Izou!

**Izou:** 

How on earth can I possibly stay calm!?

## Node 3 - Pre-Battle 2

**Refugee:** 

Everyone---! Come here---! There’s an escape route----!

**Mash:** 

Yes…! Even if it’s small, we finally managed to create an opening!

**Knight of the Expedition:** 

&mdash;

**Izou:** 

Fallen knights are disappearing…! What does this mean…?

**Da Vinci:** 

After observing the city of faith I’ve gotten an idea: These knights are a kind of living weapons.

They’re made from pouring magical energies into the emptied husks of humans. They are imitation heroic spirits.

Although they resemble necromancy, the thought process and method are totally different.

… Anyway, it’s a matter of fact that this is quite a sinful method!

## Node 3 - Pre-Battle 3

**Da Vinci:** 

Don’t pursue too deep! If we get closer to the gate more than this we won’t be able to retreat!

**Georgios:** 

That plan won’t come to fuition. All of you are going to die here.

**Mash:** 

!

**Georgios:** 

The sin of disrupting the order of the city’s gate must be repented with death. The Knight of Protection Georgios is going to deliver the judgement onto you.

**Mash:** 

Saint George! One of the very few true saints, the dragon-slaying hero!

You’re the one who’s supposed to be protecting humanity! Yet why are you doing something like this…!

**Georgios:** 

I accept your claim of my atrocities, young lady. But to protect humanity, I’ll defend that person.

**Mash:** 

Are you going to say that THIS is for humanity’s sake!?

**Georgios:** 

This singularity will eventually perish. No. ”This time for real” the human history will perish. *3

”If that’s the case then even if resorting to atrocities is needed in order to oppose that fate” –I can’t deny that person’s will

For since I too, am a person who wields my blade as a saint. *4

**Mash:** 

…. !

**Georgios:** 

It’s a pity, young lady with a brave spirit. If it’s not a meeting in this kind of situations, maybe we can…

**Da Vinci:** 

The magical signals is expanding! He’s coming!

**Georgios:** 

Thou art a dragon, a sinful beast!

## Node 3 – Post-Battle

**Mash:** 

Magical signal, disappearing! The enemy servant has been slain!

**Da Vinci:** 

Now this is the time to retreat! Hurry up you two! Also Izou and Medusa!

**Izou:** 

Tch, I still haven’t cut enough. Wanna deliver more of those divine retributions…

**Medusa:** 

Well, saying that while having his face looks like a dead man won’t be so convincing…

Let’s go Izou. We’re small roles so act like one.

**Izou:** 

It’s as you said! You’re sure pretty considerate for a tall woman, aren’t you?

I have zero intention to dive into the enemy’s rank so I will be remaining here.

Leave the rear guard to me, you guys just run!

**Da Vinci:** 

Find an opening and turn into your spirit form and come after us! Go on the buggy, everyone!

## Node 4 – Pre-Loading

**Mash:** 

The enemies have stopped pursuing.

Izou’s signal didn’t vanish either, so it’s likely that he made it out alive!

**Da Vinci:** 

That’s good to hear. As expect from the assassin from the Bakumatsu period.

**Medusa:** 

Well, this is quite a feat for Izou. So please compliment him or something if we manage to reunite with him.

**Izou:** 

Whew~ That’s was soo tiring! Hey I’m so thirsty right now, where’s my water!?

**Mash:** 

Izou-san!? D-Did you just run all the way here to catch up?

**Medusa:** 

…. (Currently speechless)

**Izou:** 

Hmm? Well, there was a piece of cloth suddenly appeared in front of me and blasted me away.

”I am the one who rules over the sky. This feat is nothing more than child’s play”

And then it said something like that! Hahahahaha, seriously, what’s wrong with this country!?

Anyway, Medusa, didn’t you just said something about me?

**Medusa:** 

I didn’t.

Anyway, since we’ve been fighting just until now, master must sure have felt exhausted.

**Da Vinci:** 

Yeah, I hope that we can find a place to rest…

But we are also accompanied by a few dozen of refugees, I can’t speed up Unit Sphinx more than this.

It would be nice if we can find a safe place so that we can finally allow them to rest…

…

…

**Izou:** 

Hm!? Killing intent!

**Mash:** 

!

Master!

“The Assassin”



The saint, perished. 

The group's fight against the knight of protection was finally over. 

However they are also greatly exhausted as a result.

Temporary retreat. 

As they are retreating from the relentless pursuit of pilgrimage knights while carrying a group of refugees.

Suddenly a creepy shadow was casted on the sand's surface.

"Master !" 

Mashu's scream rings through the desert

## Node 4 - Pre-Battle 1

**Da Vinci:** 

That was dangerous! If it wasn’t for Mash’s quick blocking he would’ve been stabbed!

**Izou:** 

What was that? Who threw these flying daggers!?

**Da Vinci:** 

Short daggers, thrown like bullets, if even I couldn’t detect their presence then that must’ve been…

**Medusa:** 

An assassin class servant, right?

**???:** 

…Splendid.

Dodging my daggers like that, so you’re really not ordinary folks.

So the news that you just saved our brethren from the recent scuffle is also true.

**??? 2:** 

Well, about testing their capabilities, are you satisfied? Shall we stop now?

**???:** 

No. At very least if they’re someone who lose to me then they won’t have any hope against that city’s king.

**??? 2:** 

That’s also true. Well to be honest I don’t like these violent methods though.

But now isn’t the time to be picky about that right? Understood.

**Mash:** 

… Two hostile servants magical signals, amplifying. There are also other enemies signals detected.

They don’t seem to be that eager to fight us though. However it also seems they’re not planning to let us leave either.

**Izou:** 

I’ll cut you down!

**Medusa:** 

Aah, Izou! Not again!

**Mash:** 

I will go too! Master!

## Node 4 - Pre-Battle 2

**Izou:** 

Tch! I’m getting sick of these small fries!

**Mash:** 

There are more! Maintaining combat stance, master!

**Medusa:** 

Let’s go Izou, first you go and check their moves.

**Izou:** 

Hahahahahaha! Medusa, you sure love using people rough, huh?

## Node 4 - Pre-Battle 3

**???:** 

So they really made it this far, as expected…

**Mash:** 

….

…

**???:** 

Come, ready yourself. This is not an assassination, it’s a war.

Finish me off first if you don’t want to die!

**Mash:** 

Servant, assassin, has entered his battle stance! Master!

!

Understood, I’ll hold back!

I’ll leave the commanding to you!

## Node 4 – Post-Battle

**???:** 

Guha! What a splendid attack!

**Mash:** 

Assassin, unable to continue fighting! I’ve gotten quite a clean hit on him so he won’t be able to move for awhile.

**???:** 

For this Cursed Arm to be conrnered this much, so you’re a renowned warrior!?

**Mash:** 

N-No, actually I’m not a knight…

**???:** 

M-Mu…

**??? 2:** 

Are you satisfied now, Cursed Arm? You should’ve seen aplenty of their capabilities already.

**Cursed Arm:** 

Miss Mata Hari. Ah… U… Um, as you said.

**Mata Hari:** 

Annnd that’s it! I’m truly sorry for everything earlier!

We’re stay servants who’s been protecting a village nearby.

After we were summoned we tried to fight that king once but…

**Cursed Arm:** 

He’s strong.

He cuts down anyone who stands in his way.

He created this road full of graves while he marched towards the holy land.

After he reached it he became its king and renamed it to ”Lost Jerusalem”

**Da Vinci:** 

Do you know his true name?

**Cursed Arm:** 

I don’t know. My comrades who tried to do that fell to his blade.

We don’t have enough power! The power to defeat that vile man!

That’s why I want to beg you, please lend us your po—

No, since I saw that you have the same objectives as us, we’ll entrust all of our power to you.

**Izou:** 

So you’re going to become our comrades?

**Mata Hari:** 

Yes! If you don’t mind.

**Mash:** 

Nice! You’re ok too right, senpai?

**Mata Hari:** 

Alliance formed! Let’s work hard together!

**Da Vinci:** 

More manpower, nice! We can also leave these refugees in the care of your village!

## Node 5 – Pre-Loading

**Mash:** 

An existence that even the king of Jerusalem can’t make a move on…

Are you going to tell me that there’s someone like that!?

**Cursed Arm:** 

Yes, he does exist.

But we can’t be sure if he’s our ally or not. I heard that if you enter his area without permission, the wrath of hot sand will surely strike you down.

**Da Vinci:** 

Does he have strong phantasmal species as his allies or something? While it’s sure troublesome, there’s nothing better than having him as an ally!

**Izou:** 

So, are we going?

**Medusa:** 

I’ll leave the decision making to Chaldea.

**Mash:** 

Thank you. Senpai, shall we…

… !

Understood! First, let’s try to meet him!

"God King Ozymandias"

A strong force that even the city of faith can't make a move on.

After the group leave their refugees into the village's care, they head south seeking out for more allies. 

Through scorching sand and deadly sandstorm. After a rough trip, they reach their destination.

A giant building shines in brilliance. 

The temple exerts its own unique pressure, signifying its rulership of the area.

Its true form is, a fortress built by a revered king from the ancient...

## Node 5 - Pre-Battle 1

**???:** 

Stop right there.

No one will be allowed to go past this point. This is the land that the Sun King reigns over.

I won’t do anything bad to you. Please turn back and return to where you came from.

**Mash:** 

A cloth! A piece of cloth is talking, master!

**Izou:** 

You are! The cloth person of that time!

You sure are an interesting fellow aren’t you? Hahahahaha!

**Cloth person:** 

Insolence… Such insolence… But… Strangely I don’t feel bad about it. While it’s sure troublesome, there’s nothing better than having him as an ally!

The laugh earlier was not from looking down, but rather a true laugh of joy.

If so, I shall forgive. But to clarify, I’m not a ”cloth person”.

I’m --

**Cursed Arm:** 

The protector of this place, and the representative of its true ruler.

While you’re a divine spirit of a foreign land, that form of you who protects those without power befits that of a true king!

She’s the true savior of the desert! The cloth person who appeared out of nowhere!

**Medjed:** 

It’s Medjed. M E D J E D. The one who crushes, the god Medjed.

**Mash:** 

I-Is that so? Sorry for our rudeness…

**Da Vinci:** 

Hmm… If you say Medjed then it’s certain that you’re a powerful Egyptian divine spirit!

But wait, what kind of god Medjed is in the first place? He doesn’t seem to have played any significant role…

But it’s still true that this is certainly a powerful divine spirit. Are you saying that the sun king has someone like this under his command?

**Mata Hari:** 

Miss representative. I want you to lend us your help.

**Medjed:** 

Hm? Not only foreign visitors, but you two again?

Turn back. The sun king won’t be meeting any of you.

A peculiar fate…

No… It’s that repulsive curse that causes the king to be summoned into that place…

Up until now, he’s been enduring against this insurmountable pain. Now that you know: Kneel and let out your tears of gratitude towards his generosity.

And turn back to where you came from. Understood?

**Mash:** 

Please wait!

We’re currently fighting, in order to reclaim our home…

If the panhuman history is incinerated, we won’t have any place left to return to!

But! If we can restore the human order from every singularity!

**Medjed:** 

….

**Da Vinci:** 

On the other hand, if we don’t manage to fix all singularities, Mash and master will lose their place to call home.

**Medjed:** 

Incinerated panhuman history… I see, so you guys, too, are… *5

**Mash:** 

?

**Medjed:** 

No… Let me admit, that you all are also the people who chose to struggle.

If it’s you all, you might be able to finally put the king to rest…

….

….

I hereby ask you all with shame, will you lend me your aid?

If you do, I swear that I will become your power after you finished my request.

**Mash:** 

What do you mean by tha--

**Medjed:** 

Please, take him down. Please take down the sun king Ozymandias!

**Mash:** 

!

**Izou:** 

Hm? Isn’t this ”Ozymandias” guy your master?

What did you mean earlier? Are you implying there are two Ozymandias or something?

**Medusa:** 

No, she probably simply asked us to defeat the sun king.

**Izou:** 

… A traitor!?

**Medjed:** 

I’m fine with you branding me with that title, but I can no longer bear seeing him suffer in anguish.

That’s why… !

**Cursed Arm:** 

(I can feel it! Inside her heart there lies an unwavering loyalty!)

**Mash:** 

The next wave of enemies is coming!

**Da Vinci:** 

Pharaoh Ozymandias, to think that he’s so powerful to the extent that he can summon spirits of flame while in his sleep!

**Cursed Arm:** 

We’ll make the road for you!

**Mata Hari:** 

We’re not suitable for fighting such a strong opponent, so we’re going to hold these things back for you!

**Izou:** 

Uwoooooo! Flame are sure difficult to cut!

**Medusa:** 

Izou, don’t rush in head first. Good boy, good boy.

**Izou:** 

I don’t feel so good about what you just called me by…

Who’s there…

Who… Called… me… ?

Nefertari… ?

**Medjed:** 

Ozymandias-sama! Ah… ! To see you in such a painful state…

**Ozymandias:** 

Don’t wail, Nitocris. I’m a pharaoh, and a pharaoh is absolute.

But…

Being a servant sure is troublesome. How annoying. Even a simple thing like maintaining my own ego isn’t possible.

Not just once, but twice, that I fell, becoming a beast’s slave. How irony.

Hmph. Such a cruel joke!

As I am like now, I can face neither that holy sword wielder not that hero. You know what to do, right? -- Nitocris!

**Medjed:** 

Y-Yes! Ozymandias-sama!

**Ozymandias:** 

LISTEN! Another Chaldea who’ve come from far away! I’m the king of kings, Ozymandias!

If you manage to strike me down splendidly, I shall you with my heavenly light!

**Mash:**

**Da Vinci:** 

Everyone it seems that we’ve another foe to defeat!

**Mash:** 

Yes! Enemy servant incoming, master!

## Node 5 – Post-Battle

**Medjed:** 

Ozymandias-sama!

**Mash:** 

The spirit origin has vanished! God king Ozymandias has been slain!

We did it, master!

**Cursed Arm:** 

We somehow managed it, although everyone is already battered…

**Mata Hari:** 

Thanks for your hard work. By the way Hassan… Are your spiritual core… Still OK…?

**Izou:** 

Ha… Ha… Ha… I still live!

What a monster! How on earth are you supposed to cross blades with him!?

**Medusa:** 

Are you complaining, Izou? You sounded weaker than your usual howling.

**Izou:** 

Who did you say howling!? That’s something only a loser does!

**Da Vinci:** 

… Sun king, the god king Ozymandias.

Just why? Why he who doesn’t have a grail possess such tremendous power servants aren’t meant to have?

What’s the meaning of this?

Did he have a possession of one in the past? Or did he acquire another magical resource that rivals the grail when he was summoned?

I’ve always assumed that the king of Jerusalem was the one who has the possession of the holy grail…

Wait, that assumption can’t possibly be wrong. Then what exactly is going on here?

**Medjed:** 

I think the answer should be asked to the real culprit himself.

**Mash:** 

…. !

**Medjed:** 

May the fragment of the god king find peace… As I promised, I shall become your power from now on.

Let’s go-----

To put an end to the pilgrim who has lost his way, my dear ally!

## Node 6 – Pre-Loading

**Mash:** 

The city of faith, again----

Senpai, the gate has already been opened!

We can now see the insi…..

………………!

**Izou:** 

W-What’s the meaning of this!?

**Medusa:** 

It’s empty. There’s not a single resident inside.

**Cursed Arm:** 

What!?

**Da Vinci:** 

Thanks to the opened gate I can now clearly confirm. There’s no sign of any living being. Absolutely none.

**Mash:** 

!!

**Medjed:** 

There’s no joy of life in this place. Only lingering despair and regret remains…

Among that, there’s only a man standing, alone…

**Da Vinci:** 

So it’s basically a kingdom of one. This king sure has such a bad taste…

**Mata Hari:** 

….

….

… How can this be…?

**Izou:** 

… What…?

ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING A LORD WOULD DO!?

**Medusa:** 

Izou.

**Mash:** 

Everyone, please wait. Something is coming…

!

Magical reading went up! Master, it’s the enemy servant!

## Node 6 - Loading (excerpt)

“The End of Eternal Pilgrimage"

After the group welcomed Medjed as another ally they head towards the city of faith, once more. The gate has already been opened.

It's not a city.

There's no single resident here.

At very least there's no single resident with their physical body.

Only a knight, standing alone in the middle.

Ruler of the city.

His true name is Jacques De Molay.

Final grandmaster of the knights templar,

And the destroyer of human order who acquired the holy grail !

## Node 6 - Pre-Battle 1

**Jacques De Molay:** 

I lost as a knight…

Broke my codes as a priest, and got my post as a grandmaster abolished… My regrets that rose as I gladly turned into ashes…

I shall avenge them all here!

This city of faith shall fulfill my deepest wish, The Lord has spoken his words to me.

”To go on a pilgrimage! Pilgrimage! PILGRIMAGE!”

After the end of eternal pilgrimage shall my wishes and regrets be sublimated!

The Lord has already delivered his words.

Who shall rebuke me? Who shall go against me?

Are you going to be the one?

Are you going to oppose The God?

**Mash:** 

The magical reading is amplifying! It’s confirmed, he has the possession of the grail!

**Da Vinci:** 

This amount of power! It rivals that of King Ozymandias! So he’s really the cuprit behind this singularity!?

**Izou:** 

What’s that…? The aura of his sword…? No, that’s impossible!

**Medusa:** 

It’s highly concentrated magical energy! If you directly bath in that your spirit origin will be a goner!

**Cursed Arm:** 

With this aura surrounding him it won’t even be possible to attack from behind…

**Mata Hari:** 

But not this time! Is that right Medjed!?

**Medjed:** 

Leave it to me!

**Mash:** 

A wall of light, suddenly appearing!?

**Da Vinci:** 

It seems to be a multi-layer barrier made from Egyptian ancient magecraft. Nice! If we have this we can close our distance with him!

Hm!? Hey, Medjed! Who’s behind you!?

**Mash:** 

Another high magical reading! A pillar of light has taken form of a human!

**???:** 

I see, so this is my form this time…

**Izou:** 

Who’s there!?

**Medusa:** 

You’re…

**???:** 

My name is Lion King

**Lion King:** 

I’m the king who ruled over the holy land in the singularity far away from here. And also the one who knows the ”Chaldea from far away” ***

The one who’s called Medjed…

**Medjed:** 

Y-Yes…?

**Lion King:** 

I used your bond with the king Ozymandias to be summoned unto this land.

But I have no time to explain the details, hence why…

I shall entrust my lance and my power to your cause.

Use me to the fullest… Master!

**Jacques De Molay:** 

A reinforcement…?

Hmph, I don’t care. My pilgrim knights! Kill them all!

Offer! Their souls! To the grail!

## Node 6 - Pre-Battle 2

**Lion King:** 

Weak…!

Your existence is weak…! Your pride is weak…!

You have nothing on your blades, your armor. Someones like you can’t possibly match my holy lance…!

**Knight of the Expedition:** 

--------

**Lion King:** 

No words, huh… How pitiful!

If that’s the case I shall put an end to all of you here!

## Node 6 - Pre-Battle 3

**Jacques De Molay:** 

My pilgrimage knights…!

Wiped out…? Completely…?

**Izou:** 

It’s only you now, you fucking monster!

**Lion King:** 

Perpare yourself. The knight who sought light and fell into the darkness.

**Jacques De Molay:**---- Into the darkness… you say?

……

……

...Ah, I know.

I know it. Known it all along.

I’ve already fallen into madness long time ago.

It’s not supposed to be like this. I’m supposed to have attained my glory at the end of pilgrimage.

It should’ve ended like that. Yet…

THIS IS ALL I HAVE LEFT NOW! MY ROAD IS FULL OF BLOODSHED, EVERY LIFE I TOUCHED PERISHED!

I BUILT THOSE GRAVES TO CALM THEIR SOULS. BUT THEY’RE ALSO MY ATONEMENT!

YET THOSE SINS WON’T EVER BE FORGIVEN! HOW COULD THEY BE? ALONG MY WAY HERE I’D ENDED SO MANY LIVES…

AND AFTER I REACHED THE HOLY LAND! I’VE ALWAYS BEEN! DESTROYING THEIR BODIES!

AND OFFERING THEIR SOULS TO THIS FAKE GRAIL!

LONG LIVE THE CITY OF FAITH! THIS PILGRIMAGE WON’T END! AND I WILL CONTINUE TO PRAY FOREVER!

I…! I…! I WON’T …!

**Mash:** 

The enemy servant, coming in at high speed, master!

---Some battling occurs---

**Jacques De Molay:** 

”Very well, but remember that next time you’ll have to pay it back to me plus interests”

## Node 6 – Post-Battle

**Mash:** 

The reading is gone! We’ve defeated Jacques De Molay!

**Jacques De Molay:** 

O..OOOOO…..

OOOOOOOOO……..

OOOOOOAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH…..!

**Da Vinci:** 

He can still maintain his spirit origin after we crushed his spirit core!? No… This is…!

**Mash:** 

The reading on the spirit origin is violently fluctuating! Magical energy rising rapidly!

The damage has already begin to spread onto the city. Thankfully that there’s no casulty there but…

… Something that looks like black mud is overflowing!

This is ----

**Lion King:** 

”Mud of the beast”. I see. So he has offered the souls to this thing.

It’s coming. The [Demon Beast Brilliance]*6

**Mash:** 

Demon Beast ---- Brilliance!?

**Jacques De Molay:** 

MY LI…! MY LIGHTTTTTTTTTT….!

**???:** 

So you’ve finally come out of hiding! The crown of dragon’s fang! The six heads with a burden of wretched sins! *7

If that so then this must’ve been my ditting appearance! How can I be satisfied with a mere spare body of the beast’s apostle!?

**Medjed:** 

Ooh… This voice is…!

Ozymandias-sama!

**Mash:** 

!?

--Cinematic plays. JDM summons dragon tentacles, Ozymandias shows up and transforms into Demon God Pillar Amun Ra--

**Cursed Arm:** 

This is…!

**Mash:** 

Two, Demon God Pillars!?

**Lion King:** 

Wrong, the one that the king of Jerusalem called upon is [Demon Beast Brilliance]

And the one the sun king transformed into is a pseudo-Demon God Pillar! He’s your temporary ally!

**Ozymandias:** 

I am Amon Ra…!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

**Izou:** 

Y-You! Didn’t you disappear when your spiritual core was crushed!?

**Ozymandias:** 

HA!

Isn’t there another one in front of you who still stands after getting his core destroyed! If it’s something a mere heroic spirit can do, there’s no way I can’t do the same!

I am pharaoh Ozymandias! This is my imperial privilege skill – NO!

My ”PHARAOH” privilege skill.

Let’s do it the Chaldea from far away! It’s an alliance! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

## Raid Battle - Demon God Alloces (excerpt)

"Demon God Alloces"

It's the sixth demon god pillar. However, it's form and name are somethings totally different from the one who got recorded in the “Human Order Incineration Incident”.

The "Beast" didn't manage to replicate the real demon god pillar who was responsible for the destruction of human order in the holy land, so it resorted to using a demon god Alloces as a substitute instead.

The knight, who became disillusioned with faith that only demands salvation and faith that only seeks reputation, eventually became an avatar of rage, he drank all the corrupted blood that fills the golden grail, along with two beasts, he replicated the sixth singularity.

Every Chaldea officially labels this thing as "Demon Beast Brilliance".

Until the knight of reverence is completely defeated, these demon beasts will continue to revive indefinitely.

----------------------

Cravings will eventually lead to victory. O the golden grail, please bestow thy miracle of reincarnation upon the struggling ones once more...

## Raid Battle - Demon God Alloces (Pre-loading)

**Ozymandias:** 

I shall praise you alongside Nitocris, master from Chaldea!

Your all-out attack on me cracked my spirit origin. Thanks to that I regained this little moment of freedom!

Thus, for a moment, Amon Ra’s power shall be your ally, not the beast’s!

**Lion King:** 

You still have this much ego left in you after transforming into a pillar? Splendid as usual, aren’t you, sun king?

**Ozymandias:** 

Hmph. What a coincidence, don’t you think so, lion king?

Anyone who knows the Chaldea from far away should be surprised. Who would’ve thought that the day I and you fight alongside each other would come!

**Lion King:** 

Agreed. I also couldn’t foresee this situation.

But this feels reliable. That thing, do you think you can defeat it?

**Ozymandias:** 

With me in this spirit origin alone would be impossible, but I have you.

 And…

**Izou:** 

?

**Medusa:** 

….

**Cursed Arm:** 

……..

**Mata Hari:** 

(I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that)

**Medjed:** 

We’re also here with you, Ozymandias-sama!

**Da Vinci:** 

Is this finally the time for my omnipotence? Well, doesn’t seem to do any more good hiding your trump cards!

**Mash:** 

Anti-Demon Beast Brilliance operation, ready to go at anytime!

Master! Your commands!

## Raid Battle - Demon God Alloces (excerpt) 2

//Just the same thing that was displayed earlier

## Raid Battle - Demon God Alloces (Pre-battle)

**Mash:** 

Demon Beast Brilliance, magical power increasing!

**Ozymandias:** 

Remember well, you normies. That’s the form of Demon Beast Brilliance.

While it’s also an apostle of a beast, it’s different of those under Demon God King’s command.

A part of the true enemy that you, Chaldea, will have to face.

Don’t fret. At the very least in this place ----

It’s more than possible to defeat them with me fighting alongside you!

## Raid Battle - Demon God Alloces (Post-battle)

**Mash:** 

Demon Beast Brilliance, defeated! The spirit origin has vanished!

**Da Vinci:** 

No sign of regenerating. We also managed to retrieve the grail. Good job!

Demon Beast Brilliance. Its true nature is still mysterious, but first let’s celebrate our victory!

**Cursed Arm:** 

Ooh… Ooooooh… Finally…!

**Mata Hari:** 

We did it, Hassan!

**Cursed Arm:** 

Yes… With this that village will be saved. Even if this is a past that I threw away, the past that became a singularity.

Rushd, Salia. I’m so happy to be abkle to prevent your untimely deaths.

**Mata Hari:** 

Good for you.

**Izou:** 

What? So those monsters are all dead, still haven’t cut enough!

Hey! Master from Chaldea!

Summon me next time, I’ll be a good use to you!

**Medusa:** 

… I’m a little bit tired.

**Medjed:** 

Me too…

**Ozymandias:** 

Hahaha. Okay Nitocris, I shall permit you to leave my side for awhile.

Even if you are both a pharaoh and Horus who wants to sour the sky, remember to rest sometimes.

That Chaldea, for example, should do well as your temporary home.

**Medjed:** 

O-Ozymandias-sama…

**Ozymandias:** 

Hahahahaha

**Lion King:** 

----Fu…

**Ozymandias:** 

Such a rare sight. So the lion king is actually capable of smiling!

**Lion King:** 

Even I used to be a human before. This and the function as Goddess Rhongomyniad is a different thing.

There are times that I smile, for example, a moment of victory.

**Ozymandias:** 

Hmm… It seems that I just saw another good thing!

I shall make sure that this will remain in my memory. --Hey, Chaldea from far away!

We are going to return to the throne. It’s regrettable but this is an avoidable fate of a servant!

Don’t you ever forget: The true enemy you have to fight isn’t the Demon God King who incinerates the human foundation, but the origin of Demon Beast Brilliance, the great beast!



 



## PunPun Translator notes

* 1 Enrollment in a context as if you enroll for a course/subject in your university/college. I think that the better substitute for this word in this context might be "learning" (enrolling in a course = learning new stuffs?)

* 2 Both Mashu and DaVinci didn't specify whether or not "Demon God Pillar" they mentioned refers to a single or multiple entities. Dialogues here indicate that this Chaldea still hasn't heard the name "Solomon" as the culprit yet. If you can find a footage of London's Demon God Pillar's fight in Arcade you will see that Solomon's silhouette there is that of a shadow servant : this might be an indication that Solomon/Goetia's debut in Mobile FGO doesn't occur here at all and this is why this Chaldea still have absolutely no f***ing clue who the heck their culprit might be. They might still think that "Demon God Pillar" is/are the actual mastermind(s) so this might be the reason words like "King of Magecraft" doesn't make any appearance here either

* 3 Again, this statement from DaVinci supports the above theory.

* 4 "This time for sure" gives either post-part 1 or maybe even post-part 2 vibe. Georgios also claimed that he did this PRECISELY because he's a saint. Maybe the real mastermind is someone/thing Christian-affiliated?

* 5 There have been too many servants voicing their opinion about futility on struggling against Goetia's plan of human order incineration. Reminded me of Goetia's words in Part 2's trailer and Galahad's attitude in Moonlight/LOSTROOM too...

* 6  I’m the king who ruled over the holy land in the singularity far away from here. And also the one who knows the “Chaldea from far away”

* 7 What's this supposed to mean? Prototype's beast VI? The Beast of Revelation? Anyway it seems to have personal connections with Ozy so this shouldn't be Goetia.

* 8 [Demon Beast Brilliance] -- I've seen some translations on this. To translate it as "Kaku" (as how it actually sounds) feels too cringy for me. The last character (the one that reads "Kaku") is a character so f***ing rare the only time I saw it in other contexts is from Tokyo Ghoul, and even in that context the author still use it to signify the color "red" which doesn't match any definition in any dictionary... Its definition in dictionary is "To shine (brightly, vividly)" so I decided to just change it into a noun instead hence "Brilliance". There's actually another word very common that reads "Kaku" (but written in a totally different Kanji character)  -- "A core (n.)" and personally I think that "Demon Beast Core" is a far less silly/confusing name but since I have no clue whether or not this is the author's actual intention I chose to stick to "Demon Beast Brilliance" instead.
