## Prologue

**Mash:** ───We've reached the hostile Singularity.

**Mash:** It's just as Chaldea predicted, this Singularity is structurally a miniature world———

**Mash:** a conceptual universe.

**Mash:** A microscale model case of the universe, so to speak...

**Mash:** The fact that there is only one life form present within this universe is of particular note.

**Mash:** The Beast of Calamity. The Evil of Humanity which manifests in civilizations that have

**Mash:** reached their height of prosperity and are now past their transitional period. Beast VI.

**Mash:** Our operational objective is the annihilation of Beast VI.

**Mash:** We will hereby commence the Last Order!

**Merlin:** ───Woah there! Looks like I've made it in the nick of time once again.

**Merlin:** Last Order, now that's a weighty phrase. Yes, that's the spirit!

**Mash:** !

**Merlin:** If this battle is to be the final one, then it will truly be the climax of this journey.

**Merlin:** And in that case, that leaves me no choice but to cheer you on from the front row!

**Merlin:** After all, your journey is one that I, Merlin, have acknowledged!

**Mash:** ───Merlin!

**Merlin:** Hey there, long time no see!

**Merlin:** I am glad to see you are doing well, Mash Kyrielight and Master of Chaldea.

**Mash:** Yes, Merlin! No...

**Mash:** Lady Merlin of another world! It's been a while!

**Merlin:** Yes, yes. Now there's a good look and a solid voice!

**Merlin:** You did well to stay true to yourself without bending or breaking,

**Merlin:** in spite of the harsh journeys you have experienced.

**Merlin:** I am in awe of that brilliance. So much, in fact, that I ran all the way here on foot!

**Merlin:** Now then, I'll be helping you out even more than last time!

**Mash:** Thank you very much! This is very reassuring, isn't it, Senpai?

**Merlin:** Oh, one more thing.

**Merlin:** Fufufufufufufu.

**Merlin:** This is going to be a sight to behold. (Grinning)

**Mash:** ?

**Merlin:** (Smiling)

**Merlin:** ───I'm not the only one who came here today!

## Orleans Pre-Battle

**First Hassan:** ───Understood.

**First Hassan:** For starters, we advance and crush the first Demon Beast Incarnadine.

**Mash:** You're...?

**Merlin:** Didn't I just tell you? I'm not the only one who came rushing over.

**Merlin:** He is the one who wanders the boundary of death!

**Merlin:** The “Old Man of the Mountain”, a title passed down in the shadows of history.

**Merlin:** He is the first and greatest of them all, the black mask of death!

**Merlin:** His True Name is Hassan-i-Sabbah───

**Merlin:** One of the Heroic Spirits who claims the <ruby>Station of the Crown<rt>Grand seat</rt></ruby>, fated to hunt Beasts,

**Merlin:** summoned here through the Decisive Magecraft: Heroic Spirit Summoning.

**Merlin:** The Grand Assassin himself!

**First Hassan:** I am naught but a phantom that writhes in the dark...

**First Hassan:** Yet now the Evening Bell tolls. Let us go.

**Mash:** The Evening Bell───

**Merlin:** “The fateful moment is upon us! I shall lend you my strength as a special favor”,

**Merlin:** is what he's trying to say!

**First Hassan:** ...

**First Hassan:** I shall be your guide. This way.

**Mash:** Ah!

**Mash:** Look, senpai! In the wake of the Old Man of the Mountain's advance...

**Merlin:** The fluttering petals of magical energy are beautiful, huh? Fufufufufu.

**Merlin:** Sorry, but that's my handiwork.

**Merlin:** If we're going to be guiding you anyway,

**Merlin:** I figured an easily understandable approach would be better.

**First Hassan:** You needn't bother yourself. You need not adorn their deaths with flowers.

**Merlin:** Come now, don't say that. We're fellow Grands after all, aren't we?

**First Hassan:** So says the pseudo-fairy who has ignored her <ruby>Station of the Crown<rt>Grand seat</rt></ruby> to act as she pleases.

**Merlin:** Whatever could you mean by that?

**Mash:** (I wonder what they're talking about?)

**Merlin:** Now then, about the first Demon Beast Incarnadine───

**Merlin:** Shaving off magical energy of this scale all on our own is going to prove rather troublesome.

**Merlin:** Not to mention there's seven of these!

**Merlin:** Or so I thought, however...

**Merlin:** It looks like someone already beat us to the punch. Look over there, Mash!

**Mash:** !?

**Kiyohime:** Uncle! Uncle Vlad, please go easy now, umm!

**Vlad:** I have every intention of holding back───

**Vlad:** But you're doing a fine job evading my Noble Phantasm. Keep it up.

**Kiyohime:** Uncle!?

**Elisabeth:** Wow, uncle Vlad's merciless! Wowowowowow.

**Elisabeth:** Won't he end up Bey'ing us too? Are you sure this is okay?

**Carmilla:** There is no way Lord Vlad would blunder like that.

**Carmilla:** More importantly, we should provide support.

**Carmilla:** We will exterminate the first Demon Beast Incarnadine here.

**Elisabeth:** Fine, fine! Let's do this───Boe~!

**Mash:** ...!

**Mash:** Master, Master! Those people are...!

**Mash:** The Servants who stood against us in the first Singularity!

**Mash:** They're all attacking the Demon Beast Incarnadine in unison───

**Jeanne:** Yes... This is undoubtedly a miracle.

**Jeanne:** What you see before you are “Heroic Spirits” as they should have been!

**Jeanne:** We, existences engraved in the history woven by man,

**Jeanne:** were meant to stand with the Human Order.

**Jeanne:** Now that we are free from the yoke of the Holy Grail's distortion and curse───

**Jeanne:** We shall unite our forces to aid you, Chaldea!

**Marie:** Yes, yes! This time, we can all get along and have a party!

**Marie:** Vive la France, Master!

**Marie:** I'm glad I got to greet you again!

**Mash:** Jeanne! Marie!

**Martha:** Rather rowdy for a party...oh, I see. So that's how it is.

**Martha:** We are to hold a grand banquet on this triumphant day!

**Chevalier d'Eon:** As you command, Your Highness!

**Chevalier d'Eon:** I shall bear the banner of the royal family's fleur-de-lis at this party!

**Chevalier d'Eon:** O Demon Beast Incarnadine, inauspicious red flower of evil.

**Chevalier d'Eon:** You have no place in the banquet of the Human Order!

**Phantom of the Opera:** Dance, dance, Demon Beast Incarnadine. Dance the Danse Macabre before us───

**Mozart:** Oh, the Phantom appears to be in good spirits. Now there's a rare sight!

**Mozart:** And Maria appears much the same to me. Is there even a need to take this seriously then?

**Mash:** Amadeus!

**Mozart:** Hello, milady. We meet again. It would appear I have made it in time for the final performance.

**Mash:** Yes!

**Jeanne:** I'm here too, you know...? Why am I on your side?

**Gilles de Rais:** Oh, Jeanne. Puffing up those beautiful cheeks of hers...could it be that she is sulking?

**Gilles de Rais:** Do you wish to stand against Chaldea, even after your second summoning as an Apostle of Lust?

**Jeanne:** Shut it! I'll immolate you!

**Mash:** Master...everyone came rushing over to this final battle.

**Mash:** We cannot afford to fall behind either!

**Mash:** Commencing anti-Demon Beast Incarnadine combat!

## Orleans Post-Battle and Septem Part 1

**Jeanne:** The path has been cleared! Please, keep moving forward, don't look back!

**Merlin:** The first Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!

**Merlin:** I'd love for us to take a break, but we don't have time. I'm sorry.

**Merlin:** Both of you, let's move onto the next one!

**Mash:** Understood!

**First Hassan:** This way───follow me.

**Elisabeth:** Get it together, you hear me!?

**Elisabeth:** There'll be hell to pay if you give up halfway through!

**Jeanne:** Best of luck!

**Marie:** Vive la France!

---

**Nero:** ...

**Nero:** What am I doing here...?

**Nero:** Where am I? Just now, I was...

**Nero:** Perhaps I was in my chambers, or perhaps under some faraway skies───

**Nero:** In either case, I came to below a different sky altogether,

**Nero:** on a stage of convergence seemingly set up to determine the fate of the world.

**Nero:** As one would expect, there is a lot I have yet to understand.

**Nero:** What I do understand, however, is what needs to be done!

**Nero:** Namely, this situation requires us to fight! Mash! And Chaldea's Master!

**Mash:** Emperor Nero───!

**Nero:** I don't know the full extent of things, but this is what needs to be done.

**Nero:** Can we presume that pillar-like thing is our enemy?

**Mash:** Y-yes! According to incoming communications from Chaldea,

**Mash:** its provisional name is Demon God Pillar Flauros! The second Demon Beast Incarnadine!

**Mash:** We fought it once before, in the second Singularity...

**Mash:** I don't suppose Your Highness would remember that...?

**Nero:** You'd be correct! Frankly, I must confess that I don't remember much at all!

**Nero:** But my soul remembers that I once fought beside you Chaldeans!

**Nero:** Thus, I shall brandish this blade of meteoric iron with all my being! As a fellow comrade-in-arms!

**Merlin:** Take it all in, Old Man of the Mountain. This is what you'd call a miracle, isn't it?

**Merlin:** You know about Her Majesty the red emperor, I take it?

**Merlin:** The living person, keeping their karmic destiny concealed within their body,

**Merlin:** who they met in that Singularity.

**Merlin:** They borrowed the Saint Graph of the very same existence, etched into the Throne,

**Merlin:** and ultimately charged headfirst into battle.

**Merlin:** Fufufu, amazing, amazing! That's two or three miracles achieved by this point, isn't it!?

**Merlin:** Just how many impossibilities will be overturned!? Truly beautiful!

**Merlin:** At the end of the headache that young woman endures───

**Merlin:** The Beast of Love will be hard pressed!

**First Hassan:** ......

**First Hassan:** If the founder of the seven hills were here, he'd say it.

**Merlin:** Hm?

**First Hassan:** ───Rome! Just that one word!

**First Hassan:** Miracles in times of crisis. Fraternity owing itself to the battlefield.

**First Hassan:** These things are all part of <ruby>romance<rt>Rome</rt></ruby>───that's what he'd say.

## Septem Part 2

**Nero:** Ggh...! A migraine, now of all times...!

**Boudica:** Ah, jeez. Don't just rush on ahead like that. We're relying on you for leadership, you know.

**Nero:** Oh, Boudica!

**Nero:** Ah yes...I remember now. You were my enemy once.

**Nero:** The dreaded warlord who once stood against my Rome, fighting alongside me now!

**Boudica:** Looks like it. I was your enemy once upon a time, but some things happened and, well, y'know.

**Boudica:** Now, take a look.

**Boudica:** The greatest allied army in history awaits your command, and so do the generals leading it!

**Caesar:** Hah hah hah hah! This time we meet not in opposition, but as comrades!

**Caesar:** Narrowly escaping the grasp of his beloved Cleopatra,

**Caesar:** here to behold the skill of the fifth Emperor,

**Caesar:** Julius Caesar has come to conquer! Rejoice, all of you!

**Caligula:** Ooooooooh...!! Rome...immortal...Demon Beast Incarnadine...DESTROY...!

**Caligula:** DESTROOOOOOY!!

**Nero:** Uncle!? And Lord Caesar!

**Caesar:** And we are not alone!

**Caesar:** O Heroic Spirits who have devoted yourselves to the training of the Divine Ancestor!

**Caesar:** Come forth!

**Leonidas I:** Nwaaaaaaaaaah! My body is rejuvenated through the strength of your war cries!

**Leonidas I:** Lancer, Leonidas I! Reporting for duty!

**Mash:** King Leonidas...!

**Leonidas I:** Sparta's patron god is Ares, also known as Mars!

**Leonidas I:** And now, I have received the tutelage of his son, the Divine Ancestor!

**Leonidas I:** Truly, I am the god of war made manifest!

**Leonidas I:** Allow me to lend you his power, O Fifth Emperor of Rome!

**Nero:** King Leonidas of Sparta! You too would side with me...!

**Nero:** Wait a minute. Who is this Divine Ancestor you keep mentioning?

**Lord El-Melloi II:** You don't know...? Well, you should.

**Nero:** The alliance's strategist! Your name was...

**Lord El-Melloi II:** Zhuge Liang. Well, it's Lord El-Melloi II at present.

**Lord El-Melloi II:** To those of you from the Human Security Organization Chaldea,

**Lord El-Melloi II:** I will tell you the truth as a mage of the Clock Tower.

**Lord El-Melloi II:** I don't know about the other domains, but as for this one...

**Lord El-Melloi II:** Many of the Heroic Spirits gathered here have temporarily manifested

**Lord El-Melloi II:** with the assistance of Rome's Divine Founder.

**Nero:** Th-that...

**Lord El-Melloi II:** The father of Rome. You might know him better as Romulus, the Founding King.

**Lord El-Melloi II:** Or as he is now, Romulus-Quirinus.

**Lord El-Melloi II:** Son of the war god, and one of the three supreme deities of Rome!

**Nero:** !!!

**Altera:** The war god has my respect. If his son commands so, then I shall heed his words.

**Altera:** So, I too have come.

**Altera:** Rome has spoken. All of you are good civilization.

**Altera:** And Nero. Emperor Nero. You...

**Altera:** Because you were kind to me in that distant sky...

**Altera:** I shall protect you this time... The me here and now shall destroy the Demon Beast Incarnadine.

**Mash:** Altera! The Heroic Spirit of Destruction!

**Mash:** Otherwise known as King Atilla, the Scourge of God!

**Nero:** ...!

**Nero:** Aaaah, I don't know how much more I can take!

**Nero:** T-the Divine Ancestor would lend his power to me!? To Chaldea!?

**Nero:** I don't understand this at all!

**Nero:** I don't understand...

**Nero:** But despite that! Right now, all of Rome is within my grasp!

**Nero:** As the Divine Ancestor once said to his father, the god of war!

**Nero:** There is enough light in mankind to nurture a heart that loves all!

**Nero:** History is rife with that which denies it to be the case.

**Nero:** And so we behold the dread form of the Demon Beast Incarnadine!

**Nero:** This would stop us in our tracks? How laughable.

**Nero:** Even the Age of Gods must come to an end.

**Nero:** Once, our very own Roman Empire proved that to be true!

**Nero:** The Age of Man is the Age of Romance!

**Merlin:** (Seriously...?)

**Nero:** Man loves his fellow man...

**Mash:** Love───

**Boudica:** ......

**Nero:** That is what I dream of! That is what Rome is!

**Nero:** Thus I declare! Advance! And conquer!

**Nero:** Our arms pave the way for all! Our love shall one day reach the heavens themselves!

**Romans:** UUUUUUUUUURAAAAAAAAH! HAIL THE DIVINE ANCESTOR! HAIL EMPEROR NERO CLAUDIUS!

**Nero:** !?

**Boudica:** That's the thousands of soldiers supporting you.

**Boudica:** They swear allegiance neither to Alliance nor Empire, but to Rome itself.

**Romans:** HAIL THE EMPEROR! HAIL, OUR NERO CLAUDIUS!

**Nero:** Yes...yes...!

**Nero:** Don your crimson and gold! I and Rome promise you glory and victory!

**Nero:** This Beast shall know by what means it falls.

**Nero:** And it shall see that even if this band of despair envelops the sky,

**Nero:** that light shall never fade.

**Nero:** My abominable migraine has vanished! I see clearly now!

**Nero:** Let the decisive battle begin!

## Septem Post-Battle and Okeanos Part 1

**Mash:** The second Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!

**Altera:** Yes...we sync well together. As expected of an emperor.

**Nero:** You certainly seem to be used to it, too.

**Nero:** It almost feels like this isn't the first time we've been in battle together!

**Lord El-Melloi II:** It has the same level of power as the thing

**Lord El-Melloi II:** that caused my apprentice's Holy Lance to go crazy...

**Lord El-Melloi II:** Certainly, you've endured it well.

**Merlin:** Amazing... You actually survived the pull of the Beast.

**Merlin:** She truly is an impressive emperor. Or rather, that's what humanity is all about.

**Merlin:** That's the way it should be!

**Nero:** ?

**Merlin:** Well then, let's go!

**First Hassan:** ───This way to the third domain.

**Nero:** Mash, Master of Chaldea! Head on!

**Nero:** My Roman legion and I will take care of this area. You may go forth.

**Nero:** This world will never end, for all roads lead to our seven hills!

**Nero:** Forward! Conquer!

**Nero:** Our steps will open up the Rome of tomorrow!

---

**Francis Drake:** Feast upon the accumulated gold and riches, you say...?

**Francis Drake:** Gold! Riches! I can't very well ignore those now, can I?

**Francis Drake:** In all ages and cultures, such straightforward treasures have always been pillaged.

**Francis Drake:** In other words, this is our forté.

**Francis Drake:** You're gonna have to hand it all over, your life included, got it?

**Francis Drake:** I am fully aware of how impudent I'm being here, having just arrived and all.

**Francis Drake:** But it is what it is, no? After all, we're pirates!

**Pirate:** Whew! Our big sis's super cool───!

**Francis Drake:** Yeah, we'll do this as merrily as usual, you swabbies!

**Francis Drake:** We'll do what we've always done, no matter who or what our enemy is!

**Francis Drake:** We'll pillage and drink and raise hell!

**Pirates:** You can say that again, Boss! We're the crew of the Golden Hind!

**Pirates:** We'll follow you anywhere, sis!! Woo-hoo!!

**Merlin:** Woo-hoo! Playing along like this once in a while isn't too bad!

**Mash:** W-woo-hoo! Captain Drake and her pirate crew are in good spirits!

**Mash:** A miracle's unfolding here too───there's more than one pirate galleon here, Master!

**Pirate:** Woah! There's another ship portside!

**Mash:** That's...the Queen Anne's Revenge!

**Francis Drake:** Heh, is that so? So he's here too, is he?

**Francis Drake:** A pain in the ass he may be, but you can count on him.

**Francis Drake:** Heeey, Teach! Can you hear me!? What'll it be?

**Blackbeard:** Hmph. The one who fells you shall be none other than I...

**Blackbeard:** I couldn't possibly let someone else take up that role, now can I───

**Atalante:** That's enough of that. Steer properly or else we'll end up ramming that pillar of flesh.

**Blackbeard:** Fine, fine! Cat-ears here has a rough way of treating her captain!

**Blackbeard:** Alright, boyos! Keep pace with the ha──Drake's ship!

**Blackbeard:** Bold of you to steal a pirate's treasure!

**Blackbeard:** I don't care whether you're a demonic beast or a devil───

**Blackbeard:** Go and regret in hell ever having laid hands on this great pirate Blackbeard's treasure!

**Francis Drake:** Well, well, looks like that oaf's all fired up! Listen up, boys, don't you dare fall behind!

**Francis Drake:** If we end up crashing and burning before him,

**Francis Drake:** you lot are gonna be scrubbing the head in hell for a lifetime!

**Pirates:** Aye-aye, big sis!

**Francis Drake:** Cannons on the ready, Golden Hind!

**Blackbeard:** Prep those cannons, Queen Anne's Revenge!

## Okeanos Part 2

**Mash:** Incoming message from Chaldea!

**Mash:** It seems like the reconstructed cannon has successfully been materialized!

**Merlin:** Oh, we can use this! Well aren't you capable of some interesting things?

**Merlin:** Taking Chaldea's records of the Golden Hind and materializing it in a fluid etheric mass, hm?

**Merlin:** Hmm. I see, I see.

**Francis Drake:** Eh?

**Francis Drake:** This cannon...looks an awful lot like ours, don't it?

**Francis Drake:** Is it from the same gunsmith? Or could it...no, it couldn't be.

**Pirate:** Haah, haah, haah...Cap'n, all our gunports're full up.

**Pirate:** Don't look like we're missin' any.

**Francis Drake:** Well, don't that beat all? Seriously takes a load off my mind.

**Francis Drake:** It's a pain in the ass havin' to keelhaul your own crew before a battle.

**Pirate:** Heh. Don't have to tell me!

**Merlin:** ...

**Merlin:** Hey Mash, Master of Chaldea. Something just occurred to me.

**Merlin:** If you taught the 21st-century definition of copy protection and piracy to these genuine pirates...

**Merlin:** What do you think would──mmmph.

**Mash:** P-p-please excuse me, Merlin, but please shut up for now!

**Mash:** We really don't need you to go down that train of thought...!

**First Hassan:** ... (reads the mood and keeps quiet.)

**Francis Drake:** Hey, what are you fussin' about over there?

**Heracles:** (RRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRR)

**Francis Drake:** Gah, my ears! Wait, was that the legendary hero himself!?

**Francis Drake:** Sorry about that! I'd be a damned fool to turn down help from you!

**Medea Lily:** I am here as well! This time, I too shall offer my support!

**Pirates:** !?

**Pirates:** Aaaaah! The wiiiiitch!

**Medea Lily:** Ah...

**Medea Lily:** Um, no! It's okay! For whatever reason, I don't have that intense desire this time,

**Medea Lily:** and because Lord Jason has asked me and Heracles to take care of you,

**Medea Lily:** both Heracles and I are on your side!

**Heracles:** (RRRRRRRrrrrrrrRRRRRRR)

**Francis Drake:** Well, well. Looks like we're gonna get along.

**Francis Drake:** All right! We've got the legendary Argonauts on our side!

**Francis Drake:** Now this is what I'm talkin' about! Listen up, you dogs!

**Francis Drake:** Don't underestimate her just because she looks like a princess!

**Francis Drake:** Little Miss Witch here is one of the original pirates!

**Francis Drake:** She went on the hunt for the first hidden treasure!

**Francis Drake:** There's no room for poor manners here──and of course, the rudest thing you can do is lose!

**Pirates:** AYE-AYE, CAP'N! AYE AYE, MISS WITCH!

**Medea Lily:** U-um...I'll do my best!

**Blackbeard:** Ooh, seems like they're getting fired up over there. Gettin' kind of jealous.

**Atalante:** Are you displeased with me, Captain?

**Blackbeard:** Oh no no no no no, not at all! Now let's get rolling!

**Francis Drake:** Hey! Don't let Teach and his crew steal all the glory!

**First Hassan:** ───Demon Beast Incarnadine, offer up thy head!

## Okeanos Post-Battle and London Part 1

**Merlin:** The Third Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!

**Blackbeard:** Whew. Ended up taking this just a wee bit seriously.

**Blackbeard:** Surely there's no need to even mention who the MVP is!

**Atalante:** That would be Heracles. Although that skull man's skill with a greatsword is a sight to behold.

**Atalante:** I certainly would not call it uncontested, you know?

**Blackbeard:** ...

**Atalante:** What's wrong, Teach?

**Blackbeard:** No, I'm...actually depressed right now, please leave me be...

**Atalante:** ?

**Francis Drake:** Not too shabby, Teach! Quite daring by your standards, I'd say!

**Francis Drake:** I like it. Where'd you learn to steer like that?

**Blackbeard:** Hey, hag...! Where do you get off spitting lines like that at a man when he's down!?

**Francis Drake:** Who the hell are you calling a hag?

**Blackbeard:** ───Blegh.

**Mash:** Oh! Blackbeard got...flattened...!

**Merlin:** Ahahahaha. How nice, it almost makes me want to rest on my laurels.

**Merlin:** But we've got to press forward. Mash, Master.

**First Hassan:** ───Let us be off.

**Francis Drake:** Woah, are you going already? I guess I've got to give at least one gun salute.

**Francis Drake:** Stay safe, Chaldeans!

**Medea Lily:** Take care!

**Pirates:** Make sure to stay alive, you hear me!? ───See ya later!

---

**Mordred:** Yeah... There's an end to everything.

**Mordred:** That majestic castle, shining proudly, will collapse.

**Mordred:** Those armored knights bearing arms will die all the same too.

**Mordred:** Even the world will end someday.

**Mordred:** But not at the hands of a Demon Beast Incarnadine. Not at all.

**Mordred:** The end of the world ain't a lousy spectacle like this without a soul to attend to it.

**Mordred:** On the contrary, it's the end for you bastards. You've already had your fill, haven't you?

**Mordred:** Then it's the end for you. I'll put you out of your misery!

**Mash:** We've reached the fourth domain! Mordred has already commenced her assault!

**Mash:** However───

**Merlin:** There are two Demon Beast Incarnadines here. A twin type one, more specifically.

**Merlin:** One of them's the Control Tower and the other one's the assault apparatus.

**Merlin:** You can't afford to waste your magical energy carelessly.

**Merlin:** Of the two, you'll need to accurately strike at the Control Tower.

**Mordred:** Shut it! Who the hell are you!?

**Mordred:** I just have to pulverize both of them!

**Tamamo:** Oh, I wonder about that.

**Tamamo:** It's a coin toss as to whether you're wasting your time if you charge in recklessly, you know?

**Mordred:** So you mean there's a fifty-fifty chance that I'll hit the jackpot?

**Mash:** Mordred, Tamamo-no-Mae!

**Mordred:** Hey, Mash! The Chaldean Master's along for the ride too, eh!?

**Merlin:** (Grinning)

**Mordred:** Hm.

**Mordred:** You're...not Merlin...are you...?

**Mordred:** That floweriness makes you feel kind of similar...

**Mordred:** But you're a woman and all───

**Merlin:** Ahahahahaha!

**Merlin:** Close but no cigar! I'm not that person you're familiar with, I'm Merlin from a different timeline.

**Merlin:** Needless to say, I'm not male. Although I am the Magus of Flowers───

**Merlin:** Your flowery big sis who's been cheering you on this whole time as you strived for your ideals!

**Mordred:** Huh?

**Tamamo:** Let's think of her as a relative of Merlin's, shall we?

**Tamamo:** Nonetheless, Mash and the Master of Chaldea. It's been a while,

**Tamamo:** and you've made quite a few new companions───

**Merlin:** Fufu.

**Tamamo:** It would appear you've become acquainted with quite a lot of heavy hitters.

**Tamamo:** After all, they both qualify for the position of Grand.

**Tamamo:** And...eh?

**Tamamo:** T-that person there! With the skull!

**Tamamo:** He's not just qualified for the seat of Grand! He's already a Grand Heroic Spirit!

**First Hassan:** I am indeed, O Radiant Tail Of The Heavens.

**First Hassan:** I am the Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah.

**Tamamo:** Mikon! C-could it be that you're the founder!?

**Merlin:** Indeed he is! After all, this battle is the climax!

**Merlin:** Where all worthy Heroic Spirits assemble!

**Mordred:** Hah. I don't know what you're babbling on about,

**Mordred:** but looks like you're some bigwig or something.

**Mordred:** I'll fight alongside you and we'll see if you're all that.

**Mordred:** We've got two enemies. One's the head and the other's like an extension of its hand.

**Mordred:** That simplifies matters! We'll keep hitting and striking them!

**Mordred:** I'll say it again───we just have to pulverize the both of them!!

## London Part 2

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ──────Exactly so.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** You speak truthfully, O Nameless Knight.

**Mordred:** !

**Mash:** That's───

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** I am but another what-if of myself, from beneath a different sky.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** One that springs from holding the Holy Lance, on the verge of apotheosis,

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** yet clinging to the slimmest of chances of remaining myself.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** The possibility of retaining my identity while wielding the power of the Lance.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** The possibility of accepting the curse of the Grail.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** A version of myself unable to act as a king, as my nature is that of the storm.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** That...is what I am.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** Nothing more than a storm which ravages that which lies before me.

**Mordred:** I have heard your words! Father──no, Storm King, leader of the Wild Hunt!

**Mordred:** You're the one who destroys everything! Even me!

**Mordred:** And especially those two Demon Beast Incarnadines!

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** No. Today all that lies before me is the head of that beast.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** I am blind to any Heroic Spirits attempting to save the world───

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** Holy Lance, removing restraints.

**First Hassan:** Oh...?

**Merlin:** Hahahahaha! Behold, the light of the tower that anchors the ends of the world!

**Merlin:** You don't see this every day! Too bad for you, Beast VI!

**Merlin:** It's just too bad we're only at one of the heads, and not at the main body!

**Mordred:** ...

**Tamamo:** Mordred?

**Mordred:** Like this? On this battlefield? What a sick joke. Am I supposed to be thankful for this?

**Mordred:** Welp, it's gone so far it's actually refreshing! I'm finally fighting alongside Father!

**Mordred:** And we're finally on the same wavelength: just trash everything in front of us!

**Mordred:** If this is a dream, it's a freakin' amazing one! I'm gonna enjoy this to its fullest!

**Jack the Ripper:** Are you happy to be with your Mummy?

**Mordred:** Yeah, I sure am.

**Mordred:** Wait───that's my Father, not my mom!

**Jack the Ripper:** (All smiles)

**Mordred:** Hey──you're Jack! What, have you manifested as our ally now?

**Mordred:** That's great! This doesn't happen a lot, so let's go smash some faces together!

**Jack the Ripper:** Yeah!

**Mordred:** Now, let's rock and rooooooll!

## London Post-Battle and E Pluribus Unum Part 1

**Mash:** Fourth Demon Beast Incarnadine, patterns A and B have both been silenced!

**Mordred:** What...that's it?

**Mordred:** Aw man, what a letdown. I thought I'd finally be able to run amok with Father.

**Mordred:** Ah, whatever. Was still a good fight.

**Tamamo:** Well, I suppose. Speaking comparatively, of course.

**Merlin:** Yep, yep.

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ...

**Mordred:** Sheesh. Those two sure aren't happy.

**Mordred:** Thanks, Mash. You too, Master of Chaldea.

**Mordred:** Why I'm still here, or why records of what happened before are still around...

**Mordred:** I don't really get it at all, but I'm sure it's because of you two.

**Tamamo:** Why are you making it sound so final!? We aren't done here yet, you know!

**Tamamo:** We'll take charge of this domain now, so please go on ahead.

**Tamamo:** And please be careful. The trials ahead will be just as taxing, or even more so──

**Jack the Ripper:** They're strong, but that's okay. You can do it.

**Mash:** Yes...!

**Merlin:** That's right. Even should a strong enemy block our way,

**Merlin:** that wouldn't stop Mash and Master's pace, would it?

**Merlin:** You guys know exactly what I mean, don't you? Fufufufu!

**Mordred:** Yeah, sure do...

**Tamamo:** Well, so it goes. But be on your guard all the same!

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ──Farewell.

**First Hassan:** ──Mm.

**Mash:** We're off! Now...let's keep going, Senpai!

**Nightingale:** Pathogenic bacterium again...?

**Nightingale:** Their extermination is truly quite an ordeal. There is no other way but to change the world.

**Scathach:** Oh, don't say that. If we're overcome here, then there is no hope for the Human Order.

**Scathach:** Besides, it doesn't appear such a surgical approach is necessary.

**Scathach:** Look───the first responders are already here!

**Mash:** Master, we've reached the fifth domain!

**Mash:** Nightingale! Scathach!

**Sita:** I'm here as well, Mash!

**Mash:** Oh, Sita's here too!

**Merlin:** Hey, it's been a while since I've seen the three of you. Good to see you're all still doing well!

**Sita:** Yes, and you too, Merlin!

**Scathach:** Well, what do you think now, Florence Nightingale?

**Nightingale:** You appear to have been correct... Very well, we will settle for symptomatic treatment this time.

**Sita:** Now, let us sally forth! Do not fear death nor pain!

**Sita:** For the Angel of Mercy is on our side!

**Sita:** The angel who hauls you up by the collar, no matter if you may be dying or on the way to Hell!

**Nightingale:** If it encourages you all, then I shall bear that moniker for now.

**Nightingale:** Ahem...

**Nightingale:** Though, I must confess, I do find it rather embarrassing───

**Scathach:** Hahahahaha! Look, the Angel is blushing!

**First Hassan:** Thou truly art a lovely flower. No wonder pagans mistook you for an angel.

**Nightingale:** !?

**Nightingale:** The gentleman over there...this is the first time I've had the pleasure of meeting him.

**Nightingale:** And yet I feel like I've seen him before somehow...why is that?

**First Hassan:** Thou art the flower that grows alongside death. Therefore, thou mayest feel familiar with it.

**First Hassan:** But that is but an illusion.

**First Hassan:** Thy hands are for the sake of preserving life.

**Nightingale:** O-of course... What a mysterious individual...

**Scathach:** ───Now then, let us bring down this poor shade.

**Scathach:** Poor fool with no idea what it truly is.

## E Pluribus Unum Part 2

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Wait.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** This is my prey, Master.

**Scathach:** ...!

**Mash:** Master, look! It's...

**Mash:** ───The Mad King, Cú Chulainn Alter. Our final enemy in the Fifth Singularity!

**Mash:** But he doesn't appear hostile towards us now. What's going on!?

**Scathach:** Even you showed up...I have to say, even I didn't expect this.

**Scathach:** A miracle may be occurring, but how dare you stir from your throne.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** It's only natural that after a defeat, the loser goes over to the winner's side.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Forcing your own way through without letting others do the same is just hypocrisy.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Even if it's through mutual hate or simply killing each other, bonds once made can't be broken.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** At the very least I can do what I'm supposed to. That's all.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** I told you already, that shadow is my prey.

**Scathach:** I see... Well then, for now I will refrain from asking why.

**Scathach:** But how do you think Medb would feel about this?

**Scathach:** After all, she created you to rule over that Singularity.

**Scathach:** Would she be pleased or displeased to see you doing this?

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Who knows... She could be mad or happy.

**Scathach:** !

**Scathach:** Yeah. It sure seems that way.

**Scathach:** Well...sorry to hold you up, O Mad King of Shadows!

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** ──────────

**Scathach:** Now, on to the extended final battle of the second American Civil War!

**Scathach:** I wish all you great heroes here good hunting!

**Karna:** Naturally...

**Arjuna:** Of course...

**Arjuna:** Karna... Did you ever think a day like this would come?

**Arjuna:** Not just that we would fight as partners───together...

**Arjuna:** But that we would do so in order to save something.

**Karna:** I knew it would come someday, but I did not know when.

**Karna:** I thought it might take one or two thousand years,

**Karna:** until the moon and sun washed away our feelings...

**Arjuna:** You're right. Who would have thought it would come so soon!

**Arjuna:** ───But this is fine...

**Arjuna:** I'll suppress my feelings of hatred and competitiveness with you.

**Arjuna:** For now...

**Karna:** Is that so? If anything, I was rather looking forward to our rivalry here.

**Arjuna:** ───What?

**Scathach:** Don't be so hasty, Arjuna! Karna merely wants to compete with you here!

**Scathach:** Isn't that right?

**Karna:** Yes... It appears I misspoke.

**Arjuna:** ───I see.

**Scathach:** In this world, your desire to clash with each other may not come to pass.

**Scathach:** But just endure for now. And continue to do so as we move on.

**Arjuna:** Queen of the Land of Shadows. I may not understand what you say...

**Arjuna:** But I shall agree for now. Therefore, Karna,

**Arjuna:** I'll express my hatred and jealousy towards you through exceeding your body count!

**Arjuna:** Now, ready your spear!

**Karna:** Of course. And you nock your arrows, Arjuna.

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** RRRRRRRRrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRR!

**Scathach:** Hah!

**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** ───Come!

**Mash:** Demon Beast Incarnadine incoming, along with hostile Shadow Servants!

## E Pluribus Unum Post-Battle and Lost Jerusalem Part 1

 

**Mash:** ───Hostile Shadow Servant, annihilated! The fifth Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!

**Scathach:** Good...

**Nightingale:** The pathogen has been excised. However, it is little more than symptomatic treatment.

**Nightingale:** We may have succeeded in opening the gate of this domain,

**Nightingale:** but we are far from a curative treatment.

**Nightingale:** Now then, hurry along. Should you dawdle, the gate will close once more.

**Nightingale:** But first of all, we must excise the real pathogen───the root cause!

**Merlin:** How much do you even know!?

**Merlin:** Is this shrewdness a trait unique to those with a high level of Madness Enhancement?

**Merlin:** In any case, she's right. Let's hurry up, Mash. You too, Master of Chaldea!

**Sita:** Go on ahead! And please be careful!

**Arjuna:** The path has been paved. You are free to press forward!

**Karna:** ───Go now, keep moving forward!

---

**Jacques de Molay:** ......

**Jacques de Molay:** ───I failed as a knight.

**Jacques de Molay:** Apostatized as a monk, expunged as a grandmaster.

**Jacques de Molay:** These regrets I harbor of having returned to ashes without achieving anything.

**Jacques de Molay:** How could I possibly stand to not resolve them here and now!?

**Jacques de Molay:** P-please do not stop me, Lady Leonardo da Vinci!

**Da Vinci:** There, there. There, there. Calm down, calm down.

**Jacques de Molay:** How could I possibly remain calm!?

**Da Vinci:** Nevertheless, we can't have you charging the enemy all on your lonesome, can we!?

**Mash:** We've reached the sixth domain...but what's going on here!?

**Mash:** Da Vinci is restraining the Heroic Spirit Jacques de Molay!

**Okada Izo:** Hey there, Mash and the Chaldeans in tow! Do something about those idiots, will ya!?

**Okada Izo:** Heroes from all ages and places are gathering here, can't have them dying in vain now.

**Medusa:** To think even Izou would say this to him...Molay truly is a pitiable man...

**Okada Izo:** What did you say!?

**Jacques de Molay:** Please unhand me, Da Vinci!

**Jacques de Molay:** This humiliation of mine shall be rectified here! To do so, I would stop at nothing!

**Mash:** Eh, umm───Heroic Spirit Molay, please calm yourself!

**Jacques de Molay:** I would...!

**First Hassan:** O heathen...

**First Hassan:** Is that truly resolve? Are foolhardiness and recklessness the virtues of thy god?

**Jacques de Molay:** !!

**Jacques de Molay:** I...I───

**Da Vinci:** Thank goodness! He's been attempting a charge and wouldn't listen to me.

**Da Vinci:** In any case, I'm glad we somehow managed to stop him. Thank you, umm...Mister...

**First Hassan:** Old Man of the Mountain. I am Hassan-i-Sabbah.

**Da Vinci:** {i}That{/i} Old Man of the Mountain!? What an intimidating aura!

**Da Vinci:** As expected of one who became a legend in life, you truly are in a different league!

**Merlin:** I'm in total agreement. It's really convincing coming from the legendary genius herself.

**Merlin:** As for our enemies in this domain...hmm, the Demon Beast Incarnadine and Shadow Servants!

**Merlin:** Just like the lineup from earlier.

**Merlin:** And the Heroic Spirits who will miraculously stand against them are───

**Okada Izo:** That'll be me!

**Medusa:** I'm here too. Not yet, Izou. Not quite yet.

**Okada Izo:** Rider, you think I'm a dog or something after all, is that it...?

**Georgios:** I am present as well!

**Georgios:** Much like Sir Molay, I too have come forth to rectify my sins in that Singularity!

**Georgios:** The Great Bewitching Queen who cants the Great Grail,

**Georgios:** in other words, the great evil spoken of in the Book of Revelation!

**Georgios:** In which case, thou art a dragon! I swear upon my Ascalon!

**Georgios:** I shall decapitate───one of those heads of yours!

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** We are present too! Unfit as we may be, we would like to offer our assistance───

**First Hassan:** Cursed Arm, hast thou redressed some of thy hesitations in life?

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** Lord Founder!?

**Mata Hari:** Is something the matter, Hassan? You're shouting all of a sudden.

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** N-n-n-n-n-no, I see.

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** Seeing how the world is on the brink of destruction,

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** the Lord Founder's advent does make sense!

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** How auspicious. What great fortune───I shall savor the joy of fighting alongside you!

**First Hassan:** Very well. Thou shalt endeavour as a Heroic Spirit.

**First Hassan:** Thou canst offer thy head after all is said and done with.

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** U-understood!

**Jacques de Molay:** ────────

**Jacques de Molay:** ───Vermin swarming all over the place.

**Jacques de Molay:** Very well then. Bring it on. I shall exterminate you as an Apostle of Lust.

**Jacques de Molay:** I have partaken of the overflowing Great Grail!

**Jacques de Molay:** Know that I have reached heights unachievable by common Heroic Spirits!

**Mash:** Magical energy levels, rising! Such a tremendous amount!

**Merlin:** This much magical energy despite that incomplete Saint Graph, huh!?

**Merlin:** Looks like we have a tough enemy on our hands!

**Jacques de Molay:** Ugh...! I...I...!

**Mash:** This voice is...!

## Lost Jerusalem Part 2

**Nitocris:** Pay close attention! And now, behold!

**Nitocris:** For this is the advent of splendor! The splendor of Pharaoh Ozymandias!

**Ozymandias:** Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

**Ozymandias:** Your supreme Pharaoh just happened to be passing by!

**Ozymandias:** And by complete coincidence, also passing by in the form of Amon-Ra!

**Ozymandias:** On a pleasure cruise, that is!

**Ozymandias:** But what is this? The knight who was in charge of guiding the pilgrims on their travels...

**Ozymandias:** That is only one shadow, and furthermore, only one Demon Beast Incarnadine.

**Ozymandias:** To be afraid of such minor pests is a complete farce!

**Ozymandias:** Have you forgotten when you opposed my majesty, wretch!?

**Mash:** Pharaoh Ozymandias! No, Amon-Ra!

**Jacques de Molay:** ...!

**Nitocris:** Bask in the Pharaoh's splendor! How long shall you wallow in your dejection!?

**Nitocris:** If you can open your eyes, then stand and take up your sword.

**Nitocris:** He has allowed you especially to stand alongside his radiant majesty and do battle.

**Jacques de Molay:** Your concern is well appreciated...

**Jacques de Molay:** For mine is the shield of faith───my oaths, unshakable and unbreakable.

**Jacques de Molay:** I believe, here and now, that it will never crack again! So swear we of the Knights Templar!

**Merlin:** Oh Hassan, do I hear a small chuckle from you?

**Merlin:** Have you come to empathize with your one-time nemesis?

**First Hassan:** It seems that not merely the tongue,

**First Hassan:** but the observation of the extradimensional Magus of Flowers is too quick to judge.

**Merlin:** Trying to tell me I'm misunderstanding things? Fair enough, I'll leave it there.

**Jacques de Molay:** ──────Tsk.

**Jacques de Molay:** Don't get cocky just from recruiting a pseudo-Demon God Pillar.

**Jacques de Molay:** That thing falters in comparison to the Holy Grail...

**Jacques de Molay:** I am secure in its power, in its inexhaustible magic energy!

**Jacques de Molay:** I am...!

**First Hassan:** Hold thy tongue, lest it speak your last will.

**First Hassan:** If thou art a shadow, speak only the truth when nearing your death.

**Jacques de Molay:** What's that...? My desires are no falsehood...!

**Jacques de Molay:** I won't let you have your way. By my life and my regrets, you will be stopped here!

**Jacques de Molay:** ───Say your prayers, my hideous shadow!

## Lost Jerusalem Post-Battle and Babylon Part 1

**Mash:** ───Hostile Shadow Servant destroyed. The Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!

**Da Vinci:** We did it! Good job, everybody!

**Ozymandias:** Victory should come as no surprise! Who else but I could have ascended to your aid?

**Ozymandias:** Hmph, but that Da Vinci girl's form is rather beautiful in itself.

**Nitocris:** Oh, Lord Ozymandias. You've returned to your normal Saint Graph?

**Ozymandias:** Do not be so formal, Nitocris. This is the proper form for a celebration and mopping-up.

**Nitocris:** Y-yes!

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** ───Lady Mash, Master of Chaldea, leave the rest to us.

**Cursed Arm Hassan:** Please go ahead while the gates of the domain are open!

**Mata Hari:** Don't give in before you reach the end. May fortune be with you!

**Jacques de Molay:** God's blessings on your path to conquest, Mash and Master of Chaldea!

**Mash:** Yes! Let's go, Master...!

**Merlin:** We have to be prepared for more than just Demon Beast Incarnadines in the next domain.

**First Hassan:** ───Let us conquer them all.

**Mash:** We have reached the seventh domain!

**Tiamat:** Mash...?

**Tiamat:** Mash. Mash! And Master too!

**Tiamat:** Mother is so happy to see her children again!

**Tiamat:** What good and darling children.

**Mash:** Y-yes...

**Merlin:** Suddenly, they're both like putty in her hands! Hmm, is this a bunrei of Divine Spirit Tiamat?

**Lancelot:** RRRRrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrr!

**Sakata Kintoki:** That's right, Tiamat! At least try to read the mood a little here!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Breaking out the good mother moves in this tense atmosphere ain't hardly golden!

**Tiamat:** Are you sulking, Kintoki? Come over here.

**Sakata Kintoki:** It ain't a matter of sulking───

**Sakata Kintoki:** aw man, she's got more power to drag me away than Shuten ever had!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Mmph.

**Tiamat:** There, there. You're a good boy, Kintoki.

**Lancelot:** RRRRrrrrrRRRRRrrrr!

**Draco:** Quite a few, indeed...

**Draco:** A few morsels, indeed. Do not underestimate a mere bunrei or shadow, Tiamat.

**Draco:** Very well. This once, I shall forgive you.

**Draco:** There is no King of Babylon here this time. No need to manipulate a king,

**Draco:** nor to devour any city of prosperity.

**Draco:** All who have shown their faces are Heroic Spirits guided here by some incomprehensible miracle.

**Draco:** How dull───

**Draco:** I share that sentiment as well.

**Draco:** Were I able to appear before my “foolish self” in the second domain,

**Draco:** I would tear off my uncle's head and play a game of catch with her...

**Draco:** But this is the domain entrusted to me. I never thought I would have to face all of you again.

**Draco:** But all is well. The Master of Chaldea has arrived at last.

**Draco:** The spare time and tedium ends now! I shall drink up every last one of you!

**Tiamat:** No, you won't! If you try to drink everything, Mother will be mad!

**Tiamat:** To protect Mash and Master, I will become a shield of dragon scales!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Sounds good! Then I'll be the blade!

**Sakata Kintoki:** And I'm gonna have to be an electric blade. I can hear the voices calling me.

**Mash:** Voices...?

**Sakata Kintoki:** Yeah, but obviously not any of yours. They're more faint and weak.

**Sakata Kintoki:** “There's too much bitterness to bear.”

**Sakata Kintoki:** That's what countless voices shouted the moment the world was burned.

**Sakata Kintoki:** I wonder how many things they would've wanted to do?

**Sakata Kintoki:** A mom making dinner, a kid who wanted to play the day after.

**Sakata Kintoki:** I've got no idea... It's enough to make me grind my teeth.

**Sakata Kintoki:** Whoever doesn't understand how important all those things are...

**Sakata Kintoki:** I don't know what's between the ears of them!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Before you start talking about humanity's future, Draco,

**Sakata Kintoki:** I'm gonna smash your stupid nature back to normalcy!

**Sakata Kintoki:** For every day that's gone to waste since this place was burned to ash,

**Sakata Kintoki:** I'm gonna kick your ass for everyone that couldn't make the most of them!

**Sakata Kintoki:** I'm Kintoki, Sakata Kintoki. One of Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings who heard those sounds!

**Lancelot:** RRRRrrrRRRRRRRrr!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Let's go, buddy! Restrain the demons and smash the rakshasas!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Split the heaven and earth, tearing up space and Demon Beast Incarnadines with it!

**Sakata Kintoki:** Hell yeah, now here's the treasured blade of fiery lightning coming to kill you dead!

**Sakata Kintoki:** ───The one and only Golden Spark!

**Draco:** Very good. Shout and defy me!

**Draco:** Entertain me by changing the flavor of your dying moments with all you can muster,

**Draco:** human history!

## Babylon Part 2

**Gilgamesh:** ───Some bewitching queen this Draco is!

**Gilgamesh:** A mere husk whose contents rest on the throne. Worthless.

**Merlin:** Wow. Could he be...?

**Sakata Kintoki:** It's you...!

**Mash:** King Nebuchadnezzar! N-no...!

**Tiamat:** Gilgamesh the 2.5th!

**Tiamat:** The aura seems different...it's changed? Maybe it's his hairstyle?

**Tiamat:** Maybe it's...the declaration to join us as an ally!?

**Tiamat:** Thank you. Mother is so glad.

**Tiamat:** I want to hug you tightly as thanks... Will you come here?

**Gilgamesh:** What is that form? Why has the Divine Spirit Tiamat shrunken so?

**Gilgamesh:** But first thing's first...

**Gilgamesh:** What did you say when you saw me?

**Mash:** U-uhm...

**Lancelot:** RrrrRRrr?

**Sakata Kintoki:** Right, right. Tiamat called him Gilgamesh the 2.5th.

**Sakata Kintoki:** (Mm...)

**Sakata Kintoki:** (She didn't get it wrong, did she? I know that Nebuchadnezzar was the 2.5th.)

**Merlin:** Huh? What?

**First Hassan:** Gilgamesh the 2.5th is what was said.

**Gilgamesh:** !

**Gilgamesh:** ...!

**Gilgamesh:** That. What is the meaning of Gilgamesh the 2.5th!?

**Gilgamesh:** Be quick, concise, and convincing in your explanation!

**Gilgamesh:** Now, the 2nd. That at least would be pleasant.

**Gilgamesh:** It's not as though that's beyond the realm of understanding.

**Gilgamesh:** But───what is this 2.5th to mean?

**Tiamat:** Huh.

**Tiamat:** Huh? What?

**Tiamat:** The familiar feeling of this Saint Graph,

**Tiamat:** its body and soul...you don't suppose this is...

**Tiamat:** The real one?

**Sakata Kintoki:** (So Tiamat did get it all wrong!?)

**Gilgamesh:** What is this reaction about, you mongrels!?

**Gilgamesh:** What is the meaning of calling me the real one!?

**Enkidu:** Hahahahaha. This is kind of amusing.

**Gilgamesh:** Not for me!

**Enkidu:** Gil, if you care so much, why don't you just use one of your Noble Phantasms?

**Gilgamesh:** Nonsense! To think I would use my Noble Phantasm of omniscience for such a trifle!?

**Gilgamesh:** What am I to say to Siduri in the underworld if I disgraced myself so───

**Enkidu:** Oh, were you planning to pass through the underworld on your way back?

**Enkidu:** Since when did you find fault with Siduri's lecturing?

**Gilgamesh:** Hmph...I have no objection to one that proves itself necessary.

**Gilgamesh:** And she has never volunteered advice out of turn.

**Enkidu:** Sure, whatever you say.

**Gilgamesh:** Enkidu!

**Draco:** ...

**Draco:** ──My, my. And now comes the last mouthful.

**Draco:** You act out a comedy before me, the Beast's retainer.

**Draco:** In mere seconds, you will find repentance in a pool of your own blood.

**Draco:** Cry out in agony and beg forgiveness.

**Draco:** Moan in despair and pray for salvation in death.

**Draco:** I deny all things. I shall devour your souls whole.

**Draco:** That which is sin stirs to form the finest wine.

**Draco:** Its tastes are terrors and agonies continuing without end.

**Draco:** How can the world of mere Heroic Spirits, mere imitations of Divine Spirits,

**Draco:** or even that of the King of Heroes even compare?

**Draco:** So long as you are human, you cannot stand against my reason.

**Draco:** You can but merely bow down.

**Gilgamesh:** Call me Gilgamesh the Sage-King, not the King of Heroes.

**Gilgamesh:** This is a Saint Graph well-suited for a mongrel of your ilk, Draco.

**Gilgamesh:** I shall quickly and brilliantly settle matters with you,

**Gilgamesh:** before addressing the issue of “Gilgamesh the 2.5th”.

**Gilgamesh:** Now come────I can taste without end the mud brought forth by prosperity.

**Draco:** You dare───

## Babylon Post-Battle and Lilim Harlot Prologue

**Mash:** Confirmed annihilation of Bewitching Queen Draco's incomplete Saint Graph!

**Tiamat:** It's because she made mother furious! Hmph!

**Tiamat:** And an angry mother is strong. Tee-hee.

**Enkidu:** Fufu. How cute of you, mother.

**Tiamat:** Ahem!

**Gilgamesh:** Don't ahem me, dear sweet goddess Tiamat. I'm asking you what Gilgamesh 2.5 even means.

**Tiamat:** Ohh, what overbearing pressure...leave this to your mother and go on ahead!

**Merlin:** I think it's best if we actually take her advice. Look there!

**Mash:** Y-yes. The final gate at the end of the domain───it's opening up!

**Tiamat:** Do your best! Mother will be here praying for your safety!

**Sakata Kintoki:** This is the final great golden decisive showdown! Do me a solid and give it your best shot!

**Lancelot:** (RRRRRrrrrrRRRRRR)

---

**Mash:** Mash Kyrielight and her Master will now go beyond the final gate...!

**Mash:** And reach the throne!

**Merlin:** Well, the final battle is upon us. Are you ready?

**First Hassan:** ───

**Merlin:** It goes without saying, eh? We've gone beyond the gate now───

**Mash:** The magical energy quantity is immeasurable...it's First-Class Planetary Grade!

**Merlin:** The throne is in sight. I see, so the one seated there is the true Great Bewitching Queen.

**Merlin:** Deceiving “Chaldea” by mimicking the seven Singularities and linking many worlds together,

**Merlin:** and as nourishment for maturation,

**Merlin:** the wishes of the “saviors who brought salvation unto the world”───

**Merlin:** The Evil of Humanity who amassed the “wishes” of countless Chaldeas,

**Merlin:** each in parallel worlds, within the Grail and drank from it.

**Merlin:** Class Beast. The Sixth Beast.

**Merlin:** Or perhaps I should put it this way───Beast VI, the true form of Sodom's Beast.

**Sodom's Beast:** ...

**Sodom's Beast:** Precisely. My Authority of the Beast is Nega-Messiah. I am the one who ridicules, slaughters and consumes the Savior.

**Sodom's Beast:** Cherishing the “wishes of the masses” is fine and all, but it provides no nourishment whatsoever.

**Sodom's Beast:** The Chaldea who vanquished the First Beast in this universe. And its Master. You who exist in a multitude of worlds.

**Sodom's Beast:** The only “wish” that will suffice in growing my horns is the wish to “save the world”.

**Sodom's Beast:** It is for this reason that the Singularities exist, that the Holy Grail War exists. Your “battles” were succulent indeed.

**Mash:** Then...the very act of competing for the Holy Grail results in Beast VI's growth...!?

**Sodom's Beast:** Correct. As a result, you lot have reached this realm.

**Sodom's Beast:** The graveyard of many prosperities. A banquet table adorned by the rot of many Human Orders.

**Sodom's Beast:** This realm isn't just “the end of some history”. It prophesies the end of your human history.

**Sodom's Beast:** ───In other words, this is a fate written in stone that your world will reach in a few years from now.

**Sodom's Beast:** I am the one who savors that end. For fruits are best savored when they are on the verge of rotting.

**Sodom's Beast:** You have no cause to defy me, given that you have beheld the future. O Earthlings, perish before my fangs.

**Sodom's Beast:** You have my gratitude too. You did well “getting this far” once more.

**Sodom's Beast:** Chaldea may have raised me, but it is an inevitability of the Human Order to beckon the apocalypse.

**Sodom's Beast:** For Beasts are weak, and alone they cannot scar the world.

**Sodom's Beast:** Only you humans are capable of destroying the world.

**Sodom's Beast:** This repulsive scenery is what the masses desired.

**Sodom's Beast:** I am merely a Beast revelling in it. This outcome is one not even I can change.

**Sodom's Beast:** So hold your heads high. That desire has led to the completion of humanity's extermination here.

**Mash:** The desire of the masses... To find greater enjoyment. To live in greater comfort.

**Mash:** Born from this inclination of humanity's is the self-ruination that lies at the end of prosperity.

**Mash:** I understand that. It is an inevitability of life. So───that in itself is not evil.

**Mash:** I understand that it's not evil.

**Sodom's Beast:** ───Is that so? Then what is evil to you?

**Mash:** People's lives. Their feelings. Their memories. The ones who ridicule these are evil.

**Mash:** If this scenery lies at the end of the Human Order,

**Mash:** then we shall continue to move forward, seeking it.

**Mash:** However!

**Mash:** I will not accept you, you who treat those as mere amusements!

**Mash:** Beast VI! Beast of Calamity!

**Mash:** At a place elsewhere, at a Chaldea that is not our own,

**Mash:** “someone” fought until the very end! To not lose to them, this “Chaldea” here will defeat you!

**Merlin:** ───!

**Sodom's Beast:** ──────!

**Merlin:** ───Wonderful. Oh, how wonderful, stargazing knight!

**Merlin:** That's right, I'm sick and tired of that inevitable end!

**Merlin:** After all, it takes a sourpuss to think the end can happen anytime so long as it's a happy ending!

**Merlin:** I happen to be rather greedy. Far greedier than any Master here in this Holy Grail War.

**Merlin:** I have no wish to see the end! I want to see a happiness that lasts forever and ever!

**Sodom's Beast:** I see───So we are incompatible existences after all, Beast of the Planet.

**Merlin:** Woah there, don't say any more than that. I still haven't told a single soul about that yet.

**Merlin:** Well then, we both know where the other is coming from!

**Merlin:** It's time for us irreconciliable archenemies to settle our differences!

**Merlin:** Our enemy is Beast VI/S!

**Merlin:** The incarnation of decadency───

**Merlin:** that which continues to gaze upon the unsightliest of things───

**Merlin:** in the unsightliest of worlds!

**First Hassan:** The Evening Bell's moment draws near. Do not fall behind, child!

**Mash:** ───Roger that, Master. Commencing anti-Beast combat!

**Sodom's Beast:** Hnn───

**Sodom's Beast:** You remain unbroken in spite of this ugly showing. You continue to struggle in the face of such desolation.

**Sodom's Beast:** And that is fine. For this is how you ought to be.

**Sodom's Beast:** Though it may be a feat the other Beasts are incapable of achieving, the “Human Order Annihilation” is little more than the main dish.

**Sodom's Beast:** A delicacy it may be, but not one I haven't tasted multiple times before.

**Sodom's Beast:** I have long since grown tired of its taste. I have but one desire that brings me joy───

**Sodom's Beast:** That swell of splendor blessed by the masses. In the midst of the filth of greed that envelops the heavens,

**Sodom's Beast:** a pitiful gem continues to shine regardless. To grasp it within my fingers.

**Noah:** I swear, you and Draco are cut from the same cloth.

**Noah:** Well, I suppose it's to be expected, since we're talking about the real thing and its aspect.

**Noah:** However───it's precisely because you continue to lounge around like that!

**Noah:** That you snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like this!

**Noah:** Of course! Who else but me would appear gallantly as a comrade in this place and time!

**Noah:** Chieftain of the survivors of the Great Flood, heir to the eldest survivor Utnapishtim!

**Noah:** The fair youth of salvation, Noah!

**Noah:** I have traversed the sea of blood, alongside the radiance of Zohar!

**Noah:** That said, I'm not much of a fighter.

**Noah:** In exchange, I've brought a special helping hand along for a ride!

**Merlin:** Here it comes! You did it! Now that's what I'm talking about!

**Arthur:** Merlin...

**Arthur:** There's a lot I'd like to ask you, Merlin.

**Arthur:** Why are you here in this world? Why did you send me to that distant world all alone?

**Arthur:** But I shall refrain for now. I've been informed of everything by Rider, Noah!

**Mash:** You're───

**Arthur:** It would seem I've barely made it in time.

**Arthur:** Pleased to make your acquaintance, Chaldean Master of this world.

**Arthur:** And Mash Kyrielight of this world! I am───

**Arthur:** I am one who hunts the Beast. The wanderer on a journey across the many worlds.

**Arthur:** ───My True Name is Arthur Pendragon!

**Mash:** Arthur Pendragon! The King of Knights sung of in Britain's legends, the Red Dragon!

**Arthur:** When L and R are both present, so too will S and G manifest under either sky...

**Arthur:** Everything is in accordance with Merlin's prophecy.

**Arthur:** I have traversed many a world for this moment.

**Arthur:** Know that the Holy Sword of the Planet will not let you escape───even if we are worlds apart.

**Arthur:** That avarice! That pride!

**Arthur:** I shall close the curtains on them on this very day, at this very moment, at this very place!

**Arthur:** ───Beast VI, Sodom's Beast!

## Lilim Harlot Main

**First Hassan:** ──────

**First Hassan:** O beast of depravity. O dragon who partakes of filth from the golden grail.

**First Hassan:** The sound of that bell───

**First Hassan:** Nay. The radiance of that star.

**First Hassan:** Have you witnessed it once more? With those gleaming childlike eyes of yours.

**Sodom's Beast:** ───To think you would address me in that manner. You haven't changed, old man.

**Sodom's Beast:** Oh, I see it well enough... Radiant even in the midst of this foulness.

**First Hassan:** ───That will do. O Knight of the Holy Sword, tis thy turn.

**Arthur:** Yes!

**Arthur:** ───<ruby>Thirteenth seal, release<rt>Seal Thirteen</rt></ruby>! ───<ruby>Round Table decision, start<rt>Decision Start</rt></ruby>!

**Merlin:** Two Grand Heroic Spirits plus the Knight of the Holy Sword,

**Merlin:** a Beast slayer who traverses the worlds.

**Merlin:** The end is in sight. The Chaldea that you have preyed upon so many times now,

**Merlin:** will bare their fangs at you right at the very end! Go on, grumble and protest!

**Sodom's Beast:** ───Hmph. What a loathsome succubus you are.

**Sodom's Beast:** Mash Kyrielight. O stargazing knight.

**Sodom's Beast:** You claimed you would not avert your eyes from this future. That you would only fight against the evil that I am.

**Sodom's Beast:** I hereby ask of that pitifully innocent heart of yours.

**Sodom's Beast:** You said yourself that everything has an end.

**Sodom's Beast:** That much is true. However───

**Sodom's Beast:** When all of creation disappears, who will be there to witness that end?

**Mash:** ...that is...

**Sodom's Beast:** Yes. That is the epitome of sorrow. The epitome of anguish.

**Sodom's Beast:** I am the Evil that was born to deliver that sorrow.

**Sodom's Beast:** The Human Order, human history.

**Sodom's Beast:** You lot speak of it as though it were something of great importance.

**Sodom's Beast:** There is truth to those claims.

**Sodom's Beast:** After all, it has the strength to resist me right up to the very end like this.

**Sodom's Beast:** Since I possess magical energy of the First-Class Planetary Grade,

**Sodom's Beast:** I am already an existence far above the likes of you.

**Sodom's Beast:** Then...it is none other than I,

**Sodom's Beast:** who feasted upon the most prosperous city that reached the extremity of civilization,

**Sodom's Beast:** who can lusciously savor it more than anyone else, down to the very last drop, no?

**Mash:** T-then, you're...

**Mash:** Out of curiosity───

**Mash:** The world───

**Sodom's Beast:** What an inelegant way of phrasing it. Here's how you put it into words beautifully:

**Sodom's Beast:** Desire!!

**Sodom's Beast:** My greed and avarice! That is to say, I wish to “savor and consume more”!

**Sodom's Beast:** Behold an Evil of Humanity,

**Sodom's Beast:** the driving force behind the development of civilizations and their downfall!

**Sodom's Beast:** Rejoice, children of Chaldea!

**Sodom's Beast:** The world shall disappear now at the hands of my dearly insatiable gluttony!

**Sodom's Beast:** And at the very end, in a barren, lifeless void, I shall proclaim thus:

**Sodom's Beast:** ───“What a wonderful meal.”

**Mash:** !!

**Mash:** Right... Right, Master! We have to stop her!

**Mash:** Right here! Right now!

## Lilim Harlot Post-Battle and Epilogue

**Mash:** We...we did it...

**Mash:** We did it, Senpai! Yes, yes! We...!

**Mash:** ...vanquished Beast VI/S...!

**Mash:** Last Order, completed! As of this moment, the Grand Order has concluded!

**Merlin:** Mash! Master!

**Merlin:** You did great, well and truly!

**Merlin:** I never even imagined that you would triumph without a single casualty.

**Merlin:** I thought we'd lose one of you, like we did against the First Beast.

**Merlin:** But it would seem my fears were unfounded.

**Merlin:** That's a relief. After all, there is no Cath Palug in this world───

**Mash:** ...?

**Merlin:** It's complicated, and you're better off not knowing about it anyway.

**Merlin:** You'll soon be forgetting what you heard just now. I'm sorry. And thank you.

**Merlin:** Let's celebrate, for starters! Thanks to your efforts, the Human Order of this world is saved!

**First Hassan:** Hmm. The annihilation of the Human Order may have been averted, however...

**Merlin:** However?

**First Hassan:** Gaze upon what lies behind you.

**Merlin:** Heh, you're not going to scare me that easily───Oh.

**Merlin:** H-hey there, if it isn't my beloved Arthur! You're acting all tense, what's gotten into you?

**Arthur:** That's not the problem here! You've been playing up the recluse angle, Merlin!

**Arthur:** But if you can come out just like that,

**Arthur:** then there's no reason for me to continue wandering the worlds alone───

**Merlin:** A-www! You're putting me on the spot here!

**Merlin:** I was watching Mash and Master's journey,

**Merlin:** and while it may have been a harsh one it seemed fun nonetheless,

**Merlin:** and that's how it is!

**Arthur:** Because it seemed fun!?

**Arthur:** Ok...listen up Merlin. You know,

**Arthur:** I've been travelling the worlds in accordance with your prophecy,

**Arthur:** searching for L and R at that Chaldea from far away───

**Arthur:** There I kept awaiting the continuation of the prophecy, for portents of S and G. And yet...

**Arthur:** You intervened, an intervention unprophesied and unplanned. Just because it seemed fun!?

**Merlin:** Waahh, save me, Noah!

**Noah:** No, you reap what you sow. Go break a leg!

**Merlin:** Ugh~!

**Mash:** Incoming message from Chaldea───it says that our retrieval process is underway!

**Mash:** Yes... Well, unfortunate as it may be, this is where we bid you farewell.

**First Hassan:** Fear not, for fate already binds us.

**Noah:** This need not necessarily be the final farewell.

**Noah:** The same applies for those Heroic Spirits you have encountered in the Singularities thus far.

**Noah:** We'll meet again someday! When the time comes!

**Mash:** Yes...

**Merlin:** Head home now, both of you. Hold your heads high.

**Merlin:** After all, this is your momentous triumphant return!

**Merlin:** Oh, that's right───I have one piece of good news for you.

**Merlin:** The condition outside the Chaldea base appears to be in a once-in-a-year state right now.

**Merlin:** That is to say, the blizzard has subsided! You really shouldn't miss this chance!

**Mash:** Then───is the sky really...?

**Merlin:** A special, blue sky.

**Mash:** From our era, our Earth───

**Mash:** Yes... Yes! Master!

**Mash:** Let's go see that blue sky of ours!
