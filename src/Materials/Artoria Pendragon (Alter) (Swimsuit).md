## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: B**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage Artoria Alter who has this rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if she was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.
… Because Artoria is being tainted by a Dark Attribute, her Magical Resistance has declined a rank.

**Riding: B**

The ability for riding. Most vehicles and beasts can be managed with above-average skill, even those that did not exist in the time period one lived in for they are not an exception to this Skill.
Large motorbikes can also be handled as a matter of course. Speaking of Alter, her motorbike is a cuirassier.

**Independent Action: EX**

The ability to be able to act even with the absence of one’s Master.
Although there is a master Artoria Alter ought to serve, that is a separate matter. She acquired the menacing Independent Action Skill from the belief that a maid’s service mentality should be free… a service that should be voluntary, and not be forced into doing by anyone else. As a result of possessing this Skill, her normal Parameters have lowered somewhat.

## Personal Skills

**Summer Sweeper!: A**

A Magical Burst Skill that has been transformed for a maid’s use.
An expert at washing anything away with cold water. While increasing her own serviceability (the ability to quickly perform service well), Artoria Alter strictly supervises the whole party, improving their morale.

**Coaching: A**

The Artoria Alter of the seaside is also a cold-blooded governess (female private tutor). By means of a strict education and guidance, she corrects erroneous battle styles. Since she is quite Spartan, those coached by her incur great damage.
It is a rare Skill called ‘Skill Recharge’, but it is difficult to use. Maid is not fit to be a meathead though, so she can use it despite its difficulty.

**Reloaded: C**

The water gun Alter fires can have her Magical Energy added to its shots; something like Magical Burst (Water) so to speak, and yet this is something even more elaborately applied compared to that. Given that its recharge time is short, it is fine to either use it without reserve, or to aim for a one-hit kill by using Coaching on herself together with this to pile up the Magical Energy from a double reload into a single bullet – a Heartbreak Bullet. This is the maid etiquette from Maid’s home of England.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Secace Morgan: The Sword of Tenaciously Blazing Victory
* Rank: A
* Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
* Range: 10~50
* Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A combination Noble Phantasm between Excalibur and Secace – a short sword possessed by King Arthur that can “only be carried into mortal combat situations.” Secace takes a shape similar to a small automatic pistol, but it becomes a large sniper rifle by combining with Excalibur, used to repel the filthy foreign enemies before they can enter her “master’s dominion”. No matter how one views it, it is, really, an anti-materiel rifle, but— (the rest of the statement is omitted)

# Character

## Pronouns

* First Person Pronoun: watashi
* Second Person Pronouns: omae / kisama / ○○ (without honorifics)
* Third Person Pronouns: Master / ○○ (name without honorifics) / goshujin-sama (My Lord) (in moments when Artoria Alter is strictly scolding/educating)

## Personality

Alter – who is a different side of the King of Britain, Artoria Pendragon – has again awakened to another conviction. Welcoming summer, Artoria was encouraged by re-examining herself not as simply a tyrant, but as a mere waitress.
“I follow what’s being said, but I really don’t follow how it resulted in such a thing.”
In order to make the summer the Master is spending time for something even better, Artoria, of course, chose the path of a maid. Because said person intends to hide the fact that she is Artoria, she is disguising even her equipment as various objects.

Excalibur as a mop. Secace as a pistol. Her combat style converted to that of a modern soldier’s.
Mowing down opponents with a mop, stopping their movements with a pistol, and blowing them up with grenades.
Such is a maid.

## Attitude Towards Master

Artoria Alter declares that she serves not as a Servant, but as a maid. And as the person in charge of their education, she supervises the Master around the clock for the sake of making them into a Master who can stand on their own; a Spartan maid. She assesses that her cold-hearted behaviour and strict words are all for the Master’s future. She has a summer sweeper (cleaning shop) as well, making use of it to remove anything and everything that would become an obstacle to the Master with all her energy. Since there is no king’s crown with her, there will also be a girlish side to her appropriate for her age that appears more often than the times when she was in the Saber Class. Though she will coolly pout if that does not matter to the Master.

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Rider. I am Artoria Pendragon. Since I came here, I will get you to prepare for the ideal livelihood. I will not allow you to go back to sleep nor permit a lack of exercise. Cleaning and laundry are to be done thoroughly. And c-cooking… I can do too; I will show you what I can do… within my scope.”

“Hah. It is also natural to be surprised. For you see, even I am surprised. Contrary to expectations, a swimsuit is fine too!”

“I appear before you in a new Class. And I shall get the better of this Ishtar Cup and whatnot; then shall I reign as the strongest maid.”

“I am serving you as a maid. Therefore, I cannot turn a blind eye to a negligence of duties.
————Go on, get out there and get to work!”

## Character in FGO

Even if it is Alter, she will wear a swimsuit. It is summer after all. But because of some kind of conviction she found, she had put away the King’s crown and had instead put on a touchingly lovely white crown————a white brim.
Yes. She is a maid.

Tempted by the Magical Energy of Summer, Alter completely changed her clothes for a swimsuit (though the person herself has not realized it, nor will she speak about it).
“I am absolutely not what you would commonly call a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit. If you want to know why, it is because before being a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit, I am firstly a maid.”
Indeed, it is a sound argument that leaves one lost for words. However, her personality, which was already too serious since the beginning, got even more serious by becoming a maid. She changed into a Demonic Head Maid who will in no way overlook the undisciplined Master.

Artoria Alter enters the Ishtar Cup together with Nero. Their team name, “Tyrant Shooting Star”, was her idea. It is a fitting name for a miraculous team in which a famously selfish emperor and a tyrant maid joined hands.

Concerning the race, Artoria Alter’s motive for entering it is to show everyone that she is the strongest. She justifiably wants a (physical) reward, but apart from that, she feels that it is fine to participate in it since it is on behalf of the Master.

Nero regards that “All the other teams are rivals”, but for Alter, there is no team that would make her feel the emotion of “I definitely cannot be defeated by these fellows.” Nero and Alter. Although they are a pair whose rhythms do not match with each other since Nero aims to actively participate and have fun in the race while Artoria aims to vent out her violent impulses (stress) and win a reward, they still joined forces to participate in the Ishtar Cup.

Artoria Alter has no motivation at all to probe into the truth hidden within the race. Because she is under the impression that she is being cheered on the most by the Protagonist, her spirit happens to be constantly in a good mood. Though such a thing really cannot be seen from her outward appearances.

Artoria Alter’s racing policy is “to race without going easy on anyone.” Nero steps on the accelerator without thinking of the consequences, and Alter uses the nitro despite thinking about the consequences. Nero views “Beauty and Speed” as supreme, while Alter views “Simplicity and Speed” as supreme. One half of their views are in conflict, but because the other half perfectly have the same rhythm, they are two people whom staggeringly got along well with each other as a matter of fact… As expected, is this not a miraculous team then?

## Related Characters

**Nero (Caster)**

Her intolerable teammate. Someone like a Roman Emperor is nothing more than a target to rebel against. But anyhow, Artoria Alter cannot help but acknowledge Nero’s talent in celebrating life.

Artoria Alter heard about Japan’s strongest housekeeper. If there is an opportunity, she will certainly want to have a bout with this person.

Artoria Alter heard about a distinguished chef of hell. If there is an opportunity, she will certainly want to receive guidance from this person.

## Comment from the Illustrator

For Swimsuit Alter, I got to send out all the design materials I wanted to do. The fact is, the maid component was planned to be one of those materials, but it should be said that it was to be expected, for that became the attire that has the most impact, don’t you think? She became quite the luxurious character where even her animation motions change in each of her Saint Graph stages. For the design of Alter’s water gun, I got Mr. Hirai Yukio to be in charge of that. In each stage, actual firearms were used as the motifs, and I got to finish the designs by mixing in an Altered composition into them. (Takeuchi Takashi)
