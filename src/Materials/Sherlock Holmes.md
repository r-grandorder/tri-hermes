## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: EX**

Although there is no need for him to create a territory for a Magic Workshop like ordinary Casters, by continuously expanding a large library of memory within his head like the Jesuit Matteo Ricci, Holmes gains a bonus in all of his knowledge checks.

## Personal Skills

**Inherent Insight: A++**

The faculty to perceive the essence of things. A keen eye for observation that will never overlook any sort of information. Although their principles are completely different from each other, this can perform foresight that is even no different than the precognition done by means of Clairvoyance. If one succeeds in their Luck Check during the cases that it is used against Servants, it will even find out about a truth that was firmly hidden by means of Magecraft, Noble Phantasms and the like.

**Abduction: Hypothetical Reasoning: A+**

A kind of logical inference and induction in a wide sense of the word.

It is an inference in itself when related to the study of logic, but when Holmes uses it occasionally with the process of elimination, it reaches the level of a special ability. Moreover, Holmes occasionally makes use of deduction methods as well. This Skill is no more than one of his reasoning methods.

**Baritsu: B++**

One has learned a martial art of the Orient that is extremely suitable for actual combat.

Besides making use of striking techniques that had this Skill and boxing combined and incorporated into them, Sherlock Holmes also uses counters and throwing techniques as his specialties too. If conditions are satisfied, it can even further be utilized as a special move that is on the class of a Noble Phantasm’s True Name Release, but…

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Elementary, My Dear: It’s Elementary, My Friend
* Rank: B
* Classifications: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm / Anti-World Noble Phantasm
* Ranges: 0 / –
* Maximum Numbers of Targets: 1 person / –

The Noble Phantasm that Sherlock Holmes ended up possessing when he is materialized as a Heroic Spirit and Servant. It is his own Origin – “Elucidation” – sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.

Even if the enigma he faces is truly an existence that is impossible to explain, the clues and the path for its explanation will “appear” to Holmes’ advantage so that he can finally arrive at the truth of it without fail. For instance, even if there was a treasure chest where its key was lost, said key will turn out to be “not lost.” It reaches the point that the key can certainly be discovered in someplace in the world. (But as one would expect, it will not do things such as making the key suddenly appear in the middle of his hand. Wherever it may be located, Holmes and his collaborators must make efforts to find it.)

It is primarily a Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type, but Holmes can perform its True Name Release in “Fate/Grand Order”. At the moment of its True Name Release, an unidentified “sphere” makes its appearance, releasing a dazzling light on the surrounding areas. It weakens the enemy camp and strengthens the allied camp. Even if the opponent is supposed to be unbeatable, Holmes will always discover a path to victory and the truth for the sake of defeating them.

Holmes does not speak of what this “sphere” is. Is it an object that concretely expresses his Origin, or is it an object solidified as the memory of his once close friend? Or perhaps, is it no more than a distraction done for the purpose of concealing “What is Sherlock Holmes actually doing?”————

Moreover, this Noble Phantasm’s name is one of the famous phrases associated with Holmes, but its first instance as Holmes’ catchphrase was actually not in Doyle’s stories, but in the stage play starred/scripted/produced by William Gillette. It is said that Doyle praised the Holmes played by Gillette with the statement “He is better than the one in my stories.” Incidentally, Holmes has remarked the word “Elementary” towards Watson in Doyle’s short story “The Adventure of the Crooked Man”, and Gillette got the idea of the phrase from that.

# Empty House: The Adventure of the Empty House
* Rank: B
* Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
* Ranges: 0 / –
* Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A disguise Noble Phantasm. It even imitates the abilities of the disguised person themselves, but it is not a perfect imitation. If one were to take Holmes disguising himself as another Servant as an example, the values of the disguised Servant’s Parameters are unable to be higher than his owns, and regarding their Skills and Noble Phantasms, they are unable to be copied.

(At the time of the Shinjuku Phantom Spirit Incident, Holmes mimicked the King of the Cavern’s combat style by simultaneously utilizing multiple Mystic Codes that he purchased from Kaburagi. After all, it is purely the King of the Cavern’s outward appearance that was copied, and regarding his copied power and nature, they do not exceed the limits of the Magecraft Mystic Codes that were being distributed in Shinjuku and used by Holmes. Even so, despite thoroughly using the Mystic Codes frenetically, Holmes was narrowly able to maintain the Ranked-Down Ether Body, hiding his identity.)

## Pronouns

* First Person Pronoun: watashi
* Second Person Pronouns: kimi / anata / Mr. ○○ / Miss / Mrs. / Ms. ○○
* Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / Mr. ○○ / Miss / Mrs. / Ms. ○○

## Personality

Contemplative, yet active. Bold, yet precise. And a calm, cool and collected man. Whatever the mystery, crime or scheme, they cannot escape from Holmes’ sight. Whether it is a dreadful murderer, a curse from the ancient times, a monster of the dark night, or even a secret society on a supranational scale, he shall disclose them all————and defeat them if necessary. With the sharp blade called Truth.

That way of being has already surpassed the Realm of Man and is even the personification of a “Wise Man” and a “Revealer”.

## Attitude Towards Master

Holmes does not want the Holy Grail.


## Dialogue Examples

“Is an introduction necessary? I’m a detective. If it’s the case that you were desiring for a hero, then I can’t help but say that it’s unfortunate, but if it’s the case that you were desiring for a detective or a reasoner, then you drew an excellent card.”

“You’re watching, yes? However, you mustn’t merely observe with your eyes alone.”

“I see. Very interesting.”

“It looks like there’s a new case. Well then, let’s enjoy ourselves, shall we?”

“————Baritsu!”

## Character Image

The world’s greatest and sole consulting detective. The crystallization of the concept of a detective and the representative of the “Revealers”. The protagonist of the stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in the 19th~20th Century, Sherlock Holmes is a detective who explains every mystery, and he is considered to be————one of the progenitors of the “detectives” that appear in the many mystery novels of later years.

‘The figure of the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes takes after Dr. Joseph Bell – who was conveyed to others as his model – Doyle himself, or the world’s oldest detective, Vidocq’————Holmes materializes not as any of the above, but as the protagonist of a series of stories and works (for that character’s words and deeds can only be regarded as those of a protagonist’s).

In the end, is the series of stories, starting with “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”, really a complete fiction that Sir Doyle produced, is it maybe something written down by Dr. John H. Watson as a biographical story of the Holmes that existed in real life, or is it perhaps a cross between the two? Holmes himself should at least have an understanding of the truth, but there is never a time where he speaks of it from his own mouth, and he easily dodges the topic whenever it does come up in a conversation.

◆

According to the records of the Clock Tower, it is an incontestable fact that a Great Detective called Holmes has existed in the past in London. There are furthermore records where he used the pseudonym Sigerson and proceeded towards the Tibetan Back Regions. In an unexplored region where Mystery still remains, he was also with a certain occultist and attended to her last moments.

“Supposing the case that he originated from the stories for argument’s sake, there’s a possibility that the stories comprise not only Doyle’s stories but even pastiches too…”, or so it was told by a Chaldean personnel, but one can probably say that this hypothesis clashes with the recorded facts.

Or maybe it can be thought of in this way: ‘Though is it also possible for a way of thinking where, as a result of receiving the influence of creative works, the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes became the perfected form of the “Great Detective” that actually existed in the past————?’


## Standard Weapons

Hand-to-hand combat attacks by means of baritsu. Also, Holmes can produce beams of light with objects and the like that are remodelled into… his personal accessories, which are like special Magecraft Mystic Codes. Holmes declares that these are “a large number of Mystic Codes that were discovered in the Back Regions of Tibet during the Great Hiatus”, but the veracity of this statement is ambiguous.

## Related Characters

**Leonardo da Vinci**

His colleague at Chaldea. A fellow genius. From the way it seems, da Vinci is one of the few people who can carry out a conversation with Holmes and make him let his guard down.

**Helena Blavatsky**

An acquaintance from while he was alive. Holmes clearly remembers, even now, the facial expressions Helena showed and the words she told him during her last moments.

**Jekyll**

An acquaintance from while he was alive. From the way it seems, Holmes feels some responsibility for allowing Moriarty’s “Evil” to become the trigger for Hyde’s birth.

**Jack the Ripper**

The culprit of a series of grotesque murder cases that happened during his lifetime in which Holmes could not get involved for it was within “the domain of the Clock Tower”. Every time he sees her, Holmes happens to show a deeply emotive look on his face.

**Charles Babbage**

His client in regard to the Human Order Incineration Incident (although Chaldea’s Babbage is a “different person” in some sense). They often exchange greetings with one another even in Chaldea.

**Shakespeare, Mozart**

A closet fan of them as a matter of fact.

**Lord El-Melloi II (Kongming)**

They see eye to eye. They are often deep in talk in Chaldea’s lobby.

**James Moriarty**

————His greatest enemy, and his most worthy rival.

## Comment from the Illustrator

The silhouette that follows and is associated with Detective Holmes remains undisturbed, and he was planned with the concept where the particulars about him are peculiar when they are examined skillfully. The 6 lenses he is equipped with are similar to the bees that are associated with the episode where he did beekeeping after his retirement as a detective. The colour I put in for his image was blue, which is falsely yet mysteriously similar to the image colour of his destined rival, Professor M (who was illustrated by Mr. RAITA), and I recall that at the moment of the Professor’s implementation, I was unable to stand up due to being struck with admiration the most out of anyone in the world.
