# Rider  
  
 *The Alluring Cavalrywoman Who Rides on Illusions*  
---  
# ライダー  
  
The Heroic Spirit summoned by Sakura is of  
the Rider class. She possesses agility, skills, and  
several Noble Phantasms worthy of the Rider  
class and is easily among the top Servants in  
terms of overall ability. Since Sakura had no  
intention of fighting anyone, she transferred her  
control of Rider to her brother Shinji. As a result,  
Rider was technically Shinji's Servant whenever  
she appeared before Shirou.  
  
Rider's main weapon is a nail attached to a  
chain, and she maneuvers gracefully through the  
air while piercing her opponent with the nail in  
order to reduce their mobility. Of her three Noble  
Phantasms, the most potent in terms of offensive  
capability is the Bellerophon, which allows her  
legendary mount Pegasus to use an extremely  
powerful charge. Aside from her Noble Phantasms,  
possesses Cybele, the Mystic Eyes of  
Petrification. Since Cybele's effect is constant and  
out of Rider's direct control, she usually wears  
Mystic Eye Killers in order to seal Cybele's effect.  
  
Though usually stoic and aloof, Rider is not  
thoughtless or without feelings. If anything, she  
tends to overthink things. When Rider sees how  
Sakura lives her life oppressed by others, the  
Servant cannot help but compare Sakura's suffering  
to the way she herself had suffered at the hands of  
the Gods. This empathy Rider feels for Sakura  
means she is very serious when it comes to her  
concerns regarding Sakura's well-being. Rider's  
bewitching presence and flawless proportions are  
two more characteristics she shares in common with  
Sakura, as Sakura also has an enviable body even  
if she tends to hide it.

### RELATIONSHIP CHART  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/L28Hkbs.jpg)  
  
Sakura is the one who actually summoned  
Rider, and is therefore Rider's true Master. Even  
after Shinji was granted control over Rider, the  
Servant viewed Sakura as her one and only  
Master. Though Rider did not think for a moment  
that Shinji was in any way a positive presence in  
Sakura's life, the Servant dutifully obeyed Shinji  
because the transfer of control was done through  
the use of Command Spells - and because such  
was Sakura's wish. Rider's absolute obedience  
quickly inflated Shinji's ego, but Rider had  
absolutely no interest in him and couldn't care less  
about his state of mind.  
  
Certain story choices can lead to Rider sucking  
Ayako Mitsuzuri's blood, after which the Servant  
seems to take a liking to her.

# Character Discussion with Kinoko Nasu & Takashi Takeuchi   
  
### THE CATALYST FOR RIDER'S BIRTH  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  Rider's one of the rare cases where  
the design changed quite a bit between the early  
drafts and the final design.  
  
**NASU:**  The early drafts actually lived on to  
become Ayako... and I don't want to hear  
anything about her eyebrows being thick! I saw a  
movie called "Vidocq", and I was totally charmed  
by the mirror-masked killer in it. I just really liked  
the way he moved and hid using his black cloak.  
I wanted to reproduce that feeling in the game, so  
I figured we could have a Rider with disheveled  
hair wearing a long robe. But then Takeuchi drew  
up the base design for the current Rider just on a  
lark, and even I had to admit it was the better  
design. That illustration of Rider where her face is  
angled down and to the side... that's the one that  
captured my heart.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  So how did we decide on Medusa  
as an identity for Rider again? Was it because we  
were talking about the lack of a "sexy" type  
character?  
  
**NASU:**  Yes, that's right. Rider was originally a  
male character, but we realized we didn't have  
enough female characters for a bishojo game.  
The original concept for Rider was a masterless  
"stray" Servant whose true name was Perseus,  
from Greek mythology. By the time he made his  
first appearance, his Master was long dead. The  
concept took two or three different turns before it  
finally settled into the current Rider.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  When we reviewed the Servants in  
search of one that could be changed into a  
female, Berserker was out of the question and  
Assassin's identity as Kojiro was basically the  
punch line for his character, so that left Rider.  
  
**NASU:**  But there weren't any legendary heroines  
with ties to Pegasus, so we selected Medusa, who  
gave birth to Pegasus, as Rider's new identity.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  We originally had no intention of  
releasing any information about Rider prior to the  
game's launch, but when the launch was delayed  
by about a month, we suddenly found ourselves  
in need of more material to fill the gap. We  
reluctantly unveiled Medusa, but we didn't reveal  
the details of her character, like the fact that she  
was a Servant.  
  
**NASU:**  We imagined most people would assume  
she was Assassin, and we were quite pleased to  
let them think that.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  Indeed, we were quite successful on  
that front. I mean, after seeing that nail...  
  
**NASU:**  No one would guess it was Rider!  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  The best part was that the magazine  
[Rider was revealed in] added the tagline "Sexy  
Fighting Lady". How great is that!?  
  
**NASU:**  I love it. (laughs)

### REGARDING RIDER'S CHARACTER DESIGN  
**TAKEUCHI:**  The main thing I was conscious of  
with Rider's design was the fact that I didn't want  
her outfit to turn out looking obscene. I leaned  
more toward a snug-fitting bodysuit rather than a  
sexually charged leather suit.  
  
**NASU:**  I do recall that when I asked you if her  
outfit was leather, you said "no" with quite a bit  
of fervor.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  I may not have wanted the suit itself  
to be leather, but I did imagine the bindings to be  
leather. I thought those little accents being made  
of leather might add a touch of elegance without  
making her look like a dominatrix.  
range  
  
**NASU:**  I see. As a side note, Rider was initially  
supposed to have a height somewhere in the  
of 175~180cm, but we were worried that  
PC gamers might not find such a tall woman  
particularly appealing, so we compromised at  
172cm.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  I imagine she wouldn't have such a  
wide appeal if we set her height in the 180cm  
range.  
  
**NASU:**  But you know, I did get some feedback  
suggesting that more than a few of our players  
were surprised that she was "so short" since I had  
emphasized her height in the original "stay night"  
material.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  Personally, I think somewhere  
around 170cm was just the right height to make  
her self-conscious about her height without  
making her a giant.  
  
**NASU:**  You're right. I suppose any girl over  
170cm in height is plenty tall. I think tall women  
are cool, but I do wonder if I should have eased  
up on that a bit.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  I think it's fine. Rider's height is what  
makes her unique, and it was precisely her height  
that made that awesome pose at Ryuudouji  
Temple during Sakura's route possible.  
  
**NASU:**  That was one of the rare cases where I,  
as the writer, made a specific request about the  
visual aspect. I asked them to give her "an  
arachnid pose".  
  
---  
  
### RIDER'S FEELINGS ABOUT HER MASTER  
**NASU:**  I saw Rider as a Doberman, fierce and  
scary but beautiful and loyal. Rider considered  
Sakura to be her true Master, so when Sakura  
wanted Rider to obey Shinji instead, Rider did so  
dutifully despite her personal feelings. But even  
Rider had her limits in dealing with a jerk like  
Shinji... (laughs)  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  She does come off as a very loyal  
individual.  
  
**NASU:**  Rider initially had a military theme, so  
she's definitely not the kind of person who  
interacts with others based on sentiment... she  
views it more as a duty.  
  
---  
  
### THE MESSAGE RIDER CARRIES AS A CHARACTER  
**NASU:**  An outlaw with super long hair and the  
Mystic Eyes of Petrification... a winning trifecta!  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  Speaking of the Mystic Eyes, the  
mark on Rider's forehead was designed to look  
like a snake and was originally going to be a  
third eye.  
  
**NASU:**  Yeah, the idea was to make her third eye  
the Mystic Eye, but we dumped that idea because  
it was too obvious and boring.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  So the mark on her forehead that  
was originally there to indicate a sealed Mystic  
Eye ended up being little more than a cool tattoo.  
  
**NASU:**  I still think we made the right decision  
about the third eye.  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  Now that I think about it... if we had  
given her a third eye, we probably wouldn't have  
had her wearing glasses...  
  
**NASU:**...You're right!  
  
**NASU:**  Even in the old "Fate", we had drilled it  
into our fans that Noble Phantasms were swords.  
So I can only imagine their reactions when Rider  
activated her reins of all things, which then  
immediately evaporated. (laughs) In a manner of  
speaking, Rider's true name was essentially the  
punch line of her character, much like with Kojiro.  
That's why I mostly kept her quiet throughout the  
main "stay night".  
  
**TAKEUCHI:**  For the longest time, I thought  
Pegasus was her Noble Phantasm, so I assumed  
the reins were like a Noble Phantasm Rider used  
to control her Noble Phantasm... but then Nasu  
told me that Pegasus wasn't a Noble Phantasm,  
and my mind was blown.  
  
**NASU:**  At the school and on the roof, Rider only  
summoned Pegasus. After summoning Pegasus,  
Rider uses her reins as kind of a power-up item,  
and that is the recipe behind Bellerophon.
