## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [A]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that are Rank A or below.

It is effectively impossible for modern mages to wound Nezha, a Divine General of the Heavenly Realm.

## Personal Skills

**Taoist Arts: [A]**

By exercising the Taoist Arts, Nezha can manage the numerous Magic Tools [Paopei] that she inherited from Taiyi Zhenren.

**Spiritual Pearl: [A]**

For Nezha, it is not her Spiritual Core, but the Precious Pearl buried inside her that acts as the main part of her body. Therefore, Nezha will continue to resurrect unless this Precious Pearl is completely destroyed.

**Tathagata’s Divine Protection: [B]**

Nezha’s body was given to her by Shakyamuni Tathagata, and its adjustments were done by Taiyi Zhenren. Simultaneously, this body seals her “Three Heads and Six Arms” technique, and it additionally plays a role in controlling Nezha’s rampages.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Di Fei Shuang Ling – Huo Jian Qiang (The Clear Soul Flying to the Earth – The Fire-Tipped Spear)
- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 10~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 10 people

A scorching charge attack where she rushes up to the sky with the hyper-acceleration of the Wind Fire Wheels, literally becomes one with her spear, and then descends for her assault. A powerful technique in which Prince Nezha, who assumed about fighting a decisive battle with the Great Sage Equal to Heaven/Sun Wukong, tries to pull out the power of the Noble Phantasm she has as a Lancer/the Fire-Tipped Spear to the maximum degree.

# Sanmianliubi – Luo Xian Shou (Three Heads and Six Arms – The Overarching Immortal Beast)
- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum Number of Targets: 6 people

Nezha’s rage, together with the soul of a Great Overarching Immortal (Da Luo Xian) from her previous existence[1] – both of which dwell within her – can allow her to enlarge to a size six times bigger than her normal size. She transforms into her multi-headed, multi-armed Divine Beast form that has three heads and six arms. Having a specialized Magic Tool at the ready in every hand, she opens with an intense offense and defense.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: boku
- Second Person Pronouns: omae / aruji [master] (to her Master)
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo

## Personality

Nezha’s verbal expression is awkward, and she has a robotic and childish aura to her. As a messenger sent by the Buddha, she tries to be thoroughly strict to evil and just to the masses. She intuitively probes about one’s goodness and wickedness. Being one who does not keep up with social norms, there are some times where she would completely rush into a situation as she is without knowing the circumstances of the incident taking place.

Nezha regrets her past where she hated her father – the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King – and furiously confronted him, especially when the latter was just trying to take care of his child tenderly.


## Attitude Towards Master

Nezha is very devoted. Regarding wicked matters however, she shakes her head in silence out of opposition to them.

Nezha secretly dreams of another meeting with the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, and she wants to have a showdown with him.

## Dialogue Examples

- “Servant, Lancer, Nezha. That is all.”
- “Master [Master][2]. Smells like the Sun.”
- “Final form. I. Am. Terribly. Grateful.”
- “Noble Phantasm unsealed. Peach Garden Sage Technique Formula; the three Hun flying and the seven Po dispersing![3] This is, namely, the Fire-Tipped Spear! Go up in flameees!”
- “Victory confirmed. Result expected… Ahem.”
- “This body houses. The Da Luo Xian with Three Heads and Six Arms! In the case that my shout is done, snow will fall with rain accompanying it, and even Heaven and Earth will shake!”
- “I, Marshal of the Central Altar – Prince Nezha. Will try to crush you. Into the rocky prison of the Five Elements Mountain. To the extent that your windpipe will pop out!”
- “…… Dialogue [Chat]. Finished [Ended].”

## Historical Character and Figure

The Marshal of the Central Altar – Prince Nezha; an elite military commander who came from the Heavenly Realm. He accepted a gruesome death in the Earthly Realm and was subsequently resurrected through a lotus flower. He boasts of his deed of arms where he defeated and sealed demons from even the Ninety-Six Caves as well as in being the greatest rival of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven – Sun Wukong (or so said person believes).

He was originally a minor god from Hindu Mythology called Nalakuvara, but he was transmitted into China as a Guardian Deity of Buddhism, was adopted into Taoism, and became the Boy God – Prince Nezha. Even now, he is being worshipped and favoured in the East Asian Regions, the worship and favouritism centered around China. He appears as a key character in “Investiture of the Gods”. He also appears in “Journey to the West”, having been recruited to subjugate Sun Wukong – who was being riotous in the Heavenly Realm – and being often dispatched by the Heavenly Emperor (Shangdi) to provide aid for Bonze Sanzang and her party in their journey.

In the first place, Nezha is not a human being. He was born with a Precious Pearl, which was taken down to the Earthly Realm by Mount Kunlun’s Immortal – Taiyi Zhenren[4] as his core, so he is an awkward existence who is neither fully human nor fully Immortal. In addition to the Magic Tools [Paopei] – the “Qiankun Quan [Universe Ring]” and the “Hun Tian Ling [Red Armillary Sash]” – that he is said to have possessed since the moment of his birth, Nezha was also presented and provided with Magic Tools by Taiyi Zhenren at every opportunity: the “Zhan Yao Jian [Demon-Slaying Sword]”, the “Kan Yao Dao [Demon-Cutting Sword]”, the “Fu Yao Suo [Demon-Binding Rope]”, the “Jiang Mo Chu [Evil-Conquering Mallet]”, the “Tou Qiu [Embroidered Ball]”, and the “Huo Jian Qiang [Fire-Tipped Spear]”.

Nezha, who grew up in the Earthly Realm, was not wicked, but he was an excessively insolent and rambunctious kid. When he was blamed by a god for contaminating a river, he killed the god in question, and even also killed another god who was the superior of the previous god he killed. He was soon rebuked for those actions, and when a disaster befell even onto his parents in the Earthly Realm because of his prior acts, he unavoidably arrived at the decision to commit suicide in order to stop it.

## Character in FGO

After his suicide in the Earthly Realm, Nezha was resurrected as a lotus spirit, although there were a couple of twists and turns. In regard to his resurrection, it had the assistance of not only Taiyi Zhenren, but also Shakyamuni Tathagata.

Summoned as a Lancer, Nezha is being strongly tinged with the disposition of a Guardian of Buddhism that appeared in “Journey to the West”. If it were the case that she was summoned as the Nezha from the time just before he committed suicide – the Nezha who has a brutal nature – one might fear that it is probably likely she would have become a Berserker.

… By the way, Taiyi Zhenren happened to pay no great attention to the sex of the body created for Nezha. To begin with, Taiyi Zhenren had been taking care of Nezha when the latter was a kid whose secondary sex characteristics had yet to develop. In other words, it means Nezha’s body after his resurrection has been completely configured to a sex different from what he was in his previous life, but it was assuredly at a stage where it was already too late. It is for such a reason that Nezha – even though he has pride in his own body’s origin and performance – shows an awkward attitude when it comes to the topic of his body’s sex.

## Standard Weapons

The Fire-Tipped Spear for close combat. The Universe Ring for ranged attacks. The Wind Fire Wheels for high-speed movement.

## Comment from the Illustrator

A mecha… Why in the world is Nezha a mecha?… Eventually, I took care of the mecha-like aspect of hers… to the extent that I was satisfied, but at first, I had considered reverse joints. I’m glad I didn’t do that, don’t you agree?! While it’s disappointing since my Nezha’s Noble Phantasm Level is 1, I’m looking forward to her pickup at my humble Chaldea!!!!! (Aotsuki Takao)

## TL Notes:

[1] – The Da Luo Xian are basically the highest tier of Immortals who reside in the Da Luo Tian (The Great Overarching Heaven, aka the highest point of the Taoist Heaven).
As explained in Journey to the West, Nezha’s previous life being mentioned here (the one even before the time he was born to Li Jing and Lady Yin, his parents in the Earthly Realm) was him as a Divine Beast Immortal that served the Jade Emperor/the Taoist Shangdi.
[2] – The first “master” mentioned here refers to the Japanese character ‘aruji’ (主) while the second [Master] mentioned here is ‘Masutaa’ (ますたー), which is mostly in hiragana instead of the usual katakana (マスター) because of her speech style.
[3] – The Chinese concept of Hun and Po refers to two different souls that every human being has within them, and in Taoism, there are three Hun souls and seven Po souls. When one dies, their Hun souls would fly to Heaven and their Po souls would scatter to the Earth. This leads to the first part of Nezha’s 1st Noble Phantasm’s name: The Clear Soul Flying to the Earth. The Clear Soul is one of the three Hun souls, and the Noble Phantasm’s name references a proverb about Nezha’s threat that he issued once before where he will beat up someone to the point that their Clear Soul would get beaten out of them and fly to the Earth instead of normally flying to Heaven. One losing their Clear Soul means losing their intelligence. So basically, it’s Nezha knocking the sense out of someone.
[4] – Taiyi Zhenren should be the Immortal of Mount Qianyuan, not Mount Kunlun.
[5] – Nezha says 緑茶 [みどちゃ] (Green Tea/’Midocha’ in Romaji) here, which is a common Japanese abbreviation and pun for one of Robin Hood’s nicknames: Green Archer. Mido (short form of ’Midori’) = Green. Cha (from Archer, which is ‘Aacha’ in Romaji) = Tea. Green Tea = Green Archer.
