# Trial Quest - Arthur Pendragon

## 一一一一Someday, The Day of Salvation for this Planet Will Come
 
**Narration:**
... 
 
**Narration:**
Well, crap... 
 
**Narration:**
This all started right after I got separated from the Servants during our investigation of a Singularity. 
 
**Narration:**
I thought that as long as I could stay in touch with Chaldea, I'd be able to meet back up with everyone... 
 
**Narration:**
The Chaldea staff could've told me my coordinates, or even where the Servants all are... 
 
**Narration:**
But every single thing seemed to go wrong. I tried contacting Chaldea, but got no response. 
 
**Narration:**
I should've heard Mash calling for me. Instead, all I can hear now is... 
 
**Narration:**
... 
 
**Narration:**
...If I had to describe it in colors, I guess it's red and black. It howls like a beast hungry for blood. 
 
**Narration:**
I'm in a tight spot here. What Mystic Code did I put on before we left? 
 
**Narration:**
If I could at least cast Gandr, I'd shoot one off. Then, regardless of how that goes, I'll just book it as fast as I can! 
 
**Narration:**
...But, will that really work? 
 
**Narration:**
Sweat trickles down my cheek. My mouth trembles. Think. Think. But that beast doesn't look like it'll give me time to think... 
 
**Narration:**
I'm taking a chance. Whether it'll work out or not... 
 
**B：???:**
...Are you all right? You should stand back. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Turn around)
 
**Knight:**
Hah!!! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Step back)
 
**B：???:**
Good. Right there's fine. 
 
**Knight:**
Hmph! 
 

---

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Exhale)
 
**Knight:**
...You've got some guts. 
 
**Knight:**
You watched that attack and didn't so much as flinch. 
 
**Knight:**
Do you have some knowledge of swordplay? Or, I suppose you have been through more than your share of trials... 
 
**Knight:**
Whoops, sorry. Looks like we don't have much time to chitchat. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Thanks. You saved me.
 
**Knight:**
You're welcome. Are you hurt, brave stranger? 
 
**Knight:**
You're certainly no ordinary person. If you were, you'd have fainted when you stared that beast down. 
 
**Knight:**
I'd love to talk to you more in detail... but I don't have the time. 
 

---

 
**Knight:**
A herd of beasts and their king are coming this way. I doubt we can reach a peaceful resolution. 
 
**Knight:**
If you don't mind, would you fight with me? You seem to be the type who's strong enough to do that. 
 
**Knight:**
Are you by chance a mage? Well, at least you don't seem to be completely lost in a battle of magecraft. 
 
**Knight:**
That magical energy enveloping you must be Command Spells. Are you a Master? 
 
**Knight:**
Well then, you must have some experience dealing with Mystics, which are so far beyond simple magecraft. 
 
**Knight:**
...They're here. Sorry, I'm just short on time. So, would you give me your answer? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's fight together.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd appreciate it if you'd let me!
 

---

 
**Knight:**
Thank you. Now then, let's take this horde of beasts down together! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Knight:**
Good. We managed to escape for now. 
 
**Knight:**
I knew it! You're a skilled mage. I'm no expert on magecraft, but I can at least say this: 
 
**Knight:**
You have the power to fight. I don't just mean the skills necessary to fight... 
 
**Knight:**
You possess a sword. A sword that dwells within your heart, that is. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**Knight:**
Hey. Did something happen? 
 
**Knight:**
You look a little unfocused. Did you use too much of your magical energy? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look familiar.
 

---

 
**Knight:**
I believe this is the first time we've met. Based on what you're wearing, you must be from the 20th century. 
 
**Knight:**
Or perhaps from the beginning of the 21st century. You may have had an opportunity to meet me... 
 
**Knight:**
No, I don't remember. 
 
**Knight:**
Hey. You didn't come here alone, did you? 
 
**Knight:**
You must have gotten separated from your group. Am I right? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes.
 
**Knight:**
I see. Okay, got it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Exactly!
 
**Knight:**
Haha. That's the spirit! 
 

---

 
**Knight:**
Okay. I will stay with you until you find your companions. 
 
**Knight:**
Don't worry. We'll find them soon enough. 

**--SECTION BREAK--**
 
**Mordred:**
UN-FREAKIN'-BELIEVABLE! 
 
**Mordred:**
And where the hell have YOU been!? Why'd you wander off like that!? 
 
**Mordred:**
Don't think for one second you're gettin' off easy just 'cause you came back in one piece. Next time, don't you dare wander off without telling me! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry!
 
**Mordred:**
...Ugh. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I suddenly lost contact with Chaldea...
 
**Mordred:**
Oh yeah, Mash did mention something like that. 
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
Um...the connection is maybe not so great. 
 
**Mordred:**
I mean, yeah, it's pretty damn cool we can communicate in real time with Chaldea, no matter where or when we are... 
 
**Mordred:**
...but it's kinda useless once we start runnin' into weird magical anomalies and crap like Bounded Fields, huh? 
 
**Mordred:**
Hunting for Singularity remnants... I figured we could forget about them and they'd disappear on their own. 
 
**Mordred:**
Or...has it gotten so bad that it was on its way to becoming a full-blown Singularity? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, you are right. It was on the brink of becoming a miniature Singularity... 
 
**Mash:**
The swordsman that Senpai encountered was likely caught up in whatever was going on. 
 
**Mordred:**
Oh, the guy who saved Master. 
 
**Mordred:**
We didn't see his face... He left right before we met up with Master. 
 
**Mordred:**
Aw, c'mon. I can't believe he's managed to survive wandering around this place alone. Who was he? 
 
**Mash:**
His name was... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now that you mention it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't ask.
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
He left without giving his name? Hah. What a big shot. I can't put my finger on it, but something about him sort of pisses me off. 
 
**Mash:**
U-um... Regardless of whether he's human or a Rogue Servant... 
 
**Mash:**
He had amazing combat power. He was able to keep up with those giant creatures. 
 
**Mash:**
According to Senpai...he was a hooded man who looked like a knight? 
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? A hooded knight? That means he's not from that Singularity, to say the least. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He was like a knight, or maybe a swordsman...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's like a knight in shining armor.
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
What the heck? 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai mentioned that the man's attire reminded [♂him /♀her] of the Knights of the Round Table. Isn't that right, Senpai? 
 
**Mordred:**
What? Us? But I don't remember anyone with a hood. 
 
**Mordred:**
I mean, Gareth wore a helmet all the time. And that jackass Percival didn't have anything either... 
 
**Mordred:**
Or...uh, did he wear a helmet? Like, when he was super serious? ...No, wait... Er, maybe that was Palamedes? 
 
**Mordred:**
...Nope, nope, it was definitely a helmet. 
 
**Mordred:**
So no. None of us wore hoods. 
 
**Mordred:**
Well...maybe when we were out on an expedition and it rained, I guess... Still, though... 
 
**Mash:**
I see... 
 
**Mordred:**
Master, what type of weapon did he use? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A sword inlaid with gold and silver.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I couldn't see what it was at first...
 

---

 
**Mordred:**
...No. It can't be. 
 
**Mash:**
??? 
 
**Jekyll:**
Do you have a minute, Master? I was rechecking the calculations on the Rayshift coordinates... 
 
**Jekyll:**
And I found some points that concern me. Actually, the one who made the discovery was Mr. Babbage. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Anyway, I'm looking for Miss Da Vinci. Would you happen to know where she&ndash; 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, Jekyll. Da Vinci should be in Lab 2. 
 
**Mordred:**
Hey! We're talking about something important, you nerd! We didn't call you, and Da Vinci's not here either! 
 
**Jekyll:**
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt... Hey! Ow, ow, ow!!! 
 
**Mordred:**
Stop overreacting. I just gave you a little poke. 
 
**Mordred:**
Ugh. This is why you're such a loser. 
 
**Jekyll:**
Well, that was actually... Ungh... No, never mind. Nothing. Haha. 
 
**Arash:**
Hey, Fujimaru. Good, good. Looks like you came back in one piece. 
 
**Arash:**
You Rayshifted out somewhere to get rid of a small Singularity, right? I heard all about it. 
 
**Arash:**
Sorry I couldn't help. So... Yeah. Make sure to take me with you next time, okay? 
 
**Arash:**
You'll never get lost again with me around. I've got good eyes. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I did get lost a bit...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But it was an accident!
 

---

 
**Arash:**
Haha. I see. Well, I'm not blaming you or anything. 
 
**Arash:**
But, well, why don't you tell me about it? Hearing you tell me about your own travels might be nice for a change. 
 
**Arash:**
I actually want to hear, directly from you, who you met. 
 
**Arash:**
... 
 
**Arash:**
...I knew it. You met HIM. 
 
**Arash:**
I get it. I guess this is what you would call fate. 
 
**Arash:**
I didn't think he was in the Throne of Heroes. No... He isn't... So? What's your take on it? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh? Huh?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Arash, what are you talking about?
 

---

 
**Arash:**
Sorry for being so cryptic. My bad, Master. I'm really not sure what to say... 
 
**Arash:**
Umm... 
 
**Arash:**
... 
 
**Arash:**
Well, I guess it's not entirely impossible. Yeah, yeah. Looks like I'll be able to enjoy my drink tonight! 
 
**Arash:**
Hahahaha. So he's still out there, somewhere, fighting! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Explain!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What the heck!?
 

---

 
**Arash:**
Haha! Come on, don't say that! Ha... But yeah...so it was him... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Arash!!!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Stare at him silently)
 

---

 
**Arash:**
...O-okay. 
 
**Arash:**
Well, yeah. I know! If there's ever a chance, you'll see him again! Yeah! 
 
**Arash:**
Hey, hey. Wait! Quit hitting me! It doesn't hurt, but for some reason I feel bad, like I did something wrong. 
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What's going on, Arash? What, are you having your very own drinking party right in the middle of the hallway? 
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh hey. Master's here too. What's up? 
 
**Arash:**
Ah, the Child of Light! 
 
**Arash:**
Oh, it's nothing. Haha, this may actually have to do with you! 
 
**Arash:**
You should keep this a secret from the pharaoh, the valkyrie lady, and the alchemist. 
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Huh? 

**--SECTION BREAK--**
 
**Knight:**
... 
 
**Knight:**
I thought there was something sinister this time around...but I don't sense the noxious gas of L or the lingering scent of R. 
 
**Knight:**
Things aren't going as planned. I guess I have no choice but to search more thoroughly. 
 
**Knight:**
... 
 
**Knight:**
Yeah. It'll be all right, Merlin. I will accomplish my goal, and then return to where I belong. 
 
**Knight:**
Soon. One of these days. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Narration:**
A voice hailed me, asking me to wait. 
 
**Narration:**
Why? I turned around, surrounded by a field of golden grass. 
 
**Narration:**
I thought I had arrived at the place where I belonged. After all, by now my time as king was no more than a distant memory. 
 
**Narration:**
The time I spent fighting for Britain... Ten years of bravery and honor, charging from battlefield to battlefield with the Knights of the Round Table. 
 
**Narration:**
And that's not all: even the time I spent living as a solitary knight after that... 
 
**Narration:**
...and yes, even that two-week-long Holy Grail War in the Far East at the end of the 20th century&ndash;one fought over a false Grail... 
 
**Narration:**
...all for the sake of a girl who taught me things I never would have learned in my life as a king. 
 
**Narration:**
All of it, no more than a distant memory now. That begs the question... 
 
**Knight:**
Why stop me now? 
 
**Knight:**
I just arrived here. I did what I needed to do, and ended everything. 
 
**Knight:**
I finally reached the place...the promised place. Just as the legend to be passed down through the ages said. 
 
**Knight:**
I thought I was going to form a contract with the world... 
 
**Knight:**
But that is not how it went. I got my answer, and then my life ended. 
 
**Female Mage:**
...Hehe. 
 
**Female Mage:**
You have the appearance of a young man, yet you speak like an old man. 
 
**Female Mage:**
No, I wonder. My king. Britain's eternal king and wielder of the sacred sword... 
 
**Female Mage:**
There must be many things you have left undone. I'm sure you know already, right? 
 
**Female Mage:**
You have yet to truly and finally defeat that which you are destined to destroy. 
 
**Female Mage:**
Once in 1991 A.D. Once more in 1999 A.D. 
 
**Female Mage:**
Twice you struck it down, but that devourer of cities is persistent. It's not over yet. 
 
**Knight:**
That's... 
 
**Female Mage:**
Hehehe. Yes, exactly! 
 
**Female Mage:**
Great child of Uther... My beloved red dragon! That's right, this situation is terribly irregular! 
 
**Female Mage:**
Yes, it is a state of emergency so severe, you were roped into this the instant you arrived at Avalon! 
 
**Female Mage:**
It should have ended the second time. But somehow, it's back for round three! It's unfathomable! 
 
**Female Mage:**
Hehe. Perhaps an Original Species awakened somewhere? 
 
**Knight:**
... 
 
**Female Mage:**
Really, I must say! It's a truly rotten twist of fate! After all, you're not supposed to be here. 
 
**Female Mage:**
Now's not the time for you to come knocking on my door. It can't be now. You're ten years too early. 
 
**Knight:**
Wait. Merlin, what are you talking&ndash; 
 
**Female Mage:**
You still need to continue your journey. Whether it be in your world, or in another universe. 
 
**Female Mage:**
You may travel through dimensions or even phenomena. Anywho, yeah, hang in there. 
 
**Female Mage:**
Why? How, you ask? Well... Yeah, I wonder... I can't say for sure. 
 
**Female Mage:**
This could be a deep-seated curse put on you as the wielder of a sacred sword, or it could be something that was sprung on you right before a long break... 
 
**Female Mage:**
...It may be the great Grand Order. 
 
**Knight:**
...Grand...Order...? 
 
**Female Mage:**
Either way, you need to leave here immediately. And that's also why I stopped you. Listen... 
 
**Female Mage:**
I'm going to say this again: your journey has not ended. 
 
**Female Mage:**
It can't end. For her sake as well. 
 
**Female Mage:**
What did you feel from her? Light? Radiance? Affection? Or all of them? 
 
**Female Mage:**
They might all end up in a whirlpool of gluttony. If you don't continue your journey, that is. 
 
**Knight:**
!! 
 
**Knight:**
Merlin, wait! Explain yourself! I've been wondering about this for a while, but you're too cryptic! 
 
**Female Mage:**
What the heck? That's mean. Oh well. Come on, hurry up and get going! 
 
**Female Mage:**
You'll get to meet me face-to-face next time! This time, too bad! 
 
**Female Mage:**
My king, the last Pendragon! May your new journey be blessed! We shall meet again! 
 
**Female Mage:**
If you meet another me in a parallel universe, be kind to them! 

**--SECTION BREAK--**

**Knight:**
... 
 
**Knight:**
I have yet to meet another you, Merlin, but I haven't forgotten what you said. For now. 
 
**Knight:**
...This is yet another world that has gone to ruin. 
 
**Knight:**
Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, was it? No, destruction and pruning have nothing to do with each other. 
 
**Knight:**
I suppose scenes like this are commonplace for any phenomenon that gets pruned. 
 
**Knight:**
The decay of a civilization... The destruction of a city... No matter how many times I see it, I still can't get used to it. 
 
**Knight:**
But then again...it's still too early for me to give up. Right, Merlin? 
 
**Knight:**
...If only there were some survivors. 
 
**Knight:**
Hm? 
 
**Knight:**
!! 
 
**Knight:**
A person...out of nowhere!? You're...!? 
 
**Knight:**
You're that stranger I met earlier! So you're someone who can travel through time and space, too? 
 
**Knight:**
A-are you all right? It looked like you fell from a ways above the ground... 
 
**Knight:**
No, before you answer that, you need to know that this land's atmosphere is poisonous to living creatures! 
 
**Knight:**
Do you have a gas mask or a Mystic Code? If you don't, take one of my talismans. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...H-hello.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...My head's spinning.
 

---

 
**Knight:**
...! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where am I?
 

---

 
**Knight:**
You've awoken. 
 
**Knight:**
What a surprise. Well, there's no shortage of those today. 
 
**Knight:**
First, you appeared out of thin air. Second, you are somehow alive when the air is pure poison. 
 
**Knight:**
You're definitely full of surprises. But for the time being, as much as I'm glad you woke up... 
 
**Knight:**
Let me ask you this first: Are you hurt anywhere? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think anything's broken.
 

---

 
**Knight:**
I see. I'm glad. 
 
**Knight:**
So...why did you come to a wasteland like this? 
 
**Knight:**
There's not much here. Actually, there are really only dangerous things here. 
 
**Knight:**
Do you make a habit of running headlong into danger? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rayshif&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
U-uh... I mean, what was it again...?
 

---

 
**Knight:**
I see. 
 
**Knight:**
You're either holding something back or your memory is fuzzy. I won't ask questions. 
 
**Knight:**
But, yeah. If you're falling from the sky from out of nowhere... 
 
**Knight:**
...then you're not just some lost mage...at least this time around. 
 
**Knight:**
(Thinking back to what happened last time, could this child have gotten caught up in my warps?) 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you say something?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think I heard something...
 

---

 
**Knight:**
Uh... Well, if I try to explain, it'll just complicate things. Sorry. 
 
**Knight:**
No, I should at least tell you what I can. Though the ruler of this land is sure to approach me soon... 
 
**Knight:**
Okay. We have at least some time to talk. 
 
**Knight:**
Let's begin with introductions. I failed to do so last time because I was in a hurry. 
 
**Knight:**
My name is Arthur Pendragon. 
 
**Arthur:**
I was the King of Britain in the past. But now I am a mere knight. 
 
**Arthur:**
I am not human like you. Do you understand that? 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm a Heroic Spi&ndash;I am currently a Servant who possesses a Spirit Origin. Unfortunately, I have no Master. 
 
**Arthur:**
The wielder of the Sacred Sword of the Planet, Excalibur. Yes, my Noble Phantasm. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The sacred sword...?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
King Arthur!?
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
What an unexpected reaction. 
 
**Arthur:**
...Do you, by chance, know who I am? 
 
**Arthur:**
I see... Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... The 21st century... 
 
**Arthur:**
A female King Arthur... 
 
**Arthur:**
And your name is Fujimaru. That has a nice ring to it. 
 
**Arthur:**
You were supposed to be able to communicate in real time with the Chaldea in 2019... 
 
**Arthur:**
No, I believe you. Actually, many of my questions have been answered. You must have gone through some truly difficult battles. 
 
**Arthur:**
...Yes, I can feel it. 
 
**Arthur:**
Being a Master to one Servant is tough enough, but to be able to form contracts with multiple Servants and keep battling... 
 
**Arthur:**
Truly, that is an achievement that goes beyond imagining. No ordinary person could save the world, after all. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You think so?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, King Arthur.
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
You're amazing. You seem to have walked an even more treacherous path than I have. 
 
**Arthur:**
Unless you... 
 
**Arthur:**
...Ah. Maybe you... 
 
**Arthur:**
... 
 
**Arthur:**
He mentioned... So it was you. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who are you talking about?
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
I don't really know the specific location or era. I was there for a very, very short time relative to the other places I've visited. 
 
**Arthur:**
I warped before I could confirm his name. I couldn't even say goodbye to him. 
 
**Arthur:**
But... Yes, I still remember. 
 
**Arthur:**
I remember being able to see a large, red, iron bridge... 
 
**--SECTION BREAK--**

**???:**
Well, yes. I don't mind if you think I am crazy. 
 
**???:**
What I am about to tell you may seem unbelievable... It does not bear any weight especially in a peaceful country like this one. 
 
**???:**
I wouldn't want it to bear any weight anyway. Because even if it was true, there's nothing anyone can do about it. 
 
**???:**
And of course it's difficult to accept... 
 
**???:**
That's why... 
 
**???:**
I'm going to talk while I imagine the astonished look on your face. 
 
**???:**
If things continue as they are, the world will end. 
 
**???:**
The world will be incinerated without ever seeing 2019. This has already been determined. It is a foregone conclusion. 
 
**???:**
...What do you think? Surprised? 
 
**???:**
Or do you think I'm insane? Do I look like a pathetic man who's been possessed by some pessimistic delusion? 
 
**Arthur:**
Of course not. I believe your words. 
 
**Arthur:**
Your eyes must see through everything. You're not the first person I've met who has the power of Clairvoyance. 
 
**???:**
Thank you. Though I don't have powers of that sort. 
 
**???:**
Know this, O wandering king: even your sacred sword cannot prevent the future I saw. 
 
**???:**
The Incineration of Humanity is simply too perfect of an achievement. 
 
**Arthur:**
... 
 
**???:**
But. But, you know... 
 
**???:**
If by chance the world does not end in 2018... And if you can continue your wandering journey... 
 
**???:**
You may be able to meet... 
 
**Arthur:**
Meet you again? Here? 
 
**???:**
No, not me. 
 
**???:**
If by chance everything goes well, I will likely have met my end. 
 
**???:**
But the person you're going to meet is someone I believe will become important to me as well. 
 
**???:**
Someone who could accomplish something I could never do... 
 
**???:**
Someone who carries love and hope... Someone who keeps aiming for tomorrow, for the sake of a yesterday that has been lost!

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't tell me that person is&mdash;
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
Hm... 
 
**Arthur:**
...It's getting near. 
 
**Arthur:**
I thought I could talk longer, but time's up. Looks like the ruler of this land is here. 
 
**Arthur:**
It's one of the sources of the decay of this time and age. 
 
**Arthur:**
Perhaps it's a Demonic Beast that somehow became corrupted. Or it could be a type of weapon that was created by someone and abandoned. 
 
**Arthur:**
Sorry to stop our talk midway. But then again, my story ends here anyway. 
 
**Arthur:**
Because right after that conversation, I warped somewhere else. I have no control over that. 
 
**Arthur:**
Nothing has changed. Regardless of what I want... 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Your situation sounds a lot like Musashi's...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wait. Was the person you were talking about earlier
 

---

 
**Beast:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]! 
 
**Arthur:**
...Bloodlust, hostility, malice. Nothing else, huh? 
 
**Arthur:**
An incarnation of massacre. A device of destruction that cannot stop itself. It may not be a Beast, but it is still evil. 
 
**Arthur:**
You are not the Beast I am searching for. But you are still my enemy. 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm sorry, Fujimaru. 
 
**Arthur:**
It's time to battle. I'm sure our opponent will come at us with everything it has, so I cannot hold back. 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm sorry for dragging you into this. I will protect you with all my strength. But if it's at all possible... 
 
**Arthur:**
If I could ask... No, would you like to fight alongside me? 
 
**Arthur:**
The one who fights to save the world. You, the one to whom that man entrusted everything... 
 
**Arthur:**
I want to engrave the sight of you into my memory once again! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And in exchange, you need to finish your story!
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
Okay, that's a promise! 
 
**Arthur:**
Let's go. For now, you shall be my Master! 
 
**Arthur:**
There's no need to be connected through Command Spells. You only need to show me your resolve to save the world! 
 
**Arthur:**
And to go along with your dazzling actions, I shall show you the light of this planet! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Arthur:**
...We're done. Good work. 
 
**Arthur:**
It wasn't the Beast I was looking for, but at the very least, its death should halt this place's deterioration. 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm not entirely clear on how all this works. But apparently this is what my journey entails. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
King Arthur, you promised.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please continue your story.
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
Oh, right. There's something I need to tell you. 
 
**Arthur:**
The man I met and conversed with... 
 
**Arthur:**
His name was Rom&ndash; 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, thank goodness! We finally connected! Scanning your vital signs in three...two...one! 
 
**Mash:**
Scanning... Okay, all done! Good, looks like nothing is wrong with your body! 
 
**Mash:**
I will begin preparations to bring you back immediately! Please hold still, Senpai! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Communication is back up!?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
...Uh, ahem. Hey. It's me, Da Vinci. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
There was a...tiny snafu in the program that handles the Rayshift coordinate calculations. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
It wasn't a mistake that just developed out of nowhere. It was there from the beginning. Let's just say that there was a shortcoming in one of the formulae. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
The result itself doesn't change. But yeah, it's a bug. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's what was causing all the problems. It was Rayshifting you, and only you, to weird coordinates. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Anyway, simply put, it was just a bug. I'm sorry, really! It wasn't that I made any mistakes in the design stage; it was just me being negligent as a manager! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, and it's not Romani's fault either. It's my fault, since it's all under my jurisdiction. I'm really sorry! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Babbage was the one who found it after doing some calculations because he had nothing better to do. I guess you really can't give those analog folks flak. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see... I mean, wait a minute!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm in the middle of talking to King Arthur!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Um, do you mean Altria...? 
 
**Mash:**
I'm only detecting you there. Is...another Servant with you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh?
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
...Seems like they cannot see me. Perhaps my Spirit Origin does not exist in your world. 
 
**Arthur:**
If the King Arthur you know is female, that means she's me, but not me. 
 
**Arthur:**
I don't exist. At least not in your world's history. 
 
**Arthur:**
You may need to ask Merlin for details, but yeah. 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm sure that's what it is. 
 
**Arthur:**
...Oh, or maybe it's because my warp has already started? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You were about to tell me a name...!
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
You should already know. It's the same name that the beautiful lady mentioned just now. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So it was Romani Archaman...!
 

---

 
**Arthur:**
Yes, that's right. 
 
**Arthur:**
I firmly believe that the person he was talking about was you. 
 
**Arthur:**
How is he doing now? ...No, I shouldn't ask. At least not right now. Not now. 
 
**Arthur:**
That's why, Fujimaru... 
 
**Arthur:**
Instead of saying goodbye, let me say this: 
 
**Arthur:**
I'm glad I met you, brave child, savior of the planet under a distant sky. 
 
**Arthur:**
You, who inherited the will of the man I encountered during my journey. 
 
**Arthur:**
May your perilous journey be blessed, Fujimaru! And when we meet again under the same sky, someday, someplace... 
 
**Arthur:**
Let us fight alongside each other again. 
 
**Arthur:**
To save your world. To save tomorrow. 

**--SECTION BREAK--**

**Da Vinci:**
Hm? What is it, Doctor? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hehe. I don't have as much free time as before. You see, everyone realized how useful I am. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why I'm super busy every day. I mean, think we're taking too much of the burden of Chaldea's future onto ourselves? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
But that's just me complaining. Though, I don't mind sparing some time to listen to you talk. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Hm? Would I be okay with just idle chitchat or gossip? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, sure. I'm just going to work while I listen. Now come on, talk to me. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Uh-huh. Oh. I see. Ah. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yep. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Eh? What? What did you just say? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Before that. The thing you said before that. Something about a thing near the bridge in Fuyuki City. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...You've met the male King Arthur? Was he a Heroic Spirit? When? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Before Chaldea's Summoning System was established? But that's impossible. How long ago was that? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Either way, that was after Fuyuki's Grail War ended, right? Even with a tremendous amount of spiritual evocation and other powerful ceremonial magecraft... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Summoning a Heroic Spirit that can converse coherently would be impossible. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Besides... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm. Wait. Something's not right. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
If what you're saying is true, it must be because of that! The Singularity in Fuyuki! The Greater Grail! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
So that reaction you had when you first saw the female King Arthur on the monitor was... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Eh? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You forgot? Completely? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Yeah, I don't blame you. If a random man calling himself King Arthur came up to you, no one would give it much credence. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Nobody would think, “Whoa, it's the real King Arthur!” And I'm sure he wouldn't stick out in your memory. But then again... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You have your position to think about. You're in Chaldea, after all. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
...Oh. I see. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
You say that, but the expression on your face tells me you're fondly thinking back on that day, Romani. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Heh heh. Oh, let me guess. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I bet you said something really embarrassing! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Am I right? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
... 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hahahaha. Nope. Can't do that. You can't say you were kidding after that reaction! There's no fooling me! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Just give up and tell me everything! Come on, I won't judge! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
It'll be all right. So what did you tell him? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Eh? You made a wish? To the King Arthur you saw in Fuyuki? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
What did you wish for...? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
No. Yeah. It'll be much more interesting if you don't tell me right now. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Maybe tell me tomorrow... Or maybe someday far from now...
