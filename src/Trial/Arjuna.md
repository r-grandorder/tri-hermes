# Trial Quest - Arjuna

## Search for the Song of Gods

**???:**
&mdash;That moment, I continue to repeat that moment. 

**???:**
Throughout the continued repetition of human history, that moment in my life... Even if it is insignificant in all that has happened... 

**???:**
Even if it was just me slaying my enemy. 

**???:**
The indescribable sadness, anger, happiness, and more than anything&mdash;relief, I can still remember it. 

**???:**
...Relief. 
Yes, that can only be called "relief." 

**???:**
Like when a scab is torn off, it's an odd pleasure. The fear that sent a shiver up my spine, it too has vanished into thin air. 

**???:**
But I was unable to touch the arrow that I myself had shot. Nor was I able to claim his head. 

**???:**
I could only stand there, dazed&mdash;and accept the glorious victory. 

**???:**
... 
... 

**???:**
...up. 

**???:**
Wake up, good fellow.

**Fujimaru 1:**
???---

 
**???:**
Are you all right? 

**???:**
Napping during a storm such as this, you must have some nerves of steel. 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Where in the world am I?

 
**???:**
Good question. 
...To be perfectly honest, I do not know myself. 

**???:**
When I awoke, I was on this ship, being tossed about in this storm. 

**???:**
I have knowledge of how to steer a ship, but I'm afraid all we can do is ride this out. 

**???:**
As that is the case, I decided that I should speak with you, since you were leisurely napping here. Also, I had nothing better to do, either. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who are you?

 
**???:**
...I'm not sure how to answer that. 
You see, I am not entirely sure myself. 

**???:**
I am a nameless man. The only thing that I remember is that I am an Archer Servant. 

--- 

**???:**
...I also have no idea where this ship will take us. 
Though I am a Servant, I don't even know who I am. 

**???:**
It does seem that you are my Master. 
If possible, may I accompany you for a while? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That is fine.

**???:**
Thank you. My name... Though I do not know it, I am sure I am an Archer Servant. 

**???:**
It is nice to meet you, Master. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where is Mash?

**???:**
Mash? I am not sure... 
There may be someone else inside this ship. 

--- 

**Mash:**
Master!? 
Are you here, Master!? 

**Mash:**
Senpai&mdash;! 

**???:**
Who is that? 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A dependable Servant.

**Mash:**
Thank goodness, Master. 
I'm so glad you're all right. 

**Mash:**
Yes, I am (Your Name) Senpai's Servant. 
My name is Mash Kyrielight! 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
My charming Kohai.

 
**Mash:**
What? Charming Kohai... 
Oh, I am hardly that... 

**Mash:**
No, I am still very much your Servant! 
You must call me dependable! 

**Mash:**
But...at any rate... 
Thank you... 

**Fou:**
Fou! 

--- 

**Mash:**
Here is our situation, Master. 

**Mash:**
Apparently, during the Rayshift, we were blown off course by a strange Singularity. 

**Mash:**
Unfortunately, we're unable to contact the Doctor. 

**Mash:**
By the way, who is that person? 
He looks like a well-known Servant somehow. 

**???:**
Unfortunately, I seem to have left my identity behind. 

**???:**
However, I do know that I am an Archer. As you can see, I carry a bow for a weapon. So quite obviously I am. 

**Mash:**
Well, uhm...Excuse me. I don't mean to seem rude, but that's not a Class that can be determined by one's weapon. 

**Mash:**
In this world where an Archer can wield two swords ([[Emiya]]), or strike with a club ([[Orion]])... 

**Mash:**
...and even hurl valuable treasures at random ([[Gilgamesh]])... 

**Mash:**
It's a bit premature to assume you're an Archer just because you carry a bow. 

**Archer:**
There is quite a variety of heroes in the world, it seems... 

**Mash:**
By the way, Senpai, what were you doing... Were you napping? 

**Mash:**
That is so like you, Senpai. You've been like that since I found you sound asleep in the corridor at Chaldea! 

**Mash:**
There's no way I can even relax. In fact, I feel a little sick... 

**Mash:**
No matter how many times I've been through this, I still can't get used to a ship deck during a storm... 

**Archer:**
Though this ship is quite sturdy, there could still be trouble if the storm continues... 

**Archer:**
What was that? 

**Mash:**
A Ghost-type enemy. 
Excuse me, but we could use your help! 


## (Part 2)

**Mash:**
We have annihilated them. 
Well done, Master. 

**Archer:**
...How humiliating. 
I was hardly any help at all. I'm so ashamed. 

**Mash:**
N-No, not at all. 
I'm just glad we're all right. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You seemed like you had doubts.

 
**Archer:**
...You have a keen eye. 
That's exactly right. I...have doubts about fighting. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't you want to fight?

 
**Archer:**
A skilled Master must be able to understand a Servant, even if the Servant is not their own. 

**Archer:**
That's right. For me -- battle carries only melancholy with it. 

--- 

**Mash:**
Why is that? 

**Archer:**
I know not my True Name, nor how many Holy Grail Wars I fought, nor how many I emerged from victorious. 

**Archer:**
...But I don't think I have been defeated. 
I have the utmost confidence in my abilities. 

**Archer:**
If I suffered a terrible defeat, Master certainly would have ordered me to commit suicide. 

**Mash:**
T-Talk about confidence! 
But what he says is not a lie, Senpai! 

**Archer:**
Perhaps I remained undefeated when I was alive as well That is precisely why it is all feels so empty. 

**Archer:**
Whether I am victorious or defeated... 

**Archer:**
It is all just an infinitesimal ship washed away by the enormous waves of time. 

**Archer:**
The joy of victory has no meaning. 
The humiliation of defeat has no meaning. 

**Archer:**
Therefore, nothing has any meaning. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even your life now?

 
**Archer:**
...That's right. It is not easy for me to say, but that is the present condition I am in. 

**Archer:**
If it were not for your presence, Master, I most likely would have abandoned the battle. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even death?

 
**Archer:**
I am a Servant to begin with... I am sure I belonged to the warrior class long before as well. 

**Archer:**
Therefore, I have no fear of death. 

--- 


**Lancer:**
That's not true, Archer. 
You are not a warrior unafraid of death. 

**Archer:**
...!? 

**Mash:**
Huh? Who was that!? 

**Lancer:**
The man you are now is not someone unafraid of death. 
You merely have not seen death. 

**Lancer:**
You achieved so much glory so easily and with so little challenge that you ended up tired of life. 

**Lancer:**
Your philosophy has led you to nothing more than desperation. You merely have a low opinion of your own existence. 

**Lancer:**
That's not even martyrdom. 
I won't allow you to take that path! 

**Archer:**
...Who...are you? 
No, wait... Who am I? 

**Lancer:**
...How infuriating! Even though I proclaim the truth, you still do not understand. 

**Lancer:**
The one and only person in this world that I cannot accept. That one person is you, bowman! 

**Archer:**
...ugh! 

**Lancer:**
A wild and crude shot. Is that the best you can do? 
Then you had better restring your bow. 

**Mash:**
Archer!? 

**Mash:**
Calm down, please! He's not an ally, but that doesn't make him an enemy! 

**Archer:**
...I know. I know that, but... 
That man&mdash;I won't stand for him! 

**Archer:**
I cannot stand your presence. 
For whatever reason, I cannot stand your presence! 

**Lancer:**
&mdash;Now that's a little more like it. 
That fury. That unreasonable malevolence. 

**Lancer:**
That arrogance is what makes you who you are. That aura of righteous anger is most fitting for the man who carries that bow. 

**Lancer:**
Fire away without reservation. 
Come on, don't hold back. 

**Lancer:**
I won't pull any punches either. 
I will run my shadow lance through your throat! 


<h3>(After Battle)</h3>

**Archer:**
Haa, haa, haa... 

**Lancer:**
A tenacity that ignores the Class affinity... 
Our fates are truly intertwined. 

**Lancer:**
...But that is all for now. 
We must each again inquire of the Bhagavad-Gita. 

**Lancer:**
We can continue this after that is finished. ...the Master over there, and the one who watched over that Master. 

**Lancer:**
...I know it may be a burden to you, but I want you to guide him. You're the only ones who can do it. 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you need guidance as well?

 
**Lancer:**
...It‘s unnecessary. 
But I do appreciate the offer. 

**Lancer:**
As long as that man is present, I will be your enemy. 

**Lancer:**
The same is true if reversed as well. 

**Lancer:**
A hated enemy is a necessary ingredient of myth. 
I am truly used to playing that part. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But for what purpose?

 
**Lancer:**
I have no obligation to answer my enemies. 
What I am after is insignificant. 

--- 

**Archer:**
Master, a while ago I said that I had tired of living. 

**Archer:**
That is the sincere truth. 
My thirst for battle has also faded. 

**Archer:**
However... 
even so... 

**Archer:**
I cannot abide that Lancer. 
I know this feeling I have is unreasonable... 

**Archer:**
That man is most certainly a righteous person. 

**Archer:**
He is recognized by the people and is a hero who devotes himself to doing virtuous deeds. 

**Archer:**
But still, I truly, for some reason, want to battle him. 

**Archer:**
No, it's not a desire to battle. 
I want to deny him. Deny all of him. Everything. 

**Archer:**
...I am certain this is an unforgivable request. 
This is an improper desire. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It is not improper.---

**Archer:**
Not improper? What do you mean? 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Most certainly he is your mortal enemy.

 
**Archer:**
My mortal...enemy. 

**Archer:**
... 
... 

**Archer:**
I see. 
Those words have hit home. 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then you should go on a quest for that answer.

 
**Archer:**
Go on a...quest? 

**Archer:**
... 
... 

**Archer:**
You may be right. 
To find out who the man is that boils my blood... 

**Archer:**
...and to find out who I am. 
I should search for those answers. 

--- 

---

 
**Archer:**
...It seems the storm has passed as well, as if waking from a dream. 

**Archer:**
I am ever a wanderer. 

**Archer:**
If we meet again in reality, I would be glad if we could find those answers together. 

**Archer:**
&mdash;Farewell, my Master. 
I look forward to the day that we may meet again.
