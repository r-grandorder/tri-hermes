# FSN Tiger Dojo Special



Thank you for your hard work.

---

Congratulations on clearing the main story and collecting all the Tiger Stamps.

---

Congratulations!

---

Welcome to the Tiger Dojo Special that rewards you for clearing the long story of Fate and completing the Tiger Stamps!

---

I have nothing to say if you've played this game to this degree.

---

Yes, you can go anywhere, sir!

---

Yeah, we can finally say goodbye to mouse-clicking hell.

---

Well, we're on our incentive trip and are at Einzbern's secret hot spring, the Valhalla Hot Spring.

---

How do you like the hot spring, Taiga?

---

It's great. It's really relaxing.

---

I feel like I'll go to heaven if I relax a little too much.

---

Right? The benefits of this hot spring include relieving fatigue and sending souls to heaven.

---

You won't be able to come back if you drop your guard.

---

Huh......!?

---

I think I saw a butter field...!

---

That was close. I shouldn't sleep in the bath.

---

Well this is the grand finale of the Tiger Dojo.

---

We will now hold a review meeting to wrap up Fate.

---

Hey, it's boring to be scolded until the very end.

---

We're at a hot spring, so let's just stick to talking about what happened.

---

Huh!? I'm being expostulated by an underage loli-girl?

---

But you're right. The hot spring feels good. Review meetings are what lions do[heart]

---

Yeah, I contemplate my actions. Let's look back at what's happened without thinking about anything.

---

So, what was your favorite part of the main story?

---

Me? Hmm, I'll say the part where I got killed in Rin's route. There wasn't a CG there, but they added one later on.

---

Oh, the one where you get your heart ripped out? Yeah, my heart skipped on that scene.

---

Why don't you just die like that?

---

I'm talking about the CG of me and Berserker.

---

By the way, the one you're talking about is a mysterious CG that was the top candidate to be dumped, but was completed and inserted before everyone realized it.

---

I-I see.

---

That's weird. So they kept such a nasty CG and dumped the one where I transform using the God of Babylonia's power to fight one-on-one against Angra Manyu?

---

&mdash;Hey, Taiga. It doesn't matter, but it's Jaguar Man that transforms using the God of Babylonia's power. It's not tiger.

---

What!? No way! But that tiger with the mantle has these really cute whiskers!

---

If having whiskers makes you a tiger, even Mobi** Suits will be tigers.

---

Shock! It's as shocking as finding out oshiruko and zenzai are two different kinds of food!

---

Sigh... I've been wondering, but why are you concerned about tigers?

---

You don't like being called Tiger, but the clothes you wear have tiger patterns. Do you like them or not?

---

Hm. I love them and detest them at the same time.

---

......Well, okay. People have their tastes, so I won't pursue the question.

---

So, what part of the main story is your favorite?

---

Hmm. I like the opening movie.

---

Especially the part where Fujimura Taiga shows up.

---

I guess it was stupid of me to ask.

---

We won't make any progress like this, so let's go in order.

---

We'll start out with the first part, Saber route.

---

It's a route that represents the game Fate, just like the route name "Fate" indicates.

---

I have no complaint about this route because I have a big part and Taiga comes out in the ending.

---

Yeah. I was one of the main heroines back then. Time sure is cruel. Fufufu. I should kill the guy who wrote the story[heart]

---

Okay, don't feel sorry for yourself.

---

The purpose of Saber's route is to give the details of the Holy Grail War with the main focus on Saber.

---

It's a standard story intended for beginner Masters.

---

You were one of the bosses too.

---

Shirou had to part with Saber-chan, but this should make him stronger...

---

...Wait.

---

Does that mean there's a big danger of Shirou becoming Archer-san in this route?

---

That would depend on how Shirou lives.

---

Well, I think that's a pretty small possibility. I'm by his side, after all.

---

I see. I'm relieved to know that Shirou will head down the path of evil with this small devil.

---

Oh, wait a minute.

---

You can live that long, Illya-chan!?

---

That's a secret.

---

Well, everyone eventually dies, so don't worry about it.

---

So, next is Rin route, "Unlimited Blade Works"...

---

It follows many perspectives, and the story is more oriented towards the Servants.

---

And quite frankly...

---

We had no part in the story.

---

Illya-chan exited the stage midway, and I was treated without much consideration.

---

You're always treated without consideration.

---

Guwa! The truth pierces my heart!

---

But Tohsaka-san's pretty unimportant, even though she's the main heroine.

---

I think Archer took all the great moments.

---

That can't be helped.

---

As the title "Unlimited Blade Works" indicates, Rin's route is a story about Shirou.

---

"Fate" and "Unlimited Blade Works" are two sides of one story.

---

Shirou is the protagonist of this game, so the game has to be about Shirou.

---

He's a pretty warped person, after all.

---

I see.

---

So the first two routes completely covered all the themes.

---

Yup.

---

So this is the front side of Fate. The story you get if you do everything you can as a Master.

---

Next is Sakura's route, the back side of Fate.

---

It's the deadly struggle chapter, where you fight through from the beginning to the end of the Holy Grail War!

---

Deadly struggle chapter, huh? You're right. You die the most in Sakura-chan's route, after all.

---

I can't laugh at how the shortest route ended up being the longest.

---

There would've been a route for me and Illya-chan if this one had been shorter.

---

Your route didn't exist from the plot stage.

---

Well, Sakura-chan's route was full of quick twists and turns, but what do you think, Illya-chan?

---

Can you call it a grand finale?

---

Of course you can. Something ridiculous like the Great Holy Grail was destroyed, and everyone's alive except me and Saber.

---

You can't ask for more.

---

Oh. But I guess there was a plan to have a ridiculous ending where Sakura-chan, Rider-san, and Saber-chan are alive.

---

................Um, is that heaven?

---

It's more like hell than heaven.

---

Well, life's fun because you can't have it your way. It's just right when some people are missing.

---

Wow, your words are filled with dignity.

---

As expected from a character that's both a younger sister and an older sister.

---

So, would you say Shirou is your younger brother or your older brother?

---

That's a secret!

---

As I have both attributes, Shirou also has both!

---

Oh, I understand.

---

But it's interesting and sad at the same time, considering that he might end up like Archer-san if he matures in the wrong way.

---

Well, it'll depend on how he grows up, so let's leave it to Rin and Sakura.

---

I said it before, but Fate is Shirou's story. The question of how Shirou should exist is presented in Saber and Rin's routes.

---

One of the answers is Sakura's route, "Heavens Feel".

---

We don't even need to say what the answer was.

---

He lost many things, but he'll be accumulating new things from now on.

---

Yup. That's why this is a grand finale.

---

Everyone's going to be as happy as they can get.

---

Oh, you're such a good girl. We don't learn how good you are until after you're dead. You really are like an evil heroine.

---

Heh. That's my role from the beginning. I have no regrets.

---

The rest is a battle for the remaining people. I'm just going to enjoy my hot spring and look down at the earth.

---

I see.

---

Then let's wrap this up nicely with a smile, pupil number one!

---

Osu, all right, master!

---

All right!

---

This is the end of Fate/stay night!

---

Thanks for not getting discouraged from the long playing time and fighting through the whole game!

---

Yeah, thanks for playing the game!

---

We took part after every dead end, but our duties are over now.

---

This is the real farewell, but let's meet again in the main story!

---

Goodbye! Don't die again!

---

Goodbye!

---

Huh...? By the way, Illya-chan. Were you saying something about looking down at earth from here?

---

Yeah. I said I'll watch over the earth from here.

---

.........C-C-Could this hot spring be...

---

Um...... Heaven?

---

Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!

---

It's not ending nicely at all!!
