## Prelude
 
**Pirate:**
Cannon ready!
 
**Drake:**
All right, FIRE&mdash;!
 
**Pirate:**
Dammit, it's no good!Looks like it's not working after all!
 
**Drake:**
I can see that!We're fools to be taking them seriously!
 
**Drake:**
Hard to port! Time to make a run for it, men!Catch the breeze and flee!
 
**Pirate:**
Breeze?!Isn't this more like a storm?
 
**Pirate:**
If we put the sails up,our ship will be blown away!
 
**Drake:**
It's okay!Even pirates wanna fly sometimes!
 
**Drake:**
Now you'll have more lame stories for when we return to land! Maybe they'll finally work on the ladies!
 
**Drake:**
And returning from the skies?That's a tale any woman of wit will love!
 
**Pirate:**
Hah! Our Pelican's seriously getting some air now!Looks like the boss is out of control!
 
**Drake:**
What! Pelican?What the HELL did you just call my ship!?
 
**Pirate:**
The Hind! The Golden Hind, ma'am!My mistake!
 
**Pirate:**
All right! Hang tight, you little twerps!
 
**Pirate:**
Our boss' good luck is the real deal!Believe in her, and she'll get us out of this alive!
 
**Pirate:**
Once we're on land again, even swabbies will get to feast! Don't you go dyin' on me now!
 
**Pirates:**
AAAAHHH! After what we've seen,we'd follow you into the depths of hell, Captain!
 
**Drake:**
Don't be silly. I've got no use for dead people!A pirate's all about staying alive and sailing!
 
**Drake:**
Now, get to work you idiots! We'll win this war and return to drink ourselves silly!
 
**Pirates:**
OOOOOOH!Captain Drake, you're the best! I love being a pirate!
 
**F：???:**
...You managed to escape this massive whirlpool...And you aren't even a Heroic Spirit. Unbelievable...
 
**F：???:**
But&mdash;Heh heh, hahahahaha! That's what makes you Francis Drake! Your legend is true!
 
**F：???:**
Hahaha! HAHAHAHAH!AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA LOLOLOLOLOL!

**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**A：???:**
&mdash;I woke up at the same time today.
 
**A：???:**
I checked my temperature. My five senses.To drive the point home, I said my name out loud.
 
**A：???:**
A deep breath&mdash;I confirmed my consciousness,as I was told it might disappear each time I fell asleep.
 
**A：???:**
I was myself.My existence had been approved one more day.
 
**B：???:**
Good morning, Number 2.Aren't you cold? The temperature outside is 70 below.
 
**B：???:**
It's especially cold this morning. Well, I suppose that's irrelevant as long as you're in this room.
 
**A：???:**
There in that clean, comfortable room,I said what came to my mind, "That's quite troublesome."
 
**B：???:**
...Any inconveniences?If there's something you don't like, please let me know.
 
**A：???:**
He smiled as he told me that,and gave me a very pained look.
 
**A：???:**
I thought, perhaps, that part of his body was in pain."Are you okay?" I asked him.
 
**B：???:**
...Yeah, I'm fine. Guess my worries were unwarranted.Good morning, ■■. Congrats on your 5,110th awakening.
 
**A：???:**
"Thank you very much," I responded.It was how I genuinely felt.
 
**A：???:**
I was extremely happy. For one more day,I'd get to enjoy the wonders of this world.
 
**Fou:**
Fou! (plod, plod, plod)Fou! FOU!! (plod, plod, plod, plod)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oww, oww.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stop, stop.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
N-No, Fou!You must not bite. You should use a gentler touch.
 
**Mash:**
Even if they are as dense as a rock.See, like a blade peeling a carrot.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Good morning, Mash.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm already awake, Mash.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...My.Non-REM sleep to fully awake in a single second...
 
**Mash:**
Good morning, and very impressive, Senpai.You're clearly enthusiastic about being entrusted with the Continuation of Humanity.
 
**Mash:**
I'm serious about it too.Let's be optimistic and head to the control room!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning everyone, how did you all sleep?I didn't sleep much.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We defeated Lev Lainur and retrieved the second Holy Grail... That's great, but there are more questions.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What was that pillar of flesh? Who was that,claiming to be one of the 72 Demon Gods?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We unfortunately don't have the time or resources to analyze these questions.
 
**Mash:**
...Um, Dr. Roman.Speaking of the 72 Demon Gods, well...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, I can only think of one thing.The familiars who served a certain ancient king.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ancient king?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Familiars?
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's right! The King of Ancient Israel,and the greatest summoner in the world of mages!
 
**Da Vinci:**
The familiars who served him were the infamous 72 Demon Gods!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!?
 
**Mash:**
Huh! Are you Da Vinci?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. Good. Perfect!Mash, I love your reaction!
 
**Da Vinci:**
It was worth slipping those cue cards to Roman!As a genius, my stage entries must be grand!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Sigh. Please don't tire me out so early in the morning, Da Vinci.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also, please refrain from spreading rumors.None of this information is substantiated.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To begin with, the 72 Demon Gods are all fantasies.Demon Gods don't actually exist.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
These days people speculate that they were merely familiars broken down into 72 different roles, right?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. But since the roles were so clearly defined,some theorize that they may be the origin of angels.
 
**Da Vinci:**
And since he actually claimed to be one, it's not unrelated?
 
**Da Vinci:**
How about the hypothesis that Lev, or the mastermind behind him, summoned "a certain ancient king?"
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...That possibility does exist...Still, I find the idea of 72 Demon Gods hard to believe...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Why is that?I mean, Fujimaru actually fought one, right?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why. The data I have seems to correspond with what I would expect from a "demon."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, uh, how do I put this... It follows the legend too well.The concept of demons came much later than that king.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Suppose that king really did turn into a Heroic Spirit.His Noble Phantasm would be a lot simpler and smarter.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It would be strange to have such an ominous Demon God, one that modern-day people know of, serving under him.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm. You have a point.The chance that they're just assuming the name is high.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Now, if we could just ask Servants related to Demon Gods a few questions, it would make our lives infinitely easier.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. That's why, for now, I won't comment on the Demon God Lev transformed into. It's still anybody's guess.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Back on topic...Let's talk about obtaining the third Holy Grail.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This may seem sudden, but Fujimaru,did you get seasick back in Rome?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A little bit.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see....Right, of course.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Humans are creatures that have learned to adapt.I'm sure you'll be fine.
 
**Mash:**
That's not very reassuring, Doctor.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm fine.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good! How reassuring. I was about to get motion sickness meds that "work" on the central nervous system, if need be.
 

---

 
**Fou:**
FOU!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh? Fou is going to head out again?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hmm. I'm not superstitious, but when Fou's around Mash's mental state stabilizes... I'll be counting on you.
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry Doctor, but if Fou's nearby during a crisis, I just feel so much calmer...
 
**Fou:**
N'kyu.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
New land always awaits us with each Rayshift.The more we find familiar, the better. Take him with you.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The year is 1573.The location&mdash; An ocean as far as the eye can see!
 
**Mash:**
Ocean, you say?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right. The geography is shifting correspondingly with the Singularity.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It doesn't look like there's an area that can be specifically marked "here."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The sea only has several islands scattered around.I would like you to investigate the cause of the Singularity immediately.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I hope we don't end up in the ocean...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's no need to worry about that.We'll input the necessary coordinates for the Rayshift.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At the very least, you shouldn't end up in the ocean.Besides, you have another promising ally with you.
 
**Mash:**
Ally?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here, I invented it. It's a rubber floaty.You can use it in case you get into trouble.
 
**Mash:**
...Sigh.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Roger that.
 
**Mash:**
Umm... It would be quite troublesome if we landed in the middle of the ocean right after being teleported.
 
**Mash:**
I don't know how to swim.Senpai... You're not a great swimmer either, are you?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't worry, I've taken that into consideration for the purposes of the Rayshift.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At least you won't end up in the walls somewhere.In case you do end up in the ocean&ndash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
Here, a floaty! Cool, isn't it?I took the liberty of designing it in Decalavian style.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha. This is needlessly prickly!Fitting the ocean theme, it's like a starfish!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Dr. Roman?This is putting Senpai's safety on the line, right?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Sorry. It was just a little joke before departure.I shall tend to the Rayshift at all costs.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Hmm. I still have some worries,but we don't have the time to address all of them.
 
**Mash:**
Master, let's go.I will give it everything I have.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, let's do it, Mash!
 
**Mash:**
Of course.Leave the combat to me once we arrive.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have a couple of errands...
 
**Mash:**
Leave the errands till after we've returned to Chaldea.Now, let's go.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha. Mash has really started to take charge.Fujimaru is the type that gets henpecked, too.
 
**Mash:**
???
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're coming after all.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll carry you.
 

---

 
**Fou:**
N'kyu!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like you're all set.Now, let's start the search for the third Holy Grail!
 

---

 
**Announcement A:**
Unsummon Program, start.  Spiritron Conversion, start.
 
**Announcement A:**
Counting down to Rayshift. 3, 2, 1...
 
**Announcement A:**
All procedures cleared.Grand Order, commencing operation.
 
## Section 1: Pirates of Chaldea 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey, Mash...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...True, we never did Rayshift to the ocean before.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, but Mash...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai.I know exactly what you're trying to say.
 
**Mash:**
...Dr. Roman.If you have any excuses, let's hear them.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well... Uh...Murphy's Law, was it?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When there's a chance of failure,you're sure to be guided towards that failure?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also...When you think about it...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It is completely possible to be Rayshifted onto a deserted island and wait a full 28 years before help arrives, right?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then wouldn't you say it's rather beneficial to have transport immediately available?
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Pirate:**
Not really sure what's going on, but...Get 'em, fellas!
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Seems like Dr. Roman needs to be disciplined after all!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, I promise I meant well!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Pirate:**
Sorry about that...
 
**Mash:**
...Whew. I don't like to get rough, but with the situation as it is, I have no choice but to interrogate you... Forcefully.
 
**Mash:**
Who are you, where is this ocean, and what's going on?Would you care to explain?
 
**Pirate:**
Hey, we have no clue either, see.Before we knew it, we were afloat around here.
 
**Pirate:**
Our compasses and maps are completely useless, too.
 
**Pirate:**
When you've got no clue what's going on, see, you just attack the prey in front of you, right? It's the pirate's way.
 
**Mash:**
What? So you had no idea who we were...
 
**Mash:**
And you didn't know if it's safe to do so,yet you still attacked us?
 
**Pirate:**
♪That's right, yo ho♪♪Because we're pirates♪
 
**Mash:**
...What should we do, Senpai?He's started to sing like he's in a musical...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is he an idiot?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't we have other leads?
 

---

 
**Pirate:**
I may be an idiot, but I do have some leads.Word has it, there's a Pirate Island nearby.
 
**Pirate:**
We're running low on food and water.I say it's a good idea to try the island...
 
**Mash:**
Pirate...Island?Um, are there lots of pirates there?
 
**Pirate:**
Yeah, it IS Pirate Island.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...For now, we don't have any leads that feel like leads.We might as well go there.
 
**Mash:**
Understood... Well, everyone, I hereby exercise my rights as victor.
 
**Mash:**
Please, man the wheel.Head towards this Pirate Island.
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye, sir!
 
**Mash:**
That would be, "Aye, aye, ma'am!"
 
## Section 2: Pioneering Pirate Queen 
 
**Mash:**
Looks like this is Pirate Island...
 
**Pirate:**
Woo-hoo! Women!Prey! Hunting! Looks like fun!
 
**Mash:**
...Looks like pirates are just as enthusiastic on land.I'm taking them out!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
...All right, next please.
 
**Pirate:**
Hey, gimme a break.I didn't mean any harm...
 
**Pirate:**
It was my instinct as a pirate...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-What a poor excuse for a pirate!
 
**Mash:**
Does anyone on this island have a grasp of the situation?
 
**Pirate:**
Oh... That would be Boss, I guess.
 
**Mash:**
Who's Boss?
 
**Pirate:**
Heh heh heh, listen and be amazed... Francis Drake,the greatest, most glorious pirate on the high seas!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why this swagger all of a sudden?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm. Perhaps it's a desperate attempt to seem more"pirate" like. That's what I think.
 
**Pirate:**
After we get through the forest, you'll find the Great Pirate Francis Drake's secret hideout.
 
**Pirate:**
Heh heh heh... You guys are done for.When Boss gets a hold of you, you'll be...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why does this person keep talking like a grunt?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Setting up one's character is important in any era.It's even normal to recreate your body into a beautiful idol.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry Da Vinci, but can you just go back to your workshop?
 
**Pirate:**
What's with all the ruckus?Is it magic? Magic or something!?
 
**Fou:**
Fou.
 
**Pirate:**
Oh my, what is this adorable little creature.It looks delicious.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eat him and I'll beat you till you cry.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Eat him and I'll crush you till you cry.
 

---

 
**Pirate:**
Yes, sorry!
 
**Mash:**
Master, we need to press onward.
 
**Mash:**
Francis Drake.One of the great heroes that pioneered this world.
 
**Mash:**
We are in the midst of the Age of Exploration&mdash;If he's the real Drake, he's probably a living being.
 
**Mash:**
He's the first voyager in history to sail around the globe and live to tell the tale.
 
**Mash:**
England received great fortune from his actions. They bested Spain, who had been dominating the world seas.
 
**Mash:**
Spain was once touted as The Sun That Never Sets.But even Spaniards feared him, the "El Draque"...
 
**Mash:**
Truly the "Hero Who Brought Down the Sun." The prosperity of the British Empire wouldn't be possible without Captain Drake.
 
**Mash:**
Though Drake was officially sanctioned by the state as a corsair... A pirate is still a pirate.
 
**Mash:**
Judging from the behavior of pirates we've met so far,odds are high that he's a good-for-nothing thug.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't let your guard down.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Roman's just as good-for-nothing.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, that is correct.
 
**Mash:**
Most likely a gluttonous giant, a nefarious character able to grab a barrel in one hand and chug its contents.
 
**Mash:**
...It is quite disturbing, but there is no doubt he is a key person of this era.
 
**Mash:**
We must somehow get the help of Francis Drake.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! BOSS!We've got enem... err, guests, I mean!
 
**Pirate:**
They said they wish to speak with you, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
The hell? Geez, right when I'm in a good mood from this good rum&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
Guests? Are they pirates?
 
**Pirate:**
Umm, I don't think so!They seem a bit classier than us, and a bit more violent!
 
**Mash:**
...A bit?
 
**Drake:**
The hell is that?Well then, government? Or army?
 
**Pirate:**
Uhh, I don't think they're any of those.
 
**Drake:**
So you don't know... Fine, bring them in!
 
**Mash:**
If you'll excuse me.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
...Well now,you certainly brought me some strange ones, Bombe.
 
**Pirate:**
Yeah. But they've got their good points.
 
**Pirate:**
Not only did they save our lives,but they're excited to meet their idol captain.
 
**Drake:**
Idol. I'm their idol? Really?
 
**Pirate:**
Yeah. They've been saying how great you are,how Drake can blast away the Spanish Armada in an instant!
 
**Pirate:**
That Drake's a giant over 3 meters tall who downs rum by the barrel. They're really excited!
 
**Drake:**
Whaaat? What's up with that?I haven't committed such sins yet!
 
**Mash:**
...Um, Senpai.I'm so stunned I can't speak. (whispering)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Me too. Who knew that THE Francis Drake was&mdash; (whispering)
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who knew she was a woman!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, who knew she was a beautiful lady!
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Stand aside, Bombe.I'll do the talking.
 
**Drake:**
So? Who on earth are you?Looks like you took good care of my boys.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're from the Organization.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're from Chaldea.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
You must be Francis Drake.
 
**Mash:**
My name is Mash Kyrielite.I'm part of the Chaldea Security Organization.
 
**Mash:**
This is my Master&ndash;Fujimaru.
 
**Drake:**
Chaldea? What do the "stargazers" want with us?Are they here to sell us some new maps of constellations?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wha-? This drunk actually knows her stuff!Even the origins of Chaldea!
 
**Drake:**
...Something feels really shallow about you, sir.
 
**Drake:**
Cowardly, gutless, pessimistic... A good man,but a chicken. I hate people like you the most.
 
**Mash:**
...Perfect.Senpai, her analysis... I mean instinct, is perfect!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Shucks...
 
**Drake:**
Well, spare me the details. They're just a pain in the ass.So, what does Chaldea want with me anyway?
 
**Mash:**
...Right, we were sent to fix all the anomalies in this era.
 
**Drake:**
...Okay.
 
**Mash:**
Captain Francis Drake.Since you're so great, you've probably already noticed.
 
**Mash:**
Something is wrong with this era, with this world.
 
**Mash:**
The ocean you've spent your days in,and the ocean we see before us, are not the same.
 
**Drake:**
...Heh, all this talk about the world, the era,they were things I decided to completely ignore...
 
**Drake:**
...But I can't ignore talk about the ocean.You're right, something did feel strange.
 
**Mash:**
...I thought so!We can explain why&mdash;
 
**Drake:**
&mdash;But when I say "strange," I don't mean it as a bad thing. There's no other world that's as fun as this one!
 
**Drake:**
Isn't that right, you scumbags?
 
**Pirate:**
Woo-hoo! You bet!You're the best, Boss! Hear, hear, to never-ending rum!
 
**Mash:**
Whaaaaaaaat?
 
**Drake:**
You see? We pirates long for freedom,even if it entails evil deeds!
 
**Drake:**
If you insist on speaking with me...You must pass some tests first.
 
**Drake:**
Try to defeat me, THE Francis Drake.Then we can talk!
 
**Drake:**
I'm as drunk as they come right now!Let's see if you have what it takes to sober me up!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I guess too much freedom is sometimes a bad thing.Like in France, please use the back of the blade!
 
**Mash:**
O-Of course!I shall respond to Captain Drake's request. Master!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, let's do this!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go!
 

---

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
S-So powerful...This person is flesh and blood, right?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-Well, she should be.Thing is, I'm getting a magical energy reading from her.
 
**Mash:**
So she's either a mage&ndash;or a hero from birth?
 
**Drake:**
Ahhhh! That hits the spot.Rum's got nothing on this, I'm telling you.
 
**Pirate:**
Hey Boss! You all right?
 
**Drake:**
Hahaha! What are you talking about?Of course I'm all right!
 
**Drake:**
That aside though...Seems that I lost.
 
**Drake:**
You can boil me, fry me, sleep with me,anything you want!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll pass.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm good.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master, I don't think you need to reply every time...
 
**Drake:**
Oh? I see, I see.In that case, I guess it can't be helped.
 
**Drake:**
Anyway, a loss is a loss,I'll hear you guys out.
 
**Drake:**
But, you know what?From the looks of it, you want a ride, don't you?
 
**Drake:**
You're looking for something, but are unfamiliar with these seas.That's why you need to rely on me, pirate or not.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You being a pirate is irrelevant.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We need you, Francis Drake.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
I see....Hmm, hah, so that's it.
 
**Drake:**
So? What exactly do you want from us?We lost, so we'll give you anything other than our lives.
 
**Mash:**
...First, we must understand the situation."Where" exactly are we?
 
**Mash:**
England? Or closer to Spain, perhaps?Or are we in the Caribbean?
 
**Drake:**
Uhh, sorry.Come to think of it, we don't know either.
 
**Mash:**
So all that revelry and you don't even know!?
 
**Drake:**
Right, because there's no shortage of food or booze.
 
**Drake:**
All right. Now that we've surrendered to you,we're officially part of your crew!
 
**Drake:**
How about we start off with a toast!
 
**Mash:**
H-Hey, wait a sec...
 
**Drake:**
C'mooon, it's fine, it's all good.
 
**Mash:**
It's NOT good!Hey, what are you... No, wait! Master, save me!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hm?What are these readings...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's up?
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nah, must be an error.I'll make some adjustments.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
All right, men!To our two new comrades, Fujimaru and Mash.
 
**Drake:**
Huh? That's backwards.To their new comrades, us&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
Cheers!
 
**Pirate:**
Cheers!
 
**Mash:**
Oh, but we really don't have time for this...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It can't be helped.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's nothing we can do.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Please don't give in so easily! We have to set sail and check out these waters immediately...
 
**Drake:**
What's with the gloomy look?You'll never find treasure with an attitude like that!
 
**Mash:**
That's not what I mean.If you're going to help, please consider our situation&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
Huh? Oh, I get it, more or less.These waters are abnormal, right?
 
**Drake:**
I mean, I've seen superhumans walking around who won't even budge from cannon fire.
 
**Mash:**
Servants!
 
**Drake:**
Being a pirate myself, see,I've been through my share of chaos.
 
**Drake:**
I can usually tell when it's something bad and unavoidable.
 
**Drake:**
These waters are abnormal. One moment we're in a jungle, the next we're in a temperate Mediterranean climate&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
The currents and winds are a mess, too.I mean, even sailing straight out into the sea is tricky.
 
**Drake:**
...Moreover, there's no "continent" in this ocean.Nor is there an "England."
 
**Mash:**
So, you already knew that much...
 
**Drake:**
Hence why we were already planning on a new journey as soon as tomorrow.
 
**Drake:**
Doesn't make sense for pirates to settle down on land.Gotta find a town to call our home base.
 
**Drake:**
Tonight was supposed to be the pre-party.But, you guys showed up out of nowhere.
 
**Mash:**
I see...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry for interfering.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pardon us.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Don't sweat it. You guys are a good omen!
 
**Drake:**
From what I can tell,you know how to handle a cannon or two. Right?
 
**Mash:**
I've never tried, but probably. ...Um, so if you already knew this much, why did you attack us?
 
**Drake:**
Ahahaha!Well, isn't that obvious? Because it seemed like fun!
 
**Mash:**
Such a trivial reason...
 
**Drake:**
So, Fujimaru you say?You the&ndash;captain or something?
 
**Mash:**
Something similar, I would say.
 
**Drake:**
Heh heh heh. In that case&ndash;Drink up!
 
**Drake:**
Let's be friends. From one captain to another, eh?
 
**Fou:**
Fou!? Fofou?FOOOOOOOOOU!
 
**Mash:**
...Huh?
 
**Drake:**
Now, someone knows how to hold their liquor.
 
**Mash:**
U-Umm... Senpai?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it, Mash?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
The H-Holy Grail...
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I know.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, the Holy Grail&ndash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll get it.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No, that's not what I mean.The Holy Grail...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
For everyone who fought with us!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Um, okay....That's not what I mean, Senpai!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do our best, Mash!
 

---

 
**Mash :**
Senpai, how many fingers am I holding up?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see two Mashes, so...
 

---

 
**Mash :**
Get ahold of yourself! Senpai! Right in front of you!The Holy Grail! It's here!
 
**Drake:**
Why're you staring at me all of a sudden?You see someone you recognize?
 
**Mash:**
That's not it at all! That thing!What the captain has in her hands!
 
**Drake:**
Ah-ha! You got a fine pair of eyes there.Gold tankards are usually so tasteless, but not this one.
 
**Drake:**
It's not just the never-ending booze from it, either.
 
**Drake:**
Place it on the table, and behold!It produces endless meat and fish!
 
**Drake:**
I just happened to pick it up,but I doubt you'll find anything like this anywhere.
 
**Pirate:**
What're you talking about, Boss? This wasn't coincidence. It was an adventure for several lifetimes!
 
**Pirate:**
Seven endless nights!Giant destructive whirlpools in one ocean after another!
 
**Pirate:**
And from within the maelstrom,the legendary lost city of Atlantis!
 
**Pirate:**
"The time is upon us. By the 12 gods of Olympus, I shall create another flood and destroy all civilization!"
 
**Pirate:**
That's what the big thing said right before Boss kicked its ass and seized the treasure!
 
**Pirate:**
And with that, as crazy as it sounds,she became a hero! She saved the world!
 
**Drake:**
Huh? Was it really that epic?It got on my nerves, so I gave it a piece of my mind.
 
**Drake:**
That big lug called itself Poseidon.Can't really have that as a sailor.
 
**Drake:**
That's why I put it in check and took its treasure, see?I even sank the entire city into the whirlpool. It was great!
 
**G：Pirate:**
Bwaaaahahaha! Way to go, Boss!Both fortune and misfortune smiled upon you!
 
**G：Pirate:**
You're gonna be single till the day you die!Or maybe you're actually a dude or something, eh Boss?
 
**Drake:**
Now this is fun! We've got a new crew, and the booze is tasty! But we're takin' Bombe in a barrel later, and sinkin' him!
 
**Drake:**
Now we sing, you idiots!Golden Hind, sing the crew's theme song!
 
**Drake & Pirates:**
♪Reap our treasure!♪♪Down our ale!♪
 
**Fou:**
Fou... FOOOOOOOU!
 
**Mash:**
Ahhh... Aahhh...I don't believe it... They're not lying!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, the Foundation of Humanity was on the verge of destruction in this era before we arrived!
 
**Mash:**
And... Captain Drake, without even knowing,resolved it on a whim.
 
**Mash:**
And the result&mdash;
 
**Drake:**
Whoa, it's sinking into my body.I never get used to this, really.
 
**Drake:**
With this treasure,I can even deal damage to those invincible guys.
 
**Drake:**
But it goes in and out of my body.Makes my chest so tight, I can't stand it.
 
**Mash:**
That Holy Grail!Captain Drake is the owner of this era's Holy Grail&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
No, by saving this era, the Holy Grail chose her.She is truly the rightful owner of the Grail!
 
**Mash:**
Doctor! Doctor!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, yes, yes, what is it?Can you get back to me later?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The search program is acting up a bit. For some reason,it says the Holy Grail is right in front of you.
 
**Mash:**
That's right!The Holy Grail is here! In front of us!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
WHAT!?
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Case closed! Woohoo!
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And, Fujimaru seems to be in an awfully good mood?
 
**Pirate A:**
Ow!Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing.
 
**Pirate B:**
Huuuh?Shut up and mind your own business.
 
**Pirate A:**
Huh?
 
**Pirate B:**
Huuh?
 
**Drake:**
And, now they're fighting.Looks like we have to stop them!
 
**Mash:**
This is insane...
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
So... What?You guys came for this magical tankard...
 
**Drake:**
I mean the Holy Grail?You can go back to your country if you have this?
 
**Mash:**
...Yes.Well, that's it, more or less.
 
**Drake:**
Hmm. Well, I can't deny that I lost to you,and I even said I'd give you anything but my life.
 
**Drake:**
Here, take it. You came here from a distant era, right?Thanks for making the trip.
 
**Mash:**
Th-Thank you very much. Since we've retrieved the Holy Grail, we've resolved the Singularity of this era...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Have we?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think we have.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...You're right.
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, the Holy Grail has been secured.Have there been any changes?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not that I can tell.The Bolt of this era is still left unsecured.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Holy Grail is indeed functioning to a certain extent.But, it's not as strong a force as before.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Maybe it's the real Holy Grail.The one that was in this era to begin with.
 
**Mash:**
...In other words, it's different from the Grails we've seen?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah. The Grails that Lev Lainur supposedly placed disrupt the seven Foundations of Humanity.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, there was another Holy Grail in these seas.Captain Drake is the one chosen by that Grail.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The reason behind the turbulent seas is that the opposing forces, the two Holy Grails, are in contention.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
"The rightful Grail held by the savior Captain Drake,"and "Lev's Holy Grail brought in from the outside to disturb the world."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As long as Captain Drake is around, this era won't fall.However, it won't return to normal, either.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In order to restore the seas&mdash;I fear we must retrieve Lev's Holy Grail after all.
 
**Mash:**
...I see. So it's not as urgent as previous eras,but the final objective is the same.
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Drake:**
There's that odd voice again...Say, who are you talking to, Mash?
 
**Drake:**
You got a pet gnome or something?
 
**Mash:**
No, it's not quite that cute.The Doctor is, how shall I say...
 
**Mash:**
Think of it as a mysterious fairy,talking to us from a town really far away.
 
**Drake:**
Sure. So, he's making you guys fight,while he gets to cozy up in his home?
 
**Drake:**
In the end, what's this all about?You get what you came for?
 
**Mash:**
...No. It seems there's another Holy Grail, Captain Drake,one that shouldn't exist in this era.
 
**Mash:**
Unless we retrieve it,the ocean will be like this forever.
 
**Drake:**
Whoa, whoa, that sounds real dangerous....Are you serious?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dead serious.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Absolutely.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Which is why I'll give this back to you....You were meant to have it, Captain.
 
**Drake:**
O-Okay.I appreciate your courtesy.
 
**Drake:**
...Boy. I've never given up a treasure so easily,or had it returned so easily either...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, can I get some advice?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
H-Hey, just hang on a second. I'm thinking.This is way beyond what I imagined...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Then, may I ask a few questions?
 
**Da Vinci:**
It's a pleasure to meet you, Francis Drake. I know this may seem very sudden, but do you have a wish?
 
**Drake:**
Wish?
 
**Da Vinci:**
For example, you're a pirate. You wish to gather all the treasures in the world, do you not?
 
**Drake:**
Yeah, I suppose I do.So, do I just wish on this Grail to have it come true?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Most likely.Are you going to?
 
**Drake:**
Of course not.You know I'm a pirate, right?
 
**Drake:**
A pirate that gets treasure by praying&ndash;That's a bad joke if I ever heard one.
 
**Drake:**
Treasure should be won through power, wisdom, and courage.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, that would mean your immediate wish is simply to secure enough water, food, and safety.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In other words, you already had that wish granted.
 
**Drake:**
...I suppose that's true.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The Holy Grail you hold has the power to create this world. However&ndash;this ocean is not what you desire.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Which means, "something" is causing this world to exist.Someone is disrupting your ocean, and your era.
 
**Da Vinci:**
There's only one thing to be done, right?You need to reclaim your own world.
 
**Da Vinci:**
The people next to you, Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, exist to resolve issues of this nature.
 
**Da Vinci:**
They're professionals who have defeated what you call "invincible guys" many times.
 
**Drake:**
I see...I think I understand now. Thanks.
 
**Drake:**
So, who does that make you?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Leonardo Da Vinci. I died about 20 years before you were born. I'm a genius.
 
**Drake:**
Oh. Never heard of you.
 
**Da Vinci:**
W-What...did you say?
 
**Drake:**
So, this world is broken after all.Which means that there's no treasure to begin with.
 
**Mash:**
You could be right. I don't think there is...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No&mdash;there is!I believe there is!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doctor?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aren't you a little too excited?
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In this world and era, "pirates" are a common thing.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For better or worse, the Age of Exploration was an unavoidable event that expanded the world.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The planet's pioneers entrusted their dreams to the unknown seas and the other side of the horizon.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...And with all those "thoughts" and "desires" gathered,I wouldn't be surprised if a treasure really did exist here.
 
**Drake:**
So, it does exist?Enough gold and silver and spices to sink this ship?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. I, Dr. Roman, will guarantee that.There is a treasure&ndash;for sure!
 
**Drake:**
...I can't take it. I'm fired up, I'm fired up as hell!All right scumbags, let's drink up a storm first!
 
**Drake:**
Our voyage tomorrow is going to be one unlike any other! No guarantee we'll return alive, so drink your hearts out!
 
**Drake:**
Treasures! Riches! Spices!Tasty booze and uncharted adventures await us!
 
**Pirate:**
CHEERS!
 
**Mash:**
Wait, we're drinking again!?
 
**Pirate:**
After all, we're pirates!♪Both you and I are pirates!♪
 
**Mash:**
Ah, please! No more singing!
 
## Section 3: Ghost Ship and New Island 
 
**Drake:**
All right, we're setting sail!Raise the flag, the Golden Hind is moving out!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
Blast that cannon! Let's liven things up!
 
**Mash:**
Sigh...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're not used to the sea?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. We saw never-ending land last time, but I've never experienced an ocean as far as the eye can see.
 
**Mash:**
Ah, don't worry. I haven't let my guard down....Senpai, you seem to be having fun.
 
**Mash:**
Unfortunately, this is not the time for that.I'm afraid things will be slightly different this&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Ah, Senpai!Seagulls! Seagulls over there!
 
**Mash:**
And look,I see more pirates there!
 
**Mash:**
......
 
**Mash:**
Ahem.Now, here I go!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Have fuuuuun.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good luck.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I-Is it just me,or are you sort of out of it, Master?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Whew...I'm all sticky from the seawater.
 
**Drake:**
Hey, hey, Fujimaru and Mash.Got a second?
 
**Mash:**
Yes, what is it?
 
**Drake:**
Those people we took out have vanished.In your eyes, is that possible?
 
**Mash:**
...True, they have disappeared.Doctor?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, just as I thought. Seems like it's the concept of pirates that exist in these waters.
 
**Mash:**
Concept, you say?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A type of spiritual body etched in the memories of the"Age of Exploration." They can only act to fulfill their roles.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They have their own will, but are models of an idea.Call them an infinite copy of the "average pirate."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They do little damage, but unless the world is corrected,these "bugs" will keep spawning forever.
 
**Drake:**
...What do you mean by that?
 
**Mash:**
If I had to sum it up in a single word,those pirates are like... Ghosts.
 
**Drake:**
...But, they took damage from bullets, you know?Not just mine either, from the scallywags as well.
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, let me rephrase that.Think of them as ghosts with physical bodies.
 
**Drake:**
S-So they have physical bodies. Then we're okay!There's no problem!
 
**Mash:**
Yes, that's correct.Now, let us be on our way!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
By the way.
 
**Mash:**
Yes?
 
**Drake:**
What do you think are in these waters, anyway?
 
**Mash:**
If what the doctor says is true,there might be a treasure here.
 
**Mash:**
But... That means these waters are basically the same as those in the Age of Exploration.
 
**Mash:**
...Which means Drake isn't the only pirate going after the treasure.
 
**Drake:**
Ahah! That gets me all fired up!First come, first served. How simple is that?
 
**Pirate:**
But Boss,we don't have any leads on that treasure.
 
**Drake:**
Fool.We're going to start by finding those leads.
 
**Pirate:**
...Boss!An island in sight! East-northeast of here!
 
**Mash:**
...It is indeed an island.Doctor?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. I'm detecting Servants on that island.
 
**Mash:**
Captain Drake. That island has those superhumans you mentioned before.
 
**Mash:**
Please have all the pirates retreat. The only ones who can fight them are myself, Senpai, and you.
 
**Drake:**
Already? Well, you guys are with me this time.Hey scumbags, protect the ship!
 
**Drake:**
Fujimaru and I are gonna go check things out!
 
**Pirate:**
Roger that, Boss!We look forward to your return!
 
**Mash:**
We need to proceed with caution, Master.We still don't know if the Servant is a friend or foe...
 
**Drake:**
Hmm... Over there, perhaps?
 
**Fou:**
Fou!?
 
**Mash:**
Ack!Drake? Is that an enemy?
 
**Mash:**
Ahhh! Fou, stop running around!
 
**Drake:**
No. But I felt a vague presence, so I took a shot.
 
**Mash:**
"Vague?" "Took a shot!?"
 
**Drake:**
If you get a bad feeling, fire first, ask later.That's the key to survival, you know?
 
**Mash:**
How violent...That's how an outlaw thinks!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, did it hit?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you get it?
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Hah! You won't know until you look for yourself!I'll go see if it's dead or not.
 
**Mash:**
...Captain Drake is unlike Jeanne or Nero.She's a type of person we've never encountered before.
 
**Mash:**
At any rate, there goes our plan to proceed with caution.Senpai, what should we do?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's calm down.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's play it by ear.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes.I will calm down and play it by ear.
 
**Drake:**
Hey! Mash, Fujimaru!Come over here!
 
**Mash:**
A... Stone tablet?
 
**Drake:**
That's right. Can you read what's written on it?
 
**Mash:**
It&ndash;appears to be runes of some sort.Doctor, can you decode it?
 
**Da Vinci:**
I see, I see, these are relatively new runes.I'd say they were carved within the last week.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, Da Vinci?That's my job, yes? Don't take my job, okay?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Let's see here...
 
**Da Vinci:**
"Bloodaxe King, once laid to rest, shall awaken once more."
 
**Da Vinci:**
...That's the general gist of it.But, Bloodaxe King? Why does that sound familiar&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Th-The Bloodaxe King is the name of the Viking king that ruled Norway in the 9th century!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Be careful. I'm picking up readings similar to those copied pirates from that stone tablet!
 
**Mash:**
Enemies?
 
**Drake:**
...Yeah, it appears so. I'm getting a very bad vibe here.Mash, Fujimaru!
 
**Drake:**
Get ready for a fight... We're goin' in!The first to strike is the winner!
 
**Drake:**
...Here they come!
 
**Pirate:**
For King Eric,our great and glorious leader!
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Master... Let's go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
...Whew. The battle has ended, Master.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Searching surroundings... Nothing detected.The nearby Servant signals are not moving.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They haven't noticed us?Anyway, you need to get out of there fast.
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. Let's move on.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
Mmm... Sniff, sniff.Treasure, will I get a whiff of that treasure?
 
**Mash:**
Captain Drake, treasure has no scent.
 
**Drake:**
Ahaha! You think so, Mash?Treasure does indeed have a scent.
 
**Mash:**
What?
 
**Drake:**
Ah, that look says you don't believe me!All right, let's make a bet.
 
**Drake:**
If there's treasure up ahead, like I said...Hmm, what should we do?
 
**Drake:**
I know, how about coming with me on a trip around the world?
 
**Mash:**
Around the world you say?
 
**Drake:**
When I flee these waters and return to England&ndash;I'm going to sail around the world on the Golden Hind.
 
**Drake:**
What do you say? If you help me out,I bet I'll be the luckiest pirate ever.
 
**Mash:**
Around the world...
 
**Drake:**
Of course Fujimaru will come along, too.You're Mash's Master, aren't you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll see what I can do.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll think about it.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
All right, and if I lose&ndash;If I lose... Hmm, is there anything else you want?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Nothing.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have enough already.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
There is nothing I want. If I had to choose,having your assistance like this is enough.
 
**Drake:**
Really? That's really greedy, you got me there!That's gonna cost you dearly!
 
**Mash:**
E-Excuse me? Senpai and I both answered that we've been repaid already. Actually, Senpai, we have a good deal.
 
**Drake:**
What's gotten into you? You said you have no wishes.That's the most troublesome wish.
 
**Drake:**
Because, you can't buy items that "don't exist."I am, after all, a merchant!
 
**Drake:**
If I can't keep my customers happy, then I'll be a third-rate one. And THAT, I will not have.
 
**Drake:**
That's why first,I need to get whatever it is you want.
 
**Drake:**
But, you said you couldn't think of anything.Now, this is going to be a problem. How can I deliver something you don't want?
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see. I'm beginning to understand why this crude outlaw of a woman has THAT skill.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;Here they come!Servants are on the move.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like they sensed you guys.They're coming in fast!
 
**Mash:**
Hopefully we can talk it out with them&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
Gagagagaga!Gigigigi&mdash;giiiiiiii!!
 
**F：???:**
M-My! My name! Eric!The Grand... Eric!
 
**F：???:**
Gah-go! Kill! Kill anyone in the way!Kill. KILL! Gigigiiii&ndash;!
 
**Mash:**
...He's not getting it.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Seems so.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good luck.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Mash Kyrielight&ndash;going in!Captain Drake!
 
**Drake:**
Sure thing! Vikings from Norway!They're like our ancestors, you know&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
I'll pay my respects, but also give him a dose of reality!Fujimaru, this is how we say it in the pirate world!
 
**Drake:**
"Shut up, you bearded freak!The old need to retire!"
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Eric Bloodaxe:**
Gi, gi, gi...Ga, ga, ga... Not giving it to you! It's mine!
 
**Eric Bloodaxe:**
It is...mine...but...
 
**Mash:**
...Eric Bloodaxe has been eliminated.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, that's odd.He vanished, but there's still a Servant response...
 
**Mash:**
What's the matter?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? It's gone.Hmm, since coming to this era, I've been off my game.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, the equipment's not in the best shape.It's going to be a little hard to track you.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are no more Servants on that island,and those pirates from before are all gone.
 
**Drake:**
I see.Then how about we go on a treasure hunt?
 
**Mash:**
Do you think there's treasure, Senpai?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I do.
 
**Mash:**
Really?...It would be interesting if there was one.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't.
 
**Mash:**
If you consider it rationally, there shouldn't be....Though it would be fun if there were.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Hey! Over here!I found something!
 
**Mash:**
Huh? You did?Let's go, Master!
 
**Drake:**
See this ship?It's probably the one that king was on.
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, can you find out?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, but I don't think there's any need.It's a larger version of the ships the Vikings used.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Therefore, it should look like something out of the 9th century...but it's good as new.
 
**Mash:**
It does not appear to be...a treasure.
 
**Drake:**
Sure it is. You guys wait right here.If this is a Viking ship, I'm sure it has one&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
Found it. Treasure!
 
**Mash:**
...A book?
 
**Drake:**
When sailing, Vikings record everything from starting point to destination using pictures and glyphs.
 
**Drake:**
Coast shapes, shoal spots, current traits, and paths&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
If they appeared here out of the blue that's one thing,but if they sailed here...
 
**Drake:**
Yes, I smell fresh ink! This must be the chart for this island and it's surroundings.
 
**Drake:**
There's no better treasure for us since we're about to set sail into the seas, right?
 
**Mash:**
...You have a good point. Captain Drake, well...You seem violent, but you're actually pretty pragmatic.
 
**Drake:**
Impressed?Now, how about that trip around the world?
 
**Mash:**
Umm...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll think about it.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
After this battle is over.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
I see, I see! With you guys, our strength would be a hundredfold! We'll depart after restocking food and water.
 
**Drake:**
Now, time to return to the ship!
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, are you sure about this?By correcting this era, the memories of us&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not a problem.
 
**Mash:**
...As her memories disappear,I suppose the problem itself will be gone, but...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I forgot about that.
 
**Mash:**
Wait, Senpai... Were you really planning on sailing around the world?
 
**Mash:**
...Oh, please stop teasing me!
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Now, according to the Viking map&ndash;there's an island to the northwest.
 
**Drake:**
Considering our speed, it'll take about 10 hours.If we can catch wind, maybe even less.
 
**Mash:**
We can have the glyphs analyzed.Doctor, I'm transferring the data.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Very well. One book shouldn't be an issue over here.That said, I'd like a summoning point established soon.
 
**Mash:**
Let's hope there's a Leyline on the next island.
 
**Drake:**
All right, you scallywags! Time to set sail!
 
## Section 4: Lightning and Goddess 
 
**E：???:**
(Pant, pant, pant...)
 
**E：???:**
Ugh, no good.So tired, can't move, can't run.
 
**E：???:**
I've never run so much in my life.Why am I a Servant in the first place?
 
**E：???:**
I don't see "myself" here&ndash;Nor my "loser sister" either...
 
**E：???:**
...No, even if that girl isn't here, I'm fine.I'm so fine in all sorts of ways...
 
**E：???:**
Sigh...I wonder who I'm talking to.
 
**E：???:**
In the first place, this maze is "that" labyrinth, right?There's no way...out of here... and no string.
 
**E：???:**
...Wait, that means HE is here.As long as this labyrinth exists, HE is sure to be here.
 
**E：???:**
!!!I knew it...
 
**E：???:**
Something's coming from behind, too...ARGH! What am I supposed to do?
 
**E：???:**
Auuuuuggggghhhh!
 
**Drake:**
Hmm?
 
**Mash:**
Something the matter?
 
**Drake:**
Yes, the air tastes different here.
 
**Mash:**
Tastes...different?
 
**Drake:**
In different countries and lands, the air changes flavor.
 
**Drake:**
The distance between England and France aside,when you travel to a new continent, the air really tastes differently.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. Perhaps Miss Drake can detect changes in the wind due to differences in temperature and currents?
 
**Drake:**
What's this "Miss Drake" business? You sound creepy when you put it that way, Mister Scholar!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
S-Sorry.Please excuse me, Drake.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, Fujimaru.What Drake says may be correct.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Your current location has obvious different temperatures and currents than the previous island.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
With a little more time, I'm sure we can determine exactly where you are.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! There's a ship to the northwest!
 
**Drake:**
All right, what flag?
 
**Pirate:**
A pirate's flag I've never seen!
 
**Drake:**
So, an enemy!Mash, Fujimaru, get ready! Time to get to work!
 
**Mash:**
Aye, aye, Captain Drake!Here we go, Master!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
All right, this side's taken care of.
 
**Mash:**
This side as well.They were below average in combat power.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss, here's their Jolly Roger.
 
**Drake:**
Hmm, it doesn't look familiar.Mash, do you have any ideas?
 
**Mash:**
If it's a famous flag, it might be in our records.Doctor, can you look into this?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay. You'll have the results right away.
 
**Drake:**
All right, then I'm advancing this ship.If this chart is right, the island should be in sight soon!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. This island is way bigger than the other one.That's why we were able to locate a Leyline.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sending you the coordinates, just follow them for now. But be careful... I'm detecting multiple life-forms.
 
**Mash:**
Roger that. Drake, we'd like to head this way.Would that be all right with you?
 
**Drake:**
It's fine. I was thinking of going in the same direction as well.
 
**Mash:**
Then we'll depart.Let's go, Senpai.
 
**Drake:**
This place is huge... Hard to imagine it's an island.This wind is amazing.
 
**Mash:**
...All true.Master, doesn't this feel like the time we were in&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rome?
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I think it's a bit like when we were in Rome.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
France?
 
**Mash:**
I believe it's closer to Rome than France.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Master,we're almost at the designated coordinates.
 
**Drake:**
...What the heck is that?
 
**Mash:**
That&ndash;appears to be a skeleton,but something is slightly off.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Dragon Tooth Warriors. Soldiers forged from dragon fangs. Fujimaru, dispose of them.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
The battle has ended, Master.Creating terminal point.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Huh?Something just...
 
**Mash:**
What's wrong?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, just my imagination.You can start setting up as usual.
 
**Mash:**
Very well.Now, then&ndash;
 
**Da Vinci:**
&ndash;All right, everyone. Time for a little history lesson,courtesy of yours truly.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Right now, you're in the middle of the Age of Exploration.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Many things were imported from the East, and Europe started advancing into the new land, fighting to gain a foothold.
 
**Da Vinci:**
One of many things imported from the East were spices.Nutmeg, cloves, and peppercorns...or pepper.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Pepper was necessary to help eat decomposing meat.In this era, it was more precious than gold.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Case in point. I just transferred a pepper shaker to you.What do you think would happen when you hand that to Captain Drake.
 
**Da Vinci:**
Try it.
 
**Drake:**
Seeeeeeeeriously?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She collapsed.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She passed out.
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
Amusing, right? Oh, and be sure to retrieve it.We shouldn't aimlessly disrupt their economy.
 
**Da Vinci:**
In the meanwhile, the summoning circle is up.Use it to your heart's content.
 
**Mash:**
Summoning circle confirmed.Terminal point established.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, and yes...I got a hit on that pirate flag from earlier&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's the flag of the legendary ■ate, ■■ of the "■■."In other words, those pirates are ■■■ called ■■■■■.
 
**Mash:**
Doctor? Doctor, the communications are acting up&ndash;Doctor!?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
We've lost contact.What on earth could have...
 
**Mash:**
Eek! An earthquake?
 
**Drake:**
Get down. It's a big one!
 
**Mash:**
...It settled down.Master, are you all right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No injuries.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Seems that way. Thank goodness.How about you, Drake?
 
**Drake:**
That was a breeze compared to a raging ocean.But I'm worried about my ship and crew. Can we go back for a bit?
 
**Mash:**
Let's do that.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Mash:**
The summoning circle has been established,but communications are still cut off.
 
**Mash:**
We should move away from here, perhaps.
 
**Drake:**
Huh?Hey, what's wrong? Something up?
 
**Pirate:**
Boss...The ship won't move.
 
**Drake:**
Huh?
 
**Pirate:**
The ship, Boss!The ship won't budge, not an inch!
 
**Drake:**
...Sorry,but could you guys wait a second?
 
**Drake:**
No good, it won't move. But I don't think there's anything wrong with the ship itself.
 
**Drake:**
It's stuck like something's anchoring it real tight.
 
**Drake:**
What on earth is happening?Fujimaru, this is your specialty, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A type of Magecraft?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A type of Bounded Field?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I believe that is correct.It looks like a Bounded Field has been drawn all around.
 
**Mash:**
Its rank is low enough for Demi-Servants like me to escape... But I can't say the same for the ship.
 
**Mash:**
Unless we take down whoever is creating this field,I'm afraid we'll be stuck here forever.
 
**Drake:**
What are we gonna do?
 
**Mash:**
Search and destroy.There is no other means of escape.
 
**Drake:**
All right, if you say so then it must be true.Men! Stand your ground!
 
**Drake:**
Behave and stay put. The real fight's gonna be above sea. Don't be wasting stuff!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
This is rather dull.That fortress earlier was completely empty, too.
 
**Mash:**
To begin with, it's mysterious that artificial structures are on this island.
 
**Mash:**
But that pattern... Could it be?
 
**Mash:**
...Hmmm?Is there a hole in that mountain?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's take a look.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go inside.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
This is...
 
**Drake:**
Is this what you call a dungeon?Oh boy, the pirate blood in me is heating up!
 
**Mash:**
Wait! We have no idea what the scope of this place is.I suggest we retreat at once and&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
The way I see it, retreating's not gonna change a thing.That's what it means to stay on my ship.
 
**Drake:**
Leave behind that goodie-goodie old self, Mash!Now, onwards! Treasure awaits!
 
**Mash:**
I think we're rushing it too much...
 
**Drake:**
See, they're here.Let's clean this up quickly!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
I mean... Seriously!
 
**Drake:**
Right or left... My gut says left!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Should we trust her instincts?
 
**Mash:**
I don't think so...But Captain Drake is a first-rate pirate.
 
**Mash:**
She must also have keen intuition....P-Probably.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Remember where the entrance is?
 
**Mash:**
Don't worry, I've recorded everything just in case.Not that I'd ever forget...
 
**Mash:**
It's just a matter of going back the way we came.Getting separated along the way would be a bigger problem.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Oh I know.Master, let's hold hands.
 
**Mash:**
It'd be a disaster if we got separated here.Holding hands would prevent that from happening.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's embarrassing...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We don't have to...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Umm... I understand how you feel,but this is no time to be embarrassed, Master.
 
**Mash:**
If we get separated,we might be wandering in this maze until we die.
 
**Mash:**
It may be a bit awkward at first,but better safe than sorry...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you embarrassed too, Mash?
 
**Mash:**
...N-No comment.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not embarrassed.
 
**Mash:**
Th-That's fine.I feel... Slightly embarrassed... I think.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
At any rate, we have now just proven that holding hands is necessary.
 
**Mash:**
If you'll excuse me.
 
**Mash:**
...That reminds me, back then&ndash;You held my hand like this, too.
 
**Mash:**
Now, it feels nostalgic.Even though not much time has passed.
 
**Fou:**
Fou. Fou, Fou!
 
**Drake:**
Hmmm? Hang on a moment....I smell something.
 
**Mash:**
What is it?
 
**Drake:**
Blood.
 
**Drake:**
...Well, with my job I'm used to smelling stuff like this.
 
**Mash:**
Look, the drops form a trail.
 
**Drake:**
Looks like the wound itself wasn't that bad.A flesh wound.
 
**Mash:**
It's our only clue.We should follow it!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
The blood trail stops here.I guess we'll have to give up tracking it further?
 
**Mash:**
Not necessarily.Master, please stand back.
 
**Drake:**
This is great. I was getting bored of dungeon-crawling anyway.
 
**Drake:**
Let's take a break and light our guns up!All right, bring it on!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
Well, fighting these non-humans, including the bones back there, means I now got some more great tales to tell.
 
**Drake:**
Anyway, even these things die when you shoot a lead bullet through them. I learned something!
 
**Mash:**
No, normally that wouldn't have any effect.It's because you possess the Holy Grail...
 
**Mash:**
I think it continuously grants your wish of,"Whatever it is, gunfire is effective."
 
**Drake:**
Oh, is that what it is? So, I guess I shouldn't wonder about when the Wild Hunt is happening then.
 
**F：???:**
Hey, it looks like they're here again.I thought you wiped them out...
 
**F：???:**
Oh dear, isn't this just troublesome.What do you wanna do?
 
**F：???:**
...Hmmm. If you want to rampage, then be my guest?
 
**F：???:**
Let me warn you... I don't like breaking a sweat.So, I'm not helping you.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
Hmmm... It's not like we're lost in here,but I'm still getting all kinds of bad vibes.
 
**Mash:**
Bad vibes?What about you, Master?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm getting bad vibes, too.
 
**Mash:**
I see. If both you and the captain say so,perhaps we should be careful.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I sense an encounter!
 
**Mash:**
...Encounter?
 
**Mash:**
Hmm... What on earth could we encounter inside this dungeon, Master?
 
**Mash:**
Don't tell me you're expecting to run into{(M) a cute girl /(F) a cute boy}...
 

---

 
**Drake:**
!!!Stop right there!
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Drake:**
Seems my hunch was right.Something's headed our way!
 
**Mash:**
This is... a Servant!
 
**H：???:**
...Die.
 
**Drake:**
I-It's huge!What on earth is this thing?
 
**Asterios:**
Me... Asterios...Kill... All... You!
 
**Mash:**
Another Berserker, like Eric the Bloodaxe King!Guess there's no use arguing!
 
**Mash:**
Master, please be careful.Asterios is his lesser-known, original name&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
People more commonly know him as the "Minotaur."He's one of the monsters from Greek mythology!
 
**Mash:**
This labyrinth is his territory.Retreat is not an option.
 
**Mash:**
...Let's go, Master!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Th-That was close! Wait... No way!
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...gi!Uh...uhh!
 
**Drake:**
You're still alive after eating all those bullets?Talk about gluttony!
 
**Asterios:**
Pro...tect!
 
**Drake:**
Then it's time to bring out the culverin cannons!If we blow his head off, he's sure to go down!
 
**Drake:**
Now&ndash;give Davy Jones my regards!
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh!
 
**F：???:**
...Hold up!
 
**Mash:**
Oh no... Two Servants?
 
**F：???:**
All right! All right!I guess I just have to go with you.
 
**F：???:**
Do whatever you want with me!Just hurry up!
 
**F：???:**
Asterios is near death.He wouldn't be much use to you.
 
**F：???:**
Besides, if we take too long, he'll die and then the labyrinth will collapse on you.
 
**F：???:**
&ndash;We should hurry back.Leave the navigation to me.
 
**Asterios:**
...Uh...
 
**Mash:**
U-Umm,I'm sorry. Do you have a moment?
 
**F：???:**
What is it, Miss Lame-Shield?Let's hurry up and go where "he" is.
 
**Mash:**
L-Lame!?
 
**Drake:**
Hey brat, don't talk to us like that.You're the one getting rescued.
 
**F：???:**
Huh? I don't think that's a way to talk to a grown woman.
 
**Drake:**
&ndash;Some nerve. Wanna sub in for the goddess statue at the ship's bow?
 
**Euryale:**
Goddess statue? ...I'm not really sure what you mean,but I AM the goddess, Euryale.
 
**Euryale:**
Wait, you chased after me not even knowing that?
 
**Euryale:**
Obviously, you wouldn't have anything like me,a full super idol, on board your ship.
 
**Euryale:**
You should at least remember my name, sheesh.Where are you from anyway, third-rate pirate?
 
**Drake:**
Y-You little brat!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want to clear something up.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You've misunderstood.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
Huh? What?Wait... Why, you're a human.
 
**Euryale:**
Hm? Hmmm? Are you the Master of "that thing?"What brings you here?
 
**Euryale:**
No, before all else, if you're the Master you must discipline your Servants!
 
**Euryale:**
What's with that perverted Servant anyway?You can't find something that disgusting, even in Greece!
 
**Mash:**
U-Umm, excuse me&ndash;It's not like we were chasing you!
 
**Euryale:**
...Huh? Then what on earth were you doing?
 
**Mash:**
We are&ndash;
 
**Euryale:**
Are. You. Serious&ndash;!You guys are so misleading!
 
**Mash:**
Look who's talking!
 
**Mash:**
You trapped us inside a Bounded Field. Wouldn't it be natural for us to assume you're our enemy?
 
**Asterios:**
Guh...
 
**Euryale:**
Ahh, Asterios!You don't have to move.
 
**Euryale:**
You're tough. If you just stay still, you won't die....You won't die, right?
 
**Asterios:**
...Urm.
 
**Euryale:**
There's no need to worry.These guys aren't associated with "him."
 
**Mash:**
...Pardon me. We were a bit shaken up as well.Asterios over there is the one who put up the Bounded Field?
 
**Euryale:**
That's right. But it wasn't to trap you guys in.It was to prevent the enemies outside from entering.
 
**Mash:**
I see. But, unless you remove this field,we'll be stuck in here...
 
**Euryale:**
...Mmm, fine.
 
**Drake:**
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.
 
**Euryale:**
It's a simple numbers game.
 
**Euryale:**
There are only two ways out of here.Either Asterios dies, or we remove the field.
 
**Euryale:**
In that case, I'd rather remove the field....It's much better than being alone.
 
**Drake:**
...I see. Yes, I like you.
 
**Drake:**
But, you're so cornered that you had to put up this "Bounded Field" thing, right?
 
**Euryale:**
&ndash;It has nothing to do with you.
 
**Drake:**
It does!See, I love interesting things.
 
**Euryale:**
...Huh?
 
**Drake:**
A trip around the world. Adventure. Dungeons. Monsters.This world has so many interesting things to offer!
 
**Drake:**
Interesting things tend to be more valuable.That's how this world works.That's why I became a pirate. But that's that.
 
**Drake:**
Anyway, you smell like money.That's why I'm bringing you aboard my ship.
 
**Euryale:**
H-Hey! You can't just decide that on your own!Board your ship? You must be insane!
 
**Euryale:**
I already decided!I'm not leaving Asterios behind!
 
**Drake:**
Who said anything like that?Asterios over there is coming with us, too.
 
**Asterios:**
...
 
**Euryale:**
...Huh?
 
**Drake:**
So much guts and power...And, quite a hunk if you look at him long enough!
 
**Drake:**
I'd be the laughingstock of pirates if I let this talent slip by! Hey, would you like to be a bodyguard on my ship?
 
**Drake:**
If you refuse, there's nothing I can do. Hey you, will you die unless you're cooped up inside a labyrinth?
 
**Euryale:**
Th-That's not really the case....Are you sure?
 
**Drake:**
Of course I am. I'll pay you well, too.Oh, but don't expect any benefits from us.
 
**Euryale:**
That's not the issue.I mean... As long as you are okay with it.
 
**Euryale:**
...Asterios. What do you want to do?
 
**Asterios:**
Go.
 
**Euryale:**
...Are you sure?
 
**Asterios:**
If...you...go...me...follow.Alone...lonely.
 
**Euryale:**
I see. Very well, then...We'll board your ship.
 
**Euryale:**
Ah! But I'll need you to prepare my own room.I have no intent of showing my face to common pirates.
 
**Euryale:**
Of course, your ship has a bath, right?Oh, and also&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai!...It seems things went quite well without us interjecting.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Happily ever after.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All's well that ends well.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Good point.
 
**Mash:**
Still, a Minotaur was supposedly a monster. One that devoured children offered up as sacrifice, but&ndash;
 
**Euryale :**
Put me on your shoulders, Asterios.Oh my, you're even taller than my "loser sister."
 
**Asterios:**
Uh... Uh... Uh...
 
**Euryale :**
Ouch! Crouch down a little more!My head's gonna hit the ceiling!
 
**Asterios:**
Uuu...
 
**Drake:**
Ahahaha!Goddesses sure have lots of demands!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
## Section 5: Blackbeard's Misery 
 
**G：???:**
&ndash;I always do wonder...Isn't he ashamed to be alive?
 
**H：???:**
Now, Mary.You can't say such things.
 
**H：???:**
Earthworms, cockroaches, even plague-ridden sewer rats are all living beings, you know?
 
**H：???:**
That means it's okay for this Servant to live.I shall allow it.
 
**F：???:**
Ohoho! LOL My, my, such intense and poisonous talk you're engaging in! LOLOLOL 
 
**F：???:**
Heh heh! LOL Missy Anne is always so gentle when she throttles me!
 
**F：???:**
Because I'm naïve, if you ever said that to me,I'd have to *&£¢% you both on the spot! (Just kidding!)
 
**Mary:**
...Let's kill him, Anne.He shouldn't exist in this world.
 
**Anne:**
I said no.
 
**Anne:**
If you keep your distance, he's just a harmful,unpleasant, and stinking guy, right?
 
**Anne:**
Now Captain, give us your orders soon, or I'll gouge, crush, and blow away that lighter-than-a-balloon head of yours.
 
**F：???:**
Oops, good heavens me! LOL Sorry, sorry.Please, let me work hard from now on. LOLOLOL 
 
**Anne:**
...
 
**Mary:**
Anne, calm down or you might pop a vessel.
 
**F：???:**
Going into totally serious mode!Wowowowow! It's coming, coming, coming&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
...And so, my brothers.The licky-enthusiast's treasured Muse Euryale&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
Let's go catch her!Oh, and the you-know-what from the old hag, too!
 
**Anne:**
Huhuhu. That's the main target, idiot.
 
**Mary:**
No good, he can only think about Euryale.Fine, we'll just have to be careful.
 
**F：???:**
Duhuhuhu! Missy Euryale is so fine!I love her so much!
 
**F：???:**
Now, Missy Mary Read! Missy Anne Bonny!Mistah Eric Bloodaxe! And&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
Teacher! Our teacher!Please, take the field!
 
**E：???:**
Ah, I wonder... I never did anything great enough to be called a teacher, yeah? As you can see, I'm an underdog.
 
**F：???:**
Haha, stop joking! With you by our side, great hero of the Trojan War, our power level will be over 9000!
 
**F：???:**
Plus we've had a nutritionally balanced breakfast!Great and Ne-great!
 
**E：???:**
...Hey, guys. Are you really okay with a captain like this?Hello?
 
**Mary:**
...
 
**Anne:**
...
 
**F：???:**
Ahnm, these freezing glares feel so good.They should be coming out soon... Fuhehe!
 
**Euryale:**
All right. Remove the Bounded Field.
 
**Asterios:**
Under...stood...
 
**Drake:**
Geez!If you're gonna shout, tell us first!
 
**Asterios:**
...
 
**Euryale:**
There. The Bounded Field has been removed.Now, let's go.
 
**Asterios:**
Mm.
 
**Pirate:**
He's huge!Huge! And scary!
 
**Pirate:**
Boss?Are we taking these two with us as well?
 
**Drake:**
What's this "scary" nonsense! You guys are veteran pirates! Yes. Those two are guests.
 
**Drake:**
Erm... What're your names again?
 
**Euryale:**
Remember! I'm Euryale.And he is Asterios.
 
**Euryale:**
Just so you know, we're the same as that human named Mash.
 
**Euryale:**
If you touch me, I will beat you up, okay?
 
**Mash:**
How aggressive...
 
**Euryale:**
With matters like this, it's better to make things clear from the start.
 
**Drake:**
Okay, Fujimaru's on board, too.It's time to set sail!
 
**Drake:**
Good weather, low waves.It's a really good day!
 
**Drake:**
Days like this make me want to grab a drink.
 
**Mash:**
...Isn't that every day?
 
**Drake:**
Hahaha! You're right!
 
**Pirate A:**
Boss! Unknown ship detected starboard!
 
**Drake:**
Okay, let's deal with it,then booze it up!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
...Now, according to the map, the next island is a bit further... Huh?
 
**Mash:**
What's the matter?
 
**Drake:**
Oh, the wind just changed direction.There might be a storm around sunset.
 
**Drake:**
You guys, get the freight and food organized!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye!
 
**Euryale:**
～♪
 
**Asterios:**
...Song?
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, did you hear that?
 
**Asterios:**
Yes.
 
**Euryale:**
Well, fine then.I'll let you hear it as a special treat.
 
**Euryale:**
La-la-la♪
 
**Drake:**
I like it.Beautiful songs are so soothing...
 
**Euryale:**
Oh Captain,I don't remember giving you the permission to listen.
 
**Drake:**
Oh, don't be like that!
 
**Euryale:**
Fine.But it's not something you get to hear often.
 
**Euryale:**
Be grateful, and listen to the music of a goddess.
 
**Mash:**
...It is a beautiful song.
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Euryale:**
There. The end.
 
**Asterios:**
Mmm...
 
**Mash:**
Euryale, I have a question.Why are people chasing after you?
 
**Euryale:**
You sure know how to open up old wounds.
 
**Mash:**
...I'm sorry.But I thought it was something I should still ask.
 
**Euryale:**
...Hmmm.Since you don't mean ill, I'll forgive you.
 
**Euryale:**
...See. I'm cute, right?
 
**Mash:**
...Huh?
 
**Euryale:**
I said, I'm cute, right?
 
**Mash:**
Erm... Well... Yes.
 
**Euryale:**
You think so too, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're cute.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're beautiful.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
Yes, I'm pretty and cute.That's why guys always want me...
 
**Euryale:**
But this time, the most atrocious pervert is after me.A strange pirate, just like Drake.
 
**Mash:**
A pirate?
 
**Euryale:**
Not just an ordinary pirate.A "Pirate Servant" is after me.
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Euryale:**
I don't know his True Name.But, he's certainly the most disgusting guy in the world.
 
**Euryale:**
Even Scylla would feel pretty in front of him.
 
**Mash:**
...Not strong, not scary, but disgusting...What kind of pirate is he?
 
**Euryale:**
More importantly... Asterios,are your wounds better now?
 
**Asterios:**
...Mmm.
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, I see.Then you'll be all right carrying me on your shoulders?
 
**Asterios:**
Mhm...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Euryale :**
All right, what a great view&ndash;What? What's wrong, Asterios?
 
**Asterios:**
...Ugh.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! A ship up ahead!
 
**Drake:**
Are they pirates?
 
**Pirate:**
Yes! ...Oh, it's THAT flag! Boss! That ship's raising the same flag we've seen before!
 
**Drake:**
Meaning they're enemies!...Huh? That ship looks familiar...
 
**Mash:**
That flag... I know!Doctor!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash? Thank goodness, I finally got through!What in the world's happening over there?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
 I forgot about that...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
 It slipped my mind.
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What, you forgot about me?I'm the lovable and reliable Dr. Roman, remember?
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, but can we talk about it later?
 
**Mash:**
Could you tell us about that flag again?Communications broke down and we couldn't hear you.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, yeah. That flag is&ndash;a legendary Jolly Roger.Belonging to the most infamous pirate in history!
 
**Mash:**
Most infamous... In history...It can't be!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right! Blackbeard! His True Name is Edward Teach!Be careful, Mash!
 
**Mash:**
...Unfortunately, Doctor, it's too late.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What?
 
**Drake:**
Ah! It's him! It's him!The pirate who was chasing my ship!
 
**Drake:**
I found him at last.I'll blast him beyond the horizon!
 
**Euryale:**
(...Sneak sneak...)
 
**Blackbeard:**
...
 
**Drake:**
Hey, are you listening you hairy oaf?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Huh?Sorry, my ears don't pick up old-hag noises!
 
**Drake:**
&mdash;Say that again?
 
**Mash:**
...What?
 
**Drake:**
What. Did. You. Just. Say?
 
**Blackbeard:**
I- just- said! I didn't ask for old hags!What's with them useless huge knockers? Is that a joke?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Guess scars are okay? Blade scars are great,they turn me on. But, the age, that's a slight problem.
 
**Blackbeard:**
If it were only half that, you'd be in my strike zone.Du'huhuhuhu!
 
**Drake:**
...
 
**Pirate:**
Boss? Boss?She's dead... (Inside.)
 
**Euryale:**
It's hopeless. She's all frozen up.I was the same during my first encounter, too.
 
**Euryale:**
...I'm surprised I survived it.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mm-hooooooooo!You really are here, Euryale-chan!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Ah, really cute! Cute! Kawaii!I want to lick and be licked! Mainly armpits and groin!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Oh, and step on me, too! Barefoot!Step all over me! I want to be treated like a cockroach!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Don't you all want that, too?
 
**Euryale:**
Uh... I don't like this...
 
**Asterios:**
...
 
**Blackbeard:**
What?You there! Big guy! You're in my way!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Show me, show me, show me, Missy Euryale!
 
**Mash:**
...Huh?I'm sorry, I almost passed out.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me too.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's no wonder.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Erm... What is that?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
B-Blackbeard... maybe?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
S-Servant... maybe?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I refuse.I won't admit that he is a Servant.
 
**Blackbeard:**
...Hmm?
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mm... Mm, mm-hmm...I approve!You're accepted! Ta-da-dah-da-da-dah!
 
**Mash:**
Eek!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mmmm, who was the one that liked one eye covered?I think it was that guy Bartholomew?
 
**Blackbeard:**
No, his fetish was both eyes covered...Well, it doesn't matter.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Anyway, you Servant there! Tell me your name!If you don't&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
I-If I don't what?
 
**Blackbeard:**
I will dream about you tonight when I sleep♪
 
**Mash:**
My name is Mash Kyrielight!I'm a Demi-Servant!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mash... Mash... Mashmallow.Mallow mallow... How beautifully raunchy... Bofufufufu...
 
**Mash:**
Please save me, Senpai!The goose bumps just won't stop popping up.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There, there.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pat, pat.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Th... Thank you very much.But, what can we do...
 
**Mash:**
Someone so disgusting...How do we deal with him...
 
**Drake:**
...Fire!
 
**Pirate:**
What?
 
**Drake:**
Cannons.
 
**Pirate:**
B-Boss?
 
**Drake:**
Cannons. Every single one. I don't care. Just fire!Otherwise I will pack you guys in as cannonballs and fire!
 
**Pirate:**
A-Aye, aye, Captain!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Oh, old hag-chan?You mad? You mad, bro? Like huff and puff?
 
**Drake:**
Bring the ship around!Send that bearded fool down to Davy Jones' Locker!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Oh my, how scary.Mm, Mr. Bloodaxe King.
 
**Eric:**
...Gigigi.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Can you take a minute and grab you-know-what from that old hag for me?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Meanwhile I will be busy here licking Euryale!'Tis my duty as a human being!
 
**Euryale:**
...Hey Fujimaru.You too, Servant.
 
**Euryale:**
Make sure that disgusting sea roach doesn't come near me. Protect me well. Got that?
 
**Euryale:**
Fortunately, my class is Archer.I can at least give you some cover.
 
**Mash:**
...Understood.Mash Kyrielight... heading in!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Euryale:**
More incoming!
 
**Asterios:**
...Me... Kill!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios, don't move in your state!You're already injured!
 
**Asterios:**
...Ugh...
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
Fire the cannons. Fire, FIRE!
 
**Blackbeard:**
We're coming alongside them, everyone! Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah!
 
**Pirate:**
Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah! (glances)
 
**Pirate:**
Yeah!
 
**Blackbeard:**
... (glances)
 
**Mary:**
...You want us to join in, too?
 
**Anne:**
Ahaha, no way. If we have to do that,I'd rather be killed by Command Spells.
 
**Anne:**
...Ah, actually that sounds good right about now.Teach, could you order us to commit suicide?
 
**Blackbeard:**
You hate being my subordinate that much?
 
**Mary & Anne:**
Yep.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Don't say that. Please help me...
 
**Anne:**
I don't really think you need our help. Why don't you just steamroll them with your Noble Phantasm?
 
**Pirate:**
Dammit! No good!Our cannonballs are bouncing off!
 
**Pirate:**
Their armor thickness is on another level!Crap... They're coming on board!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
Damn! Seriously?Our only option is to retreat!
 
**Mash:**
Can we retreat from this chaos?
 
**Drake:**
We have to! Reload the cannons!We'll use smoke bombs to create a diversion!
 
**Pirate:**
Here it comes, Boss!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hey! Don't overexert yourself, old hag! If you behave and hand over the Holy Grail, we'll let you go, yeah?
 
**Drake:**
Holy Grail!?
 
**Mash:**
They know about the Grail?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hey, are you gonna hand over the Grail or what?
 
**Drake:**
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Gyafufufu! Scary, scary! LOLOLOL 
 
**Eric:**
Gigigigigi! Kill! This time, kill for sure!
 
**Mash:**
...Eric Bloodaxe?How?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-We already defeated him, right!?We even verified he vanished&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He didn't vanish.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something strange is...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Th-That's right! There was a turbulence in the magical energies that shape the Servants.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Could it be...teleportation? Then, he's a Servant that Blackbeard summoned to begin with!
 
**Mash:**
A Servant summoning another Servant...Is that even possible? By BLACKBEARD!?
 
**Mash:**
Perhaps he has a Holy Grail, or something similar in nature in his possession?
 
**Eric:**
Kiiiiiiiillll!
 
**Mash:**
Ugh!
 
**Euryale:**
Kyaaa!?
 
**Asterios:**
Di...e!
 
**Eric:**
Yooouuuuuuuuu!!
 
**Euryale:**
What are you doing, Asterios?You can't!
 
**Mash:**
Asterios, stand back!This time I will finish him for sure!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Eric:**
...Kill...you...kill...you...Damn... Get... Holy... Grail...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right! He's gone for sure this time!We defeated Eric Bloodaxe!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hohohohoho!It's too soon to be happy! LOLOLOL 
 
**Blackbeard:**
Eric Bloodaxe was the lowest rank among us Blackbeard Pirates!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Plus he smelled bloody all over, his armpits reeked, and his feet were greasy. There was nothing good about him!
 
**Mary:**
That's all you, Captain.
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Something just...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...He's so stubborn!That guy!
 
**C：???:**
You don't let your guard down. Good girl, good girl.
 
**C：???:**
I thought it would be easier if we killed the Master as soon as possible...
 
**C：???:**
&ndash;You're really something special.What kind of Servant are you?
 
**C：???:**
Well, if you're defeated by something of this caliber,then it's not worth "letting you live."
 
**C：???:**
Do your best, young girl.
 
**Drake:**
If that's the case...
 
**Drake:**
All right! Set sails!Hard starboard! We're gonna get away from them!
 
**Drake:**
We are faster compared to that bulky ship!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye!
 
**Mary:**
Ah, they shot the ropes connecting the ships.Looks like they're trying to flee.
 
**Anne:**
Hum. She shoots as well as I do.
 
**Anne:**
As expected from Francis Drake,the first person to survive a trip around the world.
 
**Anne:**
&ndash;Though, doing nothing does make me feel bad.I guess I'll help a little bit.
 
**Mary:**
Anne, you're so earnest.
 
**Anne:**
Huhuhu. In the end, it's only a show, Mary.
 
**Anne:**
My bullet. My pride. Our name is Freedom.Catch the prey like a falcon... Just kidding.
 
**Drake:**
Ugh...What happened?
 
**Pirate:**
Seems like an explosion in the bilge!
 
**Drake:**
What!?
 
**Mash:**
Impossible!
 
**Drake:**
Dammit, they'll catch up.No, at this rate, we'll sink before that!
 
**Drake:**
I'll go fix the hole in the bilge!You guys keep the ship balanced!
 
**Pirate:**
That's unreasonable, Boss!Everybody, stop the boss!
 
**Drake:**
Hey, let me go, idiots!If I don't go, who will&ndash;
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios!?
 
**Mash:**
The ship... He's lifting it up!?
 
**Drake:**
We recovered!Okay! Drop all Barrel Bombs behind us!
 
**Drake:**
Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em&mdash;
 
**Blackbeard:**
Oooooou!? Wait there! I don't care about the old hag,but please leave Missy Euryale and the Holy Grail behind!
 
**Blackbeard:**
I don't want the old hag's body at all,so at least give me Missy Euryaleeeeeee!
 
**Mary:**
Our main objective is the Holy Grail, Captain.Euryale is just a bonus.
 
**Anne:**
Huhuhu, this captain isn't listening at all.
 
**Drake:**
You said you're Blackbeard, right?Someday! For sure! No matter what! At all costs!
 
**Drake:**
I'll take your head and tie it on my bow!Remember it, idiot! Dumbass! You...
 
**Drake:**
Oooh, I can't think of any more insults!In any case, I'll make sure to get revenge on youuuuuuu!
 
## Section 6: Hunter of the Three Stars 
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios! Where's Asterios?Fujimaru! Mash! Help me look for him, too!
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou, fou!Kyuuuu!
 
**Mash:**
Fou found him!He'll bring him over!
 
**Drake:**
I'll help! Ugh, so heavy!
 
**Asterios:**
...Ugh...
 
**Mash:**
Don't worry, he's alive. But the wound he got during the battle against us opened up.
 
**Euryale:**
That's for being reckless before making a full recovery!
 
**Euryale:**
What kind of moron keeps swimming while carrying a galleon! You dummy!
 
**Asterios:**
...This kind...of...moron.
 
**Euryale:**
It's not something to brag about!
 
**Euryale:**
Did you forget your role of carrying me on your shoulders? Go on, clean your filthy body!
 
**Asterios:**
Mgh...
 
**Mash:**
Drake, how about the ship&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
It's no good.Nothing can make it budge.
 
**Drake:**
...Although I think we'll be able to fix the ship,thanks to Asterios bringing it to the coast.
 
**Drake:**
But we don't have enough materials. Looks like this island has a forest, so I guess we can make some lumber out of those trees.
 
**Euryale:**
Don't you think it's better to slay the forest monsters first? See, over there.
 
**Mash:**
Right. I'd like to reassess the situation.
 
**Drake:**
Oh boy, when we're done, I want to ask you something...How to sink that huge fool of a pirate!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
There wasn't much difference in the ships' performance.The issue was the thickness of their armor.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Our cannons had no effect....Doctor, please tell us about Blackbeard.
 
**Mash:**
I have some knowledge,but I'm sure that Chaldea has more accurate data.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, Blackbeard was a pirate born 100 years after Francis Drake.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
His real name was Edward Teach.He was one of the pirates who ruled over the Caribbean.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
His policy was simple. He would kill anyone who showed resistance but spared the rest.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Based in Nassau, he rampaged through these waters on his beloved ship, from Virginia to Honduras.
 
**Mash:**
His beloved ship...It had a name, right?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. It was called "Queen Anne's Revenge."He had 300 men on board.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He built up a large fleet centered around his flagship,and reigned as one of the strongest and worst pirates.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, he ended up losing his head.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Even a pirate as fearsome as him...Unbelievable...
 
**Mash:**
...Don't say any more.He's a Servant I'd rather not remember.
 
**Euryale:**
I erased the image of that thing from my brain.What? Has something happened?
 
**Drake:**
Yeah, pirates are all trashy, but he is the trashiest of them all. The King of Trash. That's what he is.
 
**Drake:**
Sorry, everybody.I apologize on behalf of all pirates.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're also a victim, Drake.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I know how you feel.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Fujimaru...You're a good {(M) guy /(F) girl}... You'd be a great pirate!
 
**Drake:**
As a pirate, I can guarantee it!
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, are there any stories that could give us hints on his Noble Phantasm?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There are a few... Among them, I think his ship has the highest possibility of being a Noble Phantasm.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was monitoring the magical energy levels during the battle, and his ship gave off the strongest readings.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Captain Drake's "Golden Hind" too. Maybe it's the Holy Grail, but it showed magical energy similar to a Noble Phantasm...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even then, that ship was superior...
 
**Fou:**
Fou...
 
**Drake:**
Hmm... I don't quite understand,but are you saying that my ship is no match for his?
 
**Mash:**
It seems that way...
 
**Drake:**
Hmmm...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait a second... Nothing happened before you blasted the ropes and made your escape?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did you inflict any damage to their side&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Ah, at that time... I believe we defeated Eric Bloodaxe.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right! Yes, we confirmed that he vanished completely on our end as well.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Ah, so that's it!
 
**Mash:**
What do you mean?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Simply put, Blackbeard's Noble Phantasm&ndash;is that ship, "Queen Anne's Revenge."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe it's a Noble Phantasm that powers up as"his subordinates get stronger and stronger."
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The moment you guys defeated Eric, the magical energy surrounding the ship clearly weakened.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
After that, it stayed in that state until they lost sight of us.
 
**Mash:**
In other words&ndash;the more Servants it carries,the stronger it becomes?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There were five Servants including Blackbeard on that ship. With Eric defeated, it's now four.
 
**Mash:**
Maybe the reason he sought Euryale...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...is because he gets stronger with her on board.His personal interests also play a part, of course...
 
**Mash:**
If only we could pull those Servants away somehow...But I'm sure it will be hard.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, I've never encountered a hindrance like him before.He knows nothing and still disturbs our Holy Grail search!
 
**Drake:**
Well, we pirates are all like that. We take treasures from people, no matter how good they may be.
 
**Mash:**
...If it's hard to pull them away, we'll have to slay them.
 
**Mash:**
...And we better do it fast, before Blackbeard becomes even more powerful.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Offense is the best form of defense. Hmm?I'm picking up couple life signatures on that island.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like they're wyverns, be careful!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
Oh, so this is a dragon?It really looks like a lizard!
 
**Mash:**
More precisely, a wyvern.We fought many during our battles in France.
 
**Mash:**
...Hmm?
 
**Euryale:**
Something the matter?
 
**Mash:**
Oh no, I just thought of something...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Use the dragons as materials.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fix the ship with the dragons.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...That's it, Master!
 
**Drake:**
Huh? You're going to fix my ship with dragons?
 
**Euryale:**
...Oh, that's brilliant. If you process it,dragon scales are even harder than steel.
 
**Euryale:**
We need someone really strong to process it,but...
 
**Asterios:**
Uuugh...
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, you're here.Can you handle it?
 
**Asterios:**
Yes.
 
**Mash:**
Looks like it won't be a problem for Asterios.I'll try to strip their scales immediately!
 
**Pirates:**
Yeah, I feel reassured with this guy!But don't overdo it like before!
 
**Pirates:**
Hey, let's eat first!After that I'll let you meet our blacksmith!
 
**Asterios:**
Y&mdash;Ye-ah...We...eat food...together.
 
**Drake:**
Hmm... These scales are tough, but we still need more.
 
**Mash:**
Technical Director Leonardo. How many more wyverns do we need to slay to fix the ship?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Considering the size of the scale and how it shrinks while processing... I think 30 more wyverns should be enough.
 
**Mash:**
In that case, we should be able to do it in a day once we found a nest.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go hunting.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then it is a quest.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
We make pretty good adventurers, right, Master?
 
**Drake:**
Hmmm, maybe I should change the ship's name to the "Golden Dragon"...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**H：???:**
...All right.Uh, chop that up...and add some spices, and sauté...
 
**H：???:**
Oh no,we need to add some vegetables too, right?
 
**H：???:**
Will that grass there do?There!
 
**H：???:**
Okay, now put it in that box... And stir...Done!
 
**H：???:**
Darling, I made you a boxed lunch!
 
**E：???:**
Wait.Do you even know how you made that?
 
**E：???:**
It's just grilled meat with some plucked weeds sprinkled on top, you can't call it a boxed lunch.
 
**H：???:**
Don't say that. Please try some?It's tasty, you know?
 
**E：???:**
How are you so confident in a boxed lunch with that kind of quality?
 
**H：???:**
You're asking so much, darling...What?
 
**E：???:**
Hmm... Something's coming.Looks like a Servant.
 
**H：???:**
Is it friend or foe?
 
**E：???:**
If she's cute, I don't care which side she's&ndash;
 
**E：???:**
No, it's nothing.Don't scrape me on this tree trunk! Owww!
 
**H：???:**
Actually, this is perfect.I'm getting bored of this island already.
 
**H：???:**
I don't even know why we were summoned here 
in the first place!
 
**E：???:**
Yes, you're right.Friend or foe, we need information.
 
**H：???:**
...Well, it's not like I want to leave or anything, though...
 
**E：???:**
Speak for yourself.These last two islands are way too boring.
 
**H：???:**
And there weren't any cute girls?
 
**E：???:**
No, there weren't.
 
**E：???:**
...I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
 
**E：???:**
I forgot that I rely completely on you,and that I leech off you for everything.
 
**E：???:**
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't swing me arouuu&ndash;
 
**H：???:**
Ah... (slip)
 
**E：???:**
Wha&mdash;at&mdash;!
 
**H：???:**
Eek! Darling, I'm sorry!
 
**E：???:**
You think apologizing is enough?! You moron!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Be careful. I am picking up multiple wyverns.And... What is this?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's tiny. Maybe like a familiar...
 
**Mash:**
There's a familiar on an island like this?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm... Something different about it, though.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like it doesn't have that much magical energy,so I don't think we need to be too concerned.
 
**Euryale:**
...Hmmm.
 
**Asterios:**
Huh?
 
**Euryale:**
It's nothing. I just had a bad feeling.
 
**Euryale:**
And, with your height, I'll be hitting my head on the tree branches.
 
**Euryale:**
Please, duck a little, or hold me in your arms....Yes, that's way better.
 
**Drake:**
Geez... Comfy enough there, Princess?
 
**Euryale:**
Princess? I'm a goddess.
 
**E：???:**
Please, stop. Stop! Don't chew, don't chew please!Not food! Not food!
 
**Mash:**
Just now! I think I heard a voice...Master!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's rescue them.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's hurry.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**Mash:**
Wyverns!
 
**Drake:**
Good timing, I'll turn you into materials!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
That's the last one.But, I thought I heard someone's voice earlier...
 
**Drake:**
I am not seeing the usual mess wyverns left behind,maybe they ran away?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? That weak magic response I mentioned...Seems like it's right near you.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well? Can you find it?
 
**Mash:**
No, not really...
 
**E：???:**
Hrrrnngh!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think you stepped on something?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard a strange voice.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
What? I stepped on something?Let's see... Could it be this?
 
**Drake:**
What is it? A plush toy?It sure is ugly. Even I can sew something better.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, that's it. The magical energy I mentioned is coming from that thing.
 
**Mash:**
Is this the familiar you mentioned?...Hmmm, it doesn't look like anything but a plush toy.
 
**E：???:**
Kyun kyun♪
 
**Euryale:**
...I can feel a really creepy gaze.
 
**Mash:**
Me too.
 
**Drake:**
What? You too?So I'm not the only one...
 
**E：???:**
...
 
**Mash:**
(Stare...)
 
**Euryale:**
(Stare...)
 
**Drake:**
(Stare...)
 
**E：???:**
...
 
**Asterios:**
Wah!
 
**E：???:**
Hyoo?What are you doing?
 
**E：???:**
...Oh.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai.The unknown object is talking.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Talking plushies are rare.
 
**Mash:**
...I see, it does look pretty rare.
 
**E：???:**
I'm not a plush toy, okay?Though I do look like one. I'll admit that.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's dissect it.
 
**Mash:**
Dissect...You're right. That's a pretty good idea.
 
**E：???:**
No, it's not!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...It really talks.Are you friend or foe?
 
**E：???:**
&ndash;Huh? That's my line!
 
**E：???:**
...I'm sorry. I think we can be friends.We have no intention of harming you.
 
**H：???:**
Ah&mdash;!!
 
**Mash:**
...A Servant?
 
**E：???:**
Wait! They're not enemies... Pugyuru?!
 
**H：???:**
Did you cheat on me again, darling?!Despite! Having! ME!
 
**H：???:**
I'm at the limit of my patience!Come on, it is time to punish you!
 
**E：???:**
What? How am I the first to get hit?Wait! Wait! There's a misunderstanding!
 
**E：???:**
I really was staring at their breasts and legs, but...I'm sorr... Pugyuru!
 
**Mash:**
U-Um...
 
**H：???:**
What? Don't interfere in a lover's spat!It is a civil matter! Civil court!
 
**Mash:**
Master, what do we do?This is the first time I feel at a loss.
 
**Mash:**
Ah, no... When we met that Black-whatever earlier,I felt like this too. One bad feeling after another.
 
**Mash:**
In this era,everyone has a few loose screws!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's your True Name?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you doing here?
 

---

 
**H：???:**
Hmm? ...Wait, you're human?Are you a Master?
 
**E：???:**
Fujimaru... Right.Okay, finally we meet a respectable Servant.
 
**E：???:**
Let's see... This summon is for a Holy Grail War, right?Are we friend or foe? Is the busty girl single?
 
**H：???:**
Don't casually mix questions up!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're here to fix this era.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're here to repair the world.
 

---

 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Orion:**
...I see.Now I get what's going on, more or less.
 
**H：???:**
Huh... So this world is endless?Eternal?
 
**Mash:**
Even if this era is,I believe it will still vanish if its outer frame is gone.
 
**Mash:**
And if that happens, we'll be defeated,and human history will come to an end.
 
**H：???:**
Poo...
 
**Orion:**
Hey, you were thinking that you wanted to live in this world forever and stuff, weren't you?
 
**H：???:**
Oh! Guessing what's on my mind...It's like we're in love... How lovely...
 
**Orion:**
If I have to live in an eternal world,I'd prefer to die in the hell.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai...
 
**Mash:**
Those two people... Or one person and one thing?There's something weird about their relationship...
 
**H：???:**
What is it? No matter how you look at it,Darling and I are the best couple of the Servant world.
 
**Orion:**
Hmm, from a third party viewpoint, it must look strange for a woman to be talking to a plush toy...
 
**Mash:**
I see, each person has their own tastes.That aside, could you help us?
 
**H：???:**
Hmm, what do you think, Darling?
 
**Orion:**
You ask what I think, but with humanity about to be exterminated. We have no choice but to help, idiot!
 
**H：???:**
I'm not an idiot! I'm a goddess!
 
**Orion:**
Quiet you useless goddess!(Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap!)
 
**H：???:**
Ah, it's DV!This is what you call domestic violence, right?
 
**Euryale:**
This is just too much, I can't see the end of it...
 
**Drake:**
...By the way... Lady Goddess.What's your name?
 
**Artemis:**
What? I'm Artemis.
 
**Mash:**
What!?
 
**Fou:**
Fou?!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What?!
 
**Euryale:**
...
 
**Asterios:**
Uh?
 
**Drake:**
A super famous one just appeared...She doesn't seem to be faking it... What do we do?
 
**Mash:**
How about that plush toy right there?
 
**Artemis:**
He is my love, Orion.
 
**Artemis:**
...I knew that he was going to be summoned, and got worried so I came as his substitute!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I, I see... By lowering her divinity, it allows her to be summoned as a substitute Heroic Spirit...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not like there aren't previous cases...
 
**Orion:**
I'm Orion. When I was summoned into this Holy Grail War, I got turned into a strange creature.
 
**Orion:**
...Strange creature...Strange...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am crying.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Live strong.
 

---

 
**Orion:**
By the way, I'm infinitely close to useless.I can't live unless I totally depend on her for everything.
 
**Artemis:**
Hehe.You can depend on me even more, Darling.
 
**Orion:**
I want to be independent...
 
**Mash:**
Ahem.
 
**Mash:**
Then let's fight together.Artemis, Orion.
 
**Mash:**
Now, we need dragon's scales to fix our ship.Let's pool our strengths and gather them!
 
**Orion:**
Okay, this way... Dragon nests are usually hidden in bleak places like this.
 
**Artemis:**
Darling, so smart♪
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's just like Orion said.I am picking up multiple dragons nearby.
 
**Mash:**
Okay Servants.Let's go hunting!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Finally, we're halfway.
 
**Drake:**
So hot, so tired, so exhausted, need booze...
 
**Euryale:**
The captain is such a slacker.
 
**Drake:**
Well, you've been leaving everything to Asterios for a while now...
 
**Euryale:**
That's fine.I give orders, and he acts.
 
**Artemis:**
Hey, hey, Darling.
 
**Orion:**
What?
 
**Artemis:**
Are there male and female wyverns?
 
**Orion:**
They have parents, but I've never heard about gender.
 
**Mash:**
Parents?
 
**Orion:**
Yes. Their parents are not of the wyvern subspecies.Wyverns are born from their superior species, dragons.
 
**Orion:**
I guess they're more like minions than children.
 
**Mash:**
...So... For example...They are way bigger than wyverns?
 
**Orion:**
...Yeah. Indeed...
 
**Mash:**
And if we keep slaying their wyvern minions,they will become excited or angry?
 
**Orion:**
...Well, they probably won't forgive us...
 
**Mash:**
Master...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A boss battle is a given.
 
**Mash:**
I know nothing about such givens!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's apologize.
 
**Mash:**
If we apologize, will they forgive us?
 
**Euryale:**
The dragons basically think we declared war against them when we entered their territory in the first place.
 
**Euryale:**
It's useless.Go, fight now. Like a hero, do your best♪
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Understood.Mash Kyrielight&ndash;heading in!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
I've fought dragons before,but it never gets easier.
 
**Orion:**
Why do I have to take part in this?
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh.
 
**Euryale:**
Oh well, you have enough scales now, don't you?That was quite fun.
 
**Euryale:**
It's easy to sit back and see how things pan out,but it's also fun to see people struggle up close.
 
**Drake:**
Thanks for the god-like opinion.You sure got noticed by someone bizarre huh, big guy?
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...
 
## Section 7: Queen Anne's Revenge 
 
**Drake:**
Improvements and repairs complete!We fixed the hole in the bilge. No leaks found.
 
**Drake:**
We also equipped the ram with the leftover scales.Things are going to get interesting.
 
**Drake:**
Now... Asterios! Time for your unrivaled strength and dauntless courage to step up!
 
**Asterios:**
Uh... Uhhh!
 
**Euryale:**
Looks like your wound has healed. You really are durable. Just like my loser sister.
 
**Euryale:**
All right, go for it!
 
**Asterios:**
Uuuuhhh&mdash;!
 
**Pirates:**
Whoaaaa!Incredible!
 
**Pirates:**
Damn, Asterios! There anything you can't do!?We all admire you... Uh, as men...
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh... Huh.
 
**Drake:**
All right, men! Time to take our revenge on Blackbeard!Don't worry, this time we'll be fine!
 
**Drake:**
Believe in me and follow me!
 
**Artemis:**
Hey Darling.Let's do that. The you-know-what.
 
**Artemis:**
That thing where I stand at the bow and extend both arms.
 
**Orion:**
Yep, you can do it. By yourself.Be careful of seagulls.
 
**Artemis:**
You won't hug me from behind?So cruel!
 
**Orion:**
Don't ask a plush toy for the impossible!
 
**Pirate:**
Hey Boss, what is that thing?
 
**Drake:**
It's a harmless creature. Just let it be.Fou is way cuter anyway.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**Mash:**
Fou said, "Don't compare me to that."
 
**Drake:**
Oh my... I'm sorry, Fou.Indeed, you have more class and flair.
 
**Drake:**
...All right, we're setting sail!Ring the bell!
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! I've already found a pirate ship!
 
**Drake:**
Let's take them down to liven things up!
 
**Mash:**
Roger that!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
We'll be entering unknown territory soon.We won't be able to use the Vikings' map anymore.
 
**Drake:**
It'll be an adventure, so that's fine!The problem is Blackbeard's ship.
 
**Mash:**
Even with just four Servants,it's still a formidable amount of enemies.
 
**Mash:**
If we make a bad approach,their guns and cannons will destroy our ship.
 
**Drake:**
We're way faster though.Should we use the ram to charge in?
 
**Mash:**
These seas don't seem to have many obstacles...We'll probably encounter them from afar like last time.
 
**Mash:**
If we were to have any chance, it would have to be during a Wild Hunt...
 
**Mash:**
They don't notice us, we notice them, and then a storm hits at the perfect time&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
That's wishing for too much, really.
 
**Euryale:**
...How about we shoot arrows before they notice us,to confuse them?
 
**Mash:**
They'll certainly be confused,but there are still Servants on their side.
 
**Mash:**
...That woman with the musket is especially problematic.If it turns into a gunfight, I don't think the confusion tactic will work.
 
**Artemis:**
Why doesn't someone board their ship and cause a riot before the ships collide?
 
**Orion:**
Are you stupid? How would someone board their ship before our ship... Oh.
 
**Mash:**
...Something wrong?
 
**Artemis:**
Heheh. I am a goddess.But... I was technically summoned as Orion.
 
**Artemis:**
So I have control over Orion's power.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, now I remember.Orion can walk on water.
 
**Euryale:**
You're the son of Lord Poseidon so you can walk on water... Wait, that's it?
 
**Orion:**
...Look, even I wish I had slightly cooler powers!
 
**Orion:**
I mean, walk on water?What am I, a water strider or something?
 
**Artemis:**
Aww, you're so cute when you're sad and gloomy!I just want to squeeze you tight! Squeeeeeeze...
 
**Orion:**
Mash, comfort me in your bosom!
 
**Mash:**
I refuse.
 
**Orion:**
Ngyuu...
 
**Drake:**
Anyway, we've been dealt a new card.Now, I have something to ask you guys...
 
**Orion:**
Great.I'm excited but have a bad feeling...
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Blackbeard:**
Woo-hoo-hoo! Heh, heh, heh...Hohohohoho...
 
**Blackbeard:**
Gasp! Awww, once I wake up,my harem is nothing but a distant dream.
 
**Blackbeard:**
The only ones here are our teacher and the yuri couple in their own little world.
 
**Blackbeard:**
...Well, I happen to like yuri myself.Since sleeping alone is so lonely (glance)
 
**Mary:**
&ndash;Incredible, Anne.This captain wants to sleep with us.
 
**Anne:**
For someone with zero popularity,or rather, negative popularity, that's rich.
 
**Anne:**
Actually, we didn't appear in your dreams, did we?If so, I'll just have to hit you with my gunstock till you forget.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Heh heh. So many heroines populate my dreams, I just don't remember.
 
**Mary:**
&ndash;Incredible, Anne.The captain has lumped us together as mob heroines.
 
**Anne:**
Yes♪ Let's kill him, after all♪
 
**C：???:**
...Huh? Hey Captain, your enemies are here.That Francis Drake.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Euryale-chan is here?And the Holy Grail, too!
 
**C：???:**
Most likely. I have to say,they're out for revenge a lot earlier than expected.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Yahoo! Prepare to receive them!
 
**Mary:**
Well, I guess we don't have a choice. Let's get to work.
 
**Anne:**
Yeah, you're right. But I'm pretty sure I opened a big hole in their bilge... What did they do?
 
**C：???:**
&ndash;What's more important is how they're coming back after such a severe beating.
 
**C：???:**
...They have something up their sleeve.But I have nothing to do with it.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mmm?Are they planning to charge straight in without a plan?
 
**Blackbeard:**
A reckless and self-destructive assault!Pretty unusual for that old hag.
 
**Mary:**
Not exactly, Captain. Isn't the one at the bow the Servant you're infatuated with?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Euryale-chan? What's this about my Euryale-chan?Bow! Is she at the bow?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Yay! Euryale-chan!Come spread your arms at the bow with me&mdash;
 
**Blackbeard:**
Huh?
 
**Euryale:**
Tch, I missed.No, I feel like I missed on purpose.
 
**Euryale:**
I felt like my arrow would be soiled...
 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, but can you try to aim and shoot him down?Your arrows are disposable. Deal with it.
 
**Mash:**
If we don't get him now, Captain Drake and I have to fight that Servant in close combat.
 
**Euryale:**
I know.But instead of hitting Blackbeard directly&ndash;
 
**Euryale:**
It's better if I hit someone else.That's how my "arrow" works.
 
**Euryale:**
Some of them are boarding our ship.
 
**Euryale:**
There aren't many, so let's defeat them quickly.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hey comrades! If you get hit by Euryale-chan's arrows I'll kill you off immediately, so be careful!
 
**Pirate:**
...Huh? Captain, what on earth are you saying...
 
**Pirate:**
Ow?
 
**Pirate:**
...Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...Ohhhhh!
 
**Pirate:**
You scum... You scum!For Lady Euryale's sake... Die!
 
**Pirate:**
Huh?Captain, why did you... Ugh... Ah&mdash;
 
**Blackbeard:**
See, now your blood got my shirt all dirty. Remember,DEATH is what happens when you're careless!
 
**Pirate:**
A-Aye, aye, sir!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Missy Anne! Missy Anne!
 
**Anne:**
Please don't call to me in that creepy voice.What is it, Captain?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Gigigi. Say, why don't you go pew pew at them!
 
**Anne:**
If it wasn't for the disruption, I would have done so.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Countin' on ya♪
 
**Blackbeard:**
Let's see...Don't tell me this is all you got, old hag-chan?
 
**Drake:**
&ndash;Of course not, pervert captain.
 
**Blackbeard:**
...Above!?
 
**Artemis:**
Hi♪
 
**Blackbeard:**
An angel... There is an angel here...There is an angel... But who are you?
 
**Mary:**
A Servant!?
 
**Artemis:**
I am Orion!I'll kill all of you☆
 
**Pirate:**
Ugh!
 
**Pirate:**
Gyah!
 
**Mary:**
I'll go! You keep shooting there, Anne!
 
**Anne:**
Gotcha!
 
**Orion:**
...Geez. They sure work their plush toys really hard.One, two. One, two. One, two.
 
**Pirate:**
We're almost in cannon range!Grab all reserve ammo from the arsenal!
 
**Orion:**
Sure, sure, show me where it is, please...
 
**Artemis:**
Hai, yaa! Take that!
 
**Pirate:**
Gyah!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Dammit! Missy Mary!I'm counting on you!
 
**Mary:**
You don't need to say it!
 
**Artemis:**
Oh human, I'd be troubled if you get too close to me.
 
**Mary:**
Figures. Since you're probably an Archer from the looks of it!
 
**Artemis:**
Exactly! Bye-bye now!
 
**Mary:**
Hey, wait!
 
**Orion:**
Artemis! Tell them we're ready!
 
**Artemis:**
Darling!Understood, Captain!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Drake:**
All right! Helmsman, hard to starboard! Get a good angle! We'll rip through its belly with the ram!
 
**Pirate:**
Gotcha, Boss!Hard to starboard!
 
**Blackbeard:**
What is that small thing....That small thing...
 
**Blackbeard:**
Oh... My... God!Everyone, hold on!
 
**Blackbeard:**
It's gonna explooooooooooode!
 
**Mary:**
What?
 
**Anne:**
Explode?
 
**C：???:**
Ah, so that's what's going on! Dammit!
 
**Pirate:**
E-Explosions! In the ammo hold!
 
**Artemis:**
That went well, Darling!
 
**Orion:**
I-I thought I'd die down there! I lit the fuse and ran! Ran at full speed!
 
**Mary:**
You bastards&ndash;!
 
**Artemis:**
How rude.Fine, I'll play with you for a while.
 
**Orion:**
Don't play, shoot her down!...Though, what a waste it will be.
 
**Artemis:**
Okay♪ Oh, and Darling, I'll punish you later☆
 
**Pirate:**
C-Captain! What should we do?
 
**Blackbeard:**
C-C-C-Calm down! Everybody calm down!Extinguish the fire first! Now everybody strip down&ndash;
 
**Anne:**
Regain your sanity, Captain.
 
**Blackbeard:**
W-W-W-W-What? I'm super sane, you know?More importantly, Missy Anne, take off your pants too&ndash;
 
**Anne:**
Next time you say that, I'll shoot.
 
**Blackbeard:**
I'm sane again! And I understand!Hard to starboard! Anyway, we have to get out of here!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye!
 
**Blackbeard:**
...Oh, great. Looks like it's too late!
 
**Pirate:**
Huh?
 
**Blackbeard:**
All hands, brace for impact!Bahahaha, I've always wanted to say that!
 
**Mary:**
It's the Golden Hind!
 
**Anne:**
Right! Both fast and sturdy!
 
**Drake:**
Prepare to board, my filthy scoundrels!Yes, yes! Let the plundering begin!
 
**Asterios:**
Uuuuuuuu!!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios, go!
 
**Mash:**
Well, Master, can't keep Blackbeard waiting!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's do it, Mash!
 

---

**--BATTLE--:**
 
## Section 8: Desperate Battle 
 
**Mary:**
Haaaaaah!
 
**Mash:**
...Ugh!
 
**Anne:**
Mary, I'll join in!
 
**Mary:**
Okay!
 
**Mash:**
These two...combined, they're one Servant?
 
**Mary:**
My name is Mary Read.
 
**Anne:**
And I'm Anne Bonny.
 
**Mash:**
The legendary female pirates...No wonder their teamwork's sublime!
 
**Mary:**
...Interesting.So Heroic Spirits of Shield really do exist.
 
**Anne:**
They have many Servants on their side as well.Mary, for now, why don't we do the usual thing.
 
**Mary:**
&ndash;Okay.We haven't lost quite yet.
 
**Mary:**
If we can hold you off, we can win....Let's go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mary:**
...So we fell short.Sorry Captain, we're going on ahead.
 
**Anne:**
Captain. Please don't get depressed just because we're not around anymore.
 
**Anne:**
...Being a victor is all you're worth. If you lose,we're the ones who end up looking like fools.
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Blackbeard:**
Mmph! Then, Blackbeard's beard began shining like gold or silver or burning red, and he rose like a phoenix!
 
**Blackbeard:**
At least emotionally!
 
**Mash:**
Ugh. This is discouraging...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't give up.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hang in there.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Even Master starts to sound unmotivational.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Backs against the wall, all is vanity, Glory to the Sutra.However!
 
**Blackbeard:**
I hate to brag, but this Blackbeard never even thought he could lose!
 
**Drake:**
Oh, look who's talking, you swine!Now this finally feels like a death-match!
 
**Drake:**
You and I, we're the same. A pair of heartless scoundrels who live our lives taking or saving lives!
 
**Drake:**
The loser is scum and the winner is justice! In that case,I'll trample your justice with my demonic heels!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Aww♪You're acting pretty cool for an old hag...
 
**Blackbeard:**
If I was a woman, I'm sure that right now there'd be romantic BGM playing with an event CG where I start stripping.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Such a bother to create backups and programming for that though...
 
**Drake:**
I seriously don't understand what you are saying at all...
 
**Mash:**
You don't need to understand.I guarantee that you'll never need that knowledge.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Well, anyway!Let's have our showdown, old hag!
 
**Drake:**
Insult me as much as you want.
 
**Drake:**
Now that I can punch you directly in the face&ndash;I'll laugh at your jokes.
 
**Drake:**
And when I finish with you, not even your mom can recognize you! Mash! Fujimaru!
 
**Mash:**
I'm on it.Let's go, Master!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Blackbeard:**
Ugh... Not yet...not yet...I'm...not even...at my full power...yet!
 
**Blackbeard:**
If I really put my mind to it, there's no way I'd ever lose to a Servant or two...let alone the old hag!
 
**Drake:**
If you can blab like that after a fatal blow,you certainly got some guts.
 
**Drake:**
I don't respect you, but I am impressed.The great pirate born 100 years after me.
 
**Drake:**
I know you wanted the Holy Grail, but give up.That's my treasure.
 
**Drake:**
Treasures at sea have no rightful owners."First come, first served" is our rule, right?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Yeah... That's right... Feels good... What a feel-good conclusion... That's how a pirate should be...
 
**Blackbeard:**
Ugh!
 
**Mash:**
...What?
 
**Drake:**
Teach!Dammit, you... To your own comrade!?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**F：???:**
Well... You finally let your guard down, Captain.
 
**F：???:**
I mean, you act totally carefree, but wherever you are,you're always gripping your gun warily.
 
**F：???:**
This old man's really impressed.
 
**F：???:**
After all, a genius who acts like a moron is more trouble than a moron calling himself a genius.
 
**Blackbeard:**
...I see...So that's why...I couldn't read your true thoughts...
 
**Blackbeard:**
But betraying me under these circumstances?Mistah Hektor, are you an idiot?
 
**Mash:**
Hektor!?
 
**Hektor:**
Oh please, this old man's doing it knowing there's a fair chance to succeed.
 
**Hektor:**
All right Captain,I'll take your Holy Grail now!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Don't mock me!
 
**Hektor:**
Too bad, you missed.The Holy Grail...is mine!
 
**Mash:**
Is that...the Holy Grail!?
 
**Mash:**
Edward Teach was...the Singularity for this era?
 
**Blackbeard:**
I screwed up...
 
**Hektor:**
Now all that's left is...you.Francis Drake.
 
**Hektor:**
Sheesh. The plan was to let the Holy Grail fall into an idiot's hands, causing this era to fall apart.
 
**Hektor:**
I can't believe that a voyager who exists only to stop that would appear. The Naval Chart of Mankind sure walks on a tightrope.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stop him, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Defeat him, Mash!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I won't allow it!
 
**Mash:**
What?
 
**Hektor:**
Just kidding.I don't care about the correct Holy Grail.
 
**Hektor:**
My objective is...her.
 
**Mash:**
...The ship!
 
**Euryale:**
Eek!
 
**Mash:**
Euryale!
 
**Euryale:**
Hey, let me go!
 
**Hektor:**
Please behave.
 
**Drake:**
That means you were betraying Teach even before you boarded this ship?
 
**Hektor:**
Correct.I guess you can call me a Trojan Horse?
 
**Hektor:**
Granted, I've never seen the real thing.
 
**Asterios:**
Let her goooo!
 
**Hektor:**
...Whoa! You're a dangerous one!
 
**Euryale:**
Oh!
 
**Hektor:**
Minotaur&ndash;huh?A combination that is truly beauty and the beast.
 
**Hektor:**
Still... This old man hasn't fallen so far as to be defeated by an incompetent Berserker!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios!
 
**Hektor:**
Tch!...Hey now Captain, are you still alive?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hee hee hee. It's the power of love!...Just kidding. That was my final blow.
 
**Hektor:**
Tch!But, I've achieved my goal. Too bad, pirates.
 
**Orion:**
Dammit, he had a ship ready!Cheeky bastard!
 
**Artemis:**
Should we go after him, Darling?I'm sure we could 
 
**Orion:**
We can't!
 
**Artemis:**
...Why not?
 
**Orion:**
Because right now,both you and I are Servants.
 
**Artemis:**
Hmph. So you think that I'd lose, Darling?
 
**Orion:**
That's a Lancer.On top of that, if he's Hektor then he's also, you know...
 
**Orion:**
The great hero of the Trojan War. The greatest conflict in which the gods of Olympus intervened.
 
**Orion:**
Even the omnipotent, invincible hero Achilles took many years to defeat him.
 
**Orion:**
If you were in your "true body" sure,but with my power as your base it's a bit much.
 
**Artemis:**
Hmph. Surprisingly calm.
 
**Orion:**
Not really. Everybody's mad right now.One of us has to be calm, or it's hopeless.
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, you're so cool!Darling! Embrace me! Do what you want with me!
 
**Orion:**
Like I said, don't ask the impossible from a plush toy!
 
**Mash:**
Blackbeard's subordinates... vanished.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They were created by Blackbeard's magical energy.Now that the Holy Grail is gone, they can't be maintained.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Even though he himself still looks full of energy.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hey everybody, it's almost time to say goodbye!Don't you dare think you won, old hag, got that?
 
**Drake:**
Yeah, yeah.The more you talk, the more you sound like a sore loser.
 
**Drake:**
Hurry up and begone, Blackbeard.It must be hard for you to even breathe right now.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Damn you. You're being nice to me...Makes my heart flutter.
 
**Blackbeard:**
I'd say, "Marry me, I'll make you happy"...I mean, you've been single ever since you were born, no?
 
**Drake:**
I've had enough of you nitwit!Hurry up and kick the bucket!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Hahaha, what a nice insult!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Now that I'm satisfied, it's time to die!But this time I won't be beheaded.
 
**Blackbeard:**
Because I am the greatest pirate after all!I am a merry pirate, and I will die as one!
 
**Blackbeard:**
I regret that I wasn't able to create my harem,but I still had fun. I approve!
 
**Blackbeard:**
...Oh, old hag.Don't you need a story route where I revive as a rival?
 
**Blackbeard:**
Wouldn't it be great if I revived with a line like"It's been decided, I'm the one who defeats you!" or something?
 
**Drake:**
...Not needed, useless.Come on, snuff it.
 
**Drake:**
Mash told me about your final moments.Make sure to take that head with you!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Okay, well that's all fine!Hah, that's all dandy and fine! Fandy and dine!
 
**Blackbeard:**
The woman who Blackbeard respected most!The pirate who he yearned for most!
 
**Blackbeard:**
She is present at Blackbeard's deathbed,and he keeps his head intact!
 
**Blackbeard:**
Then, farewell humanity!Farewell pirates!
 
**Blackbeard:**
And so Blackbeard draws his last breath! Haha!Ahahahaha!
 
**Drake:**
Hurry up and die, Edward.In the end, both you and I are headed to hell.
 
**Drake:**
Why don't we pay for our misdeeds with disgrace and shame like true pirates?
 
**Mash:**
...The ship will collapse.Let's go back!
 
**Mash:**
Come, Asterios.Hold onto me.
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...Eu...ry...ale...
 
**Mash:**
...
 
## Section 9: Tracks Down the Dandies 
 
**E：???:**
Excuse me.I'm coming in, Master.
 
**F：???:**
Hey, what's going on?My beloved!
 
**E：???:**
Lord Hektor contacted us.It seems he caught Euryale.
 
**F：???:**
I see! I see, I see, I see!All right!
 
**F：???:**
We were told, if we offer up Euryale,we can obtain even more power.
 
**F：???:**
Me! I'll be more powerful than anyone. I'll be invincible!Wouldn't that be amazing?
 
**E：???:**
Yes, very.I think that would be extremely amazing, Master.
 
**F：???:**
I like your smile. Your smile is like the sun.It never fails to enrich my heart.
 
**F：???:**
Oh, but you seem a little tired.Are you all right?
 
**F：???:**
You've been the ship's power source for so long.I want you to tell me when it gets too hard.
 
**F：???:**
See. Just a bit. If it is just a bit,I can think about letting you rest.
 
**E：???:**
T-Thank you very much! But it's fine.Your words alone are enough for me to go on.
 
**F：???:**
Perfect&mdash;yes. That's how you should be.The woman who will become my lovely wife.
 
**F：???:**
As soon as Hektor returns,let's go search for "you-know-what."
 
**F：???:**
I mean, where the hell is it?You still haven't received any oracle?
 
**E：???:**
Correct. I assume that as soon as Lord Hektor returns,I will receive an oracle showing where we must go.
 
**F：???:**
What's with all these problems...They always keep dragging me down...
 
**F：???:**
Ah, I'm really sorry.I don't mean to blame them.
 
**F：???:**
But, I have the right to receive these oracles too.Why is it only you&ndash;?
 
**E：???:**
...?What is it, Master?
 
**F：???:**
...Nothing.Haste makes waste I guess.
 
**F：???:**
That's right, that must be it. For now, I'll believe in your oracles, and do my best as the captain.
 
**E：???:**
Yes, that is what we hope.Let's go welcome Lord Hektor.
 
**E：???:**
We members of Argonautai are undefeatable heroes.There is no way a random group like theirs can win.
 
**F：???:**
Yes, you're right! We are the strongest!There is no mistake. Our strength is unparalleled!
 
**F：???:**
We have the world's greatest, strongest hero, and witch on our side! Oh, and there's one useless woman, too.
 
**F：???:**
Hmph, to think someone would vow chastity to someone like Artemis and reject my invitation like that.
 
**F：???:**
Should be a shark's meal by now.Serves her right.
 
**F：???:**
Now, everybody!Prepare to depart!
 
**F：???:**
We shall obtain the "Ark." Even the golden ram pales in comparison to this treasure.
 
**F：???:**
With the Holy Grail and the "Ark,"I will reign as the king of Okeanos!
 
**Drake:**
Full speed ahead!Hey, lookout! Pay close attention to what's ahead!
 
**Drake:**
Once you see that ship, call out!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
...That tiny ship is faster than it looks.
 
**Drake:**
With their head start, unless they stop,we might not catch up...
 
**Asterios:**
Uh, uuh...
 
**Mash:**
Don't worry, she won't die.
 
**Asterios:**
Eu...ryale... I...will...save you.
 
**Mash:**
...I understand how you feel.But for now, concentrate on healing your wounds.
 
**Asterios:**
No!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll save her.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll help too.
 

---

 
**Asterios:**
......
 
**Asterios:**
Do... You... Promise?
 
**Mash:**
Of course. Drake is sailing the ship at top speed with that very same thought.
 
**Asterios:**
...Uh.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! A pirate ship's headed our way!
 
**Drake:**
Damn, at a time like this!?
 
**Mash:**
Master, let's take them out quickly.
 
**Asterios:**
...Crush!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Master...I'm sure Blackbeard said "Hektor."
 
**Mash:**
If that's the case, then that spear is the sword "Durandal," later inherited by Roland, one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne.
 
**Mash:**
Or rather, the base for that sword.
 
**Mash:**
It's a miracle that Asterios didn't die.That's how powerful that spear was.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I wonder what Hektor plans to do,with Euryale.
 
**Drake:**
Human trafficking... No, it can't be.
 
**Orion:**
...But he sounded like he had a clear goal in his mind from the beginning.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. From the start, Servant Hektor had his eye on Mistah Blackbeard's Holy Grail.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Blackbeard seemed wary of that.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, why "Mistah"...
 

---

 
**Orion:**
I can understand the Holy Grail,but why Euryale?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not about bolstering forces.Euryale herself isn't that powerful of a Servant.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think what makes her special is the fact that she IS a Servant.
 
**Drake:**
What? What do you mean?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Actually, in the past, we met "another" her...No, maybe her... Big sister, perhaps?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, we met a girl summoned as a Servant despite being a goddess.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Euryale is not a hero,nor is she someone whose name is engraved into history.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She was treated as a goddess in Greek mythology."The one who flies far"&ndash;that is Euryale.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or she was a monster.The middle sister of&ndash;the three Gorgons.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The youngest is the famous Medusa,I can see her being summoned into a Holy Grail War.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, not Euryale. She is just a goddess,an idol of ideals, and undoubtedly weak.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For her to be summoned as a Servant is a strange phenomenon.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Though some other Servants are just as peculiar.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Usually it's hard for Divine Spirits to become Servants.Unless there is a really special case.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In addition, a pure god becoming a Servant is something that isn't supposed to happen in the world of Magecraft.
 
**Artemis:**
Really? Who's like that?
 
**Orion:**
Us, take the hint.
 
**Drake:**
Basically what you're saying is, Euryale isn't good enough to be kidnapped for her fighting prowess?
 
**Asterios:**
...
 
**Drake:**
Well, that's not a reason for us not to save her.Plus, she's a great singer.
 
**Drake:**
I like great singers.It is a very important role for sailors, right men?
 
**Pirate:**
Aye!It heals our rotten heart!
 
**Drake:**
There ya go.. Don't worry, big guy.Nobody on this ship wants to abandon that girl.
 
**Asterios:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong, Mash?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is something the matter?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...No. Captain Drake's personality is just very complicated.
 
**Mash:**
...It's hard to explain, but she reminds me of you.Facing difficulties. Helping those around her.
 
**Mash:**
It is an advantage, a merit, that humans possess.But why&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Is Francis Drake a villain?As she is now, and back in history.
 
**Mash:**
She is such a good person, but her actions are that of an outlaw.
 
**Mash:**
I can't understand this contradiction well&mdash;
 
**Drake:**
Ah, dammit.It had to happen in a time like this!
 
**Drake:**
Everybody tie yourself to the ship!There's a storm coming!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Pirate:**
What should we do, Boss?
 
**Drake:**
Shut up, I'm thinking! Um... The distance between us and that ship is about this much...
 
**Drake:**
This storm has a small range... Perhaps...Depending on distance, it'll be a tailwind for them...
 
**Drake:**
...The ship's armor is... Oh, that's right.Since we used THAT for repairs...
 
**Drake:**
All right!
 
**Drake:**
You guys!Good news and bad news, which do you want first?
 
**Pirate:**
Let's see. Bad news first...
 
**Drake:**
All right.
 
**Drake:**
This Hektor guy who kidnapped Euryale probably won't be affected by this storm!
 
**Drake:**
If we sit tight, he'll probably pull so far away that we'll never catch up!
 
**Pirate:**
...Um. So what's the good news?
 
**Drake:**
Rejoice, guys! We're gonna raise all sails to and cruise at top speed in this storm!
 
**Drake:**
Let's have another exciting ride through the seas!
 
**Pirate:**
How is that good news!?
 
**Drake:**
Shut up or you'll get the boot!Anyways, get moving!
 
**Drake:**
Mash, Asterios, and Lady Artemis,please help us too!
 
**Drake:**
...Of course Fujimaru, too.Okay, let's go!
 
**Mash:**
Master... L-Let's do our best!
 
**Drake:**
Come on, keep going!
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! Our ship won't last much more!
 
**Drake:**
Really? But it is pretty stable, isn't it?
 
**Pirate:**
What?...Now that you mention it, indeed...
 
**Drake:**
Did you forget? We used a bunch of dragon scales when we repaired this ship.
 
**Drake:**
It'll take more than this to sink us!This is no sailboat!
 
**Drake:**
Got that? Now, charge forth!
 
**Pirate:**
Boss, there's a ship up ahead!
 
**Drake:**
Did we catch up!?
 
**Pirate:**
It's not them.That ship is bigger than ours!
 
**Drake:**
It's similar to Blackbeard's ship!?
 
**Pirate:**
Yes, but&ndash;
 
**Drake:**
But?
 
**Pirate:**
It looks pretty beat up.That's all I can tell in this storm!
 
**Drake:**
Give me the telescope!
 
**Drake:**
Mm-hmm....What is that, a ghost ship?
 
**Mash:**
A ghost ship?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow, it's even more like an ocean adventure novel now!So much excitement, I want to turn this into a book!
 
**Drake:**
Hah, ghost ships are usually just vessels that were abandoned for things like mutiny and starvation.
 
**Drake:**
...Hmm?Some light... is headed this way... Eek!?
 
**Orion:**
Drake made a really strange sound just now!
 
**Artemis:**
Her voice was like a maiden's!
 
**Mash:**
Master!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh, what?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's wrong?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Nothing, I just was shocked by Drake's voice.What happened, Drake?
 
**Drake:**
F-Forget about my scream, look to the bow!Enemy attack! Ghosts are attacking us!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
Ugh... Thank goodness we beat them...
 
**Mash:**
Drake, are you afraid of ghosts?
 
**Drake:**
Can't a pirate be superstitious!?
 
**Mash:**
S-Sure. There's no problem.Sorry.
 
**Drake:**
All right, the storm is winding down.Hang on just a little more.
 
**Drake:**
Let's go!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Hektor:**
Now, according to my calculations, it's almost time.
 
**Euryale:**
...Why me? Does your Master have the same tastes as Blackbeard?
 
**Hektor:**
Oh no, my boss may be a worthless womanizer,but he's not brave enough to hit on a goddess like you.
 
**Hektor:**
Let's just say your very existence is important.
 
**Hektor:**
Even if you've fallen to the level of a Servant,Divine Spirits normally don't appear in this world.
 
**Hektor:**
...So, now that you've appeared,it'd be a waste not to use you, right?
 
**Euryale:**
As a Divine Spirit, I'm low-tier, you know?
 
**Hektor:**
They're probably not expecting any combat skills from a goddess like you.
 
**Hektor:**
"Offer a god as a sacrifice."This is the only thing we expect from you.
 
**Euryale:**
Oh? Offer to whom?
 
**Hektor:**
To the world. We can't tolerate being part of an endless spiral.
 
**Hektor:**
Even if we take a little risk,we have to blow this world to pieces.
 
**Euryale:**
...Who do you serve, exactly?
 
**Hektor:**
Mm... That's a good question.Who do you think this old man is serving!?
 
**Euryale:**
...In any case, asserting principles of anarchy is sure to meet interference in the end.
 
**Euryale:**
Honestly, whether or not they'll come is like fifty-fifty.
 
**Euryale:**
...Hmph, it must have been because Asterios was there.
 
**Hektor:**
What?That is "the Golden Hind!"
 
**Drake:**
Okay, we caught up.Can't waste anymore time, let's ram into them!
 
**Drake:**
Are you ready, guys!?
 
**Pirate:**
Yup!
 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**Drake:**
Good! Let's land a hard one on that guy!
 
**Mash:**
Master, we are ready to fight too.
 
**Orion:**
Hey, Asterios! Calm down, calm down!Relax, please!
 
**Asterios:**
Euryale!
 
**Artemis:**
Nope, no good. Can I let him go?
 
**Orion:**
Letting him go now is like painting a target for that spear. Come, there there. Now, there there.
 
**Asterios:**
Uhhh!
 
**Orion:**
Fine! I got it!Wait 10 more seconds. 10, 1, 0!
 
**Artemis:**
You cut corners, Darling!
 
**Orion:**
Thinking rationally, there was no way a plush toy could stop a Berserker...
 
**Artemis:**
You should've realized that sooner!
 
**Mash:**
Asterios!?I-I will go with him!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's rescue Euryale!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's help Asterios!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**Hektor:**
Geez, what a pain in the ass.Oh, brother&ndash;But this old man...
 
**Hektor:**
Is really good at defense to the point even I hate it!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
These pirates are way more tenacious than before!
 
**Asterios:**
Give... Baaaaaaaaaaack!
 
**Hektor:**
Geez, that damned Minotaur!Fine, I'll give her back!
 
**Euryale:**
Aughh!
 
**Asterios:**
Eu...
 
**Hektor:**
Nothing like the predictability of a Berserker!
 
**Mash:**
I won't let you&ndash;!
 
**Hektor:**
Demi-Servant!
 
**Mash:**
Hero Hektor&mdash;who do you serve, and what are you after... I'll have you tell me!
 
**Hektor:**
Huh. Pretty interesting, little girl.This old man would rather not take a young life...
 
**Hektor:**
But the world is cruel like that.Let me show you what that truly means!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Hektor:**
Tch, she's surprisingly tough!That's why I can't stand heroes with shields!
 
**Mash:**
Haaa!
 
**Hektor:**
&ndash;Well, this old man won through persistence.Dear me, I'm tired, so tired.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! A ship up ahead!I-It's a ship that I've never seen before!
 
**Drake:**
Did you say a ship that you've never seen before?!
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Hektor:**
Yes, thanks for that!My current "superior" is on that ship.
 
**Asterios:**
Oh... Uh!
 
**Hektor:**
Now, time for the counterattack.This old man's gonna be serious about it now, yeah?
 
## Section 10: World's Oldest Pirate Ship 
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! They're approaching!
 
**Drake:**
Cannons ready! Fire!
 
**Pirate:**
Not good, it didn't do anything!They deflected every single cannonball!
 
**Drake:**
Ugh, each and every one! Hmm. You know what?
 
**Drake:**
If we wanna burn down a ship, we should just ram our own burning ship into them, yeah?
 
**F：???:**
&ndash;All right, found them.Okay, Heracles.
 
**F：???:**
Let's send those scrappy masses gathered there a hearty greeting.
 
**Mash:**
What? They threw a boulder?
 
**Asterios:**
Move...away!
 
**Asterios:**
Nuaaaah!!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios!
 
**F：???:**
Hahaha! He managed to barely catch it!That barbarian over there...
 
**F：???:**
What is that? Is it a werebeast?
 
**E：???:**
Oh, that's probably Lord Asterios.Otherwise known as the Minotaur.
 
**E：???:**
The tragic child born from the union of a divine bull and a human.
 
**F：???:**
So, a poorly created human!A comical creature fated to be defeated by a hero!
 
**F：???:**
The're really short on talent aren't they?Hahahaha!
 
**F：???:**
Hektor! You seem to be in trouble. Need help?
 
**Hektor:**
...Yes, Captain. I'm so sorry.Could you help?
 
**F：???:**
No problem, Hektor!The goddess is there? And you have the Holy Grail?
 
**F：???:**
Then all is well.
 
**F：???:**
While we're at it,let's settle the score once and for all!
 
**F：???:**
You, the evildoers trying to "correct" the world...And us, the heroes trying to make it right!
 
**F：???:**
A suitable finale for the Holy Grail War!
 
**Hektor:**
Then, this old man will take this opportunity&ndash;
 
**Artemis:**
Ah, he jumped and ran away.
 
**Orion:**
Let that old guy go. The problem we have here is more important.
 
**Pirate:**
I won't let you go!
 
**Mash:**
Master, let's defeat the remaining enemies first.We have to hurry!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Artemis:**
Ohhh.Is that the Argo, by any chance?
 
**Mash:**
The Argo?Is it possible?
 
**Mash:**
Orion, by the Argo,do you mean "the" Argo!?
 
**Orion:**
Yeah, you got it right, dammit.Those are the real "Argonauts!"
 
**Orion:**
The ship of adventurers who set sail seeking the Golden Fleece. Likely mankind's first and strongest pirates.
 
**Orion:**
Though unlike our brabuster, generous, big-sisterly, tigbits Captain, their captain will make you think lice have better personalities.
 
**Mash:**
The leader of the Argonauts... Jason.
 
**Asterios:**
Ja-so-n!
 
**Jason:**
So disrespectful, Minotaur.My name should be called with awe and worship!
 
**Jason:**
But, as you are an ugly monster fated for death,I shall grant you forgiveness.
 
**Jason:**
Now, come at me!
 
**Hektor:**
What do we do, Captain?Should we crush them here and now?
 
**Jason:**
Of course, just like heroes of justice.We will fight and win head-on!
 
**Jason:**
Indeed, justice makes me feel so good!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I recommend you withdraw. It's impossible.Since we already have Euryale, it's better to retreat.
 
**Mash:**
But, Doctor!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Powerful heroes were gathered as Argonauts, but...There is one exceptional hero among them...
 
**Mash:**
...I know.That Berserker, presumably...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes. The greatest hero of Greek mythology. He who overcame the Twelve Labors. &ndash;Heracles.
 
**Heracles:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Jason:**
You can't win! As if you could!Heracles traveled everywhere, fought every monster.
 
**Jason:**
He was undefeated, and ultimately rose to become a god!
 
**Jason:**
He's not like you second and third-raters.You trash mobs are fated to be ripped to shreds!
 
**Jason:**
Of course, as a summoned Servant,he does lack two things.
 
**Jason:**
Intelligence and dignity. He's just a vicious stray dog now. Serves him right, I'd say.
 
**Jason:**
Now... Hand over Euryale.
 
**Jason:**
...If you do, I'll stop sending Heracles to attack you.
 
**Jason:**
What do you say, you Master-ish entity?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I refuse.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Shut up.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Master!
 
**Jason:**
Haha!I see, I see!
 
**Jason:**
You are very courageous!I really, really, really like you!
 
**Jason:**
And you have such a cute Servant, too!Good, very good! You're just like a hero!
 
**Jason:**
Wooo!So cool!
 
**Jason:**
&ndash;Geez, so cocky for the likes of trash.Can you perish now, Servants and all?
 
**Jason:**
Medea!My beloved Medea!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. Are you calling me, Master?
 
**Jason:**
You know what I want, right?I want you to kill them and break them into tiny pieces!
 
**Jason:**
Just like you did to your little brother!Ah, it's fine, it's fine.
 
**Jason:**
I already repented!I will never betray you again!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Little brother, in pieces?Sometimes you say strange things, Master.
 
**Medea Lily:**
But that's right, Lord Jason was like this.Now, you are like this.
 
**Medea Lily:**
That's why details don't matter. I'm the first disciple of Hekate, goddess of Magecraft&mdash;
 
**Medea Lily:**
Princess Medea will make your desires come true.
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, I know this.It is called DV.
 
**Orion:**
It's worse than DV.Neither of the two are looking at their partner!
 
**Jason:**
And Heracles!You shall go too! I'll be looking after you two from here.
 
**Mash:**
...He sends his wife to the front line, but doesn't fight himself. Um, Master. Maybe he is...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The scum of mankind.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A trivial boss.
 

---

 
**Jason:**
Hah, that's a funny joke....Kill them all, Heracles!
 
**Orion:**
To think there's someone even scummier than me.This world is so big, and Greece is so tiny.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Look at their numbers with just the Dragon Tooth Warriors...
 
**Artemis:**
Familiars created from dragon fangs...That's Hekate's specialty, all right!
 
**Orion:**
That sparkly kid,is that really Medea?
 
**Orion:**
That's weird... I thought Medea would look more, like...Ill-fated, or maybe gloomy...
 
**Medea Lily:**
I still have a lot of materials. Will your ship sink from the Dragon Tooth Soldiers' weight before you are defeated?
 
**Drake:**
Take that!You're so damn annoying! Get lost!
 
**Drake:**
Euryale! It's you they're after!Stay with Asterios!
 
**Euryale:**
But...
 
**Asterios:**
Rest...assured...
 
**Euryale:**
I can't do that!Stand back... Wait, are you getting in my way!?
 
**Mash:**
The second wave is coming!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Medea Lily:**
So they have strong bodies and minds.All right, I'll go too, Master.
 
**Jason:**
Yes, I'm counting on you, my Medea. Although Heracles alone is enough, with you victory is assured.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Here she comes. Princess Medea, a mage known as a"witch" even in Greece, where Magecraft was mainstream!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Witch of Colchis, whose skills rank among the top five in the world!
 
**Medea Lily:**
I will offer everything, dispose of everything,and sacrifice everything.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Even without reward, even gaining nothing.That is the reason I left the island.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Prepare yourselves, everyone!
 
**Medea Lily:**
I'm not the best at fighting,so please forgive me if I make you suffer...
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Medea Lily:**
Impressive. Just what you'd expect of someone who's already crushed two "eras."
 
**Fou:**
...Fou!
 
**Mash:**
At this rate, we'll make it somehow!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank goodness she really is a lousy fighter!But the problem is the other one!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Medea Lily:**
I'm sorry, I can't take them down by myself.Heracles&ndash;it's your turn, brave one.
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Asterios:**
Don't... Leave... My... Side!
 
**Euryale:**
What are you saying?Of course I'd flee without hesitation.
 
**Euryale:**
That's Heracles, the strongest hero in the history of mankind. He's like a walking disaster.
 
**Euryale:**
A man who walks into an avalanche is no hero.He's just a dimwit.
 
**Euryale:**
...I've seen many dimwits.
 
**Asterios:**
...I...know.
 
**Euryale:**
In that case&ndash;
 
**Asterios:**
But...if...somebody...needs...to.Then...I...will... Because.
 
**Asterios:**
I...am...monster. Killed...many...children.Many... Many... Many... Many!
 
**Asterios:**
So... I...will...go!I... Fight!
 
**Mash:**
...They're coming!
 
**Asterios:**
You... Won't... Have... Her!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...uh...aaaaaaaaaaargh!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;!
 
**Mash:**
Did we defeat him?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, it's no good!I'm still picking up a reaction!
 
**Jason:**
Oh, effort, effort, so much effort!So, I've got some news for you guys!
 
**Jason:**
&ndash;About Heracles... He's immortal.
 
**Mash:**
What?
 
**Jason:**
Heracles' most famous legend.The Twelve Labors given by the gods.
 
**Jason:**
Since he's overcome them all,he's been granted that many lives as a reward.
 
**Jason:**
In other words, you have to defeat him eleven more times. Good luck!
 
**Mash:**
No way... Eleven times... For real?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I-Impossible. That is just cheating!
 
**Drake:**
...Retreat! Everyone, retreat!Come on, back to the ship!
 
**Jason:**
Hahahahaha! Great! This is the best!Using overwhelming violence to oust enemies!
 
**Jason:**
This is the real pleasure behind "justice!"Don't you agree, Hektor?
 
**Hektor:**
Hmm...well, at least Heracles makes it nice and easy.Ah, and here's the Holy Grail.
 
**Jason:**
Oh, so this is the Holy Grail.Well, I suppose this is sufficient to be king of this world.
 
**Jason:**
I only regret that the previous owner was a lowly pirate.Now all I need is Euryale and&ndash;"the Ark."
 
**Jason:**
Then I'll have everything I need!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**Mash:**
Ark?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did he say "the Ark"!?
 
**Hektor:**
Captain, you sure it's okay to disclose that?
 
**Jason:**
It's fine, Hektor!They wouldn't have the slightest clue!
 
**Jason:**
Not of this world! Not of this era!Not of our true intentions... Nothing!
 
**Hektor:**
...Well, I think the lack of understanding is mutual.
 
**Jason:**
Now, Heracles!Finish them off!
 
**Heracles:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
Ugh!
 
**Asterios:**
!!!
 
**Euryale:**
Augh!
 
**Drake:**
Crap!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!!
 
**Euryale:**
&ndash;Oh, this is not good.
 
**Jason:**
!?No way! Knock it off, Heracles!
 
**Jason:**
This will wreck all my plans!Don't kill that woman!
 
**Asterios:**
!!!
 
**Euryale:**
!!!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios&ndash;!?
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...GRRRRRRRRRRR!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios...it's no good now.We're no match! We can't win against him!
 
**Euryale:**
It's no good. It's no good, but why...Asterios!
 
**Asterios:**
!!!...Ugh!
 
**Asterios:**
Kill-ed. Killed...killed...killed!Killed...innocent...children!
 
**Asterios:**
Father...told me...to...do it.Father...called me...monster!
 
**Asterios:**
But...it...was...my fault.I was sure...my heart was...monster.
 
**Asterios:**
But...you...called my name.Everyone forgot...my...name!
 
**Asterios:**
Then...I need to...return.Even if I'm not forgiven... Even if I'm still ugly...
 
**Asterios:**
I need to...return to human!
 
**Asterios:**
...Ugh!
 
**Jason:**
Quite considerate of you, Ox-head!Medea! Go retrieve Euryale!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. Just what you'd expect of the Minotaur.Though only once, he ultimately pushed Heracles back.
 
**Drake:**
Don't you dare...
 
**Drake:**
Come over here, Euryale!
 
**Medea Lily:**
??? Why go so far to protect her? You're a pirate knowing no love nor romance, only desire, so why?
 
**Drake:**
Hah! You don't understand?I may be inhuman, but this girl's beauty is true!
 
**Drake:**
Her soul is especially beautiful. She's not blind like you.It's obvious we would protect her!
 
**Drake:**
Euryale is our treasure!I won't let a guy like that get even a hair from her head!
 
**Euryale:**
Drake!
 
**Mash:**
Euryale, please stand back!You're the one they're after!
 
**Jason:**
What are you doing, Heracles? Medea?
 
**Jason:**
Oh, dammit! Why is everyone else but me a hopeless imbecile?
 
**Jason:**
Heracles, finish off that ox-man!But don't lay a hand on Euryale!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Asterios:**
Ugh...uh!
 
**Jason:**
You can't even obey me now, you  piece of scum?U-Ugh&mdash;Whew...Hektor!
 
**Hektor:**
Yessir....Time to do it?
 
**Jason:**
...Yes. When things don't go exactly as I plan,it irritates me.
 
**Jason:**
I can't stand my own allies' disorderly conduct.If you can't follow orders, you're worse than the enemy.
 
**Hektor:**
Gotcha.ThenReleasing Noble Phantasm.
 
**Orion:**
Oh, this doesn't look good.Asterios, dodge it!
 
**Asterios:**
...No.I can't...handle...that one.
 
**Hektor:**
If you want to stop this, you should bring either Achilles'or Aias' shield! "Durindana Pilum"!
 
**Hektor:**
...What?
 
**Euryale:**
No! Asterios!
 
**Heracles:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Jason:**
Good job, Hektor! That damn ox-head is going to hell along with Heracles!
 
**Jason:**
But, Heracles will revive immediately.Now, quickly get up and grab Euryale!
 
**Jason:**
You died once, and ox-head also died!You should have come to your senses a little bit!
 
**Hektor:**
Oh no....I don't think that's gonna happen, Captain.
 
**Hektor:**
That bastard Asterios is still "alive."
 
**Jason:**
W-What!?
 
**Hektor:**
...Amazing.He's the enemy, but I'm impressed.
 
**Hektor:**
He clung onto Heracles,fully aware that the spear would pierce through his body.
 
**Hektor:**
By doing so, my spear becomes a chain,and ties Heracles down.
 
**Hektor:**
He really wants to let Euryale escape,even if it means receiving a fatal blow.
 
**Asterios:**
...Mas-ter!Master! Master! MASTER!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...We're retreating!
 

---

 
**Asterios:**
Y-Yes!Thank...you!
 
**Asterios:**
Master...you too...called my name!Everyone...did not hate...monster!
 
**Asterios:**
First time... For the first time!I was...happy!
 
**Asterios:**
I am happy...to be...born!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;
 
**Asterios:**
Take care of...Euryale!All...thanks to...Euryale&mdash;
 
**Asterios:**
I...love...Euryale!
 
**Drake:**
We're setting sail!Fire all the smoke bombs we have on hand!
 
**Euryale:**
You can't. Asterios is&ndash;
 
**Orion:**
Shut up, tiny goddess!Try to understand his feelings!
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios!
 
**Euryale:**
No matter what anyone says,you're Asterios and nobody else.
 
**Euryale:**
And so&ndash;I beg of you.Don't regret not fully turning into a monster.
 
**Euryale:**
Because that's a very noble thing.
 
**Asterios:**
...Right.But...after all...a monster...need proper punishment.
 
**Jason:**
W-What the?Hektor, go after them!
 
**Hektor:**
I am very sorry, but that's impossible.They sunk into the ocean, with my spear and all.
 
**Hektor:**
Asterios likely won't let go of Heracles until he dies&ndash;
 
**Hektor:**
By the time Heracles returns,they'll be long gone.
 
**Jason:**
...Dammit.Medea!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Y-Yes?
 
**Jason:**
Can you track them?
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes, I analyzed their Magical Circuits on contact.I can find them as long as they're somewhere in this world.
 
**Jason:**
Can you find the location of the "Ark?"
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. Even without searching for it&ndash;They will find it for us.
 
**Medea Lily:**
That captain, Francis Drake, was a hero who greatly expanded this world at some point. She is a Pioneer of the Stars.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Since she pioneers this world,she is sure to work miracles.
 
**Medea Lily:**
If we nip that in the bud, this world will truly be whatever you desire, Lord Jason.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Don't worry, Master.We can capture Euryale at any time.
 
**Medea Lily:**
As long as those two Servants exist,we will be invincible&ndash;
 
**Medea Lily:**
We obtained a fragment of the Holy Grail.With it, we gained the right to rule over this naval world.
 
**Jason:**
I see! I get it, we just have to use them!That's my Medea!
 
**Jason:**
You indeed are not a treacherous witch, but the wise wife of a hero. That's what you should be called, my beloved Medea.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Treacherous witch... Who are you talking about?
 
**Hektor:**
Hey, Princess. When are you planning to tell him the truth?
 
**Medea Lily:**
Must I tell the truth?The world is going to end eventually.
 
**Medea Lily:**
For just these seas to last forever...That's something HE would never allow.
 
**Medea Lily:**
If so, it's not a bad thing to let him bask in blissful thoughts until the end, is it?
 
**Hektor:**
...If you say so,then this old man will keep quiet.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Anyway, please warn Heracles.It seems he does have a brain after all.
 
**Medea Lily:**
He probably knows that Euryale is the key.That's why he tried to kill her, to fend off destruction.
 
**Hektor:**
It's hard to believe he has "a brain" in that state...Fine, I'll give him ample warning.
 
**Hektor:**
Oh, brother. This old man wishes he was summoned to a proper Holy Grail War...
 
**Medea Lily:**
The Hand of the End has ticked forward again.One more push, and "the order" will crumble and fall.
 
**Medea Lily:**
My beloved. Before then, would you please awaken me from my dream?
 
## Section 11: Lost Ark of the Covenant 
 
**Pirate:**
No sign of any approaching ships.
 
**Drake:**
...I see.
 
**Euryale:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...Master.What do you think we should do from now on?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
About that "Ark" they mentioned?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Steal the item they want.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
So what exactly is this "Ark?"
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, please explain.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...The "Ark" contains the Ten Commandments that Moses, leader of ancient Israel, received from God.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
From a historical standpoint,it's a relic equivalent to that of the true Holy Grail.
 
**Drake:**
...Hmm. So it has no worth as treasure, then?What a pity.
 
**Mash:**
That's what Jason and the Argonauts are searching for.I'm certain that that's what he said.
 
**Mash:**
Even with Mistah Blackbeard gone, the Singularity still stands.
 
**Mash:**
Which means we should assume that Jason,captain of the Argonauts, is the Singularity.
 
**Mash:**
...So should we steal the Ark first?
 
**Orion:**
The Ark, huh...How are they planning to use it?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I don't know. I have no idea whatsoever.
 
**Artemis:**
Come on. You're not fighting on the front lines,at least make yourself useful.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Oh, sorry, that's not what I meant.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What I found incomprehensible was the actual concept of using the Ark.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The concept itself was incomprehensible?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's no way to use the Ark?
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They say the Ten Commandments are sealed inside.Whoever opens it will be punished...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Basically it's one of those "don't open it" fables.Just like Pandora's Box in Greece.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which is why I can't even begin to imagine why they'd want to find it and use it. It's just stupid.
 
**Mash:**
...I see. Doctor, you're afraid of imagining the worst-case scenario.
 
**Artemis:**
You're too cautious. Either that, or you're too smart.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mm... I admit that I'm too cautious... But you're all so carefree because you don't know about the legend of the Ark.
 
**Drake:**
Okay, okay, no more fighting. In any case, it's better to find this Ark thing for sure, right?
 
**Drake:**
Let's hurry up and get it.If it comes to it, we can smash it out of spite.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Captain, have you been listening?"The Ark" activates when it's broken or opened.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And the effect is... well, it is divine punishment.At worst, the surrounding area will be reduced to nothingness.
 
**Drake:**
What the hell? Why did ancient kings possess something so dangerous!? Were they all idiots or what?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't look at me, I got nothing to do with it.
 
**Mash:**
...I'm for going after the"the Ark."
 
**Mash:**
Um... I'm just not sure how to fight the Argonauts.More specifically, how do we fight Heracles?
 
**Euryale:**
Heracles... Even as a Berserker,his powers as a great hero weren't diminished.
 
**Euryale:**
It was only because Asterios held him down that we were able to flee to safety.
 
**Euryale:**
...Seems like he died.
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, most likely.
 
**Euryale:**
&ndash;How foolish.We just called his name. That's all it took for him&ndash;
 
**Euryale:**
With just that, he felt he could die for us.Just because we called him "Asterios," not "Minotaur."
 
**Euryale:**
That's the reason he risked his life to protect us...It was just that pure and simple.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He had no regrets.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Without him we all would have died.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
...Perhaps. But it might have been better if we were cleanly wiped out then and there.
 
**Euryale:**
Asterios died, and Heracles still lives.With just that, it makes it all seem so hopeless.
 
**Euryale:**
Sigh. Geez, this had to be the one time where my "loser sister" wasn't summoned.
 
**Drake:**
That Heracles...He has to die like ten more times?
 
**Mash:**
It's eleven times. But perhaps he died once when he got pierced by the spear at the end.
 
**Mash:**
In that case, it's still ten... Not much difference.
 
**Pirate:**
Boss, sorry to bug you when you're thinking.But a ghost ship has appeared!
 
**Drake:**
Huh? Oh fine, let's take our frustrations out and crush them!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
All right.We'll get going soon!
 
**Mash:**
Huh? But we have no strategy yet...
 
**Drake:**
Oh please, we can just play it by ear!They say you can't deal with trouble till you run into it.
 
**Drake:**
Besides, if we waste more time here, they are just gonna come after Euryale again after they grab that "Ark."
 
**Drake:**
Anyway, lay forward!
 
**Drake:**
If what Jason said was correct,neither of us has any leads.
 
**Drake:**
Though, we have a better chance because I'm here instead of their incompetent captain!
 
**Euryale:**
...Well, it's true that Jason's worthless.At least, you're probably a better captain.
 
**Orion:**
He's not a bad guy.
 
**Orion:**
He's just utterly worthless with a horrible personality,and now he's getting cocky because he's gained some power.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I don't understand which part of him is "not a bad guy."
 
**Artemis:**
Just because you say someone's not a bad guy,that doesn't excuse everything they've done.
 
**Orion:**
Right.Okay, I take it back. He's not a good guy.
 
**Orion:**
He's a scumbag with a terrible personality, but has power.
 
**Mash:**
There's nothing good about him whatsoever...
 
**Drake:**
See, that's what I meant.In that case, I win.
 
**Drake:**
Treasure always ends up in the pocket of the decisive one. That's how this world works!
 
**Drake:**
If Heracles is unstoppable, then bring it on.Only humans can challenge the impossible.
 
**Drake:**
We're greedy and shameless.We live by dreaming of achieving the impossible!
 
**Drake:**
Isn't that right, Fujimaru?
 
**Drake:**
Since you've come all the way to this era,that makes you just as big a fool as me, right?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not as much as you, Captain.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If that's what you think of me, it's promising.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Damn right you are!I'm a merchant. I only go after the best goods!
 
**Mash:**
...That's right. Both in France and in Rome,that's how it was for us.
 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Senpai. With you as my Master,I feel I can take on any opponent!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anchors aweigh!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Set sail!
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Full speed ahead then!Get to it, men! Sound the bell!
 
**Drake:**
The "Ark" will be ours!Let's go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Pirate:**
Land ho, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
All right, get us closer!...So, what's your take, scholar man?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...This island's no good, either.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No magical energy detected. We have several weak responses, but based on recorded data it's probably just monsters.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a bust. On to the next.
 
**Drake:**
You heard her! To starboard! Avoid that island!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye!
 
**Drake:**
...This island's also no good.That's three in a row.
 
**Drake:**
I'm happy the charts are filling up,but nothing looks like a clue.
 
**Mash:**
No Servants around, either.
 
**Mash:**
...Even if there were, we probably wouldn't find someone who could put up a fight against Heracles...
 
**Drake:**
All right, to the next island!
 
**Orion:**
...You know, something still bugs me...About that Medea, I mean.
 
**Mash:**
Medea... You mean the young girl standing next to Jason, right?
 
**Mash:**
She looked too sweet to be called the Witch of Colchis...
 
**Orion:**
Yeah. If Medea transformed into a Servant,she'd definitely be her grown up self, right?
 
**Orion:**
Medea was betrayed terribly by Jason,so she massacred his wife and children for revenge.
 
**Orion:**
...No matter how you look at it, they should've started killing each other the moment she was summoned!
 
**Artemis:**
That's awful!
 
**Artemis:**
At least Orion only flirts and randomly messes around with goddesses and other people's wives, right?
 
**Orion:**
Yeah, it's better to break those off clean...Pugyuru!?
 
**Orion:**
Dammit, that was a loaded question!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. It could be that she's the young Medea.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,but this is before she became a witch...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, when she was first learning Magecraft at Colchis Temple... Before she became "Jason's wife."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That explains the way she looked and acted.She hasn't experienced Jason abandoning her yet.
 
**Mash:**
I wonder if we should pity her...
 
**Euryale:**
Impossible. Once you become a Heroic Spirit,a slight difference in age won't alter your memories.
 
**Euryale:**
...I'm sure she knows the outcome of her story with Jason. So why does she act like that...
 
**Drake:**
It's obvious she's "acting oblivious."It's a pity, but also horrifying.
 
**Drake:**
Unlike you, she's not someone who can look a person in the eye and pick a fight.
 
**Euryale:**
What does that mean?I ignore humans because they don't matter to me, okay?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I know this! What they call that cold attitude of hers...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That explains Blackbeard's obsession...She's obviously a tsun&mdash;
 
**Pirate:**
Boss! A new island!
 
**Drake:**
All right! We're sure to hit the jackpot this time!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Orion:**
Hey, Fujimaru.Which side you betting on?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jackpot.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Miss again.
 

---

 
**Orion:**
I see. Well, I'm for&ndash;
 
**Orion:**
...Eek!?
 
**Artemis:**
An arrow in your head, Darling?Jackpot!
 
**Mash:**
Master, we're under attack!
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, an arrow, you should duck.
 
**Artemis:**
Darling, hey, hey, does it hurt? Does it actually hurt?
 
**Orion:**
It hurts a ton, idiot!G-Gotta pull it out!
 
**Orion:**
D-Damn...Hey, I just realized...I can't touch the top of my head!?
 
**Mash:**
A shocking fact has just been discovered, Master!
 
**Orion:**
Pull it out! Come on, hurry up!
 
**Artemis:**
A-All right. Artemis will do her best!Ready, set, twirl...twirl!
 
**Orion:**
Ouch ouch ouch! Just hurry up and pull it out!You're ridiculous!
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, this makes me so happy! It's not every day people think I'm useful like this!
 
**Drake:**
Ugh... You're making me cry...What an admirable maiden's soul. (Tears)
 
**Orion:**
Wish you'd make expressions like that under different circumstances!
 
**Orion:**
Oh...oh.I thought I was a goner...
 
**Orion:**
...Huh?There's something on it.
 
**Mash:**
What?
 
**Orion:**
Oh, it's a message.Let me see...
 
**Orion:**
...Somebody open it, please.
 
**Artemis:**
All right. Let's see...Oh!
 
**Mash:**
Artemis?
 
**Artemis:**
Hehehe, it's from someone I know.So stiff, as usual!
 
**Artemis:**
Perhaps because she's a pure girl who's never known love?
 
**Mash:**
Someone you know... Um, who would that be?
 
**Artemis:**
Uh... This girl is&ndash;
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**D：???:**
All right, it's delivered.
 
**E：???:**
...Whew. They're sure to notice the letter on that arrow.It's not like they have any clues right now.
 
**E：???:**
Now they've got to come to this island... They should.But there is an off chance... Or not?
 
**E：???:**
Oh no, I'm getting anxious. If they don't figure out that arrow, we'll never get another chance!
 
**E：???:**
It's about time the Argonauts found us as well....And if things don't play out, it's checkmate.
 
**E：???:**
...This is bad. It's super bad.I'm getting horribly anxious. I need some medicine.
 
**D：???:**
Shut up.
 
**D：???:**
They have no will to fight? Impossible.We've already confirmed&ndash;They're determined to fight.
 
**D：???:**
We're sure they're seeking the "Ark," right?Otherwise, they wouldn't be going island-hopping.
 
**D：???:**
They'll surely come.The world will be destroyed if they don't.
 
**E：???:**
Of course my calculations are correct.Oh, but... No, I just can't.
 
**E：???:**
I can't stand the anxiety, the feeling that everything is futile!
 
**E：???:**
I know, my love...May I hold your hand?
 
**E：???:**
I'd like your soft hand to guide me to tranquility. Desperately.
 
**D：???:**
May you?You may not. So no.
 
**E：???:**
...I'd like an explanation as to why I may not, but...
 
**Both:**
They're here!
 
**Orion:**
Hey, hey, are you really going to meet HER?
 
**Artemis:**
Huh? Of course.She's a hunter who worships me.
 
**Artemis:**
I have to give her my blessing.
 
**Orion:**
Hmm, well, okay.
 
**Mash:**
Orion, is there a problem?
 
**Orion:**
I mean, well, Mash.Artemis is the goddess of virginity.
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, Darling. Virginity? You're embarrassing me.
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, but I do run simulations every day of the day I lose my virginity, you see?
 
**Orion:**
What's that now?
 
**Artemis:**
Um, um.Orion first slams his hand against the wall. Like, SLAM.
 
**Artemis:**
And then he whispers in my ear, "Am I not good enough?" In a husky voice! And then, and then&ndash;
 
**Fou:**
Foou...
 
**Orion:**
I don't know why, but Fou's gaze makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! I could just cry!
 
**Euryale:**
Her head is just way too romantic...If "she" saw that, I think she'd faint from shock.
 
**Euryale:**
...Huh?
 
**Orion:**
Um, Artemis?
 
**Artemis:**
And then, and then?...Wait, what's with that look?
 
**Orion:**
Enemies are here and I'd like you to defeat them...
 
**Artemis:**
Oh, dear me!I'm so clumsy! Tee-hee☆
 
**Artemis:**
Okay, we'll defeat them quickly!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Combat complete.Let's keep going, Master.
 
**E：???:**
Wait!
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**Drake:**
Are you the one who sent that arrow?
 
**E：???:**
That's right!
 
**E：???:**
...Are you foes of the Argonauts?Or have you already given up and submitted?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Foes.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We haven't given up.
 

---

 
**E：???:**
...Very well! Then I shall show myself!
 
**E：???:**
...Forgive my questioning. I already knew the answer, but I still had to ask.
 
**E：???:**
We are, after all, the last hope in these seas.
 
**Mash:**
...Atalante, I presume?
 
**Atalante:**
Indeed. My True Name is Atalante.A hunter in service to the goddess Artemis.
 
**Atalante:**
...Oh, come to think of it, we ran into each other a bit in France, didn't we?
 
**Atalante:**
I was affected by Madness Enhancement back then...But this time I've been summoned as a normal Archer.
 
**Atalante:**
For now, I perceive to be on your side.
 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much.My name is Mash Kyrielight.
 
**Mash:**
This is my Master, Fujimaru.
 
**Mash:**
And the ship's captain, Francis Drake,and this is Euryale.
 
**Atalante:**
Yes, good to meet you.
 
**Mash:**
This harmless-looking plush toy is Orion,and the animal is Fou.
 
**Fou:**
Fooou.
 
**Orion:**
A pleasure... By the way, Mash, why did you introduce me with Fou? Are we in the same category?
 
**Mash:**
Also, this is Artemis.
 
**Atalante:**
Francis Drake, Euryale,Orion the plush toy, and Artemis, huh?
 
**Atalante:**
...Artemis?
 
**Artemis:**
Yeees♪
 
**Atalante:**
......
 
**Atalante:**
Mash, was it?You can stop joking.
 
**Atalante:**
Lady Artemis is the goddess of hunting and virginity.There's no way she could be summoned as a Servant.
 
**Artemis:**
Hey, Darling?Atalante doesn't believe me.
 
**Artemis:**
What's wrong with the goddess of virginity living for love? Right?
 
**Orion:**
Hah-hah-hah. No comment! No comment!
 
**Atalante:**
...Huh? Really?
 
**Artemis:**
It's true, Atalante.The hunter goddess who lives for love, that's me&ndash;
 
**Artemis:**
Artemis!Hehe!
 
**Atalante:**
...(Staggers)
 
**Mash:**
A-Are you okay!?
 
**Atalante:**
I-I'm fine. The Holy Grail War on the great seas has strengthened my mind a bit...
 
**Atalante:**
E-Even finding out the goddess I worship is hopelessly romantic won't be enough to break me!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
The wound's deep, be disappointed.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hang in there, maiden.
 

---

 
**Atalante:**
You don't sound like you mean it!...Anyway, I would like to introduce you to another Servant.
 
**Atalante:**
The Servant in possession of the "Ark."In other words, the man the Argonauts seek.
 
**Mash:**
The "Ark" is a Noble Phantasm!?
 
**Atalante:**
Indeed. He was the first Servant summoned to these seas. His True Name is&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
Hey, I've been waiting a long time for you guys.
 
**Atalante:**
David.
 
**Fou:**
Foou...
 
## Section 12: Defeat Heracles 
 
**David:**
Normally I'd hold a feast with food and drink,but first, let me explain about the "Ark."
 
**Euryale:**
Fine with me. I like men who get to the point.
 
**David:**
Thank you. I am David, King of Israel.The "Ark" is my Noble Phantasm.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...King of Israel?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Israel? You mean...
 

---

 
**David:**
Yes, that King of Ancient Israel.Is there something on my face?
 
**Mash:**
No, it's nothing.Don't worry about it.
 
**Mash:**
...Psst! Senpai! I thought it was a perfectly valid question to ask. Let's hear him out for now.
 
**Fou:**
Fou.
 
**David:**
...Now, before I continue, it seems we've been interrupted. While we're at it, let's recover any edible meat we find.
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**David:**
Anyway, back to our discussion.
 
**David:**
The "Ark" is a third-rate Noble Phantasm. If you make someone touch the box, they die&ndash;That's it.
 
**David:**
Could it be used for evil? ...Yeah, probably.Strictly speaking, it doesn't belong to me.
 
**David:**
It's like a contract that God gave to humanity.It's not easy to steal, but it's bad news if stolen.
 
**David:**
What's more, you can't shift it into spirit form.
 
**David:**
I'm the Servant summoned to this world along with the actual physical "Ark."
 
**David:**
Even if I die,it will remain as long as someone possesses it.
 
**Mash:**
It is said that inside the box lies the stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments...
 
**David:**
But that's not all.That thing brings literal "death," not just metaphorical.
 
**David:**
Anyway... After I heard from Atalante that Jason was after the "Ark"...
 
**David:**
I hid in the forest with her, and waited for an opportunity.
 
**David:**
We waited for properly summoned Servants,like you.
 
**Atalante:**
I was summoned as part of the Argonaut crew,but I didn't lose control of myself like Heracles.
 
**Atalante:**
Maybe because I never liked Jason in life, or because I was summoned as an Archer who can act freely.
 
**Atalante:**
Either way, once summoned,Jason immediately sought the "Ark."
 
**Atalante:**
He kept saying that if he had it,he could be the king of these seas.
 
**Mash:**
Is the "Ark" a representation of kingship?
 
**David:**
Hardly. It's just a relic I offered to God when I was a king.
 
**David:**
It's not a sign of kingship.It's simply something owned by a king.
 
**Euryale:**
...David, may I ask something?
 
**David:**
Of course.Ask me anything.
 
**Euryale:**
If I were to be sacrificed to this "Ark,"what would happen?
 
**Euryale:**
If nothing else,that seems to be their goal...
 
**David:**
Euryale, right? You were originally a Divine Spirit.If you were sacrificed to the "Ark"&ndash;
 
**David:**
Yeah, this whole era would "die."
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sigh. I thought so.
 
**Mash:**
Huh?
 
**David:**
Details&mdash;After the fight!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**David:**
Like I said before, the "Ark"brings death to all things&ndash;
 
**David:**
Sacrificing a soul that exists as a god, regardless of rank, would cause the box to lose control.
 
**David:**
The death of a god means the death of the world.The Ark is a disaster from that kind of era.
 
**David:**
If this was a normal world, it would only destroy the surrounding area, but, hmm...
 
**David:**
This is an unstable place that normally wouldn't exist,right? I doubt such a groundless world like this can survive.
 
**David:**
Um, a Singularity, was it? The thing blurring the foundation of human history.
 
**David:**
This whole era will disappear without having to wait for its collapse.
 
**Drake:**
There'd be no need to use a weird Holy Grail...or even steal mine, for that matter.
 
**Drake:**
They can use that box to sacrifice a goddess,and at that point it will all be over.
 
**Mash:**
...Why does Jason want to destroy the world so badly?
 
**Atalante:**
Who knows?...He may not even know himself.
 
**Atalante:**
Somebody may have convinced him that all he has to do is offer Euryale to the "Ark."
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Either way.
 
**Mash:**
We know why they're after this Noble Phantasm,and why we absolutely must stop them.
 
**Mash:**
The question is how do we defeat them...By the way, David, is your class Archer?
 
**David:**
That's right. Atalante is an Archer as well.
 
**Mash:**
Talk about unbalanced. Four Archers, a Shielder,and one Pirate...
 
**Atalante:**
We're up against Heracles, Medea, and Hektor.We don't have to count Jason, I suppose.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is he that weak?
 

---

 
**Atalante:**
He's weak.Rather, he's never actually fought.
 
**Atalante:**
He's a monster who formed the Argonauts with just charisma and eloquence, but he's no fighter.
 
**Atalante:**
But I doubt having one useless member in their party poses any problems for them.
 
**Atalante:**
...They have Heracles, after all.
 
**Mash:**
Multiple resurrections from the Twelve Labors.And above all else, his prominent combat techniques.
 
**Mash:**
I don't see how we can beat him.
 
**Orion:**
We, on the other hand, are full of fighters who specialize in long-distance combat.
 
**David:**
If we can get him to touch the "Ark,"we might be able to instantly obliterate him.
 
**Artemis:**
Would he touch it that easily?
 
**David:**
It's a what-if. Even a Berserker can sense the magical energy around Noble Phantasms. You'd never walk up to a bomb, right?
 
**David:**
If he had no choice but to touch it, then maybe...But how could we force that situation?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Not just Heracles. Medea and Hektor also possess terrifying power.
 
**Mash:**
If all three attack at once,it'll be impossible for us to hold out.
 
**Mash:**
If we could at least lure Heracles away from the others&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...How about we flee with the "Ark" in tow,and wait for an opportunity...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, just go choke on an expired sesame bun or something.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**Orion:**
How about we hole up?Anywhere like that near here?
 
**Atalante:**
Nope. Some cramped pagan catacombs are all this island has.
 
**Atalante:**
Even if there were some kind of stronghold here,it wouldn't be enough to hold off Heracles.
 
**Orion:**
Hmm, I suppose you're right.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou?Fou, fou, fou!
 
**Mash:**
What's wrong, Fou?Huh, Master?
 
**Mash:**
Master?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I have an idea.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes?
 
**Drake:**
Oh good, nice, great idea!You're just as reliable a {(M) man /(F) woman} as I thought!
 
**David:**
That's a reasonable strategy. But, besides the Servants,Fujimaru would also be at risk.
 
**David:**
Well, I guess that's life. The odds of winning usually go up with your life on the line.
 
**Euryale:**
It's quite a gamble.If you fail, you're done. No turning back. A one-shot deal.
 
**Artemis:**
So I guess the question is how the enemy will act.
 
**Artemis:**
Will Heracles head straight for Euryale?
 
**Orion:**
...Out of countless Heroic Spirits, Heracles is likely in the top tier.
 
**Orion:**
Even though he's Berserker, I doubt he's completely devoid of intelligence.
 
**Orion:**
When he was fighting Asterios,he was dead set on going after Euryale.
 
**Orion:**
...That's the reason Asterios somehow managed to keep up.
 
**Drake:**
Berserkers are easy to lure.The one I can't get a read on is Jason.
 
**Drake:**
He impaled the enemy along with his own ally.Who knows what other cowardly tricks he'll pull off?
 
**Atalante:**
No, don't worry about Jason.Trust me. I'm sure he will act this way.
 
**Atalante:**
...It's true he's a coward, but, more than that,he places absolute trust in Heracles.
 
**Atalante:**
I like Fujimaru's plan. Count me in.
 
**David:**
Count me in, too. Since everyone's betting equally,it's fine as long as one of us survives and wins it all.
 
**Orion:**
...What destructive thoughts this guy has.Or is it irresponsibility?
 
**Artemis:**
And you, Darling?
 
**Orion:**
Are you expecting something from me, a plush toy?
 
**Orion:**
It's Mash who has it toughest here.She's risking her life on the front line.
 
**Orion:**
Shouldn't Mash decide whether we go through with this plan or not?
 
**Mash:**
...I'm fine. I'll make sure that the plan Master devised succeeds.
 
**Mash:**
Of course, that's contingent on the Doctor's cooperation.
 
**Mash:**
Doctor?You've been silent for a while now. Are you listening?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course I'm listening.It's risky, but we don't have any time left. Count me in.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We don't know when or if King David will fall into enemy hands. I'll provide all the backup I can.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do this.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's win.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master!
 
## Section 13: Betting It All 
 
**Medea Lily:**
That's the island.
 
**Jason:**
Ah, I see.Euryale hasn't been killed yet?
 
**Medea Lily:**
She's still alive.
 
**Hektor:**
...Even though they know they're being targeted...I question their judgment.
 
**Hektor:**
...Well, whatever. It's their choice.I'll leave the decisions here up to our captain.
 
**Jason:**
All right! The luck of the gods is on our side.Heracles, Medea, Hektor!
 
**Jason:**
Land on that island and seize both Euryale and the "Ark!"
 
**Jason:**
I&ndash;
 
**Hektor:**
Whoa!
 
**Jason:**
Huh, arrows? ...What fools. As if these flimsy arrows would work against Heracles&ndash;
 
**Medea Lily:**
!!!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Lord Jason!They're&ndash;aiming at you!
 
**Jason:**
...What?
 
**Atalante:**
Well then, time to show off all our Noble Phantasms.
 
**Atalante:**
I dedicate this to Apollo and Artemis&ndash;"Phoebus Catastrophe!"
 
**Artemis:**
Awww... How touching♪
 
**Artemis:**
...What's wrong, Darling?Your head is in your hands and you're shivering.
 
**Orion:**
It's a knee-jerk-reaction from hearing Apollo's name...
 
**Artemis:**
Hehe. Then, it's my turn! Deploy Noble Phantasm!Hear my song of love! "Tri-Star Amore Mio!"
 
**Euryale:**
It might be a waste to use my Noble Phantasm on such a disgusting idiot.Well, whatever, I'll use it without hesitation.Noble Phantasm&ndash;"Eye of the Euryale!"
 
**David:**
I'm jealous. Jason, you're so popular!Let me share something with you too.Noble Phantasm&ndash;"Hamesh Avanim!"
 
**Hektor:**
Whoa, a concentrated attack of Noble Phantasms Ugh, what a pain!
 
**Medea Lily:**
They have also mixed in A-rank attacks!They are leaving no openings!
 
**Jason:**
W-Why? Why is it all directed to me&ndash;You damn cowards!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Please stay calm, Master.I shall protect you!
 
**Jason:**
Oh, uh, thanks Medea....But I just can't count on someone so inexperienced...
 
**Jason:**
Hektor! You stay here too!Protect me like a true Servant!
 
**Jason:**
Heracles! They're just Archers.Pulverize them with one blow!
 
**Heracles:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Medea Lily:**
...Sigh.
 
**Hektor:**
...Up to this point it's going just like the enemy wants it to.
 
**Hektor:**
But, what are they planning to do against Heracles?The ox-head aside, that shield girl isn't going to cut it.
 
**Hektor:**
To defeat Heracles, they'd need 12 wielders of A-rank Noble Phantasms, or...
 
**Hektor:**
No, that can't be. There's no reason to risk one's life to that extent, is there, oh Future Mage?
 
**Euryale:**
He's here, Fujimaru....I mean, Master.
 
**Euryale:**
Do everything you can to protect me!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Got it!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's run.
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll show you the route to take!For now, Fujimaru, just run!
 
**Euryale:**
Yes, let's go!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Mash:**
Just as expected, he's targeting Euryale!First, let's hold him down here!
 
**Drake:**
All right, I'll give you as much support as I can!Mash, this plan all depends on you!
 
**Drake:**
Time to brace yourself!
 
**Atalante:**
I'll take Mash with me.
 
**Mash:**
Yes!...Mash Kyrielight, here I go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
(Pant, pant, pant...)
 
**Heracles:**
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![1-dark](https://i.imgur.com/NkGVSh6.png#gh-light-mode-only)&ndash;!
 
**Mash:**
...As predicted, he's headed towards Euryale!
 
**Euryale:**
I know!On to the next!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Euryale:**
Hey, can't you run any faster?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am trying!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Doing my best!
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
He's here!
 
**Atalante:**
He's caught up!Mash, go!
 
**Mash:**
Yes!Great Hero Heracles&ndash;!
 
**Mash:**
It's time for a rematch!
 
**Orion:**
All right, Artemis!Let's do this!
 
**Artemis:**
Yeah! I won't pull any punches here!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**David:**
He's here.Euryale, Fujimaru, hurry!
 
**Euryale:**
Master, do your best! Just hang in there a bit longer!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm super-duper running!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm giving it all I got!
 

---

 
**Atalante:**
He's here, so get ready!
 
**Mash:**
We've caught up.Here we go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Euryale:**
Run, run!If we don't hurry...
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**Euryale:**
He's here. There's nowhere to run anymore.Scared?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm scared.
 
**Euryale:**
I see... Me too.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not scared.
 
**Euryale:**
I see... You're overdoing it.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
If we stop, he'll catch up to us.We have no choice, jump over the you-know-what!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Even if a touch means death!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not confident!
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
Never mind that and just jump!Trust me!
 
**Euryale:**
All right&ndash; One, two, three!
 
**Euryale:**
W-We did it! You can do anything you put your mind to, Master!
 
**Heracles:**
!!!
 
**Euryale:**
He stopped!It looks like Heracles was able to understand...
 
**Euryale:**
What that box separating us really is...
 
**Atalante:**
That's far enough, Heracles!
 
**Mash:**
Heracles, the Noble Phantasm that Jason seeks is right in front of you!
 
**Heracles:**
!!!
 
**Mash:**
The "Ark" kills whoever touches it. Since you still have ten lives, this is the only way to defeat you.
 
**Mash:**
Master, bear with us just a little longer.
 
**Mash:**
Heracles, we will stop you!&ndash;Here we go!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
Take this!
 
**Drake:**
Force him in!
 
**Heracles:**
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![2-dark](https://i.imgur.com/siU9dhg.png#gh-light-mode-only)&mdash;!
 
**David:**
All right, he touched it!
 
**Mash:**
...We've defeated Heracles.No, it was more like he disappeared instead of dying.
 
**Mash:**
Honestly, I still can't believe it.Master, are you all right!?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought I was gonna die.
 

---

 
**Euryale:**
...We were all terrified.But, I'm glad you're not just some savage hero.
 
**Euryale:**
You knew your own weakness, and still did what you could. You did a wonderful job, Master.
 
**Drake:**
Now, the only one left is that revolting Jason.Let's go free the seas once and for all!
 
## Section 14: Pioneer of the Stars 
 
**Hektor:**
...He's late.
 
**Jason:**
The arrows have stopped.Medea, check things out with your familiar.
 
**Medea Lily:**
That's unnecessary.It seems Heracles has been defeated.
 
**Jason:**
What?Hey Medea, that's not funny.
 
**Drake:**
Oh, there he is.Hey Jason! Can you hear me?
 
**Drake:**
Well then, we're coming for you!
 
**Jason:**
...Impossible!Heracles! What happened to Heracles!?
 
**Drake:**
Oh, come on. You really need to ask?
 
**Drake:**
If he was alive,we obviously wouldn't be, right?
 
**Drake:**
Since we're alive, it means he's dead.That's pretty simple logic.
 
**Jason:**
There's no way he'd die!He's Heracles! The great immortal hero!
 
**Jason:**
He's the epitome of a hero, someone who heroes admired, challenged, yet still fell short of!
 
**Jason:**
There's no way a petty, ragtag bunch like you could ever overcome someone like that!
 
**Drake:**
...I guess even you felt a semblance of friendship.Even if it was a distorted one.
 
**Drake:**
Well, fine. If that's what you want to believe, so be it.We'll settle the match.
 
**Jason:**
Ugh! ...Get us out of here!
 
**Hektor:**
Oh, thinking of running?
 
**Jason:**
We're retreating! Using this Holy Grail,all I need to do is summon a new Servant!
 
**Hektor:**
As far as I can tell, we're still at an advantage here....Well, gotta follow the captain's orders.
 
**Drake:**
So you ARE thinking of running.Just as I thought. Men, are you all ready?
 
**Drake:**
"Golden Hind!"This is our last voyage, our final task as pirates!
 
**Drake:**
The target is the Argo! The treasure they hold captive is the freedom of the seas!
 
**Drake:**
We'll have them pay us back in full!Ring the bells, brothers!
 
**Pirate:**
Aye, aye, Boss!
 
**Drake:**
Hard to port!Make a steady approach and fire the cannons and guns!
 
**Jason:**
What're you doing?Hurry up and cut us loose!
 
**Hektor:**
With so many Archers on their side, their attacks are that much more fierce.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Never mind the cannonballs... It's Atalante's arrows.We're the only ones who can block them.
 
**Jason:**
Damn, how are they catching up!This is the legendary ship, Argo!
 
**Jason:**
It's in a different class from their mundane sailboat!
 
**Hektor:**
The difference is in the helmsman, I guess.Those are the skills of one who has lived with the sea.
 
**Hektor:**
They're fundamentally different from someone who just takes his boat out casually.
 
**Jason:**
Damn... We have no choice.O Holy Grail!
 
**Drake:**
We've caught up with you, pretty boy!Let's see what you got!
 
**Jason:**
You lowly scum!Go! Kill them!
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**Mash:**
...That's a Shadow Servant!Be careful, everyone!
 
**David:**
Oh boy. What a rotten thing.
 
**David:**
...But, I guess since you're relying on tricks like this,it means you're pretty much cornered, right?
 
**Jason:**
How dare you, you piece of...
 
**David:**
Now, now, Jason was it? No need for such a scary face... Guess I really hit the mark, didn't I?
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Drake:**
All right, let's board!...Then again, we're just all Archers.
 
**Atalante:**
I'm going. Being an Archer doesn't mean I can't handle close-range combat.
 
**David:**
In that case, I guess I'll go, too.If I die, I'll trust you'll take care of the rest.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight, here I go!
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**Jason:**
Hektor!
 
**Hektor:**
Yes, yes, I know.All right, Medea.
 
**Hektor:**
If the need arises, I'll be counting on you.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. It is my duty to protect our Master.I will look after him until the very end.
 
**Hektor:**
Oooh, scary... Is this what they mean by "naturally insane"... Hm?
 
**Hektor:**
Hi, future {(M) boy /(F) girl}.Your name was Fujimaru, right?
 
**Hektor:**
I'm impressed you've come this far. It's truly amazing.France, Rome, and now "here."
 
**Hektor:**
I appreciate you coming all this way.I value that kind of perseverance.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This guy!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you know about Chaldea?
 

---

 
**Hektor:**
Oh, my hunch was right, that's all.I'm just a warrior who couldn't pick a Master to serve.
 
**Hektor:**
Now, let's see who can hold out longer. This old man is pretty confident in defensive battles.
 
**Hektor:**
So&mdash;Come at me with everything you've got, brat.I'll show you how experience trumps youth.
 
**Mash:**
...This is Hektor, the hero of the Trojan War. We can't let our guard down. Let's take him down, Master!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Hektor:**
...Dammit, this is it for me.Well, I did what I could.
 
**Hektor:**
But at least I'll leave a parting gift.Euryale, offer your life&ndash;to the "Ark!"
 
**Mash:**
Oh no!
 
**Euryale:**
&ndash;Yes, that is what I expected you would do.
 
**Hektor:**
Wha...
 
**Euryale:**
"Eye of the Euryale."
 
**Hektor:**
Urgh...This old man's scheme...How did you see through it?
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, I didn't see through anything.But you killed Asterios.
 
**Euryale:**
That alone was reason enough for me to pay close attention to you, old man.
 
**Hektor:**
...Pfft.I guess I'm just not cut out to be a villain.
 
**Hektor:**
I thought I'd at least go out big at the end of the world.But your hands are tied when the "top" is terrible.
 
**Jason:**
Wha...Hektor!?
 
**Medea Lily:**
Hektor has passed on, too.Lord Jason, what shall we do now?
 
**Medea Lily:**
Impossible to surrender or retreat.I'm a mage who can only heal and defend.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Now, what shall we do?
 
**Jason:**
Silence, woman! If you're my wife,act like one and think about protecting your husband!
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. Of course I am thinking, Master.After all, that's what a Servant does.
 
**Jason:**
...What's that look? Why are you still smiling!?Don't you understand what this situation means?
 
**--ARROW--:**
 
**David:**
Wait!Before that, I have a question for Jason.
 
**David:**
...Who gave you such an idiotic idea as sacrificing Euryale to the "Ark?"
 
**Jason:**
That's none of your business!
 
**David:**
Oh, I think it is. After all, if you had sacrificed her, the world would have been destroyed.
 
**Jason:**
&mdash;What?
 
**David:**
Of course.That box brings death.
 
**David:**
To offer it a Divine Spirit is completely insane.
 
**David:**
This era is unstable to begin with.It would have killed the era itself.
 
**Jason:**
&mdash;Ridiculous.Lies. That can't be&mdash;
 
**David:**
That's why I'm asking you.
 
**David:**
"Sacrificing a Divine Spirit will grant infinite power."Who tempted you with that promise?
 
**David:**
Was it Hektor? Medea?
 
**Jason:**
...Medea?He's lying... isn't he?
 
**Jason:**
Sacrificing a Divine Spirit to the "Ark"would've grant me powers and invincibility, right?
 
**Jason:**
I mean, that's what HE told me...
 
**Medea Lily:**
It is no lie. After all, the death of an era brings complete destruction.
 
**Medea Lily:**
If the world is destroyed, your enemies will cease to exist. See&ndash;? That makes you invincible, no?
 
**Jason:**
Y-you.You people lied to me?
 
**Jason:**
That doesn't serve my purpose at all!I was finally going to create an ideal nation!
 
**Jason:**
One where everyone respects me!A true utopia, where all are content, and there is no war!
 
**Jason:**
Was this trial not for that purpose!?Was it not to give me a second chance!?
 
**Medea Lily:**
...That is a dream that can never come true, Lord Jason.It is beyond you.
 
**Medea Lily:**
You'll never be an ideal king. Even if your heart truly wished for peace, your soul is hopelessly twisted.
 
**Medea Lily:**
You cannot make your dream come true.Not in the manner that you desire.
 
**Medea Lily:**
You will only realize your fate the moment you obtain what you truly desire, then crush it with your own hands.
 
**Jason:**
What... What are you talking about, witch!? What does a woman who was holed up in a rural shrine know!?
 
**Jason:**
I was born the son of a king, but my uncle robbed me of my throne. I was forced into the care of a centaur!
 
**Jason:**
Even while suffering that indignity, I became resourceful.I built the Argo and gathered a crew of heroes!
 
**Jason:**
So what part of me!? Where!?Where am I lacking the qualifications to be king!?
 
**Jason:**
I just wanted to take back my own land!I just wanted my own nation!
 
**Jason:**
How is that wrong, you traitor!?
 
**Medea Lily:**
...Such a pity. Ever since I was summoned,I have told you nothing but the truth.
 
**Medea Lily:**
I am Princess Medea. Prior to being betrayed,I was a witch who blindly believed the one who summoned me.
 
**Medea Lily:**
That is why I have protected you all this time.You were chosen by "that" king.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Everything is real, everything is true....Though there may have been some misunderstandings.
 
**Medea Lily:**
For example, I just said I would protect you, yes?But how I will protect you&ndash;
 
**Jason:**
Huh?
 
**Medea Lily:**
This, is how.
 
**Jason:**
Wha-!? Y-You! Stop!What are you doing!? Aaah! No! My body is melting!
 
**Fou:**
Fouuu! Fouuuu!
 
**Medea Lily:**
O Holy Grail. O ultimate vessel granting my desires.Manifest. Remember. You are one of the 72 Demon Gods.
 
**Jason:**
Arggh, ack, aieeeeeeee!
 
**Medea Lily:**
&ndash;I shall give you the strength to fight.I shall give you the strength to rise up.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Let us fight together for the sake of destruction.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Now then, rank number 30. Sea Fiend Forneus.Use that power to put an end to your journey!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Demon God! This is the second one of those things, I mean deities, we've seen!Something like that really exists?
 
**Mash:**
!!!
 
**David:**
This is a surprise...What did she just say?
 
**David:**
Rank number 30, "Forneus!?"She's talking about Solomon's Demon Gods!
 
**Atalante:**
Will we&ndash;Be able to defeat it?
 
**Drake:**
I hit it!All right, if it can be hit, it can be defeated!
 
**Drake:**
Mash, this is truly the final battle!Come, get a hold of yourself!
 
**Drake:**
You came all this way to slay that thing, didn't you?So hold your head up high!
 
**Drake:**
This is it! The final battle!Be brave and laugh your fears away!
 
**Drake:**
Say, "I have no use for a monster!Just give me a pretty crown!"
 
**Pirate:**
Whoaaaa!?We... We just heard somethin' awfully rare, yeah!?
 
**Pirate:**
Did Boss just say a seriously feminine line!?
 
**Drake:**
Shut up you fools, go hide in your cabins!This isn't something you can handle!
 
**Drake:**
A-Anyway, Mash, just do it!And forget what I just said!
 
**Drake:**
If you keep hesitating, I am going to take that second Holy Grail for myself!
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Captain Drake.
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, understood! Master, visual confirmation of the final enemy of this era!
 
**Mash:**
Commencing correction&ndash;!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're gonna win, Mash!
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Mash:**
...We got it, Master!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay?
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes!
 
**Jason:**
Oh...ah...ugh...Medea, Medea, Medea...
 
**Medea Lily:**
&ndash;Yes, Jason.Is something wrong?
 
**Jason:**
...Fix me, my Medea.It hurts, it hurts, it really hurts!
 
**Medea Lily:**
...
 
**Jason:**
What are you doing you slowpoke? I said, fix me.
 
**Medea Lily:**
&ndash;I can't do that, Jason.I'm sorry.
 
**Jason:**
...Huh?
 
**Medea Lily:**
I will be falling soon myself. It's such a pity.Originally, the world would've sunk with you.
 
**Jason:**
...Why you, just as I thought...
 
**Medea Lily:**
Although it has nothing to do with me,but it's true that I did know you.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Even as we speak,the memories of Princess Medea are coming back to me.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Even if she was betrayed, even if she was cursed at,even if she'd been deceived from the very start.
 
**Medea Lily:**
She truly, truly adored her Lord Jason.You had been given divine power, yet&ndash;
 
**Medea Lily:**
You were endlessly innocent.Like a child excited over receiving a paltry treasure.
 
**Medea Lily:**
You were hopelessly cruel, and completely innocent.Despite being weak, you attracted others and inspired loyalty.
 
**Medea Lily:**
That's who you were, Jason.That was her first love.
 
**Medea Lily:**
But you were quick to betray everything.That's the only way you knew how to live.
 
**Medea Lily:**
If so&mdash;isn't it easier to sink along with the world,so that you won't be betrayed?
 
**Medea Lily:**
You were never&mdash;supposed to return to your land.
 
**Jason:**
Damn...witch!...You treacherous...damned witch!
 
**Jason:**
Die! Die! Go to hell!Dammit, dammit, DAMMIT&ndash;!
 
**Medea Lily:**
...I'm sorry, Lord Jason.
 
**Medea Lily:**
I wanted to protect you from him,but I had no way of doing so.
 
**Medea Lily:**
I don't have much time left... I only wish I could have dreamed a beautiful dream in my final moments...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Medea's about to vanish... No, before she does!Fujimaru, you have to ask her!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Who's behind all this?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Were you allies with Lev, too?
 

---

 
**Medea Lily:**
...I'm no longer at liberty to tell you that,since I have lost to him as a mage.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Princess Medea the mage,not the Servant, was defeated?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words&mdash;
 
**Medea Lily:**
Yes. Please be sure to prepare yourselves,newest and last mages from a distant era.
 
**Medea Lily:**
You don't stand a chance against him.As mages, you have no prayer of defeating him.
 
**Medea Lily:**
So&mdash;go gather stars.Numerous dazzling stars.
 
**Medea Lily:**
Stars that can rise against the greed and beast hidden within man's heart. Stars that can remain bright even within a storm and light up the sky&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Elimination confirmed.Holy Grail collection complete.
 
**Mash:**
No enemies left.End combat actions.
 
**Mash:**
Era correction&ndash;complete.
 
**Drake:**
The wind has stopped blowing... Ah, this is the end.There is nothing that can be done.
 
**Drake:**
This sea will end soon.But not anything like the giant whirlpool earlier.
 
**Drake:**
This is a good ending. It's a new birth&mdash;Our sea is coming back to us!
 
**Pirate:**
Heee&mdash;eey!It's goodbye to this damn weird sea&ndash;!
 
**Pirate:**
We did it, men! Can's say I won't miss it, though!After all, these waters were full of adventure!
 
**Pirate:**
Hey, we're vanishin', one after another!Guess that's how life works, the rank and file exit first!
 
**Pirate:**
Mash and Fujimaru, see ya!Thanks for helpin' the captain!
 
**Pirate:**
We'll get hanged sooner or later, but you're good folk!Let this be a lesson! Never keep the company of pirates!
 
**Mash:**
Everyone...
 
**Artemis:**
Haaaa!We can finally go home!
 
**Artemis:**
Come on, Orion! A new journey of love awaits!
 
**Orion:**
This is supposed to be a nice goodbye scene.Don't you want to look cool?
 
**Orion:**
Oh, forget it. I'm tired.
 
**Orion:**
Well, I hope we can meet again with me in a different form! Farewell!
 
**Orion:**
Oh, and Mash.How about a kiss goodbye for good measure?
 
**Orion:**
No? Oh, okay.
 
**Artemis:**
Darling, how about a "goodbye" from me?
 
**Orion:**
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
 
**Euryale:**
And so our roles are played out now.Oh, what a terrible time.
 
**Euryale:**
Without "me" or my "loser sister" around,it's dreadfully boring.
 
**Euryale:**
...Although I would like to meet HIM again someday.
 
**Euryale:**
I'll have to call him by name, and make fun of that embarrassing confession of love.
 
**Euryale:**
Oh, that's right. Fujimaru, you did well, too.As a final reward, I'll give you a little kiss.
 
**Euryale:**
Get down on your knees.Here&ndash;(smooch.)
 
**Mash:**
Wha!?
 
**Euryale:**
Well, safe travels.Make your next struggle as merry as this one.
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Atalante:**
...Whew. I'm happy I was of service this time.I didn't want to be defeated like last time.
 
**Atalante:**
That said, I haven't really shown what I can do yet.So please call on me again sometime.
 
**Atalante:**
Still... From now on, how should I go about honoring Lady Artemis?
 
**David:**
Well, it's about that time.
 
**David:**
It seems you have various struggles ahead,but do your best without being discouraged.
 
**David:**
With two humans, a quarrel ensues.100 will create competition, 1000 will cause confrontation.
 
**David:**
That holds true no matter what era.You should fight your own battle.
 
**Mash:**
Please, wait.You knew about the 72 Demon Gods.
 
**Mash:**
Was that... Um, really a Demon God?The doctor claims they don't exist...
 
**David:**
Oh? Did I say as much?Why would you think so?
 
**Mash:**
...Well, naturally.You're King David of Israel.
 
**Mash:**
You are the father of King Solomon,who is said to have summoned the 72 Demon Gods.
 
**Fou:**
Fou!
 
**David:**
Hmm. It's true Solomon is my son...But summoning spells are beyond my capabilities.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...How utterly useless...
 
**David:**
Ah, how rude.But what about yourself?
 
**David:**
It seems you said that Demon God was no Demon God.On what grounds?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-Well, that's&mdash;That wasn't exactly my image of one, or...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ahahaha. Roman is a fan of King Solomon.I hear he's been an admirer for a long time?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, Leonardo!That was a secret! A secret!
 
**Da Vinci:**
That's why you don't accept the Demon Gods, isn't it?You don't want to believe your idol messed with such disgusting things.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ugh... Right, you're correct! The 72 Demon Gods signify both the beginning and the pinnacle of summoning spells!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They couldn't be foul creatures like that!I mean, he's King Solomon, you know!?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's the king who held the omnipotent Ten Rings, built the First Temple in Jerusalem, and made Israel prosperous!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
How could someone like that command such monsters, or even worse, plot... plot the destruction of humanity!?
 
**Da Vinci:**
There you go. As his father, what do you think, King David? Does King Solomon have a connection to that Demon God?
 
**David:**
Mm, Solomon would do things like that, you know?Basically, he's a cruel, vulgar good-for-nothing.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? How terrible!I can't believe anything anymore!
 
**David:**
Hahaha. My apologies. It's my fault for not having much to do with Solomon. I was never interested in child-rearing.
 
**David:**
But certainly&mdash;though he was a fool, he was honest.
 
**David:**
As for destroying human history, well...
 
**David:**
I don't think he'd consider it unless he was betrayed by all ten of his secret lovers?
 
**Mash:**
In its own way, that makes his image even worse.
 
**Fou:**
Fou.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just how bad is the public's image of King Solomon!?
 
**David:**
Well, I must be going. I leave the rest to you,but if anything happens, don't hesitate to call on me.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Right. So we still don't have any definite information about the Demon Gods yet.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But&mdash;King Solomon is involved,and that's the ugly truth...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor?
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh no, never mind.Now, Captain Francis Drake.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you very much. With so many special cases this time, I wasn't really much help.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lucky we had a dependable voyager like you on site.Thanks to that, history has been successfully corrected.
 
**Drake:**
Oh, it was nothing.I couldn't do much in the end.
 
**Drake:**
Ahhh... If I could become one of those Servants too,I'd be a little flashier.
 
**Drake:**
But I suppose that's an impossible request.A pirate like me could never be treated like a hero.
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not true.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're already a fine hero, Captain.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Really?Since that's coming from you, I'll believe half of it.
 
**Drake:**
So if history is corrected, will I really lose my memories of all of you?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's what happens.
 

---

 
**Drake:**
Hahaha. Well, you don't have to say a word.That look on your face says everything.
 
**Drake:**
I see.Guess I can't sail around the world with you folks. A pity.
 
**Drake:**
But that's fine.Our time together was short, but it was a merry journey.
 
**Drake:**
So go.For seafarers, parting is always abrupt.
 
**Drake:**
Blown up by a cannonball, washed away by a wave,and ultimately lose sight of our destination and die.
 
**Drake:**
That's why we take those fears&ndash;and always "brush them off" with a laugh.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, goodbye,Captain who navigates across the seas of freedom.
 
**Mash:**
...It's too bad. During this journey, I wanted to discover my wish and report it to you, Captain.
 
**Drake:**
Mm? What we talked about before?How you're troublesome because you have no wishes?
 
**Drake:**
It bothered you that much? Don't be silly.Or rather&mdash;
 
**Drake:**
You already have a wish, Mash.You know very well what you want to do.
 
**Mash:**
Huh?
 
**Mash:**
Captain Drake, what do you mean...
 
**Drake:**
Saying you have no wish is wrong.In the first place, nobody is without greed.
 
**Drake:**
All humans have some kind of wish.You can't live without one.
 
**Drake:**
The only difference is living while knowing what it is,or spending your whole life not realizing it.
 
**Drake:**
...Same with that Jason guy.Even he had a dream of "creating a utopia."
 
**Drake:**
His homeland banished him, and didn't save him.I don't know if he did all this to prove them wrong.
 
**Drake:**
Still,he wanted his nation to be a peaceful one.
 
**Drake:**
The man was obsessed with the desire to rule,and at the very end, he arrived at his true wish.
 
**Mash:**
...Yes.Jason's actions and behaviors were reprehensible.
 
**Mash:**
But&mdash;surprisingly, he was thinking of the people.Though selfish, he was trying to protect others.
 
**Drake:**
Aye. Sometimes sinners do saintly deeds, while saints sin. That's humans for you. That's us.
 
**Drake:**
That's why everyone's got a wish.
 
**Drake:**
It's just that some go their whole lives without realizing what their true wishes are.
 
**Mash:**
...Captain Drake.Which type am I?
 
**Drake:**
You... You're the type that's better off not realizing.You should stay just the way you are.
 
**Drake:**
I'm sure you'll know in the end.
 
**Drake:**
You'll realize what you want to do, and why you continue to raise that shield to defend others.
 
**Drake:**
I'm the opposite, I already know. The sooner you know,the uglier the punchline ends up being...
 
**Mash:**
...Captain Drake.Are you, um... From now on, your life...
 
**Drake:**
It's fine. You needn't state the obvious.I know how it ends for me. I die, right?
 
**Drake:**
Life is interesting once you know you're going to die.No, because you will die, you want to live in the moment.
 
**Drake:**
I'm not really a fiend for treasure.What I want is money, and pleasure.
 
**Drake:**
We're gonna die eventually! So I want to enjoy every single moment while I can.
 
**Drake:**
Thanks to you, I now know how vast the world is.It's a never-ending journey, even if I go all out.
 
**Drake:**
I'd be satisfied to take just a little of that,and blaze one of the many trails available.
 
**Drake:**
How blessed, how inconvenient, and how it would be just like what I wished an ending to be.
 
**Drake:**
So never mind.Don't worry yourself over my dying days.
 
**Drake:**
Farewell, Mash and Fujimaru.You too, cowardly scholar guy!
 
**Drake:**
The reward for saving an era... Let's see&mdash;
 
**Drake:**
When your journey ends, just remember how much fun you had with me! That'll be enough!
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Will do. Farewell, Captain!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Bon voyage!
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Welcome home.Good job, Fujimaru and Mash.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This makes three eliminated Singularities. Protecting human history... That mission is no longer just a pipe dream.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll look into that Demon God on my end.For the time being, I'll focus on King Solomon's era.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'll use Chaldeas and Sheba to observe the Earth of 1000 BC.
 
**Mash:**
...Are you sure?
 
**Mash:**
Sheba's range is the Christian Era.Go back further than that and you lose accuracy.
 
**Mash:**
Plus, it would require vast amounts of magical energy and electricity.Chaldea's current reserves aren't that&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
With my pride on the line, I'll take care of that somehow.As for magical energy, I might know someone who can help.
 
**Mash:**
Really? I thought chances for outside help were nonexistent?
 
**Fou:**
Fooou!
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Oh yeah, sorry. I had the wrong idea.I'll get by somehow with Da Vinci's stash.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, you two need to unwind. Next up is the fourth Singularity&mdash;the turnaround point.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
France, Rome, and the sea. Each time, the number of irregularities has been increasing.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe with the next Singularity,the real target will come.
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why I want you to rest up.We've got some time until the next Rayshift.
 
**Fou:**
Fooou!
 
**Mash:**
Good job, Senpai.You did your best too, Fou.
 
**Fou:**
Ky, kyuuuu!
 
**Mash:**
...By the way, Senpai.Did you want to sail around the world with Drake?
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A little.
 
**Mash:**
Me too.
 
**Mash:**
The captain was larger than life,but overflowed with charm.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go after this is over.
 
**Mash:**
After our battle is over?
 
**Mash:**
...Yes.Not a trip via Rayshift, but a journey in this era.
 
**Mash:**
I want to enjoy a world in which the future isn't decided yet, just like Captain Drake.
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. I think this recent search for the Holy Grail was the most special case so far.
 
**Mash:**
The process solely was to head somewhere.It was a battle on a seemingly endless sea.
 
**Mash:**
Along the way, I think I learned something.
 
**Mash:**
Good and bad people alike contribute to human history.Human diversity and contradictions. Expectations, too.
 
**Mash:**
...Humans are brutal creatures. They use wisdom and gain power for their own desires and objectives.
 
**Mash:**
That is a truly brutal trait. You could say that they are the most powerful and barbaric organisms on the planet.
 
**Mash:**
But there's hope in that brutality... The hope of realizing what couldn't be realized.
 
**Mash:**
The power not to let the impossible remain impossible.This power, this hope, she taught us that is what makes us human.
 
**Mash:**
...I don't know if I have such a power.But, I'd like to get as close as I can.
 
**Mash:**
So I can keep fighting by your side, Senpai.To become a Servant that you can be proud of someday.
 
**Mash:**
Now, then, Senpai, Fou, sweet dreams.We're on dry land for the first time in a long while.
 
**Mash:**
We don't have to worry about getting seasick anymore.Please have nice and long rest.
