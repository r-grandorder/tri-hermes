## Prelude
 
**Fou:**
Kyuuu! Kyau! 
 
**Mash:**
Good morning. Did you sleep well, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, like a log. 
 
**Mash:**
Glad to hear it. I'm happy to know that you got plenty of rest. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well enough. 
 
**Mash:**
Is that right? Senpai, you must rest as much as possible. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
As you can see, Fou is also fired up. I'm sure he's had more than enough sleep and breakfast. 
 
**Mash:**
We don't know what it'll be like beyond the Rayshift. No telling when or how much we can rest. 
 
**Mash:**
So as much as possible, please get enough sleep. 
 
**Mash:**
Staying up late is prohibited, since your magical energy is linked to your stamina. 
 
**Mash:**
And, umm&ndash;about that dream...
 
**Mash:**
Did you see something? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dream? Why? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No, not really...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
It's not like I saw anything special. It's just...
 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci says that Masters and Servants under contract see the same dream. 
 
**Mash:**
I don't know what that means...But if you didn't see one, then there's no problem. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's go to the command room after breakfast. The Doctor's eagerly waiting. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, good morning, everyone. Although by that, I mean just you two and...
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yawn! Oh, 'morning...The tech department is analyzing the Grail you've retrieved as we speak. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...That half-asleep genius, and myself. Please pardon the work crew for not being very reliable. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We're already set to Rayshift. This time you're headed to 1st Century Europe. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Specifically Ancient Rome, the great empire that grew from Italy to control the Mediterranean Sea. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Hm? Ancient Rome? Really? That sounds like fun! I sort of want to go, too! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You have analyzing to do, I believe. Please partake of Roman pleasures some other time. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, darn it. I don't care which one,but I always wanted to chat with a Roman Emperor. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Especially Emperor Caligula or Nero. I bet we'd have a lot in common. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, I feel the same...No, we can't. You also have work to do reviving Chaldea. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahem! Is that clear, Fujimaru. Your teleport point is the Imperial Capital Rome. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The name of the Roman Empire's capital is also Rome. It's geographically similar to the last time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The exact location of the supposedly existing Holy Grail is unknown. There may be historical changes as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Neither can be determined. Sorry, the observation precision seems unstable. 
 
**Mash:**
Not a problem. Either way, Senpai and I will locate it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, that's the spirit. You really are reliable. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Similar to the last mission, you'll reach and correct the singularity. Also, find the Grail, and either obtain or destroy it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Humanity's continuation is on your shoulders. I hope you're successful this time, too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And...That you come back safely. 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Yes. We'll make it back to Chaldea, I promise. 
 
**Mash:**
...I'm counting on you, Senpai. I'll need your strength for this mission. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave it to me. 
 
**Mash:**
Okay! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's rather your strength we need, Mash. 
 
**Mash:**
No, that's...The fact is, running this mission requires your judgment and leadership. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No doubt, Servants will be summoned during the 1st Century Rome as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If possible, call upon their power. Of course, you won't get help from hostile ones. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, I have one question. May I ask it? 
 
**Mash:**
Hostile Servants and neutral Servants. Is there a way to distinguish them upon detection? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It would be best if we had the ability to distinguish them from our observation data. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For example, the ability to see if approaching Servants are enemies or possible allies&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am sorry. Unfortunately, that's impossible right now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if we combine Sheba and Trismegistus, the best we can do is to detect lifeforms and energy readings. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The ability to distinguish hostility, that lies within the realm of psychology. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For now, you can't quantify that with numbers. I'm sorry, Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, we can speculate from the situation. I'll warn you if there's over 70% chance of hostility. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
As for non-Servant readings of local humans, I will try my best to detect them as well. 
 
**Mash:**
That's okay, Doctor. I'm sorry for asking too much of you. 
 
**Mash:**
I realize it was logically unreasonable. But, even so...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was to reduce the danger, right? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was it to avoid fighting? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Strategically speaking,it's best to avoid unnecessary battles. 
 
**Mash:**
But no, I knew it was an unreasonable request. Please forget it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, forgive me. I know I'm putting you in unreasonable danger...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To the best of my ability, I'll support and back you up. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can promise you that much at least. Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood! 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you.... Well, let's start the Rayshift. 
 
**Mash:**
...Dr. Roman. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Quit being so gloomy! I'll back you up mentally, as well! 
 
**Mash:**
No, that's...It's just the sudden shift in mood is a little...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Program start! 
 
**Announcement A:**
Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start. 
 
**Announcement A:**
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...
 
**Announcement A:**
All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation. 
 
## Section 1: Windy Hill 
 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Ahh. We've successfully teleported this time, Senpai. 
 
**Mash:**
The feel of the wind, the scent of earth&mdash;the vast blue sky. 
 
**Mash:**
...It's strange. I've seen it on film so many times,but just standing here, it's so much more vivid. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong? You're breathing deeply. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Was I? I-I see. I'm sure I was doing it without thinking. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So Rayshifting makes you nervous? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Rayshifting makes me nervous. But, I don't think my state of mind has anything to do with that. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...I mean, I feel overwhelmed. 
 
**Mash:**
In France, it was one shock after another. So now it's like I'm finally able to face this landscape. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou...Kyu, kyu? 
 
**Mash:**
Fou? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You tagged along again? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you just pop out of Mash's chest? 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Kyu! Kyau! 
 
**Mash:**
Looks like Fou will be tagging along again. He prefers the outside world to that cramped base. 
 
**Mash:**
I can agree with that sentiment. 
 
**Mash:**
Battles can be scary, but it makes me happy to discover new worlds like this. 
 
**Mash:**
...But "that" is visible in the sky in this era as well, isn't it? 
 
**Mash:**
That ring of light. It's the same as the one that was over France. 
 
**Mash:**
No, I mean it looks the same. Not that I've examined it precisely. 
 
**Mash:**
I wonder what it could be? It's such a huge&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ring of light, huh? As usual, we can't get a good look at it from here. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it is an intriguing phenomenon. I will continue to investigate. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way, is that...Oh? Weren't you suppose to be in...Rome? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Uh, we're in the hills. 
 
**Mash:**
You're right Senpai. We're in the hills. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wonder? 
 
**Mash:**
No Senpai, I don't believe this is the ancient Roman capital. We're in the hills. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's weird, I confirmed it from here as well. That's not the capital. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm sure that I fixed your teleport position...Uh, looks like that's a suburb of the Roman capital. 
 
**Mash:**
Was there an error in the coordinates? Is the era correct? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The era's correct. Definitely the 1st Century where the singularity exists. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
During the reign of Nero Claudius&ndash;fifth emperor of Rome. That's for certain. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Still, this is strange. Why are we so far from the capital? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Despite the poisoning of Empress Aggripina last year, Nero isn't in his dangerously declining years yet. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
An era where the emperor is loved, and the city of Rome is prosperous...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...that's what should've been awaiting you. 
 
**Mash:**
No Doctor, it's just rolling hills. All it needs is some sheep to complete it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There must be some reason for this. Do you see anything unusual in the surroundings? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou! 
 
**Mash:**
...I hear it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? 
 
**Mash:**
This is&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A battle somewhere? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you hear something? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I think it's the sound of a large battle. It seems to be coming from over the hill. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A large battle? A war, maybe? No, no, no. Impossible. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There were no full-scale wars near the Roman capital in that era. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That means&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
There's a historical anomaly. That must be it. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's get to that noise! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
That's...
 
**Mash:**
No doubt about it, they're in combat. One side is overwhelmingly larger than the other. 
 
**Mash:**
The larger force wears regalia of crimson and gold. The small wears the same, but a different design. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Crimson and gold were colors especially liked in Ancient Rome. Mash, anything else that's distinctive? 
 
**Mash:**
...A woman. Several groups of the smaller force are being led by a young woman. 
 
**Mash:**
She's practically taking on the enemy forces herself. The overwhelming avalanche towards the capital, all by herself. 
 
**Mash:**
An extremely strong individual. A Servant, perhaps. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I am not getting any readings on Servants. You don't sense it either, do you? 
 
**Mash:**
Correct. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then it's certain. That woman is a human of this era. 
 
**Mash:**
This is just personal speculation&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
But she reminds me a bit of Jeanne. I've no basis for it, though. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of Jeanne? The saint who rose to defend the sacred? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm, who of this era was like that...I can't think of one. My knowledge is lacking. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In any case, an impossible war is going on. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which means&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's help that woman. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We must stop the city from being overrun. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, I agree with your firm policy, Senpai. Even Fou's fired up. 
 
**Fou:**
Kyuu! Kyu kyu, kyu! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You aren't facing Servants or monsters,but they have great numbers. Be careful! 
 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**D：???:**
Sheathe your swords! It's over. You there! Are you reinforcements from the capital? 
 
**D：???:**
I thought the capital was sealed off...No matter, I commend you! 
 
**D：???:**
It doesn't matter if you were once my enemy. I am merciful, so past mistakes are water under the bridge. 
 
**D：???:**
More importantly, I praise the way you fought just now. For a girl to brandish a weapon larger than herself...
 
**D：???:**
Umu, I must say I like you! You showed such indescribable, aberrant beauty! 
 
**D：???:**
Very good, I shall allow you to fight by my side. Revel in the ultimate honor! 
 
**D：???:**
...Still, you people sure dress in a strange fashion. Aren't you showing a little too much? Are you foreigners? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We are beyond words for your generous praise. 
 
**D：???:**
Yes, yes. You may enjoy wallowing in the sweet sounds I utter. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're reinforcements, just passing by. 
 
**D：???:**
What perfect timing! Do you serve Boudica,perhaps? Her moves are beyond shrewd. 
 

---

 
**D：???:**
At any rate, this victory belongs to us. I will reward you handsomely! 
 
**D：???:**
Oh, uh, sorry.... I couldn't help myself just now. 
 
**D：???:**
You'll have to wait for your reward. Since I have nothing but this sword at the moment. 
 
**D：???:**
It will all be taken care of after we're back in Rome. Now then, follow me! 
 
## Section 2: All Roads Lead to Rome 
 
**D：???:**
By the way, you people. I don't doubt that you're foreigners, but where are you from? 
 
**D：???:**
Surely not...Britannia. The Far East...doesn't seem likely, either. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're from Chaldea. 
 
**D：???:**
Chaldea? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're from the future. 
 
**D：???:**
What? If that's true, we're going to have a problem. You have my sympathies, but did you fall down the stairs perhaps? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
That's enough small talk. We still have many enemies to deal with, the second wave is coming. 
 
**D：???:**
Damn those restless United Empire fools! How dare they interrupt my beautiful voice! 
 
**D：???:**
Let's go! You! Very striking-looking girl,I order you to serve as my shield! 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Uh, right! 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, now we're the ones under command somehow! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**D：???:**
...Somehow we're out of the danger. You ended up saving the day again. 
 
**D：???:**
I'm sure it's not uncommon to be outnumbered in war, but being on the inferior side is no fun. So tiring! 
 
**Mash:**
No, it's not over yet. I can sense more coming! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Servant, Mash, Fujimaru! I've detected a single Servant! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I'm sensing it. It's almost...there it is! 
 
**E：???:**
&ndash;My beloved younger sister's child. 
 
**D：???:**
Uncle! 
 
**D：???:**
No...No, no, let me call you this now. You fool who inexplicably lost his way, aligning with the United Empire! 
 
**D：???:**
..."Caligula! "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What did she just say? Uncle? Is that what she said? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'm sure that's what I heard. A human living in this era, and a blood relative&ndash;of a Servant? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's look into that later, Mash. No question about it, that's a Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, are you ready? This is our first Servant battle since coming to this era. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready when you are! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm still not used to this, but I have no choice. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
No need to worry, Senpai. No, Master. 
 
**Caligula:**
My&ndash;
 
**Caligula:**
My actions are destiny. 
 
**Caligula:**
Give up your, life. Give up that body. 
 
**Caligula:**
All of it 
 
**Caligula:**
Give it up! 
 
**D：???:**
Uncle, how could you? 
 
**Mash:**
Here he comes! It's a Servant Battle. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caligula:**
Oh...Oh. My beloved...younger sister's...child...
 
**Caligula:**
Why won't you...give it to me? Why can't you give it to me? 
 
**Caligula:**
My beautiful...My...My...My...My...
 
**D：???:**
H-He's gone? Uncle...
 
**Mash:**
I can no longer sense his presence. The enemy troops seem to be withdrawing as well. 
 
**D：???:**
...My uncle must've been the general of that battalion. I didn't think I'd ever see him again. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like he turned into a Spiritual Body and left. Or fled rather, good work. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Berserker class from the looks of him. If so, it's hard to believe that he'd flee...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Could it be that...He has a Master? 
 
**D：???:**
Hmm. Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Wh-What is it? 
 
**D：???:**
There's a man around here, who can be heard but not seen. From the feel of it, maybe a Mage? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am glad you know of magecraft. Yes, these two and myself are from an organization called Chaldea&ndash;
 
**D：???:**
That's all right. You two, no, three over there! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, you interrupted me...
 
**D：???:**
I'm not sure about the one with no body, but the two of you fought marvelously. I praise you again! 
 
**D：???:**
Before I ask your lineage, I'll offer my own. I am&ndash;
 
**D：???:**
The true protector of Rome. Truly, I am Rome itself. 
 
**D：???:**
I swear to rebuild the empire. Yes, this I swear to the gods, my ancestors, to myself, and to the people! 
 
**Nero:**
I am Nero Claudius,fifth emperor of the Roman Empire&ndash;! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Gasp)
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(I knew it. )
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Heh heh heh, are you surprised? You are surprised! 
 
**Nero:**
Of course, of course. Very good. Be as surprised and amazed as you like. I shall allow it. 
 
**Mash:**
...Emperor Nero. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Was...a girl...History...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is deep...
 
## Section 3: Eternal City 
 
**Nero:**
Take a good look and be struck with awe! This is my city, a glorious regime that even young girls extol! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It does seem incredibly vibrant! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everyone seems to be laughing! 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Yes, yes, didn't I tell you? After all, this is the greatest city in the world! 
 
**Nero:**
First, there was Septem Montes&ndash;Such words existed like so. 
 
**Nero:**
And that's where it all started. Our glorious history began with our divine ancestors and those hills. 
 
**Nero:**
And...Hey, shopkeeper, I'm taking one of these apples. 
 
**Shopkeeper:**
Welcome to my...Oh! Your Majesty! Please,take as you wish. Glory to the Emperor and Rome! 
 
**Nero:**
Shopkeeper, you don't have to be so stiff. Yes, yes, this is a delicious apple. 
 
**Nero:**
Why don't you take one too? We're returning from war,so no need to worry about bad manners. 
 
**Nero:**
Sweet fruit does wonders for battle fatigue. My wounds won't be healed, but my motivation will! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, no thank you. But I appreciate the gesture...
 
**Nero:**
Then how about that {(M) man /(F) woman} over there? They're delicious, don't be shy. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thank you. 
 
**Nero:**
Ah, that is a wonderful apple. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll eat it later. 
 
**Nero:**
Really? That's pretty modest of you. 
 
**Nero:**
Well, for me? I'm usually humble about things too, you know? 
 
**Nero:**
But I want to show off a little&mdash;ahem. A-Anyway. 
 
**Mash:**
(She's cute...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(How cute...)
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Umu. Once again, I like you. 
 
**Nero:**
Honestly, I'm unclear about what you speak of...But I can tell that you and that girl are honest people. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a relief to hear you say that, Emperor Nero. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It might be best to think of us simply as a mage and his pupils. 
 
**Nero:**
Is that so? Then let us forget this confusing talk of Masters and Servants. 
 
**Nero:**
You are the mage's pupils, and the mage speaks from a distant land. 
 
**Nero:**
And? You also said your goal&ndash;is to aid me? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. You aren't wrong about that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The center of the world, and the world itself. The name of the greatest empire that rules the world is Rome. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In this era, there should be no threat to the city. The Grail's influence must be upsetting events. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If I am right, this era's singularity is probably the existence of the great Roman Empire. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
An empire that greatly influenced later generations. Stopping its destruction would fix the singularity. 
 
**Nero:**
...Mm, Mm Mm...
 
**Nero:**
...S-Sorry, I don't quite understand. Please speak a bit more in my range of understanding. 
 
**Mash:**
Sorry, he can be a bit too theoretical...I'll explain. 
 
**Mash:**
We seek something called the Holy Grail, a magical item with special powers. 
 
**Mash:**
It's causing a great many disturbances just by being here. 
 
**Mash:**
The odds are great that the Grail is the problem eating away at Rome now. 
 
**Nero:**
...I see. This Holy Grail is damaging my Rome. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It must sound astounding to you...
 
**Nero:**
No, neither strange nor weird. This Holy Grail. It strangely...Worries me...
 
**Nero:**
Never mind, a needless concern of mine. It's just a nightmare I had once. 
 
**Nero:**
Right. Come with me,let's talk freely in my home. 
 
**Nero:**
...Wait, what? Is there something wrong at the market? 
 
**Shopkeeper:**
H-Hey! What's this! What are you people doing to my shop! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou!? 
 
**Nero:**
How dare you do this to my Rome, and my people! Are they enemy spies? Either way, it's unforgivable! 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, we should go too! The townsfolk are being attacked! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
&ndash;Now then. My Rome is currently endangered. 
 
**Nero:**
My great empire's territories are now, vexingly enough, ripped apart and scattered all over. 
 
**Nero:**
On one hand, there is the true Roman Empire that I rule over. The area centered around this capital, Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
On the other hand, there is an alliance controlled by multiple "emperors", that suddenly appeared out of nowhere. 
 
**Nero:**
The United Roman Empire. That's what they called themselves when they stole half of my empire. 
 
**Nero:**
The United Empire is still a mystery to us. No matter how many scouts we send out, none ever return. 
 
**Nero:**
Even the location of the capital where these fake emperors gather is unknown to us. 
 
**Mash:**
Multiple emperors, you say? 
 
**Nero:**
That's right. In my eyes, they're just a group of treacherous bandits.  
 
**Nero:**
And...
 
**Nero:**
...No, it's not worth mentioning. Just rebels spreading their vicious lies. 
 
**Nero:**
They call themselves emperors, but they're just pretenders. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You look troubled. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is something bothering you? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. 
 
**Nero:**
No, it's fine. You saw one of them before. 
 
**Nero:**
Caligula, the enemy general. The man who singlehandedly slaughtered my forces before you arrived. 
 
**Nero:**
He's one of the traitors who calls himself "emperor. "As well as being...
 
**Nero:**
...my uncle. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Shouldn't he be dead already? 
 
**Nero:**
Yes, dear formless mage. That is correct. 
 
**Nero:**
Even our Court Mage was killed by Uncle Caligula, but if he was still alive you might have gotten along well. 
 
**Nero:**
Our mage boasted that he had overcome death. In truth, he showed me some impressive spells. 
 
**Nero:**
But...He was killed by that one "emperor's" sword. 
 
**Nero:**
A master of spells who shouldn't have died, yet died easily.... It shouldn't be possible, yet, he did. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
To easily beat a mage of this era...That's no ordinary human. It's a Servant. 
 
**Mash:**
That must be causing the historical anomaly. One of the "emperors" got hold of the Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's highly likely that is the cause of this era's singularity. 
 
**Nero:**
Honestly, the United Empire is very strong. Violent battles are occurring all over and the people suffer. 
 
**Nero:**
I've dispatched all my serving viceroys and generals, and thrown nearly every troop at them. Yet the United Empire's power is undiminished. 
 
**Nero:**
Recently, an expeditionary force of theirs pressed in on the capital. They even managed to get inside. 
 
**Nero:**
I only had a few of my troops to defend us. 
 
**Nero:**
I hate to say it...But it showed me that this situation is beyond my ability to break by myself. 
 
**Nero:**
Therefore. I order you, no, I implore you! 
 
**Nero:**
Become my generals! Then Rome and I shall assist you in obtaining this Holy Grail! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Such a heaven-sent proposal. It seems we have a common cause. 
 
**Mash:**
That's right. What do you think, Senpai? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's cooperate. 
 
**Nero:**
Ah, I see! I see! That's a quick response! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do we get a salary? 
 
**Nero:**
Of course. As soon as the United Empire is beaten,I shall give you what you desire. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
I shall grant one of you the title of viceroy, as well as reward for the work you've already done. 
 
**Nero:**
Rest well tonight. I shall prepare quarters suitable for a viceroy for you. 
 
**Nero:**
Oh yes, will the invisible mage require them as well? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Don't worry about me. Supplying a room for those two will be enough. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
By the way Your Majesty, have you ever heard the name Lev Lainur? 
 
**Nero:**
...Lev? No I haven't, who is he? 
 
**Mash:**
A mage of our era. He betrayed Chaldea and all humanity. 
 
**Mash:**
There's a chance he's in this era. Although, I don't know if he's revealed himself or taken any action. 
 
**Nero:**
A mage from a foreign land? ...Hmm. 
 
**Nero:**
I've heard there is a powerful mage in the United Empire. It's only a rumor, but someone saw that mage on the front lines. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...It's possible. Your Majesty, I have a request. 
 
**Nero:**
Speak. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd like Mash and Fujimaru to be deployed as close to the front lines as possible. 
 
**Nero:**
I don't mind, but...Will Fujimaru be all right? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Lev Lainur is our enemy. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We owe him some payback. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Master. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The Director will be avenged. 
 
**Mash:**
...That's right. We can't let him go after the way he killed the Director. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Very well. Nero Claudius will honor your request. 
 
**Nero:**
I shall pray to the gods and divine ancestors of Rome that your enemy be defeated. 
 
**Nero:**
But first, how about a feast before you rest! 
 
**Nero:**
Not as grand as usual due to the war, but it will still be a feast where I spare no efforts. 
 
**Nero:**
Fujimaru, Mash, do you drink? We have something special imported from the Orient! 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, uh, no drinking for me thanks...
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Your Majesty! The eastern city gate is under attack by a mid-size United Empire force! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
I think they're remnants of that expeditionary force! Our eastern gate can't hold them back! 
 
**Nero:**
...Grr. Just as I was about to have a rare pleasant feast. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Go Mash, Fujimaru. Looks like your time has come. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It won't be unusual if another Servant shows up as an enemy general. Stay on guard! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood.... Senpai, shall we? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go, Mash! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes! 
 
**Nero:**
I'm counting on you Viceroy Fujimaru. Show those skills you demonstrated before! 
 
**Nero:**
The feast can wait! We'll look forward to it! 
 
**Mash:**
Enemy forces sighted. They're in battle formation. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're facing human forces, not Servants or monsters. Take it easy on them you two. 
 
**Mash:**
Got it. Master, your commands please. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The sun is setting, but it seems the attack isn't over yet. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm worried about the enemy's numbers. Keep an eye on Fujimaru's stamina and magical energy consumption. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes Doctor. Master, try not to exert yourself too much. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...It's getting dark, huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The enemy isn't letting up. As expected in the age of close combat, they all have incredible stamina! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Still, this is where you need to make your stand. Don't let your guard down, Fujimaru! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Whew. The enemy is retreating. 
 
**Mash:**
There didn't seem to be any Servants among them. They were all human soldiers. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No mages that could be Lev, huh? Anyway, good job. It's gotten really dark. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's head back, Senpai. If there's a night raid, we'll be in for another battle. 
 
**Mash:**
You should rest while you can. Didn't I tell you as much this morning? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, you did. 
 
**Mash:**
Okay. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not sleepy yet...
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha! Then I think I'll go back to my room and sleep. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have to check Magi☆Mari's blog too. She should've updated her diary by now...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doctor...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wh-Why are you looking at me like some sort of pitiful creature? What's wrong with internet idols? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're truly the ideal "idols," untainted by the hand of the media, TV networks, or even morals! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Isn't the outside world destroyed? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You've noticed a vital point. The outside world has definitely been destroyed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Which means Magi☆Mari and that HP will no longer be updated...Is that what you think? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fool! Magi☆Mari is a supreme idol who has transcended beyond this world's circumstances! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well actually, she's been recreated as an auto-generated AI from her original data. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Doctor, it's not my place to comment on the hobby of a 30-year old bachelor, but please do your job. 
 
**Mash:**
Otherwise, I'll be forced to delete that "secret" folder of yours. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
C-Come on now, it's a joke! I'm always checking your surroundings and finding data! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, get some rest you two. The Emperor's also waiting for your report. 
 
## Section 4: Burning Mountain 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good morning Your Majesty, I actually have an important favor to ask of you. 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, ask me anything! I am quite generous! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In order to stabilize our activities in this era, I'd like to go to Mount Etna. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A leyline crucial to our mission exists in that volcano. 
 
**Nero:**
Etna, huh? The Court Mage used to go to Etna a lot too. Hmm, but why? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We need to set a terminal point. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So we can bolster our troops. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
I see. I'm not sure I understand, but I'll grant you permission. 
 
**Nero:**
If you go to Etna, will it be for me and for the sake of my Rome? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Your Majesty. Of course. 
 
**Nero:**
Very well. While my investigation of the United Empire prevents me from going&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
You may do as you wish. Be prepared for enemy soldiers along the way. 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, foooou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...We arrived more easily than expected. Isn't this a vital region to the United Empire? 
 
**Mash:**
Wait Doctor, it looks like something's already swarming around the leyline! 
 
**Mash:**
That's&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ghost-type monsters? If it's naturally occurring, that's quite a leyline! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's eliminate them! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Secure the leyline! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Roger Master! Initiating combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
The battle is over. Now I'll create a terminal point&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Hm. Huh? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Da Vinci's not coming out. Oh, could it be that this time it's...
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He must be busy with Sheba's maintenance, so I guess he doesn't have the time. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou...
 
**Mash:**
I've completed the summoning circle. Now we can secure combat personnel even in this era. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Mash:**
Now then, let's return to Rome. Thank goodness there were fewer battles than I expected. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? No, wait, I am still detecting some magical energy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did it get drawn by the energy that was leaking before the circle was established? 
 
**???:**
...Oh...oh...oh! 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, the opponent is a non-physical type. Your battle commands! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;No sign of any nearby enemies. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This time we're safe for sure. Let's head down while keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Foooou! 
 
**Mash:**
United Roman Empire...They seem to have taken in Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
Who is the mastermind anyway? Is it Lev Lainur, or perhaps&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I still can't pick up anything, but if there's a Servant here it'd be hard to avoid combat. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Servants are being implemented in wars without hesitation. This is clearly unusual. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If you weren't here, the emperor would've been killed for sure. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Please do your best, I'll proceed with my analysis. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do your best, Doctor. 
 

---

 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Nero:**
Ah, you're back, Fujimaru. 
 
**Nero:**
I know you only just returned, but I'm thinking of launching an expedition to Gaul. 
 
**Nero:**
It's to aid and give encouragement to my fellow subordinates. Of course, if I don't go there's no point. 
 
**Nero:**
I'd like Fujimaru and Mash to join me. Well? Will you come? 
 
**Mash:**
...What should we do, Senpai? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The emperor's given me details of the situation. Gaul seems to be a front line in the war with the United Empire. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There's a chance that the Servant with the Grail could be rampaging there. Lev could be there too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think you should go with her. Naturally, it'll be dangerous, but&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It can't be helped. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll do our best and be careful. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Right Senpai, I agree. 
 
**Nero:**
It's decided! An imperial expedition! Prepare at once! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Yes, Your Majesty! 
 
## Section 5: Onward to Gaul 
 
**Nero:**
Fujimaru, you're not going on horseback? 
 
**Mash:**
I do have Riding Skill, but...Senpai isn't very used to horses. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, are you all right? You've been walking non-stop all this way, are you not tired? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This is nothing. 
 
**Mash:**
Don't tell me...Before coming to Chaldea,you were the outdoors type? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you all right Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
I'm fine. As a Demi-Servant I have incredible stamina. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You shouldn't try to keep up with Mash, Fujimaru. Demi-Servants have mind-blowing stamina. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You should've just gotten on that horse. Were you traumatized when you almost fell off? 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor. Try not to tease Senpai too much, please. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha! Well, it's no fun just providing intel support. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
&mdash;Hold! I am detecting life ahead. Not a Servant, but I think it's an enemy. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmmm. The invisible mage is quite convenient. 
 
**Nero:**
Faster than my scouts. If you may, please consider becoming my Court Mage. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gulp. Royal service...A promotion? 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, no, I was just kidding. How could I ever accept royal service? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway, here they come! Flanking from left and right! Prepare for immediate combat! 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, we'll get rid of them! Fujimaru, I'll leave the right side to you! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
You handled those veterans like they were nobodies. With such small numbers, too. 
 
**Nero:**
Was that thanks to Mash's skills? Or was it&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
Or was it Fujimaru's leadership? Either way, you're more intriguing than when we first met. 
 
**Nero:**
Listen...Rather than a guest commander, want to serve me? 
 
**Nero:**
You'll get to savor all the glory of this world by my side. I mean after we've defeated the United Empire, of course. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Nero:**
Well? Not a bad deal, is it? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
True...
 
**Nero:**
Isn't that right? Isn't that right? You're an honest soul. Heh, heh, I think I really like you now! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, we have a mission. You haven't forgotten, have you? 
 
**Mash:**
...You haven't forgotten, have you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Please let me think about it. 
 
**Nero:**
Can't answer right away even though you want to? How modest! Very well, think it over! 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Once we defeat the United Empire, I can even grant you Britannia, let alone Gaul. 
 
**Nero:**
You know of my generosity, but grand feasts like this have been rare. 
 
**Nero:**
Isn't that right, soldier? Do I not excel in splendor among past emperors? 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Yes, as you say. Today the brilliance that is Rome shines all the brighter! 
 
**Nero:**
Heh, heh, an honest fellow. Yes, yes,I believe that even I may shine a bit too brightly. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh? Mash is looking a little...
 
**Mash:**
What is it, Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, it's nothing. Nothing. Whoops! Another enemy attack! More regular soldiers, this time. 
 
**Nero:**
This mage is really quite useful. Go on then, crush them once more! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
Battle over. We've only sustained minor casualties. 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, good work! Aren't you exhausted? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work to you too. 
 
**Mash:**
R-Right...Thank you very much,but I'm more worried about our allies. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm a little tired. 
 
**Mash:**
You mustn't overdo it. Let's ask Nero if we can rest for a bit. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, we only have to endure this a little longer. We should be arriving soon. I can see it. 
 
**Nero:**
...How truly convenient! I'm going to want one in every country, mage. 
 
**Nero:**
Whoa, it's just like the mage said Fujimaru. We've entered the territory of Gaul. You must be tired from your long journey. 
 
**Nero:**
The Gaul expedition troop's camp is nearby. We can finally get a good long rest. 
 
## Section 6: Wild Camp 
 
**Nero:**
I am Emperor Nero Claudius! I shall allow you to listen carefully! 
 
**Nero:**
Soldiers of the Gaul expedition, I thank you for your efforts for me, my subjects, and my Rome! 
 
**Nero:**
I have now come to the expedition's aid. You now have a mighty general here with you! 
 
**Nero:**
There's no reason for us to lose this battle! &ndash;Victory belongs to me, and the Rome you all love! 
 
**Mash:**
Listen to the crowd. So this is how charismatic Emperor Nero was at her peak? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Probably, but it's also a mystery. She's so charismatic now, but in her later years...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No, never mind. I will stop there, never tell people living in the past about the future. That's our policy. 
 
**Fou:**
...Kyuu...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mm. This is...This reaction, Mash...right there&ndash;
 
**G：???:**
Well, Emperor Nero Claudius came earlier than I thought. 
 
**G：???:**
&ndash;You there. {(M) The boy who looks like a rookie. /(F) The girl who's doing her best. }Are you the guest commander I've heard so much about? I guess looks can be deceiving. 
 
**Boudica:**
Thank you for travelling so far. I'm Boudica, general of the Gaul expedition. 
 
**Mash:**
Boudica&ndash;? 
 
**Boudica:**
Yes Boudica, the "former" queen of Britannia, and this huge fellow here is...
 
**H：???:**
Another champion who was invited to the battlefield. You should be pleased, this garden of battle is full of oppressors. 
 
**H：???:**
The oppressors are committing atrocities as they approach. It is time to rise up. Let us battle side by side. You who dare defy this unparalleled tyranny. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Mash:**
...Right. His words baffle me, but I have a feeling...
 
**Boudica:**
H-Huh? Whoa, that's extremely rare. Spartacus hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight. 
 
**Boudica:**
Let me correct myself. He hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight, without then pouncing on them. 
 
**Mash:**
(...Doctor, this giant over here is. )
 
**Fou:**
(Fouuuuuu...)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Y-Yes, he's definitely a muscle. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I mean a Servant. That's what the reading says. Definitely a Servant. Let's leave it at that. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(He doesn't seem to have hostile intentions. )
 
**Mash:**
(I can't translate what he's saying. He's looking at us, but what does he mean by "You who defy tyranny"&ndash;? )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(My guess is he's a Berserker. Yes, he must be...Maybe...)
 
**Spartacus:**
Warrior of the rebellion, give me your name. Let us revolt together against the inhumane empire and shout in triumph under a free sky. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
My name is Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
Did he ask for your name just now? Is that what it was? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't know what he's saying. 
 
**Mash:**
Neither do I...He's got this extremely carefree smile, but that's all I'm getting...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? He's smiling while saying all that? His Madness Enhancement must be incredible.  
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That being said, I suppose this proves that even in this era, stray Servants do exist. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
For some reason, unlike hostile Servants, there are also those who have free will, stand by their era, and fight. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It has been confirmed in two eras. I am sure it will be the case for all the singularities. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If we count Fuyuki, this makes the third time&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At any rate, this is encouraging. This way we know we'll have allies even without summoning. 
 
**Boudica:**
Ummmm, are you the Invisible Mage? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh excuse me, let me introduce myself. I am Roman, and...
 
**Mash:**
I am Mash Kyrielight,this is Fujimaru...The viceroy. 
 
**Boudica:**
I've heard your names before, news of you travels even out here. They are the honored guests, aren't they, Your Majesty.  
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Your Majesty? 
 
**Nero:**
...Mm. D-Did you say something? It seems I am a little tired. Boudica, take care of our guests. 
 
**Nero:**
Tell them about the situation here in Gaul. I have a terrible headache. I'm going to lie down for a bit. 
 
**Boudica:**
Understood. Leave these youngsters to me. 
 
**Nero:**
Yes, I'm counting on you. Fujimaru,you must be exhausted, too. You should get some rest. 
 
**Boudica:**
...
 
**Roman Soldier:**
I bring news! An enemy scouting party has been discovered! 
 
**Boudica:**
...Can we pursue them? 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
We can't catch up to the enemy soldiers' speed! At this rate, it's possible they'll get away! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, you're right. A group of them are leaving the camp and making off with intel on us! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I think we should strike,Mash and Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood, Doctor. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Sometime we can't let them go. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right. Let's go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;So that's the story. I think we'll be in your care for a while. 
 
**Boudica:**
Oh? From a foreign world? I see, I guess such things can really happen. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you for your understanding. Boudica, was it? You're a Servant too, right? 
 
**Mash:**
...Doctor. 
 
**Boudica:**
It's all right, you don't have to hold your tongue. Yes, I "should be dead" already. 
 
**Boudica:**
I see you find that strange. How did Queen Boudica become a Roman general, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. In the history that I'm aware of, you&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
Yes, that's right. 
 
**Boudica:**
I'll never forgive Emperor Nero or Rome. I even swore it to the Celtic gods. 
 
**Boudica:**
...And then I materialized. To this era right after my death, of all things. 
 
**Boudica:**
I thought maybe it was my chance for revenge,but when I saw Rome overrun by the United Empire...
 
**Boudica:**
My body moved on its own. Not for Nero's sake, but for the people who live there. 
 
**Boudica:**
...Or did I feel guilty towards the Londinium fellows, whom I brutally murdered for the sake of my vengeance. 
 
**Boudica:**
I don't really know myself. But when I think about it, I've always been like that. 
 
**Boudica:**
I think fighting to protect something is just my personality. That's what seems most natural to me. 
 
**Boudica:**
So my apologies to Nero, who wrongly sees me as a "worthy living opponent," but...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you keeping your Servant status a secret? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you keeping your death a secret? 
 

---

 
**Boudica:**
Yes, because somehow she's more dangerous than before. If she becomes overly concerned about me, who knows what she would do. 
 
**Mash:**
...Understood. You're a proper Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Mash:**
A hero whom others aspire to be. The symbol of strength used to suppress villainy and save others. 
 
**Boudica:**
Nyahaha, I was just doing it on a whim...Although if that's how I look to you, who am I to disagree? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
There aren't many Heroic Spirits who could put it like that. Queen Boudica, your pride is dazzling. 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. Um, are you keeping up with the conversation? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't really get it...
 
**Mash:**
I didn't think so. Sorry, I'll explain. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes, it's okay. I understand. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. Ms. Boudica is, um...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...She's a Heroic Spirit, a Servant. She was killed by Nero's army just before this era. 
 
**Mash:**
She was the Queen of Britannia, which was overrun by Rome. Now she stands with Nero. 
 
**Mash:**
I do have a question, though. I mean, why&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
It's not that difficult. I dislike the United Empire more than Nero. 
 
**Boudica:**
You feel the same way, don't you Spartacus? You intend to fight a legion of oppressors. 
 
**Boudica:**
It's dangerous to say this, but she isn't the enemy. You don't consider yourself to be Nero's ally, do you? 
 
**Spartacus:**
Hahaha, the walls of the colosseum have fallen. Soon, all of this land shall become my colosseum. 
 
**Boudica:**
You see? 
 
**Mash:**
(I don't. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(I wonder if she possesses a special skill. Like Madness Comprehension...or something? )
 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway. Both of them are Heroic Spirits and Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
Just like in Orleans, right? In a singularity, multiple Servants will materialize. 
 
**Mash:**
But not all of them are enemies. Some have wills of their own and stand on the side of justice. 
 
**Boudica:**
You're embarrassing me. I'm not all that. 
 
**Spartacus:**
Hahaha! Behold, this muscular body is proof of the uprising. The oppressors shall know any injuries inflicted are my strength. 
 
**Boudica:**
There, you see? Spartacus is embarrassed, too. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai, did you understand what he said? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I got the gist. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? R-Really?

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not one bit! 
 
**Mash:**
I-I didn't think so. I didn't catch any of it either...
 

---

 
**Boudica:**
&ndash;All right, shall we get started then? 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me? 
 
**Boudica:**
I don't doubt your skills, but...Ah, actually, maybe I do. 
 
**Boudica:**
Right now, the United Empire controls most of Gaul. Not even we can drive them out. 
 
**Boudica:**
The ruler of Gaul&ndash;One of the "emperors," is strong. 
 
**Boudica:**
There's nothing excessive about him, body or mind. He's a top-notch hero in both looks and skills. 
 
**Boudica:**
Do you have the strength to fight him head-on? Or should I use you as back-up? 
 
**Boudica:**
My apologies, but could I put your abilities to the test? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? I thought you were a rational queen, but it turns out you're a hero who "speaks" with her sword! 
 
**Boudica:**
Ahaha, now you've got the idea. So, shall we? 
 
**Boudica:**
Just try not to die. When we're done,I'll whip up something delicious for you. 
 
**Boudica:**
Of course I mean Britannia cuisine, not Roman. &ndash;So, let's meet face to face and cross swords! 
 
**Boudica:**
My True Name is Boudica, class Rider! Be careful, because my chariot is extremely strong! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Boudica:**
Ah.... I must say, I am happy to be proven wrong about you. 
 
**Boudica:**
You showed me how competent you are. Thanks,I know you must be exhausted from your travels. 
 
**Boudica:**
My defense and Spartacus's offense matches pretty well. You held your own against us, I underestimated you! 
 
**Boudica:**
As for you...Mash? You're a shield-wielding Heroic Spirit, right? I really like you. 
 
**Boudica:**
I know it's twisted to have a weapon solely for defense, but it's far better than one solely for killing. 
 
**Boudica:**
I mean, how can you be so reliable when you're so slim? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Mash:**
R-Reliable? 
 
**Boudica:**
Yes, when you wielded your shield and stood your ground...It was like you'd taken root. 
 
**Boudica:**
If Lord Nero is the violence of fire, then you're the riches of the earth. I think you'd be compatible with any Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. 
 
**Boudica:**
Yes, good answer. Indeed, indeed. 
 
**Boudica:**
Hmm...
 
**Boudica:**
Hmm, hmm. (staring)
 
**Boudica:**
Hmm, hmm, hmm. (staring)
 
**Mash:**
E-Excuse me? 
 
**Boudica:**
Now that I look at you carefully, yes, I see. So that's what it is. If that's the case, you should have just told me! 
 
**Mash:**
Excuse me? 
 
**Boudica:**
Things are getting complicated, aren't they? Even we...Ah, I just noticed. How adorable! 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Boudica:**
Come here. Come on. There, there. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah&ndash;W-What is it, Boudica? Augh...What's with you all of a sudden...
 
**Boudica:**
You're like a little sister to me. Maybe both of you are. There, there. 
 
**Boudica:**
I'm so proud of you, coming from a faraway time period. You're so strong. There, there. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's like an aunt...or big sister. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Boudica's chest is mashing Mash...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
U-Um, y-your chest...I can't breathe...
 
**Boudica:**
Mmm, good girl, good girl! 
 
**Boudica:**
You called yourself Nero's ally so I was on my guard for a bit, sorry! 
 
**Boudica:**
But now I'm in a great mood! All right, tonight I'll make you something wonderful to eat! 
 
**Boudica:**
Your big sister here is really good at cooking Britannia cuisine. You'll eat it, won't you? 
 
**Mash:**
T-Thank you...Senpai, how about you? Are you hungry? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Famished. 
 
**Mash:**
I know, right? Actually, me too. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm just completely exhausted. 
 
**Mash:**
Ah...I-I know, right? I'm exhausted from traveling, too. I'm sorry! 
 

---

 
**Boudica:**
Yes, yes! Eat, eat, and then go to sleep! That's the key to having plenty of energy! 
 
**Boudica:**
Even if you don't like it, I'll force you to eat! Then after dinner&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
Of course, we should take a bath! I'll even wash your back. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Boudica:**
I hate to admit this, but Roman baths are the best in the world. It goes to show that even Nero can be useful. 
 
**Boudica:**
It feels amazing. Even Spartacus calms down when he's immersed in hot water. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
U-Um...I think you can let go of me now...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Berserkers calm down when they're immersed in hot water...This is a discovery Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
No, it's not. 
 
**Mash:**
No...
 
## Section 7: Take Back Gaul! 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
I have a report, Your Majesty. Enemy attacks are intensifying&ndash;and we have a message from the front. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
A small unit led by the pretender, Emperor Nero, is advancing with incredible force. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
It's as you said, Your Majesty. There's a "special" enemy leader among them. 
 
**Caesar:**
I see. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
Yes, sir. 
 
**Caesar:**
Hmm. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
Sir, how should we proceed? 
 
**Caesar:**
Do nothing. Forget about them. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
What? 
 
**Caesar:**
Only a Servant can stand up to another Servant. Seriously, it's such a pain. 
 
**Caesar:**
It's laughable to think that the fickle gods would come this far. I mean, look at me&ndash;
 
**Caesar:**
A "Saber" class, huh? To think they would make me take up my sword. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
D-Do you mean...Emperor Caesar, are you going into battle yourself? 
 
**Caesar:**
Fool. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
Sir! 
 
**Caesar:**
I am not going into battle. They are coming to me. 
 
**Caesar:**
I'm not moving. The rest of you better not meddle with them, either. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
B-But, Your Majesty! We are soldiers of the true United Roman Empire! 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
If our rule over Gaul is the will of the gods, then we must not retreat! 
 
**Caesar:**
Fool! Are you in a hurry to die? Humans cannot defeat a Servant. They would be slaughtered. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
B-But...
 
**Caesar:**
Then let it be an order. Fight in moderation, I do not desire your deaths. 
 
**United Empire Soldier:**
...Yes, sir! With everything I have. 
 
**Caesar:**
That being said, I'm sure you are going to die for the sake of the Rome that you believe in. 
 
**Caesar:**
Honestly...I've had it with "that one's" whims. 
 
**Caesar:**
Perfect government. Perfect leadership. But then you're left with a colony of people without a will. 
 
**Boudica:**
Spartacus and I will lead the charge! Both of you,go with Nero to take the enemy's main camp. 
 
**Spartacus:**
Hahahahaha. Wonderful. Everything is here. Hundreds, thousands of oppressor's evil agents are here. 
 
**Spartacus:**
Now is the time to sing of our victory. We're not at a disadvantage, we have the upper hand. From now on, my warcry shall signify the beginning of our triumph. 
 
**Boudica:**
Not over there, here! Oh, come on Spartacus! 
 
**Spartacus:**
Hahahahaha. The queen of the rebellion is my ally. That is to say, victory is at hand. The powerful will be defeated! 
 
**Nero:**
...Umu, I'm counting on you, Boudica. In a number of ways, I'm counting on you. 
 
**Nero:**
Still, Spartacus isn't wrong! The time has come to defeat one of the "emperors. "
 
**Nero:**
Let us take Gaul back from the false emperor! Come, Mash and Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Right. Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hold nothing back! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's be careful out there! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! Order understood! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...What was that enemy just now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No question, it's a magical creature. Is this the work of an enemy Servant or mage? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or was it Lev Lainur&ndash;? 
 
**Nero:**
Stop daydreaming! We're charging into the enemy's main camp! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am getting a reading on non-human, non-Servant entity. Fujimaru, more golems are coming! 
 
**Mash:**
I will crush them. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caesar:**
...So you're here. 
 
**Caesar:**
I'm tired of waiting. How long do you intend to keep me waiting.  
 
**Caesar:**
Still though, it looks like it was worth a little boredom! 
 
**Caesar:**
That beauty of yours&ndash;
 
**Caesar:**
So beautiful. Beautiful. Truly beautiful, your beauty is fitting for the world's greatest treasure - Rome! 
 
**Caesar:**
Heir to our beloved Rome. What did you say your name was? 
 
**Nero:**
&mdash;
 
**Caesar:**
Don't fall silent. Even if it's on the battlefield, be eloquent. 
 
**Caesar:**
Or do you intend to fight without giving me your name? Is that the way of the current Roman emperor? 
 
**Caesar:**
Now then, speak. Who is the one who would force me to take up arms, what is your name? 
 
**Nero:**
&ndash;Nero. I am the fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire. 
 
**Nero:**
My name is Nero Claudius. I will take you out pretender to the throne! 
 
**Caesar:**
I like how you announced yourself. Otherwise it would all be so dull. 
 
**Caesar:**
You, guest commander! Thank you for coming from a distant land. Tell me your names as well. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am Fujimaru. 
 
**Mash:**
Mash Kyrielight. I'm Master Fujimaru's Servant. 
 
**Caesar:**
I've never heard of those names. All roads lead to Rome, eh? I see that I was arrogant. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Um, you're kind of plump, aren't you? 
 
**Caesar:**
Of course, Rome is the pinnacle of civilization and that begins with gourmet food. Plumpness is power. 
 
**Caesar:**
Take the fifth Emperor here, she's plump in all the right places. Although inferior to my woman, the Queen of Desert, but that's fine. 
 
**Nero:**
...Mmm, as befits the mystery man who subdued Gaul...You soften a woman's heart as naturally as you breathe...
 
**Nero:**
But I am not a woman like my mother. I am an emperor and a young maiden! 
 
**Nero:**
Oddly rotund man, your words fail to strike a chord in my heart! 
 
**Caesar:**
Is that so...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um, can we get down to business? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I want to ask you something. About the United Empire, and the Holy Grail. 
 
**Caesar:**
Oh? Then, um, the what's-your-name over there...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's Fujimaru. 
 

---

 
**Caesar:**
So you're the "Master," huh? I see, so this is Master and Servant. 
 
**Caesar:**
You seem very different from the one I know. Or are you the proper one? 
 
**Caesar:**
In any case, I suppose you're my enemy. It's a pain, but so be it. 
 
**Caesar:**
Let me reward you for coming all this way. I will let you witness the power of my golden sword, Crocea Mors. 
 
**Nero:**
Don't say that! Gold is my color! Mine! The one who built the Golden Theater! 
 
**Caesar:**
Haha, that's the spirit. Protect her well, Demi-Servant. 
 
**Caesar:**
Fight well and perhaps I will tell you where to find the Holy Grail that you seek. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Caesar:**
Now then&ndash;Come forth. The die has already been cast. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caesar:**
Hmm, you certainly are strong. No&ndash;
 
**Caesar:**
Who would even place a fine general like me on the front lines in the first place. Can't call this "best man for the job. "
 
**Mash:**
Wielding such a devastating sword...How can you even say that...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Just what you'd expect of a Saber Class...He's truly a skilled Servant. 
 
**Nero:**
Such a monster...Ugh, and I thought he was just a fake emperor...
 
**Caesar:**
No, you're wrong about that Nero Claudius. I'm still the emperor, though no such title existed in my time. 
 
**Caesar:**
In response to your beauty and courage, I shall tell you my name. I am Caesar. In other words...
 
**Caesar:**
Gaius Julius Caesar. 
 
**Nero:**
Wh-What? That's...the name of the ruler who preceded our first emperor...
 
**Nero:**
But...You're dead...How can this be? 
 
**Caesar:**
You've already met Caligula, I presume? Then you should already know. 
 
**Caesar:**
We're "genuine. "Both myself...and him. 
 
**Nero:**
...Ugh. 
 
**Caesar:**
Try to relax. You are beautiful, truly beautiful. Your beauty can match any other treasure in the world. 
 
**Caesar:**
You, Demi-Servant, you too are beautiful. Very nice indeed. Nice body, too. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Caesar:**
I admire your courage, strength, and beauty. Therefore, I shall tell you one thing. 
 
**Caesar:**
The Holy Grail is located in a castle within the United Empire's capital. More precisely, in the hands of our Court Mage. 
 
**Mash:**
Mage&ndash;Can you tell us the name of that person? 
 
**Caesar:**
I can't. Your reward ends here for I have no reason to tell you more. 
 
**Caesar:**
Now, Emperor Nero, your hardship is not something I wish for. 
 
**Caesar:**
But I have my own reasons to fight. I want that Holy Grail for myself as well. 
 
**Caesar:**
They say once a Servant has obtained the Holy Grail, they can get any wish granted&ndash;
 
**Caesar:**
This is rather greedy as I am already dead, but I must fulfill the promise that I made. 
 
**Caesar:**
...Well then. It's time for me to be serious. 
 
**Caesar:**
It's been a while, so I needed exercise. The poor golden sword also needs occasional use. 
 
**Nero:**
"Serious? "
 
**Mash:**
This presence&ndash;Please be careful, Master! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
His magical energy level is rising? No, he's unleashing what he's been holding back! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I guess our opponent has gotten serious! Or rather, he didn't fight seriously until now! 
 
**Caesar:**
I came, I saw. Now, I must conquer! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
Mm, mmm...Did we...get him? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, I can detect his readings are getting weaker. You've won. Congratulations. 
 
**Mash:**
Your sword was very powerful, but as long as I have Senpai's instructions I can block it. 
 
**Caesar:**
Hmm, being taken out by beautiful women isn't so bad. 
 
**Caesar:**
It's not feasible for me to act like a mere soldier anyway. Seriously, I was helpless against that person's weirdness. 
 
**Nero:**
That person&ndash;? 
 
**Caesar:**
That's right, the true emperor of this era. That person is surely waiting for your arrival in the capital. 
 
**Caesar:**
I'm not an emperor to be exact, but none of the past "emperors" can stand up against that person. 
 
**Caesar:**
When you see that person's name and face,I wonder how you'll react? I can't wait. 
 
**Caesar:**
I am not being sarcastic. You are beautiful,no matter what expression you may have&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
He's gone...
 
**Nero:**
What's this...Is this some sort of magecraft...or...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's a Servant death. 
 
**Nero:**
What did you...
 
**Mash:**
Like Senpai said, that Servant has lost his life. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's left this world. 
 
**Nero:**
What did you...
 
**Mash:**
Like Senpai said, that Servant is gone from this world. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
A Servant disappears when facing death. Their temporary body dissipates, and their experience is sent back to the Throne. 
 
**Nero:**
I don't quite understand...What that bastard, no, "that man" said earlier. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He is a Servant. A deceased human transcended into a different form. 
 
**Nero:**
...I see. 
 
**Nero:**
I made you personally kill the once great ruler Caesar. 
 
**Mash:**
Nero&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
No, nothing. Umu! I commend you for defeating one of the "emperors. "
 
**Nero:**
Now Gaul is truly under my command. We have shown the United Empire what we can do! 
 
**Nero:**
Just as I wished, just as my people wished, the Rome blessed by our ancestors and gods is returning to us! 
 
**Nero:**
I will bring Rome back into my hands! Until then&ndash;Until then, no matter what, I cannot afford to stop here. 
 
**E：???:**
...So Caesar was defeated. 
 
**Lev:**
Yes, it seems that way. I only used him because he had a wish for the Grail. 
 
**Lev:**
This shouldn't cause many issues. I can summon as many new Servants as I want. 
 
**Lev:**
If there's an issue, it's this foolish Berserker. Isn't it obvious that Berserkers are fools? 
 
**Lev:**
I was surprised he would defy my orders. Is blood thicker than water? What a joke. 
 
**Caligula:**
For my destiny...My beloved niece Nero...is irrelevant...
 
**Caligula:**
Beautiful child...Nero, you will be loved, loved, so loved...
 
**Caligula:**
Therefore...In my destiny...
 
**Lev:**
Hmph, I regret not having a Command Spell. However, I have quite the spell ready for you. 
 
**Lev:**
You will kill your niece with your own hands. Then,drowned in regret, you will destroy everything else in this era. 
 
**Lev:**
That said&mdash;You likely don't have enough intellect left to regret. 
 
**Lev:**
My, my, Servants truly are inconvenient beings. 
 
**Lev:**
No matter how legendary you are, or how much superhuman strength you possess, in the end you are just mere familiars. 
 
**Lev:**
With the power to change the world at will, yet that freedom is not allowed. Talk about irony. 
 
**Lev:**
Say, wouldn't you agree? 
 
**E：???:**
...Well then. 
 
**Lev:**
Oh, excuse me. Come to think it, you are a Servant too. 
 
**Lev:**
&mdash;Heh, that's why you must obey me. If anything called destiny exists for you, I am it. 
 
**Lev:**
The utter annihilation of this era. The death of Emperor Nero, the collapse of ancient Rome, the death of humanity.  
 
**Lev:**
That&ndash;is my duty, bestowed upon me by our king. 
 
**E：???:**
...Yes. 
 
**Lev:**
Then, it is time to replenish our lost personnel. The summoning ritual is almost finished. 
 
**Lev:**
This is different than the incomplete one in Chaldea. I can truly summon Servants at will. 
 
**Lev:**
We were created as such. With this summoning ritual,I stand at the end of this world. 
 
**Leonidas:**
...Servant, Lancer. True Name, Leonidas. I will serve you from here on. 
 
**Lev:**
Oh, a Heroic Spirit from Thermopylae. Not bad. Use your full powers to eliminate Nero Claudius&ndash;
 
## Section 8: The Trip Back Home 
 
**Nero:**
...Hmm. 
 
**Nero:**
Did you hear what that farmer said just now? The traveler we passed yesterday said the same thing. 
 
**Nero:**
That "an ancient god has appeared. "Could it be true? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wonder. It's an interesting phrase. If he said"ancient god," could it be from the Age of the Gods. 
 
**Mash:**
To be precise, it's the fourth time we've heard it. None of them seemed to be lying. 
 
**Mash:**
"An ancient god appeared on an island in the Mediterranean. " For a rumor, it's very specific. 
 
**Nero:**
Well, Gaul faces the Mediterranean. It's not unusual to hear such rumors...
 
**Nero:**
But after hearing it over and over, I'm intrigued. Though we're on our way back to Rome now. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, it is intriguing, huh? I mean, I'm extremely intrigued. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru, what do you think? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It may have to do with the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
Well...I don't know about that. Caesar said their Court Mage has possession of it. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We can't tell if it's Lev Lainur or not,but is it possible that he moved to the Mediterranean? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And is claiming to be a god. It's a likely story. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, well, he could be a real god. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think we might've misheard. 
 
**Mash:**
No, we've heard it multiple times for sure. Senpai, have you forgotten? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An island where a god lives, huh. Ah, that sounds so romantic! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
An ancient god in the 1st Century! The supposedly gone Divine Spirits returned to the land once more! 
 
**Mash:**
Question Doctor, is materialization of Divine Spirits really possible? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's difficult. So much so that it's nigh impossible. At least, it's not possible with Chaldea's system. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Divine Spirit? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, a Divine Spirit. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Divine Spirit, not Heroic Spirit? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It is different than a Heroic Spirit. It is said to be a higher being than elementals. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Divine beings are mentioned in many legends of this world. Sometimes as a natural phenomenon, or symbols of authority. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They are what you may call God, or gods. Just think of Divine Spirits as a term to define them. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're already gone from the face of the Earth. Perhaps they never existed in the first place? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's hard to understand with magecraft developed after Anno Domini. After all, we can't observe them in our time. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
When you pray to the gods in times of trouble, they don't give help that easily do they? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Maybe that was a bad example. In any case, they "do not exist. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, several pieces of supporting evidence exist. Hence we predict Divine Spirits exist in a higher dimension. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
At the very least, they won't do anything directly. No, they can't do anything. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyways, it's impossible. The world has long been that of humans and civilization. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if there was a kind god, realistically they wouldn't be able to regain a lost future. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We're the only ones who can possibly save the world and its future. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, let's get back to an earlier topic. Whether or not a Divine Spirit can materialize as a Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They can't. That's the answer. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if "they" were inclined to do so. Even if technology reached realms of True Magic, it's disadvantageous. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In theory, it should not necessarily be impossible though. 
 
**Mash:**
Then, the god of the Mediterranean&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's probably not a god from somewhere. Probability of a materialized Divine Spirit is quite low. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But, there might be that one in a million chance if it's a god that fell from its throne. 
 
**Nero:**
This is pointless. Umu, if it's on our minds so much, fine! 
 
**Nero:**
It would be a good idea to verify. Fortunately, we're facing the Mediterranean Sea. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Your Majesty! Rear ranks are being assaulted by an unknown monster! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
We can't hold it down! At this rate...
 
**Nero:**
...Mm, perfect timing. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I am detecting traces of magical energy. It could be the Holy Grail that's causing the monster to spawn. 
 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Senpai! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's quickly deal with it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Be careful, but be quick. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master. Commencing battle! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;The battle has ended. There are no reinforcements. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahh, how awful. To think that spirits of the dead would materialize on their own. 
 
**Nero:**
I'm used to it. So, uh, what were we talking about&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
Right, that Mediterranean god! Personally, I'd really like to find out about that. 
 
**Mash:**
Are you sure? Don't you need to return to Rome? 
 
**Nero:**
I don't know what this ancient god may be, but what if it's truly one of the gods? 
 
**Nero:**
It's not impossible, right? There are Roman legends. 
 
**Nero:**
For instance, Romulus the founder and first king of Rome became the newest god after he disappeared in lightning. 
 
**Nero:**
Things like that occasionally happen. Ancient gods. How amusing. 
 
**Nero:**
Further, assume they are gods of Rome. If the United Empire's "emperors" took that god away, we'd have bigger problems. 
 
**Nero:**
I don't want that. That's the one thing I absolutely cannot stand. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see, Your Majesty's words are reasonable. As guest commanders, we'd be happy to accompany you. 
 
**Mash:**
...Aren't you enjoying this too much, Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's not true! I just can't hide my overflowing curiosity as a researcher! 
 
**Mash:**
But that's...
 
**Fou:**
Fu...Kyu, kyu. Fou. 
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Mash:**
Come on Nero, say something...
 
**Mash:**
Nero? Are you all right? 
 
**Nero:**
...Hmm, what? No, I've decided. A triumphant return from the sea might not be so bad! 
 
**Nero:**
Then, we'll continue our journey back through the sea. I'm rather tired of traveling on land! 
 
**Mash:**
(She spaced out just now. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Right. This must be what Boudica was talking about. )
 
**Boudica:**
There's something I'm worried about. Something about Nero. 
 
**Boudica:**
It happened right after you got here. I wonder if you noticed. 
 
**Boudica:**
She occasionally spaces out. She been like that ever since the United Empire showed up. 
 
**Boudica:**
I think it might be just me, but when it happens,I feel a slight trace of magical energy. 
 
**Boudica:**
...She's a human from this era, not a mage. Still, I definitely feel it. 
 
**Boudica:**
I asked her about it, but she doesn't feel it at all. 
 
**Boudica:**
Can you guys keep an eye out? I mean, about her. 
 
**Boudica:**
As the governors of Gaul, Spartacus and I must to continue protecting this place. 
 
**Boudica:**
About her...If possible, I'd like to rely on you all. 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. You are...worried about Nero aren't you. 
 
**Boudica:**
I wouldn't worry about her at all! ...It's not something I want to do personally. 
 
**Boudica:**
For better or for worse, she's the symbol of this land. If something happens to her, it would be a war lost. 
 
**Boudica:**
I don't want to lose another war. That's the only reason I care about her. 
 
**Mash:**
...Right. 
 
**Boudica:**
Well then, that's that. Mash, we still have time, right? 
 
**Mash:**
U-Um&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
Before you leave, I will teach you the best of Britannia cuisine! 
 
**Boudica:**
I'd be happy if you learned it and made it your specialty! 
 
**Mash:**
N-No, that's&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
You're so cute, you should start training to be a bride! 
 
**Boudica:**
Oh, geez, so cute! Come here! 
 
**Mash:**
W-Wah! Again&ndash;Your breasts&ndash;
 
**Boudica:**
There, there. Good girl, good girl. 
 
**Boudica:**
You stay cheerful forever. Don't get too hurt, and don't be too reckless. 
 
**Boudica:**
You really are an adorable girl. 
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, well, I-I am Senpai's...Um...
 
**Boudica:**
There, there! I am so happy to see you grow into such a fine lady! 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Yeah, I definitely sensed a trace of magical energy in Nero. But that might just mean she has the potential to be a mage. )
 
**Mash:**
(I wonder what it is. )
 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Hmm, we don't have enough info...)
 
**Nero:**
All right, then it's settled! Let's go, we must first hurry and procure a ship! 
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Before that, Master look, the enemy army remnant. I feel their presence. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, I have detected multiple lifeforms. I am getting hostile readings from the United Empire troops in Gaul. 
 
**Nero:**
I'd leave them be if they're fleeing home, but if they're headed here it can't be helped. Let's defeat them! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
It's more or less taken care of. Now then, let's regroup and head out to the sea. 
 
**Nero:**
It's good to travel by sea. Fujimaru,let me show you my brilliant sailing skills! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can't wait! 
 
**Nero:**
Right? Right? Heh, heh, such a honest fellow. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm a bit worried. 
 
**Nero:**
No need to be embarrassed. Heh, heh, you're bad at hiding your feelings, huh? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The emperor is amazing! Whatever you say, she interprets it in a positive way! 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
## Section 9: Secret of the Ancient God 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, that was some nice wind! It was the most aggressive voyage ever! 
 
**Mash:**
...Thank goodness my semicircular canals were enhanced. 
 
**Mash:**
If I hadn't become a Demi-Servant...Ugh...I'm not going to go there. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-You seem to have gone through an ordeal. I could tell by your vitals. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The soldiers couldn't leave the ship either. Oh, poor men! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Since the emperor offered to take the wheel herself, I thought she had impeccable skills. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But wait, maybe, just maybe! Those were impeccable skills, in a sense. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I mean, the ship's still standing after such a rocky journey. It also leapt through waves, and drifted some turns...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's amazing when you think about it. Just what you'd expect of the emperor...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't be stupid. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I agree. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha! Oh c'mon Fujimaru,you didn't get mad, did you? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyways, you landed safely on the rumored island. You should start looking for this ancient god&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, maybe we don't have to look after all? It seems the god is coming to greet us. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
However, I am detecting a Servant. Be on your guard. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Nero:**
What, another enemy attack? So this island is also under the United Empire's control. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, this is...a Servant, but...Something is off. It's different than normal, what is this? 
 
**E：???:**
Yes, that's right. I'm not a "normal" Servant. 
 
**E：???:**
Good day heroes, welcome to my humble temporary home for this era, the "Shaped" Isle. 
 
**E：???:**
My, oh my. I was wondering what kind of magnificent hero was here. 
 
**E：???:**
But to my surprise, it seems there are Servants in your group. Unfortunately, I was waiting for human heroes. 
 
**Mash:**
This presence&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What in the world...can this even be possible? Her reading is definitely like a Servant, but different...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What the...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Is she the "ancient god"? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An immeasurable divinity level! Without a doubt, she's definitely a god. No, a goddess! 
 
**Stheno:**
That's right. I am a goddess&ndash;my name is Stheno. 
 
**Stheno:**
One of the three Gorgon Sisters. Though, I rather dislike being called an ancient god. 
 
**Stheno:**
But it's fine. It is true that where you're from, I am a past god. 
 
**Stheno:**
You may call me whatever you wish. After all, time is irrelevant when it comes to my beauty. 
 
**Mash:**
Servant of a Divine Spirit, not a Heroic Spirit? Doctor, this is different from what we talked about. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Y-Yeah, I guess everything has an exception. O-Oh this is unheard of, a Divine Spirit Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Furthermore, one of "the" ancient Greek gods! That's an authentic god! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is that possible? She is actually standing before you. Even so, there's no way she can remain "as a god. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I mean, it's the same for Heroic Spirits. Her power must've been downsized. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gods no longer have "Authority" on this land. If that's the case...
 
**Stheno:**
Aren't you the knowledgeable one, Mage. That's right, you are not mistaken there. 
 
**Stheno:**
However...There's one thing you should remember, pure one. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-What is it? &ndash;To think a goddess would personally instruct me. 
 
**Stheno:**
Oh, what a wonderful voice. It has a nice sound to it,I would love to see your face but...
 
**Stheno:**
Such a shame. You're in a place where even my "eyes" can't reach. 
 
**Stheno:**
If you were in my arm's reach, I'd have done something nice to you in the wink of an eye. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whoa...I just had shivers down my entire body...This presence is different than Dark Jeanne! 
 
**Stheno:**
Oh, that's just your imagination. Allow me to inform all of you clueless people. 
 
**Stheno:**
Not all gods are powerful. "Myself" and I are quite "feeble" beings. 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Based on the readings you are quite an individual...So does that mean you're not hostile because your combat abilities are low? 
 
**Stheno:**
There are goddesses who are never asked to fight. For instance, you over there. 
 
**Mash:**
You mean me? 
 
**Stheno:**
You are one such, no? Your power is not to kill, but to protect. 
 
**Mash:**
...It is. 
 
**Stheno:**
Hehe, I do like honest girls. I'd like to pamper you like I do to my "little sister. "
 
**Mash:**
(Oh, I just got a shiver. )
 
**Nero:**
(I had a shiver, too! )
 
**Fou:**
Fou. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Wait. I'm detecting another presence on the beach! 
 
**Stheno:**
Oh my. 
 
**Nero:**
How dare they interrupt an emperor and a goddess. Who are they? From the United Empire? 
 
**Mash:**
...No, they're just ghosts. But they are closing in. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's drive them off. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's ask them to leave. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes Senpai, commencing interceptive combat! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
Anyway! Stop leaving me out of the conversation! 
 
**Nero:**
I get the gist of what you're saying. That goddess isn't our enemy, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Right. I'm assuming that's the case. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmm, in that case, isn't it simple? Ancient Goddess Stheno, come to Rome! 
 
**Nero:**
I am Rome. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius. 
 
**Nero:**
I shall accept you as a new god. Let us defeat the United Empire together! 
 
**Stheno:**
Well now, how dazzling you are,as much as Apollo. But I'm sorry, Your Majesty. 
 
**Stheno:**
I am not suitable for combat. 
 
**Stheno:**
Now that I've taken on the form of a Servant, I do have some skills and basic functions, but...
 
**Stheno:**
I don't possess the power to fight valiantly like my younger sister. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? 
 
**Stheno:**
I said I don't have the power♡ You'll get stabbed in the back if you don't stop being insensitive. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Sorry, I get it. She's more of the type of goddess who hunts her prey, I guess. 
 
**Stheno:**
But, you are a hero who came all the way here. 
 
**Stheno:**
I should give you a reward. Though back in the day, I would've incited Medusa&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Incited? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I heard nothing
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Incited? 
 
**Mash:**
Did you say incited? 
 
**Stheno:**
Ahem, hehe. Never mind! I'll give you a goddess' blessing. 
 
**Stheno:**
As you walk along the coast, you'll find an entrance to a cave. All the way in the back...
 
**Stheno:**
I prepared a treasure. It doesn't exist in nature, it's something special. 
 
**Stheno:**
I'll give it to you because you're fun. Haha, I don't usually reward someone like this. 
 
**Nero:**
Well, a goddess' blessing...That's really...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's interesting. It could be the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
It doesn't match up with Caesar's information. That said, I think there's still a chance...
 
**Nero:**
I don't care what kind of treasure it is. I try to love everything. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right then, let's head for the cave now! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Nero:**
Ugh...
 
**Nero:**
...It's so dark, and clammy...
 
**Mash:**
It's not exactly comfortable in here, is it? It's hard to see ahead. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, is something wrong? Your face...no, I mean your voice sounds funny. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've been deceived. Forgive me,multiple magical energy signatures up ahead. 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're not Servants, but a type of monster. Does this mean...that goddess...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Set us up? Oh, hahaha...
 
**Skeleton Soldier:**
(clank, clank, clank)
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
What's going on here? This cave is full of skeletons! 
 
**Mash:**
Well, let's hope they're just skeletons...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Multiple signatures incoming! I think a lot of skeletons are coming...
 
**Nero:**
Mm, mmm, mmm! Sword-wielding skeletons aren't treasure by a long shot! 
 
**Mash:**
Please give me your orders, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
Phew, I'm getting a little exhausted...I want to go back and rest...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But what do you know? Looks like we reached the back of the cave while fighting. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm getting a unique signature there. This amount of energy&ndash;No, that's not possible. 
 
**Mash:**
What is it, Doctor? Could the Holy Grail really be here? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No...no, it's not the Holy Grail at all! It's a Phantasmal,not a dragon, but a powerful mystical beast! 
 
**F：???:**
GARRRRRRRRRR!! 
 
**Mash:**
This is&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
It's so huge! Oh, but that lion has a cute face! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a chimera, a legendary beast of ancient Greece. This is not a product of magecraft, but a true mystical beast! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Why would a thing like this be here? Oh, I know why. That goddess. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's powerful and has considerable toughness, so be careful! 
 
**Mash:**
Roger. Master, commencing battle! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Stheno:**
Haha. Welcome back, did you enjoy your special reward to the fullest? 
 
**Nero:**
I'm tired...so exhausted...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I'm sure...Consecutive battles in a closed space will wear you out beyond belief...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm totally wiped out...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I think you should rest immediately...Should we return to the ship? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
This is nothing! 
 
**Mash:**
Are you sure? Senpai, at times you display extraordinary endurance...
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Really, you're so lame! I could've taken on a big cat like that without breaking a sweat! 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahahaha! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, I'm sensing two enemies. Either lizards, dragons, or maybe idols...
 
**Mash:**
At any rate, we're going to take them out! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, that's Elisabeth! 
 
**Mash:**
I know, I know! 
 
**Mash:**
But she's dangerous, Senpai. I have a feeling that she might screw everything up! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I agree...Let's pretend we don't notice her,so we can get away with it Fujimaru! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, let's beat them up! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's the right choice. I'm sure they will bring up some absolute nonsense! 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
What, that reaction again! You ugly, weird deerlet! 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahahaha! 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, a weird person told me I'm weird! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There, there. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She's the weird one. 
 

---

 
**Elisabeth:**
Hmph, I guess that cave was really tough. Well, it can't be helped with the Puppy's ability. 
 
**Nero:**
...Who the hell are you, appearing all of a sudden and talking nonsense? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Who the hell are YOU? Oh, I'm not sensing any magical energy...wait a human? You? 
 
**Nero:**
Not sure why you're so surprised. You are rude and insensitive. I would have slashed you already if you didn't look so cute. 
 
**Nero:**
I'm Nero Claudius, the emperor of this era.... Um, why are you looking at me like that? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Are you kidding me? The real Nero?! 
 
**Mash:**
The real...
 
**Nero:**
What do you mean by "real? "
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahahaha! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is worse than France! I'm even more confused about what's going on! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Stheno:**
Anyway, when I materialized in this world I dragged these two with me. 
 
**Stheno:**
I didn't feel like I'd be able to complete the Heroes' Cave on my own. 
 
**Stheno:**
So I had these two serve as my testers for the cave, that's all I think? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Hmph, it was a totally boring dungeon. Oh, but a live show in an underground cave is a new concept, right? 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahaha! 
 
**Stheno:**
So you know Elisabeth. What about this one? 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahaha! 
 
**Mash:**
Uh no...we've never met. Although, I know she's a Servant&mdash;
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Ahahaha! All right, let's introduce ourselves! 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I am Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine! 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I tag "woof" at the end of my sentences. My hobby is cafe management. My favorite food is carrots. 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Hmm. That's pretty inconsistent even for me. Woof woof. 
 
**Nero:**
She talked! 
 
**Mash:**
She did that on purpose, too. Woof! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Neutral, huh? I'm glad she's not a hostile Servant. Or maybe I should say I'm glad she's not our ally? 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I was laughing because it was fun. I'm a laughing drunk. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh, s-sure. 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
I'm Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine! Can I speak in cat language? 
 
**Mash:**
What? 
 
**Nero:**
What's the Tamamo Nine? 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
No? How about dog language? 
 
**Nero:**
Umu? 
 
**Stheno:**
Hehe! Your reaction was better than I thought. It requires technique to communicate with her. 
 
**Stheno:**
Thank you, Tamamo Cat. But why weren't you in the treasure chest? 
 
**Stheno:**
You were supposed to be the last trick. After they dealt with the chimera, you should've come out. 
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Now I'll get my carrots as the reward! 
 
**Stheno:**
Did you eat the chest? Oh my...okay. I understand. 
 
**Nero:**
H-Hmm. Their conversation seems to be working out...
 
**Nero:**
She's a goddess after all. She doesn't even flinch at that oddball. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, well. Though this island has been somewhat fun,I guess we came here for nothing. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You sound like it's not your problem...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Probably. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahahaha! It happens! Don't look so depressed. Why don't we return to Rome for now&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it looks like we can't! There's a Servant over there! 
 
**Elisabeth:**
Huh? (←Servant)
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
Indeed. (←Servant)
 
**Stheno:**
Oh? (←Servant)
 
**Mash:**
Doc? (←Demi Servant)
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, that didn't come out right! There's another Servant besides you guys, it's coming from the sea! 
 
**Caligula:**
My! 
 
**Caligula:**
My! My...actions...are...fate! 
 
**Caligula:**
Sacrifice your life! Sacrifice your flesh! 
 
**Nero:**
Uncle? 
 
**Elisabeth:**
What? Who? Nero's uncle? 
 
**Stheno:**
He seems to be pretty "tangled up. "That's how one should deal with Servants, I suppose. 
 
**Stheno:**
&ndash;That's just bad taste. 
 
**Caligula:**
Beautiful...You're beautiful...
 
**Elisabeth:**
You popped out of nowhere and now you're hitting on girls? W-What's with you, I know I am an attractive idol and all. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
But acting like a lowly beast is the worst! What kind of royalty are you? 
 
**Caligula:**
Beautiful...Really beautiful! You are beautiful! 
 
**Caligula:**
I want to take it, lust over it, and tear it apart. Your purity, your divine beauty, everything! 
 
**Caligula:**
I want to trample all over you with my entire body! I...love...you, my beloved sister's child&ndash;
 
**Caligula:**
&ndash;Nerooooo!! 
 
**Nero:**
...That's right. You are a beast. You are no longer my uncle! 
 
**Nero:**
My uncle is dead. I still can't stop thinking about his regrettable death. 
 
**Nero:**
But still, if you appear before me after being lost in death...
 
**Nero:**
...Then I shall sing a requiem for you. Know it's my duty as your niece, and as a proper emperor! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, this is going to be a Servant battle. Your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Caligula:**
Nero...Nero...My...beautiful...niece...
 
**Caligula:**
You...are...so...very...beautiful...
 
**Caligula:**
More so than...the goddess...of the moon...More than...the radiance of...the Holy Grail...
 
**Nero:**
Uncle...
 
**Nero:**
...I've defeated the enemy commander, Caligula. I've slaughtered yet another pretender to the throne! 
 
**Nero:**
What a splendid job. Thank you Mash, Fujimaru. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was nothing. 
 
**Nero:**
Oh, it was definitely something. Now I'll have to think up another reward. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you all right? 
 
**Nero:**
You really are kind, Fujimaru. But no need to worry, I am the emperor of Rome after all. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Anyways, you guys have saved me so many times. 
 
**Nero:**
I can assure you that the reward for the defeat of the United Empire's shall be grand. 
 
**Nero:**
I won't send a monster and say, "Here, it's your reward. "
 
**Stheno:**
Are you talking to me? You, not a Servant, but a mere human? 
 
**Stheno:**
The queen of this era seems to be brave. 
 
**Stheno:**
You might actually be a proper hero. Oh, how I wish you were a man. 
 
**Nero:**
No, I am not a queen or a hero. Listen well, I am&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
&ndash;I am, the Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire! 
 
**Stheno:**
Yes of course, that's what I shall call you. The Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire. 
 
**Stheno:**
As a special gift, I'll give you a real goddess' blessing. This time it won't be a monster. 
 
**Stheno:**
It is also my thanks, for taking out a Servant who was not a hero. 
 
**Stheno:**
Your enemy, this so-called United Empire, and the gathering ground for their "emperors"&ndash;
 
**Stheno:**
The United Empire capital. I shall tell you its exact location. 
 
**Nero:**
!!! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is...an unexpected reward. Good thing we got into the cave, eh guys? 
 
**Mash:**
R-Really? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dr. Roman didn't do anything. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The cave had nothing to do with it. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Y-Yes. T-That's right. Sorry. 
 
**Elisabeth:**
...  (←Did nothing)
 
**Tamamo Cat:**
...  (←Did nothing)
 
## Section 10: Triumph 
 
**Mash:**
It won't be long until we're in Rome again. Good work on the way back, Senpai. 
 
**Nero:**
Why won't you go by horseback Fujimaru? I know, I should've provided a chariot. 
 
**Nero:**
I apologize, the few soldiers left in my unit are brilliant, but none of them fights on chariots. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Your Majesty, should I provide a chariot for the next expedition? 
 
**Nero:**
I'm sure we'll need one anyway. After all, next time we'll be attacking the United Empire capital! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Sir! 
 
**Nero:**
Yes, yes. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Your Majesty, we seem to be under attack. Enemy brigade up ahead. Multiple signatures. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
That's strange...We're running into the same amount of enemies as before. 
 
**Nero:**
You're right. Even though we already regained control of nearby Gaul. 
 
**Nero:**
Don't tell me they're attacking from the sea! If our scouts haven't noticed, then...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
The scouts were discovered and killed. We might be dealing with an elite battalion. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, that explains it. But if so, that would mean&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's as I feared. I'm detecting even more enemies now! 
 
**Mash:**
Brave soldiers, please be safe. I'm going to do what I can. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Good luck to you too, Miss Mash! 
 
**Mash:**
Your orders please, Master. Commencing battle. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
Those soldiers just now&ndash;They're not like the ones we've run into before. 
 
**Nero:**
Not that they looked much different, but...
 
**Mash:**
True, rather than human soldiers, they feel like Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
Yet they're not really Servants per se. Doctor, do you have an idea? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I can think of several possibilities. Not good. Things like this are typically related to Noble Phantasms. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
And I don't mean typical Noble Phantasms. The type that's designed for use on the battlefield. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In which case&ndash;
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Master, I'm sensing the presence of a Servant. There's one...no, several hundred! 
 
**Mash:**
It's the same presence from before. But I can only tell that one of them is an actual Servant. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Enemy attack! Several hundred enemy soldiers! 
 
**Nero:**
Is this an ambush? Where did several hundred enemies come from? 
 
**F：???:**
It's not an ambush. I chose to defend this place, that's all. 
 
**F：???:**
You people trespassed into my stronghold. So I shall defend it. 
 
**F：???:**
I will crush any and all enemies more valiantly than any attack, and far stronger than any defense. 
 
**F：???:**
This is how we Spartans fight. You will soon experience it for yourselves. 
 
**Mash:**
Did you just say Sparta? Then you are&ndash;
 
**Leonidas:**
Servant, Lancer. My True Name is Leonidas. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
He's not hiding his True Name. Just like last time,this is far different than a normal Holy Grail War. 
 
**Nero:**
Leonidas? You introduce yourself as King Leonidas of Sparta? 
 
**Leonidas:**
Precisely. It is an immoral war, but I'm still going to destroy you. 
 
**Nero:**
What! You are the legendary Leonidas,the guardian of the Hot Gates! 
 
**Nero:**
So the "emperors" aren't the only ones who came back? Hmm, then what about Boudica? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Stay focused on the battle! 
 
**Nero:**
U-Umu? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We met Elisabeth, too, remember? 
 
**Nero:**
Ah, now that you mention it. Hmm, but then is Boudica...
 
**Nero:**
Is she also dead? Is that it? 
 
**Nero:**
Or was she alive? I told her, "This time, surrender yourself to Rome. " Thinking that was the case...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
N-Never mind that Nero, there are many enemies. We must strengthen our defenses! 
 
**Nero:**
U-Umu, our unit is quite small. I hope we're able to defend...
 
**Mash:**
If we defeat the main Servant, the remaining hundreds should be gone. In that case&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Master, it's a Servant battle. Your orders, please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Leonidas:**
Just as I thought, huh? In a battle with nothing to protect...
 
**Nero:**
He vanished? So he wasn't meant to exist in this world after all. 
 
**Mash:**
...He was a formidable enemy. Just what you'd expect of the ultimate defensive Heroic Spirit. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No signs of Servants or humans around us. No Phantasmals, either. 
 
**Nero:**
Then let's head back to Rome! Mash, Fujimaru, you can hold your heads up high! 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, you in particular Mash. Your skills aren't as good as mine, but they are quite good. 
 
**Mash:**
N-Not really...
 
**Nero:**
Haha! Hold your head up high with pride! This is our triumphant return from Gaul, after all! 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Nero:**
Phew...At last, things have settled down. 
 
**Mash:**
That was an unbelievable crowd. It was like a festival. Senpai, you got squished pretty hard, didn't you? 
 
**Mash:**
But you didn't seem that uncomfortable. Maybe you like that sort of thing? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, yeah. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can't be helped if it's a festival...
 

---

 
**Mash:**
I see, I see, at festivals, everyone becomes friendly, right? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Haha. I bet you didn't mind at all. That's what you call a victory wine! 
 
**Nero:**
Ah unseen mage, you speak as though you've actually tasted some? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hahaha, I have a vivid imagination. Which has led me into all kinds of situations. 
 
**Nero:**
Mash, you protected us well. Do you not like being touched? 
 
**Nero:**
As expected, the great warrior of shield swore loyalty only to me. It makes me like you even more. 
 
**Mash:**
T-Thank you. It's nice of you to say that...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you looking at me? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm glad that she likes you
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes...Well, no. Nothing. I have nothing to say. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Your Majesty! The special expedition force is heading back to Rome! 
 
**Nero:**
What&ndash;? Those people are coming back? 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Yes, both generals are alive and well! But now they are tied down due to a massive attack by the United Empire! 
 
**Nero:**
That's not good. I'm sorry, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. Senpai, your orders please. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go help them. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Orders are orders. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Understood. 
 
**G：???:**

![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)
 
**H：???:**
We're completely surrounded. Nothing but swarms of enemies around us. 
 
**H：???:**
That shouldn't be a problem, but...
 
**G：???:**

![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)
 
**H：???:**
Yeah, we'll probably lose the soldiers Nero Claudius provided for us. I'd like to avoid that if possible. 
 
**H：???:**
Find a way out of an impossible situation&ndash;
 
**H：???:**
People like you and me can get through it on our own, but it would be too harsh to force them to do that. 
 
**H：???:**
What should we do? ...Huh? 
 
**G：???:**

![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)
 
**H：???:**
Reinforcements, huh? Though I heard Boudica and Spartacus were in Gaul. 
 
**Mash:**
...You must be Jing Ke. I recognize you from your description. Looks like we met up with them, Master. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm relieved. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. We made it. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought it was all over
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I was a little nervous when we broke through the enemy's line, but...
 
**Mash:**
They are human forces. The degree of risk is relatively low. 
 

---

 
**Jing Ke:**
You look unfamiliar, but you don't seem to be an enemy. 
 
**Mash:**
No we're not, we are reinforcements from Rome. You guys are&ndash;
 
**Jing Ke:**
Let's talk later. You're Servants, too, aren't you? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Then, let's find a way out together. My hope is to bring as many soldiers back to Rome as possible. 
 
**Mash:**
Of course. Master, massive enemy troops ahead. Your orders, please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We have destroyed the enemy forces and sustained only minor casualties. Good work Senpai! 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Thank you again, looks like I didn't lose my borrowed troops. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
I'm Assassin, Jing Ke. Like you, I'm a guest commander under Nero Claudius. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
I was drawn by the prospect of killing multiple"emperors," but now I'm being treated like a general. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Of course...My main activities are reconnaissance and assassination. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
It's his job to do the actual work on the battlefield. Lu Bu&ndash;...hm...where's he gone after chasing those enemies? 
 
**Jing Ke:**
...Hm. I'm sure he'll be back eventually. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Jing Ke. The legendary Chinese assassin? No wonder you're obsessed with killing emperors. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Huh&ndash;? 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Mash and Fujimaru,I see that you are visitors from another era. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
I understand your circumstances. That said, it doesn't change what we must do here. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
We are here to slaughter the "emperors. "Me and Lu Bu. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
We've already killed three enemy "emperor" Servants. It's going to be a competition with you guys. 
 
**Mash:**
S-Sure. Competition...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We are not losing to you. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Is that so? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We've killed only two so far...
 
**Jing Ke:**
Don't be so depressed. You still have a chance to catch up. 
 

---

 
**Jing Ke:**
As soon as we're back in Rome,Nero's full-scale invasion of the United Empire will start. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
And there comes the race. We count heads of "emperors," or enemy generals. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Our team or your team, which one gets more&ndash;Heh, now I have something to look forward to. 
 
**Mash:**
W-Well. Something to look forward to...
 
**Mash:**
(...I can't, Senpai. I can't maintain the conversation. )
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay. Me neither. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You just have to do your best
 

---

 
**Mash:**
(H-Hey, Senpai! )
 
**Lev:**
&ndash;So they failed to eliminate Lu Bu. 
 
**H：???:**
...What should we do, Lev Lainur? 
 
**Lev:**
There's nothing to worry about. Don't forget that I have the Holy Grail. I told you before, didn't I? 
 
**Lev:**
I'm capable of summoning Servants at will. No matter how powerful they may be! 
 
**F：???:**
...Servant Rider, huh? Hmm, I guess, that's my class? 
 
**F：???:**
So? What should I do, Master? 
 
**Lev:**
Eliminate Nero Claudius immediately. Destroy this era, and crush the foundation of humanity. 
 
**H：???:**
...I'll lend you my troops. Use them as you see fit. 
 
**F：???:**
Got it. In short, you want me to start a war, right? 
 
**H：???:**
...Exactly. 
 
**F：???:**
War. War, hmm. War, huh? I guess I'm very good at that. 
 
**F：???:**
All right, if you insist I'll borrow your troops&ndash;
 
## Section 11: Attack the United Empire 
 
**E：???:**
&ndash;That sums up Nero Claudius' army. 
 
**E：???:**
All the details are in the report. Look it over later. 
 
**E：???:**
One comment from me. Think of the enemy commander, Lu Bu as a disaster. 
 
**E：???:**
The same goes for Spartacus. It's no use confronting them head-on. 
 
**E：???:**
That said, these disasters can be dealt with. The two Berserkers are like automatic machines. 
 
**E：???:**
It should be easy to "lure" them. Luckily, they didn't materialize as other classes. 
 
**F：???:**
Guess our luck is turning. Were my Luck parameters that high? 
 
**E：???:**
Luck that's already played out is nothing but reality. Meaning that reality is working in your favor, nothing more. 
 
**F：???:**
Oh? You can look at it that way too, I guess. 
 
**F：???:**
It doesn't matter either way. I want to see her face. 
 
**F：???:**
Nero Claudius. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire. 
 
**F：???:**
What kind of king is she? No, what kind of emperor is she, I should say. 
 
**E：???:**
I will make your wish come true. No matter what. 
 
**F：???:**
Thank you, but I kind of feel weird. 
 
**F：???:**
I'm what you may consider a curveball as a Heroic Spirit, so my "memory" is a little different too. 
 
**F：???:**
It seems a little bit off, that you became my teacher. 
 
**E：???:**
Those are my words. Can you imagine being sent back in time, and becoming a vessel for a Heroic Spirit I have no connections with. 
 
**E：???:**
What happened to me in my own era? Did I switch with this Heroic Spirit? 
 
**E：???:**
Or did the time in "my era" stop, and I'm here as myself, integrated with this Heroic Spirit? 
 
**E：???:**
...I have no idea what's going on. 
 
**F：???:**
But you came here anyway. As my new teacher. 
 
**F：???:**
Right, Mr. Zhuge Liang. 
 
**E：???:**
No. Well, as a Heroic Spirit, that may be true. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
&ndash;I am Lord El-Melloi II. 
 
**Mash:**
And&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
The true Roman Empire Army has started its attack. The United Empire is being invaded. 
 
**Mash:**
Jing Ke already came back with intel. A city resembling Rome indeed exists in the specified location. 
 
**Mash:**
This is the place Stheno was talking about. This is the real blessing from the goddess. 
 
**Mash:**
Boudica and Spartacus of Gaul, along with Lu Bu and Jing Ke. 
 
**Mash:**
An army commanding five Servants, including me. That is the true Roman Imperial Army led by Emperor Nero. 
 
**Mash:**
It's a force that no standard army can match. Yet the United Empire force won't send in their Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
No sign of Lev Lainur either. Everyday, we advance further. 
 
**Mash:**
We certainly have the upper hand now. The Imperial Army is marching toward the enemy capital with unbelievable momentum. 
 
**Mash:**
In the meantime, I&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
will do this&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you doing? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai? Fou?! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you keeping a journal? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Mash:**
Well...Senpai, Fou, yes that's right. To tell you the truth&ndash;
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Doctor asked me. To keep a journal, like a military record. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right, I'm the one who asked. To take advantage of the fact that you became a Roman viceroy! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What do you think about "Novus Commentarii de Bello Gallico"? This title is an homage to the book written by Caesar. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That sounds interesting, right? Though you do have to cover the part where a god showed up...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you planning to publish this? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Wouldn't that be breach of confidentiality? 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I suppose you're right. Well then, let's talk about something serious! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's assume you guys could save the world. I thought about what would come after that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if the world is saved, the tragedy of Chaldea will never be reversed. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words&ndash;there's no guarantee for our salary. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You understand the rest, right? 
 
**Mash:**
I see. You mean prevention is better than the cure,but why are you the one avoiding physical labor, Doctor? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, it's a joke, it's a joke. Why would I count my chickens before they hatch when the world's about to end? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's happening in Rome is exactly like a war. In order to grasp the situation correctly, I just use the best means. 
 
**Mash:**
I understand its purpose now. In that case, I will dispose of this journal right away. 
 
**Mash:**
Regarding the war record, I will deliver it to Da Vinci later. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good! Look how well you've been trained! Damn! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash is right. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What a waste to throw it away. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Fou:**
Fou? 
 
**Nero:**
Mmm, what? What are you talking about? 
 
**Nero:**
Fujimaru always seems to be having fun. You should let me in on it, too. 
 
**Boudica:**
Hey! You know this is not the time to be fooling around. We've detected the enemy. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're right, multiple signatures. I am not picking up any Servants, it's a regular military force. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmmm. I was just about to have a lovely conversation...what a disappointment...
 
**Nero:**
It's okay. First, we'll get rid of them. What can mere United Empire troops do to us! 
 
**Nero:**
I shall take in those who surrender! Pledge fealty to my Rome, and your life will be spared! 
 
**Boudica:**
Your Rome, I see. 
 
**Nero:**
Huh? 
 
**Mash:**
Master, we should go too. If we can crush the leading units, we can demoralize their troops. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't overdo it. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's go! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Jing Ke:**
...That's all. Already, the United Empire is without clear leadership. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
All we encountered are small random skirmishes with independent enemy units. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
It's safe to assume that the situation looks positive. 
 
**Nero:**
Umu! In other words, my army has regained its true power, right? 
 
**Nero:**
No, I have Mash and the others, as well. These traitors have no chance against my forces! 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Carelessness could be fatal, Nero Claudius. Life can be extinguished without you even knowing it. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
The United Empire defense is still formidable. That's also why we only run into weaker units. 
 
**Nero:**
U-Umu. Jing Ke is so cautious. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Have you forgotten? I assassinate others for a living. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Plotting is my specialty and at the same time, it's what I'm most wary of. 
 
**Nero:**
Umu...
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Pardon me, Your Majesty! Enemy troops are ahead! Also they are behind us! 
 
**Mash:**
Behind us? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I believe General Lu Bu was in the rearguard,Spartacus as well. We can't leave them like that&ndash;
 
**Jing Ke:**
This is not good. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Once the fight starts, those two will probably chase the enemy to the ends of the earth...
 
**Nero:**
That's why we placed them in the rearguard. To capture the capital as planned...but it backfired. 
 
**Nero:**
We can't lose those generals! I'm sorry, Mash,Fujimaru, I am counting on you! 
 
**Mash:**
Understood. I just need to stop the rear enemy troops, right? 
 
**Mash:**
I am relatively good at fighting defensively. I want to emphasize...'relatively. '
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's hurry up! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't over do it. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We've crushed the enemy forces, and destroyed all the monsters. 
 
**Mash:**
We somehow made it&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not yet! Multiple signatures! What's this? The enemy forces are even stronger than before! 
 
**Mash:**
Another battle! Master, your orders please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did we stop them? Looks like the rest retreated. Good job, Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We were able to save Lu Bu and Spartacus. Dear me, let's take a breather. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
From now on, let's protect our rearguard as well. The enemy seems to understand how our army works. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Did you sense any Servants? I couldn't detect anything from here. 
 
**Mash:**
There were no signs of such during the battle. Except for the four in our own forces. Oh wait...
 
**Mash:**
Jing Ke often extinguishes her presence. So to be precise, that's three Servants. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's Assassin's Presence Concealment skill. I can't detect her from here, either. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I don't think an Assassin is involved. In this case&ndash;
 
**Jing Ke:**
It must be directed...There must be an enemy general who's adept at commanding. 
 
**Mash:**
I wonder if it's one of the "emperors. "
 
**Jing Ke:**
I don't know. But we will find out soon. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**F：???:**

![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png) 
 
**Nero:**
Wh-What's this sound? A beast howling? 
 
**Mash:**
No, it's a Servant's presence. It's possible that an enemy Servant has appeared. 
 
**Nero:**
A big gun like Mash and the others? An enemy commander? In that case, one of the "emperors"&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
First, let's draw back our men. Humans don't stand a chance against that, they'll be slaughtered! 
 
**Nero:**
Right, gotcha! So the instant we move Boudica to the rear, this happens? 
 
**Mash:**
Let's head to the front. Master! 
 
**Mash:**
I have them in my sights. That's...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up multiple magical energy signatures. All belong to that of necromancy, but with this number...perhaps a Caster? 
 
**Mash:**
Multiple non-human, hostile creatures. We haven't confirmed the source of the roar. 
 
**Mash:**
It may be a Berserker. Master, we should eradicate this group of hostile creatures. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Pay attention to Servants! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Looks like a Servant was summoned in the enemy vanguard. Was it that Court Mage's doing&ndash;
 
**El-Melloi II:**
No, it couldn't have been. In that case, was it you? 
 
**F：???:**
I don't know. All I did was gallop my horse. 
 
**F：???:**
I thought they'd be on their way by now. I never thought it would be this soon. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Oh? 
 
**F：???:**
Have you heard the rumors about the Mediterranean goddess? They say that aside from her, there are two female monsters. 
 
**F：???:**
So you see...It hit me. 
 
**F：???:**
A Chained Summon. If such a thing could be possible. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
I don't like battles that rely on luck. 
 
**F：???:**
Please don't say that. You're the one who created that opening in their vanguard. 
 
**F：???:**
Let's get ready now, while he's buying us time. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
...Are you sure? 
 
**F：???:**
About? 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
If he materialized through the chained summon,then most likely he's&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
Yes, I think he's Darius III. The fearless Persian King and my forever rival in life. 
 
**F：???:**
However, right now, I feel that I know that as a kind of future. 
 
**F：???:**
It's okay. I fought him once, and will fight him again. 
 
**F：???:**
And I want to fight him again. But not right now. 
 
**F：???:**
Right now, it's Nero Claudius. I want to talk to that person. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Darius III:**

![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png) 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Amazing, I can almost feel the air vibrations over here! Magical energy signature confirmed. He's a Servant! 
 
**Mash:**
Linguistic communication impossible, it's an enemy Servant. Master, your orders! 
 
**Darius III:**

![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png) 
 
**Mash:**
Ugh...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't get swallowed up! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We can beat it! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Right! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
We have defeated the enemy Servant. Good job, Master. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're really getting hang of fighting Servants. Your experiences are coming in handy, well done. 
 
**Mash:**
Oh no Doctor, I think it's because of Master's precise orders. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Commander Fujimaru, Commander Mash,a message! It's from Her Majesty the Emperor. 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
There's been an ambush in the rear, both General Spartacus and General Lu Bu have left the battlefield. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, no! So the enemy deployed a two-front attack? 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
The two generals have defeated the enemy forces, but they've broken away in pursuit of remnants! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
Then another force launched a surprise attack from both sides. General Boudica fell into the enemy's hands and was taken prisoner! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is...Mmmm, this is not good at all...
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Mash:**
&ndash;Nero. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmm? Oh, I seemed to be deep in thought. I have made my decision. 
 
**Mash:**
(Seemed? )
 
**Nero:**
Our forces were outmatched in the previous battle...I will accept this as a stern truth. 
 
**Nero:**
My generals are just as capable as the enemy"emperors. " But two of them left the front line, and one is captured by the enemy. 
 
**Nero:**
There is nothing we can do about those two. No, it was my mistake. 
 
**Nero:**
It might take a little bit of time, but I'm willing to believe Lu Bu and Spartacus will return to us. 
 
**Nero:**
Therefore, at this point&ndash;We will save Boudica! 
 
**Nero:**
Fortunately, Jing Ke found the location of enemy fort. We will charge in, destroy the fort, and save Boudica. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmmm...
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, something wrong? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I just feel uneasy. The one who captured Boudica is supposed to be a Servant. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not something a regular human can do, but why are they barricading themselves in a fort? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's not that far from the United Empire capital. So it should be convenient to get back there. 
 
**Mash:**
The enemy is trying to lure us in. Is that what this means? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
If they just want to destroy our force, the approach I mentioned earlier should be "better. "
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We have at least two Servants. They should understand that too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's why they cut off Lu Bu and Spartacus in such a spectacular manner. 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Humans and Servants, I think the enemy has a good grasp of the clear difference. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now, Fujimaru. It's time for a decision. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're going to rescue Boudica. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. I knew you'd say that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You're too optimistic. We're at war. We need a strategic point of view. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If it's a trap, we'll crush it. 
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai. You're starting to think like a Berserker. 
 
**Mash:**
I understand more Berserkers have materialized this time, but I don't think it's a good idea to be influenced by them. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
But...I don't believe your way of thinking is bad. 
 
**Nero:**
You understand me, Fujimaru. In that case, let's conquer together. Our target is the enemy base! 
 
**Nero:**
We will take it at once! My loyal soldiers, attack with caution! 
 
## Section 12: Rescue Boudica 
 
**Mash:**
I am sensing Servants nearby. Please be careful, they're very close. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up two signatures from here. You're looking at a battle with multiple Servants. Watch your back! 
 
**Nero:**
Where are you Boudica? Answer me! 
 
**Nero:**
I know you can't be dead yet! I can tell, I can tell. You would never die! 
 
**F：???:**
...No, no. Isn't that a rather selfish way to put it? 
 
**F：???:**
Rest assured, she's safe. Right now, she's fast asleep thanks to his spells. 
 
**E：???:**
It's a Restraint Spell. Not like being fast asleep. 
 
**F：???:**
But she really was sleeping. Fast asleep. 
 
**Nero:**
...You bastards. I'm surprised that you'd show your faces. 
 
**Nero:**
I assume you're both leaders of this fort. I shall allow it, tell me your names. 
 
**F：???:**
You're making us tell you our names? Hmm, let's see...How should I put this? 
 
**F：???:**
I have several names. It's hard to pick one, hmm. 
 
**F：???:**
&ndash;All right, this is what I'm gonna do. 
 
**Alexander:**
My name is Alexander. To be precise, that's Alexander III. 
 
**Alexander:**
So, he's&ndash;
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Lord El-Melloi II. Due to certain reasons,or should I say fate, I am his strategist. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
I am not a true Heroic Spirit. I'd probably have another name as a Heroic Spirit. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
Therefore, it's okay to forget my name. 
 
**Alexander:**
That doesn't work. We are the enemy generals to her. 
 
**Alexander:**
Right, Roman Emperor? 
 
**Nero:**
Of course...what? Now that it's come to this,don't tell me you're not going to fight. 
 
**Alexander:**
Exactly. 
 
**Nero:**
W-What? 
 
**Mash:**
You aren't going to fight? You aren't the enemy Servants? 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
I'm a "drop out," I don't have a Master. Alexander, however, is a different story. 
 
**Alexander:**
I guess I didn't get along with my Master. That's why I'm here of my own will. 
 
**Alexander:**
I was waiting here. For you to show up. 
 
**Nero:**
For...me? You were waiting? 
 
**Alexander:**
Yes, I'm a little bit interested. That's why I teased you here and there. 
 
**Alexander:**
I wanted to talk to you. 
 
**Alexander:**
If possible&ndash;right here in the middle of the battlefield. 
 
**Alexander:**
Thank you, Lord El-Melloi II. You made my selfish wish come true. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
What are you talking about? More than half of them were your directions. 
 
**Nero:**
???
 
**Mash:**
...Senpai! Your Majesty! The enemy soldiers are coming, their target is Your Majesty! 
 
**Nero:**
Ugh, a pincer attack!? 
 
**Alexander:**
Yes, don't worry. We won't do anything, but&ndash;
 
**Alexander:**
The United Empire soldiers won't stop. Once they notice you, they will attack automatically. 
 
**Mash:**
They're coming! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Intercept them! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Protect Nero! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Got it, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Alexander:**
...Is it over? 
 
**Alexander:**
All right, let's talk. We need to hurry,or both your soldiers and mine will die off. 
 
**Alexander:**
It's not my intention. That's why&ndash;
 
**Alexander:**
&mdash;C'mon. "Let's talk. "
 
**Nero:**
...I don't understand, not one bit. At the very least, my men were killed by your army! 
 
**Nero:**
It's happening even now. Knowing that...
 
**Nero:**
...Are you still saying your purpose is to talk? You bastard! 
 
**Alexander:**
Yes. 
 
**Alexander:**
I do believe that human lives are sacred. Even I believe that. 
 
**Alexander:**
But you see, I think that this is the best way. 
 
**Alexander:**
Because you caught my attention Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius. 
 
**Alexander:**
Why is it&ndash;&ndash;that you fight? 
 
**Alexander:**
Why would you not show allegiance to the United Empire, and keep fighting like that? No, "like this. "
 
**Alexander:**
If you chose to be one of the united "emperors,"you could've avoided many unnecessary conflicts. 
 
**Nero:**
Unnecessary...
 
**Nero:**
Did you call this fight unnecessary? How dare you. 
 
**Alexander:**
I did. So what are you going to do? 
 
**Nero:**
...I won't forgive you. 
 
**Nero:**
It doesn't matter if you're my resurrected kin...or a wise ruler from the past...
 
**Nero:**
Or a brave general from an ancient era...or even if you're a legendary king yourself...
 
**Nero:**
The only one suitable to be emperor is none other than Nero Claudius! 
 
**Nero:**
Loved by the people, allowed to love them, wanted by them...There is only one! The one and only ruler! 
 
**Nero:**
A shining star like so! Arrogant to carry all the burden like so! 
 
**Nero:**
Even if all the Gods of Rome descend and tell her to surrender to the United Empire, she'll never back down! 
 
**Nero:**
How can I back down! Such is my life to believe in this philosophy, such is my fate! 
 
**Nero:**
I won't back down, I will rule and I will prosper gloriously. I am, without a doubt, Rome itself! 
 
**Alexander:**
Splendid! That's exactly what I wanted to hear. 
 
**Alexander:**
You pass. Go forth and become a ruler. No, an emperor! You have the right to do so! 
 
**Alexander:**
A rose that attracts glory and prosperity! A sin only allowed for humans, a Beast that shows the number of the Fallen. 
 
**Alexander:**
You can even "become the Devil! "Yes, you! 
 
**Nero:**
Shut up, shut up, shut up! You don't need to say any more, so! 
 
**Nero:**
Mash, Fujimaru! I need your help. Take this bastard&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
&ndash;down! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Alexander:**
I have one more thing to say to you, my adorable emperor. 
 
**Alexander:**
That pride of yours...Its blossom,it's radiance is sure to be revered, but...
 
**Alexander:**
I'm sure it can also be dangerous. Please...
 
**El-Melloi II:**
That's not for you&ndash;No, it's not your place to say. 
 
**El-Melloi II:**
But it's so like you to meddle that way. Dear me. 
 
**Nero:**
I am not wrong by any means. Not by any means...
 
**Nero:**
I am the only...Emperor...
 
**Mash:**
...
 
## Section 13: Signal to the Final Battle 
 
**Nero:**
Umu&mdash;In other words, it's the final showdown! 
 
**Nero:**
Now is the time to gather my strength and yours, as my soldiers. With this battle, Rome will become one again! 
 
**Nero:**
Those miserable pretenders to the throne...Now is the time for the false Rome to fall! 
 
**Nero:**
Fight, my soldiers! As my swords, annihilate every one of those pretenders! 
 
**Nero:**
My sword is the Original Flame, and the sound of it clashing is like a star streaking across the sky. 
 
**Nero:**
Listen in awe and praise it! Rejoice, my Swords! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I could hear her voice and cheers over here, too. The troops' morale is sky-high. 
 
**Mash:**
The battle has already started, but there's still no sign of any Servants. 
 
**Mash:**
We'll be taking part in the palace raid. I hope we can find that court mage...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You mean Lev Lainur? 
 
**Mash:**
I can't say for sure, but it's a strong possibility. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Professor Lev...
 
**Mash:**
A dangerous man who killed the Director, and proclaimed the world to have ended. There's no room for sympathy, Senpai. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash, Fujimaru, be extremely careful. Who knows what will happen if we run into the holder of the Grail. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A dragon was summoned with the power of the Grail last time. This time it might not just be used to summon Heroic Spirits. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Also&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wait, I've detected a Servant signature. It's close, you should be able to see it in front of you. 
 
**E：???:**
...Brave ones. 
 
**E：???:**
You are truly brave, and that is why you rule over the current Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmm&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
We've got visual confirmation. One large target, near the entrance to the palace. 
 
**Mash:**
To us...he's talking to us. It seems Nero heard him too. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
His voices reaches this far even on the battlefield? As expected of Servants, even their vocal cords are different.  
 
**E：???:**
I see. So you're Nero? 
 
**E：???:**
How adorable. How beautiful. How gorgeous. I can see how you held Rome up with those slender arms of yours. 
 
**E：???:**
Now, come. 
 
**E：???:**
The past, the present, the future. All that is Rome loves you. 
 
**Nero:**
What? 
 
**Nero:**
What's...No, I-I can't...
 
**Nero:**
Would...that...even be...possible...No, no, but...
 
**Mash:**
Nero? You don't look well. Did someone cast some spell on you&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not detecting any traces of magical energy. It's probably not due to magecraft or Servant Skills. 
 
**Mash:**
Then what's&ndash;
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Do you know who that might be? 
 
**Nero:**
W-Well...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why are you so afraid? 
 
**Nero:**
Afraid? A-And...just what would I be afraid of? 
 
**Nero:**
I am the Roman Emperor...That's right, Rome...
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Rome...But that person..."He" is...
 
**Nero:**
Just one glance...and I understand...He is truly...
 
**Nero:**
Rome, itself...
 
**E：???:**
I'm sure you understand, Nero. 
 
**E：???:**
Now come back, come back to Rome my dear child. 
 
**E：???:**
It's Rome. Rome is the true leader of the United Empire. 
 
**E：???:**
You should join, as well. You shall be forgiven for everything. Rome shall forgive you. 
 
**E：???:**
Rome will even love that inner beast of yours. Rome is the only one that can do that. 
 
**E：???:**
That's right&ndash;
 
**E：???:**
I am Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
I...You're...No, you're...
 
**Nero:**
You're...That's not possible...I...
 
**Nero:**
I had thought about it...I had believed. I had wanted to believe...
 
**Nero:**
However, you stand in my way! You are none other than Rome, the founding king of the nation. 
 
**Nero:**
The Holy Progenitor, Romulus! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, there's a group of enemies headed this way! I believe they're going after Nero! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Intercept them! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's pull back! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Lu Bu:**

![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png) 
 
**Spartacus:**
Hahaha! Hahahahahahahaha! The day of liberation has come. Crush the oppressors with your will and bodies! 
 
**Roman Soldier:**
The generals have returned! Victory is within our grasp! Glory to Her Majesty, the emperor! 
 
**Boudica:**
...I see, the founding ruler. 
 
**Boudica:**
So that's why she's acting like that. Such a gloomy face is sure to affect the troops' morale. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Emperor Nero? She doesn't look so gloomy. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Even as we speak, she's encouraging the troops on the battlefield. I'm sure there's no problem. 
 
**Boudica:**
Well, she is acting cheerfully. But she's not as radiant as normal. 
 
**Boudica:**
Well, right now we're fighting human soldiers, and the boss is hiding in the palace. It should be fine, but...
 
**Boudica:**
If that big one shows up again, we'll have a problem. 
 
**Boudica:**
The morale of the United Empire troops is strangely high. The soldiers were all ready to sacrifice themselves. 
 
**Boudica:**
More so, each capital civilian is acting like a soldier, and attacking our troops whenever in sight. 
 
**Boudica:**
I am sure this is the charisma of that Holy Progenitor. The soldiers and people are acting like moths drawn to the flame. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
It's true they seem to be acting that way. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
People of the United Empire are blind. Though that may be proof that they're under proper leadership. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
However, our troops have high morale as well. Nero...is acting no different than usual. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm...not sure about that. 
 
**Mash:**
I understand a little bit. It's her determination,or just general aura about her...
 
**Mash:**
It feels...a little bit lacking right now. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure it came as a shock for her. The founder of the nation, King Romulus, is actually the enemy leader...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Romulus? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I thought he was some mythological figure...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, the founding-king, Romulus. The great hero who founded Rome upon the Septem Montes. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A great figure that deserves to be called the Progenitor of Rome. At any rate, he's the son of the War God Mars. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
So that means his Divinity level is quite high,since Mars is the equivalent of Ares the Greek God of War&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, I'll get back on track. Either way...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It doesn't matter if he existed in history or not. Just like I've explained before, Heroic Spirits are the heroes people dreamt of. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
In other words, Emperor Nero must have dreamt of Romulus, as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
A dream of the shining hero who created Rome. I'm sure it was quite a shock when that person turned out to be an enemy. 
 
**Boudica:**
It would be like if I was betrayed by the Celtic gods. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Something like that. Maybe also adding in being betrayed by your beloved husband. 
 
**Boudica:**
My husband is the best husband there is. If the world turned inside-out, he still wouldn't betray me. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It was just an example, but it looks like it's time for you to go. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It isn't a Servant, but I am getting magical energy signatures. Might be some kind of monster. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
...I will search for a route to infiltrate the palace. 
 
**Boudica:**
Then I will protect the soldiers and the Emperor. Mash, Fujimaru, can I leave this to you? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure. 
 
**Boudica:**
Thanks, I'm going to go save our silly emperor. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't expect too much from us. 
 
**Boudica:**
Oh, but I will. Mash, you'll figure this out, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, of course. Senpai gets things done when the need is there. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Well then Master, commencing battle with the enemy creatures. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Nero:**
...Mmm, so it's you. 
 
**Nero:**
Where's Mash? Oh, the restroom? I guess this happens too. 
 
**Nero:**
It's just you two seem to be joined at the hip, so I thought you'd be together during those times too, sorry. 
 
**Nero:**
...
 
**Nero:**
...I made a fool out of myself, didn't I? I can't believe I'd lose it like that. 
 
**Nero:**
Although I panicked a bit during the incidents with my uncle and Lord Caesar. 
 
**Nero:**
This time, it hit home. Just a tiny bit, mind you...
 
**Nero:**
I...
 
**Nero:**
"Could it be? " I thought. Could it be that my path was mistaken? 
 
**Nero:**
...Needless to say, that's not possible. I myself am Rome...its fifth emperor. 
 
**Nero:**
But when I heard our founding ruler's voice,though it was for a brief moment, it did cross my mind. 
 
**Nero:**
"Could it be? "
 
**Nero:**
The other day, I put up such an act, and now I'm being completely pathetic. 
 
**Nero:**
But it crossed my mind. Could it be possible? 
 
**Nero:**
Would it be better for me to just bow down to the Holy Progenitor? No, let's say it. I will say it. 
 
**Nero:**
I wanted to. That's how I really, truly felt in my heart! 
 
**Nero:**
The Holy Progenitor! With all of his faults, he founded this nation! 
 
**Nero:**
If my path is wrong, if that is indeed the case, then I want to entrust everything to him as an "emperor" of the United Empire! 
 
**Nero:**
But&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
I can't do that. That is the one thing I cannot do. The Holy Progenitor is definitely mistaken. 
 
**Nero:**
Look at his people, look at his soldiers. Not a single one of them is smiling! 
 
**Nero:**
No matter how perfect the reign may be, how can there be a nation without laughter! 
 
**Nero:**
Which is why I...I...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're not wrong. Stay on your path! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're in the middle of a battle right now. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
...I know. Oh, I know! 
 
**Nero:**
That's it. I forgot something important. 
 
**Nero:**
No matter who the enemy might be, I must not stray from the path. I shall finish what I started. 
 
**Nero:**
Thank you, Fujimaru. I feel like my eyes are wide open now. 
 
**Mash:**
I'm back, Senpai.... Oh, Nero? 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, hey there Mash! If you're back, it's about time to finish this! 
 
**Mash:**
???
 
**Mash:**
Looks like you've cheered up...Senpai, Nero looks brighter now, right? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She's the same as usual. 
 
**Mash:**
Yeah, that's true. That might just be true. 
 
**Mash:**
I think she's a lot like the sun. That's why she's captured the hearts of many. 
 
**Mash:**
Even now, people are fighting under her name. She's got a powerful charisma. 
 
**Mash:**
That's just who she is...Even if it dims a little, her light still shines true. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I cheered her up a little. 
 
**Mash:**
All because of that? 
 
**Mash:**
I see...So that's what I should have done. 
 
**Mash:**
I couldn't do anything for her. Master, you're amazing. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Boo. What are you talking about? I want in on it too. 
 
**Nero:**
At least that's what I want to say. Right now, I'll just have to wait, for now we assault the palace! 
 
**Nero:**
Jing Ke has found a way in. We will take a small number of elites, and take out Romulus. 
 
**Nero:**
This will be the last battle. Will you come with me Mash, Fujimaru? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We have unfinished business in there, too. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Umu! Let's go, then! 
 
## Section 14: The Emperor 
 
**Nero:**
Are you sure this is the way, Jing Ke? 
 
**Jing Ke:**
This is the second time I've gone to the emperor. Don't worry, I promise I'll guide you to the throne without fail. 
 
**Nero:**
The city sure looks familiar...It's impressive,they even replicated the palace down to the interiors. 
 
**Nero:**
When did they build it? Is this some sort of spell? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's possible. It might have been the power of the Holy Grail. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
There's no time to chit chat. The enemy's noticed us&ndash;They're not human. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Nor are they Servants. They're probably monsters created by magecraft. 
 
**Nero:**
Ugh, monsters huh? Whatever they may be, I am no longer afraid! 
 
**Mash:**
Master, it's enemy lifeforms...Commencing battle. 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Romulus:**
...Here you are, my beloved child. 
 
**Nero:**
Umu, I am here! O proud founder of our great nation, King Romulus! 
 
**Romulus:**
...Splendid radiance. In that case, should I call out your name, "Emperor? "
 
**Nero:**
Oh, there's no need. Call me what you did just now&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
Whether it's the past, the present, or the future. I am the one and only Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire! 
 
**Nero:**
Holy Progenitor, O King Romulus! I hereby challenge you with my warriors, my swords! 
 
**Romulus:**
I'll allow it, Nero Claudius. Show me you can trample over Rome's love with your love. 
 
**Romulus:**
Behold. My spear&ndash;
 
**Romulus:**
&ndash;"Rome" is here! 
 
**Mash:**
An enemy Servant is approaching. Speculated class is Lancer. Battle commencing. Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Romulus:**
...Your love, is so dazzling, Nero. 
 
**Romulus:**
My eternal crimson and gold empire. I entrust it all to you and your heirs. 
 
**Romulus:**
Don't forget. Rome is eternal. 
 
**Romulus:**
Therefore, the world must always be eternal. Remember that...
 
**Mash:**
We've defeated the enemy Servant, Lancer Romulus. Victory is ours. 
 
**Nero:**
We won? In that case...
 
**Nero:**
...Umu. Rome shall be restored to its former glory. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's true, more or less, but we still haven't found that Court Mage. We've got to search for the Holy Grail. 
 
**Nero:**
Hmm? But the United Empire has already met its end. Isn't that right, Unseen Mage? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's certainly true, give or take. But unless we secure the Holy Grail, our purpose will be&ndash;
 
**Jing Ke:**
Wait, someone's there. Though it's not a Servant. 
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Lev:**
...Well, well. To think you took out Romulus. 
 
**Lev:**
Nice work for a "mere" Demi-Servant. Have you become more powerful since I last saw you at Fuyuki? 
 
**Lev:**
However, a Servant is still a Servant. Sorry,but you'll never surpass the power of the Holy Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Nero:**
Is that the Court Mage? Then that golden chalice he has is&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Yes, that's the Holy Grail. It looks similar in shape to the one we saw before...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Who could've thought a Court Mage would ignore his king's crisis. I guess betrayal is second nature to you now, Professor Lev? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Actually, perhaps this is the real you? You seem more energetic than when you were at Chaldea. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Save the small talk for later! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hand over the Holy Grail! 
 

---

 
**Lev:**
I see. Looks like you've learned to talk back, {(M) boy /(F) girl}. 
 
**Lev:**
I hear you did quite a bit in France. Thanks to that&mdash; I really got yelled at! 
 
**Lev:**
I would've been back at the Temple already, but I got sent back out! 
 
**Lev:**
As a result, I am here to do some clean-up. 
 
**Lev:**
My plan was to give the Grail to a fitting fool,then enjoy what would unfold. But you ruined that. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...I see. Find a human, or a Heroic Spirit who wants to plunge an era into madness. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then if you give them the Grail, that era would surely drive itself into madness. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's what happened in France, but this time&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
Yes, the Holy Progenitor Romulus, did not wish for the downfall of mankind. That's why&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You have no other choice but to interfere yourself. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's quite ironic, Professor Lev. In this era,the only betrayer of mankind is you. 
 
**Lev:**
Shut it trash. I never had any hope for humans in the first place. 
 
**Lev:**
You either, Fujimaru. 
 
**Lev:**
You think you can stop me, Lev Lainur,just because you defeated a few Servants? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's not going to go like before! 
 
**Lev:**
It's true you've changed. You've grown quite a bit. 
 
**Lev:**
You've grown more stupid that is! Don't you know that if you try to resist, you're going to suffer that much more? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you after? 
 
**Lev:**
I believe I told you, I already long completed my objective. This is what you should be asking, Fujimaru. 
 
**Lev:**
"Why did you destroy humanity? " 
 
**Lev:**
Although, even if you did ask me, I have no reason to answer you. 
 

---

 
**Lev:**
Besides, I think you people misunderstand something. Recover the Grail, repair the Singularity,protect mankind&mdash;
 
**Lev:**
Protect humanity? &mdash;Idiots. There's nothing you can do. 
 
**Lev:**
There's no point in struggling. The end is certain. You're insignificant, worthless! 
 
**Lev:**
You will perish in sorrow! Allow me to show you the favor of our King! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! Fooou! 
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Nero:**
What's that creature! It's ugly! You're uglier than anything of this world! 
 
**Lev:**
Haha! Hahahaha! That's right! That ugliness will be your undoing! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...This signature, this amount of magical energy...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's not a Servant, not even a Phantasmal! Could that be&mdash;could that be an actual "Demon" from legends? 
 
**Lev:**
Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Lev Lainur "Flauros! "
 
**Lev:**
One of the Seventy-Two Demon Gods! The Demon God Flauros&ndash; This is the true favor of our King! 
 
**Nero:**
How disgusting...You are the reincarnation of evil! 
 
**Mash:**
A giant pillar of flesh protruding out of the ground? A large amount of magical energy...Doctor! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Flauros. He did say Seventy-Two Demon Gods. In that case, the King he speaks of is&mdash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, there's still not enough information. That's impossible, Demon Gods do not exist! 
 
**Fou:**
...Fou! Kyu, kyu, kyu, kya! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We don't know the details, but that thing is dangerous. Here it comes! We've got to take it out! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...We've defeated the enemy lifeform Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All right! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't let your guard down! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Lev:**
...Impossible...
 
**Lev:**
A mere Heroic Spirit...Do you really think you can repel one of the "Gods? "
 
**Lev:**
No, this is simple miscalculation. That's right, that must be it. 
 
**Lev:**
It's been too long since I left the Temple. My cells are starting to die off. 
 
**Lev:**
But, I am  entrusted with the mission to incinerate the future. It's not as if I didn't have a contingency plan. 
 
**Mash:**
Is something else coming? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Watch out! I'm detecting the Holy Grail's activation! Mash and Fujimaru, Something's about to happen! 
 
**Lev:**
...By sacrificing ancient Rome,I have managed to summon the strongest hero. 
 
**Lev:**
Rejoice, Emperor Nero Claudius. This one is truly fit to bring the demise of Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
Rome is the world, and the world shall never come to an end! 
 
**Lev:**
Even pride is nothing more than ultimate stupidity if misdirected, huh? See with your own eyes, the end of your world! 
 
**Lev:**
We'll pull the bottom out on humanity! We'll destroy one of its seven foundations! 
 
**Lev:**
&ndash;By the esteemed words of our King! 
 
**Lev:**
Come forth! Great hero of destruction, Altera! 
 
**Altera:**
&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
!!! 
 
**Lev:**
Kill. Destroy. Incinerate. With your power,burn Rome and this Singularity to the ground! 
 
**Lev:**
Hahaha! It's over, Romani Archaman! Your dream of continuing Humanity is nothing but a dream! 
 
**Lev:**
This Servant is the ultimate destroyer! Altera is a Heroic Spirit, but her power&ndash;
 
**Altera:**
&ndash;Silence. 
 
**Lev:**
Huh? 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? Lev Lainur's signature has disappeared! 
 
**Mash:**
He...He was cut in half by the Servant he summoned! Her True Name is Altera. She's probably a Saber. 
 
**Mash:**
Altera has the Grail! It's being absorbed...huh? She's absorbing it...
 
**Altera:**
I am&ndash;
 
**Altera:**
A warrior of the Hun. 
 
**Altera:**
And, its King. 
 
**Altera:**
I am the King of Destruction, the one who destroyed the western world. 
 
**Altera:**
Destruction&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
I've got a bad...feeling about this! Mash, something's going to happen. Even I can tell! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huge spike in her magical energy signature! This must be her Noble Phantasm&ndash;an Anti-Fortress level at that! 
 
**Mash:**
Master! 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Deploy your Noble Phantasm, hurry! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Right! 
 
**Altera:**
This is what you people said. 
 
**Altera:**
That I am the divine punishment itself. 
 
**Altera:**
&ndash;The Scourge of God. 
 
## Section 15: Scourge of God 
 
**Nero:**
...I thought I was going to die. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right. With the release of an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm so close, I'm amazed that you're not dead. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Thank you, Mash. You too, Boudica. That was great timing. 
 
**Boudica:**
...To be honest, that was too close. 
 
**Boudica:**
I ran in to raid the palace from the entrance, only to sense this vast amount of magical energy, so I rushed to release my Noble Phantasm's True Name as well. 
 
**Mash:**
I couldn't have blocked that with my Noble Phantasm alone. Thank you, Boudica. 
 
**Boudica:**
Likewise. But, what are we going to do now. 
 
**Boudica:**
Lu Bu and Spartacus were rampaging around the palace entrance and unfortunately got hit by that light. 
 
**Boudica:**
We can't count on them any more. We've gotten this far...
 
**Nero:**
Altera was the name, right? She&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Already started her advance from the Untied Empire's capital. Judging from the direction, she's heading for Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
In that case, is she planning to burn my capital to ash? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'd imagine so. Plus, she has that ability. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Even if you're left alive, with the capital destroyed, Rome will disappear as well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Or she might come to kill you after she destroys the capital. 
 
**Nero:**
Either option is rejected. I have no intention of allowing Rome or myself to fall. 
 
**Mash:**
Then we have to defeat Altera. But can we...even stand up to her? 
 
**Mash:**
Her magical energy is tremendous. It reminded me of the sacred sword in Fuyuki...
 
**Mash:**
And we had a powerful Caster helping us back then. Now...
 
**Nero:**
You can't do it, Mash? 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
**Nero:**
I would like to think otherwise. Fujimaru and Mash have saved me multiple times. 
 
**Nero:**
You were talking about gods and the like, I'm certain the gods and fate are on our side. 
 
**Nero:**
That's why Fujimaru and the rest of you came here. My wish shall see its fruition. 
 
**Nero:**
Rome will be saved. My people and my Rome will be left for future generations. I'm sure of it. 
 
**Nero:**
The Holy Progenitor said so as well. I heard it. 
 
**Nero:**
The world must be eternal. Rome must continue on eternally. 
 
**Nero:**
Even if its name will someday be forgotten, the many seeds Rome planted will continue on in different forms. 
 
**Nero:**
The eternal empire will continue to exist. Even if its emperor, state, and name changes. 
 
**Nero:**
It is the innate truth that mankind will continue to thrive. The tree of life that is humanity. 
 
**Nero:**
&mdash;Fujimaru. I am sure that is the "Humanity" you are trying to protect. 
 
**Boudica:**
...Emperor Nero. I don't understand what you're trying to say. 
 
**Nero:**
I see. Honestly, I don't either. 
 
**Mash:**
I understood it a little. At least I think I did. 
 
**Mash:**
Even if something's clear and defined fades, as long as the world exists, its memes will remain. 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
How about thinking more romantically? Nero's words gave me strength. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
She's confident that we can fight Altera. That's why the world won't end. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sounds good to me. Although there's no real basis for it&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it makes you feel like we should at least try. Fujimaru, what do you think? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&ndash;Let's put our faith in Nero. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Got it. Then I will put my faith in your words Senpai. 
 
**Boudica:**
I'll join in, too. I'm tired of things getting destroyed. 
 
**Boudica:**
I hate that one called Altera far more than Emperor Nero. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
I don't really get what's going on, but I think it's safe to believe in Nero Claudius's luck. 
 
**Nero:**
Oh, hey there Jing Ke, where did you disappear off to? 
 
**Jing Ke:**
I was observing&ndash;Altera. It looks like she's slowly advancing. 
 
**Jing Ke:**
We can catch up if we leave now. That is, if you all want to. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We just came to a conclusion on that. Nice timing, there. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well then everyone, time to head out! Let's get the Grail back and save the world! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
...At least that was the plan until a second ago. I am picking up a major magical energy signature. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
It must've be drawn to the power of the Grail when it connected with Altera&ndash;Phantasmals, it's the wyverns! 
 
**Nero:**
Wyvern? What's that? A monster out of a fairy tale? 
 
**Mash:**
No, it's a dangerous enemy! Master, your orders please! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Now I'm picking up multiple magical energy signatures. Is she attracting monsters just by walking? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Is she summoning them? I don't know the details, but they're closing in fast! 
 
**Nero:**
Wyverns again? I never thought I'd be fighting dragons. 
 
**Mash:**
We're used to it. Lord Nero, Senpai and I will take the front! 
 
**Nero:**
So reliable! Umu, I'm leaving it to you! 
 
**Fou:**
Fou! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I really want to say "good work," but more are coming. Several times more than before&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
Wh-What? Several times? That's pretty wild. 
 
**Boudica:**
...Guess it can't be helped. We'll take those on, Jing Ke are you ready? 
 
**Jing Ke:**
Monsters aren't my specialty. But I should take on non-human enemies for a change. 
 
**Nero:**
W-Wait, Boudica, Jing Ke, what do you mean take them on? You're coming with us. 
 
**Boudica:**
Exactly. You go on ahead already. 
 
**Nero:**
What are you saying&ndash;
 
**F：???:**
GuOOOOOO&ndash;!!!!! 
 
**Boudica:**
Go! You stupid emperor! Never mind this,go protect what you call your world! 
 
**Nero:**
...Apologies. My worthy rival, Queen of Britannia. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right everyone. No time to look back,we're close to where Altera is&ndash;
 
**--ARROW--**
 
**Altera:**
...Are you going to stand in my way? 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's why we're here. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can't let you advance any further. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
Yes, I'll stand in your way. I can't allow you advance further, no matter what. 
 
**Nero:**
You said that you would destroy the world. 
 
**Nero:**
I don't understand. Why would you say that you were going to destroy the world? 
 
**Nero:**
The world is brimming with beauty. Flowers, songs, gold, love...
 
**Nero:**
That's right, above all, this Rome, this world is filled with my love. 
 
**Nero:**
And you'd destroy it? Don't you find that wasteful Altera, or whoever you are? 
 
**Altera:**
I am&ndash;
 
**Altera:**
A warrior of the Hun. 
 
**Altera:**
And its King. 
 
**Altera:**
A King of Destruction, who will bring destruction to the western world. 
 
**Nero:**
That again? 
 
**Nero:**
How sad Altera, but even that sadness seems beautiful to me. 
 
**Nero:**
I can't just leave you like this. I feel a great pain and contradiction in your life. 
 
**Nero:**
Perhaps your power exceeds mine, but know that you cannot defeat me in love. 
 
**Altera:**
I know not of love, I know not of beauty. 
 
**Mash:**
Doctor, those words are different from before. It seems like she's not responding automatically. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This reaction&ndash;
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see, she's going out of control by becoming one with the Grail! This isn't good, talking is not going to end this.  
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Magical energy signature rising. You have to stop her before she unleashes it again. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is the last battle for Rome&ndash;Mash, Fujimaru! 
 
**Mash:**
Prepare for anti-Servant combat! Master, your orders! 
 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Altera:**
...I see. 
 
**Altera:**
In this world...There are things that cannot be destroyed, even...by my sword. 
 
**Altera:**
I was called, the Scourge of God...
 
**Altera:**
Even my...
 
**Altera:**
Sword of Mars...can't...I see...
 
**Altera:**
Well that...
 
**Altera:**
Makes me...a little happy...
 
**Nero:**
Altera is gone. Perhaps fate will arrange for us to battle again one day. 
 
**Nero:**
But...is it over? Have you obtained that Holy Grail&ndash;
 
**Mash:**
Yes, we've obtained the Holy Grail. This concludes our mission. 
 
**Mash:**
Thank you very much, Nero Claudius. 
 
**Nero:**
Mash, your toes are looking faint! Don't tell me you're going to vanish too! 
 
**Nero:**
Fujimaru, Fou...I see, you're all going to vanish...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Farewell. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We must go now. 
 

---

 
**Nero:**
...I had a feeling. My intuition is pretty sharp, you see. 
 
**Nero:**
You're going to disappear like Altera,my uncle, and the Holy Progenitor. 
 
**Nero:**
Boudica, will you, as well? Jing Ke, Lu Bu, Spartacus? 
 
**Mash:**
...Yes. 
 
**Mash:**
This era will be restored. Your memories of fighting the United Empire will no longer exist. 
 
**Nero:**
That's a sad thing. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, it is...
 
**Nero:**
I will no longer doubt you. I believe you, but this is a problem. 
 
**Nero:**
It's unfortunate, I haven't given you any reward. 
 
**Nero:**
You could have been more than my retainers. Something more&ndash;
 
**Nero:**
No, no sense in saying it. Fujimaru,you will find yourself heading to Rome. 
 
**Nero:**
All roads lead to Rome, for Rome is the world. Both the Holy Progenitor and I believe so. 
 
**Nero:**
So I will not say goodbye. Only thanks. 
 
**Nero:**
&ndash;Thank you. I offer you the thanks of my soul and a rose for your efforts! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Welcome back and good job you two. You retrieved the Grail. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was that for the best? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
When? 
 

---

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'll explain. The Grail is the law that decides how magical energies in a dimension is used. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Think of it as a world's rules. It normally doesn't have a form, but Lev crystallized it into one. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
We can't analyze its workings, but we can seal it away. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
I fiddled with Mash's shield a little, and created a space for the Grail. 
 
**Mash:**
My shield can do that? 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Yes. The best place for a relic is in a relic, I figure. 
 
**Da Vinci:**
It can only hold one at a time, so I yank it out after each retrieval. Got it? 
 
**Mash:**
Ahhh! 
 
**Da Vinci:**
Ok, Grail's retrieval is confirmed~♪Try your best to search for the next one! 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is our second Grail and we've also achieved our original goal of finding Lev. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But Lev is&mdash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I didn't learn anything...
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...That's right. Altera killed him,and we never found out what his plans were. 
 
**Mash:**
...You mean why he betrayed mankind and tried to...destroy it? 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
That's right. We still don't know anything,but still have five singularities left. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lev spoke of "Gods. " In other words,there are other enemies out there just like him. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
What that means at this point, we don't know. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
All we can do is recover the Grails one by one, and restore the Singularities. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Leave the next Grail to me! 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We've got a long way to go. 
 

---

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Good answer. I'm counting on you, Fujimaru. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
We don't have that much time, but for tonight try and rest well. 
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You walked a long way. You'll want a good massage, I'm sure. 
 
**Mash:**
...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You look down Mash. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Thinking about Nero? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. Our parting with Nero was so sudden. I feel bad about leaving her...
 
**Mash:**
Even if it ended up never happening, in that last moment, she was alone. 
 
**Mash:**
She defeated the people she respected, and said goodbye to her rivals&mdash;
 
**Mash:**
She was left all alone in that huge empire with no one to rely on. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Was this battle hard for you? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Do you think Nero feels lonely? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;No, I don't think so.... I'm sure that's not right. 
 
**Mash:**
It was a hard battle, yes. We almost died many times, and I'm still scared of fighting. 
 
**Mash:**
But&mdash;it was a fun journey. 
 
**Mash:**
Partially thanks to Nero's glamour, but...It was a lot of fun. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sure it was fun for Nero, too. 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It was a fun Empire, just like Nero. 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Yes. I'll never forget that sky and land, I'm sure. 
 
**Mash:**
By the way Senpai, about what the Doctor said. 
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What did Roman say? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The massage? 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
Yes, you need to take care of yourself. Shall I give you a massage? 
 
**Mash:**
I know several effective methods shiatsu, deep tissue...
 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds good. 
 
**Mash:**
Really? 
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll pass. 
 
**Mash:**
Come on, please! 
 

---

 
**Mash:**
...Ahem. I really wanted to try it. 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, that's all. Um, well...
 
**Mash:**
I tried it once before, and they said it really hurt...Oh! 
 
**Mash:**
T-That shouldn't happen anymore. I practiced after that. In my mind. 
 
**Mash:**
Huh? Senpai? 
 
**Mash:**
Where are you going? Oh, you want a massage in your room, right? 
 
**Mash:**
Senpai?
